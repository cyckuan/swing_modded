<HEADLINE> NY Teen Sentenced for Killing Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYONS, N.Y. (AP) -- A teenager who drove her car over a romantic  
rival after they had tussled all summer for the affections of a 
young man was sentenced Tuesday to 10 to 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Polly Smith apologized to the parents of the 18-year-old victim,  
Amanda Leoni, but insisted she never meant to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd give anything to bring back Amanda,'' she said, choking  
back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 18, was acquitted of murder in February but convicted of  
manslaughter. She faced up to 25 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith knocked down Leoni on a street last August with her car.  
She then hit the brake, turned the steering wheel and drove over 
her, three teen witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury apparently decided Smith intended to cause serious  
physical injury, not kill. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's father, James Leoni, appealed to the judge to  
impose the maximum sentence to send a message, especially to the 
young, ``that violence is not a way to solve a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances of Leoni's death bore haunting similarities to  
another lethal love affair involving her 15 months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1997, her boyfriend, Christopher Heise, 18, died of a  
knife wound to the heart during a fight with a 16-year-old high 
school buddy who was courting her. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding Gavin Dinneen acted in fearful self-defense, a jury  
acquitted him of criminally negligent homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had been dating Justin Smith, 20, on and off for over a  
year when Leoni, returning home from her first year in college, 
began seeing him as well. Smith tried to scare her off, allegedly 
kicking and punching her on one occasion, then forced a showdown 
the night of Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The women had an argument during which Justin Smith told Leoni  
he was finished with her. As Leoni walked away, Smith hit the 
accelerator and struck her from behind.

<HEADLINE> $50M Settles Suit Vs. N.Y. Law Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The dean of the University of Chicago's law  
school and his former partners in a consulting company agreed to a 
$50 million settlement today in their lawsuit against a law firm 
that they claim abused the legal system in an act of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement came one day after a U.S. District Court jury  
awarded Daniel Fischel and his former partners $45 million in 
compensatory damage in their lawsuit against the New York firm of 
Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach. If the lawsuit had not been 
settled today, the jury would have been asked to award punitive 
damages on top of the $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischel would not comment on the settlement, which concludes a  
nearly decade-old legal battle between the law firm and 
Chicago-based Lexecon Inc., a legal and economics consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because he's the dean of the law school he just doesn't want  
to fan the flames,'' his attorney, Alan N. Salpeter, told 
reporters. ``He's extremely pleased with this result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, the parties agree that no appeals will be  
filed. Milberg Weiss denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerold Solovy, who represented Milberg Weiss, said after the  
verdict Monday that he was shocked by the decision. He left the 
courthouse today without commenting. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute began when Milberg Weiss named Lexecon in a lawsuit  
brought on behalf of investors in Charles Keating's failed Lincoln 
Savings and Loan. The consulting firm had prepared financial 
reports for the California-based S&AMP;L, which was seized by federal 
regulators in 1989 and then collapsed, costing taxpayers $3.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors who lost money sued, naming Lexecon as a defendant.  
Lexecon paid more than $700,000 to investors in 1992 to resolve 
claims, but sued Milberg Weiss alleging the firm had sought to 
destroy its business by destroying its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The law firm was accused of targeting Fischel, who had testified  
as an expert witness on the opposite side of shareholder 
class-action lawsuits involving Milberg Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Milberg Weiss contended Lexecon had been sued for a  
legitimate reason: It had once been a consultant and helped defraud 
investors of Lincoln Savings.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Sentencing Hearing Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The widow of the man Dr. Jack Kevorkian  
was convicted of murdering choked back tears today at his 
sentencing hearing as she described her husband's suffering from 
Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not depressed, he was not a victim. He requested Dr.  
Kevorkian's help and was grateful for it,'' Melody Youk said of her 
late husband, 52-year-old Thomas Youk. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not wish to be on a ventilator, nor completely  
dependent on others in a totally paralyzed body,'' she told Oakland 
County Circuit Judge Jessica Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was heartbroken to realize that in spite of our efforts, we  
had come to an end. ... I came to understand that it was selfish 
for me not to support him in his decision,'' she said in a 
quavering voice. She asked the judge to show ``compassion'' in 
sentencing Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian taped Youk's death last September and gave the video  
to CBS's ``60 Minutes,'' which aired the footage in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was found guilty March 26. The widow's testimony had  
been deemed irrelevant during that phase of the trial, because a 
victim's suffering is not considered a defense in a murder trial 
under state law. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors were expected to ask Cooper to sentence Kevorkian to  
10 to 25 years in prison for his conviction on second-degree 
murder. The maximum sentence is a life term. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys have argued that the retired pathologist's  
crime shouldn't be treated as any other murder, and doesn't require 
sending a 70-year-old man to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Youk's brother, Terrence Youk, described Youk's spirited but  
failing efforts to fight a disease that started slowly but that by 
two and a half years later left him in extreme pain with little 
control over his body. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was caught in hell'' on ``a dead run to one eventuality,''  
Youk said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom fought the courageous and insprired fight to the very end  
of his life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout it all he always chose to work with his  
limitations. Ultimately he chose to be released from his needless 
suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the judge goes outside state sentencing guidelines, Kevorkian  
could be sentenced to probation after today's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges are allowed to bypass state guidelines if there are  
compelling reasons for doing so, and Kevorkian attorney Meyer 
Morganroth said Monday he would ask Cooper for a departure ``as far 
down as you can go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors were expected to ask Judge Jessica Cooper to  
sentence Kevorkian to 10 to 25 years in prison for his conviction 
on second-degree murder. The maximum sentence is a life term. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was found guilty March 26 in the death of 52-year-old  
Thomas Youk, who suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease. Kevorkian 
taped Youk's death on Sept. 17 and gave the video to CBS's ``60 
Minutes,'' which aired the footage. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys have argued that the retired pathologist's  
crime shouldn't be treated as any other murder, and doesn't require 
sending a 70-year-old man to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	If the judge goes outside state sentencing guidelines, Kevorkian  
could be sentenced to probation after today's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges are allowed to bypass state guidelines if there are  
compelling reasons for doing so, and Kevorkian attorney Meyer 
Morganroth said Monday he would ask Cooper for a departure ``as far 
down as you can go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's previous trials, all on assisted-suicide charges,  
have resulted in three acquittals and one mistrial. He has admitted 
helping 130 people commit suicide; this was the first time he stood 
trial for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ed Pierce, who led a failed effort to legalize assisted  
suicide in Michigan last year, said Kevorkian's tactics in recent 
years have not helped the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think on the whole he's been a pioneer in bringing the issue  
to our attention. But I don't think he can go on like he's been 
doing in the past,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce added that Kevorkian has been known to help people who  
weren't terminally ill, something most assisted suicide advocates 
oppose. Still, Pierce said Kevorkian shouldn't have to go to prison 
for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ``60 Minutes'' interview, Kevorkian threatened a hunger  
strike if sent to prison, a claim he has not repeated. If he does 
start a hunger strike, prison policy calls for forced feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian staged a three-day hunger strike when jailed in  
November 1993 for refusing to pay bond. He accepted only juice and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	He staged a 17-day hunger strike in December 1993 until a judge  
lowered his bond. During that hunger strike he consumed only 
limited amounts of juice, water and vitamins and lost 12 pounds. He 
was hospitalized several days while he recovered.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Push Immigrant Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Health coverage for hundreds of thousands of  
low-income pregnant women, children, disabled and elderly legal 
immigrants rendered ineligible by the Republican-crafted welfare 
law would be restored under legislation being introduced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and  
Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., also would extend federal food stamp 
eligibility to able-bodied adult noncitizens who were in the 
country as of the August 1996 enactment of the welfare law. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has moved twice to soften the blow of the 1996 law,  
which hit legal immigrants especially hard, and is being asked to 
act again to assist impoverished noncitizens squeezed by 
Washington's policy shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad coalition of anti-hunger, health care, religious and  
immigrant advocacy organizations that lobbied successfully for 
restoration of disability benefits and food stamps for certain 
legal immigrants is rallying behind the Moynihan-Levin measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no sense to withdraw these benefits from needy  
people,'' Levin said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Having urged President Clinton to sign the 1996 welfare bill,  
which was reviled by traditional Democratic constituencies, Levin 
said he considers it his ``solemn obligation'' to rectify what he 
views as unduly harsh aspects of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenly aware of complaints by some Republicans that earlier  
benefit restorations represented a wholesale rollback of the 
welfare law, Levin said his measure would make changes in ``a very 
pinpointed way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Congress reversed itself and allowed hundreds of  
thousands of legal immigrants who were in the country at the time 
Clinton signed the welfare bill to retain their Supplemental 
Security Income payments. Last year, lawmakers restored food stamp 
eligibility for elderly, disabled and minor noncitizens, covering 
250,000 of the 935,000 legal immigrants who had lost their 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrant advocates, who prevailed before by dispatching a  
steady stream of elderly and frail immigrants to Capitol Hill to 
relate how they were harmed by the welfare policy changes, are 
hopeful that they'll succeed again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress became more aware of how these changes were impacting  
families and communities,'' said Ellen Vollinger, legal director 
for the Food Research and Action Center, an anti-hunger group. ``We 
have every reason to think if we can make the same compelling 
arguments, hopefully they would be open to responding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levin is counting on FRAC and others in the coalition to provide  
the lobbying muscle. ``The support groups are going to whip into 
action, and they've been exceptionally successful before,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One coalition leader, National Council of La Raza Vice President  
Cecilia Munoz, said the legislation has yet to draw opposition from 
GOP leaders who were instrumental in crafting welfare reform. ``We 
have not heard a negative response from Republicans,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs of the Moynihan-Levin bill have yet to be fully  
assessed, but Levin gave a rough estimate of $2.7 billion over five 
years. The legislation goes well beyond a proposed restoration 
package sought by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the earlier measures, which benefited only legal  
immigrants who were in the country before the welfare law's 
enactment, the new legislation would provide health care benefits 
to post-1996 newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Munoz acknowledged that restoration of benefits for immigrants  
who entered after 1996 may prove harder to sell to Congress. But, 
she said: ``This notion that the date of entry is the determining 
factor of whether or not a pregnant woman has access to health care 
is ridiculous. It's not morally smart and it's not economically 
smart.''

<HEADLINE> Big Week Hurts Olson's Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Gregg Olson struggled for five years to regain  
his form as one of the top closers in the game. Last year, with 30 
saves in 34 tries for the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks, he was 
one of baseball's big comeback stories. 
</P>
<P>
	All of that unraveled in a nightmare first week of this season.  
</P>
<P>
	On opening day in Dodger Stadium, then twice in Atlanta, Olson  
went to the mound in the ninth to protect a lead. All three times 
he failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Home runs, walks, bloop singles, grounders that dribbled through  
the infield and one costly error. Whatever could go wrong did. 
</P>
<P>
	Worst of all, this most analytical of pitchers can't figure out  
exactly what the problem is, and he sees the closer role he so 
covets slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks used Darren Holmes, who was the closer a few  
seasons ago for Colorado, in the ninth-inning mopup role of Monday 
night's 12-6 victory over Los Angeles. And there is continuing 
murmurs that Arizona might go after Mark Wohlers, once one of the 
best closers in the game for Atlanta a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers' control has vanished, and the Braves have said they  
will either trade him or release him outright after he refused 
assignment to the minor leagues. He could be available, although 
the Diamondbacks certainly would want him to work in the minors 
before getting a chance with the big club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now he can't hit the batting cage,'' Arizona general  
manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson has been around long enough to understand the situation.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it's the best thing for the team that we go to somebody  
else, that's fine,'' Olson said. `I would hope that when I get 
everything going the right way, I'd get another opportunity to do 
it, but it's out of my hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Buck Showalter hinted that Olson is no longer the  
absolute go-to guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether or not, with a one-run lead in the ninth inning, he  
comes in regardless of the situation, I 've got my own feelings 
about that,'' Showalter said. ``But I don't think it's something he 
needs to be reading in the paper. I think it's something he needs 
to hear from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olson, 32, said the situation is tougher to handle than any of  
his other trials, and there have been many. After 140 saves in his 
first five seasons with Baltimore, he injured his right elbow and 
decided against surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was able to pitch again, he was no longer the pitcher he  
had been. 
</P>
<P>
	He bounced from team to team -- Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City,  
Detroit, Houston, Minnesota and Kansas City again. By the start of 
last year, no one wanted him. He had to talk his way into an 
invitation to the Diamondbacks' spring training. He didn't get a 
chance to close until May 14, after Arizona got off to a disastrous 
8-31 start. 
</P>
<P>
	His success made him assured of the closer's job going into  
spring training for the first time since those long-ago days with 
the Orioles, and that's what makes the sudden collapse so hard to 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I like to find some reason why things go wrong,  
but there isn't one,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said he sees one flaw.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the location of his fastball,'' Showalter said.  
``Gregg's stuff and his health are fine. It's just you see him 
missing with his location where he never did hardly ever last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olson said his fastball may be off an inch or two here and  
there, but he notes that he's also been the victim of ground balls 
that would be routine outs had they bounced a foot or two to either 
side. And he feels some of the umpiring has been conservative, with 
balls called when others would have called them strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't say so, but an error by Jay Bell at second base in his  
last blown save, Sunday in Atlanta, didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely haven't earned the right to retain the closer's  
job,'' Olson said, ``but I'd like to see Trevor Hoffman get out of 
some of the things I've faced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There also is the concern of Olson's psyche.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's as mentally tough a guy as you'd want to have on your  
club,'' Showalter said, ``but everybody's human. There's only so 
much of that you can take until it wears on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olson didn't sound absolutely confident, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of hard when you're out there and something happens  
-- the first guy gets on or the umpire misses a pitch and you go 
`Here we go again. Now what's going to happen,''' he said. ``You 
don't want to get in the mode where you're expecting something bad 
to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Welcomed at Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- China's premier cut a quick swath through a  
bastion of American capitalism Tuesday, carrying wishes for a 
strong stock market and apparent optimism about China's eventual 
entry into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Zhu Rongji, on a six-city, nine-day visit to the United  
States, joined heads of the National Association of Securities 
Dealers for the Nasdaq Stock Market's morning opening, then moved 
on to a private policy discussion with some of the nation's top 
banking, securities and insurance executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always bull market,'' a smiling Zhu, using English, told  
officials at the Nasdaq-Amex MarketSite. In turn, he received a 
welcome in Chinese -- ``huanying'' -- from Nasdaq officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time in the history of both of our economies that we  
could both benefit greatly by cooperating,'' said Frank G. Zarb, 
chairman and chief executive of the National Association of 
Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing agreed. ``Capital formation is  
critical to the Chinese economy,'' he said in a statement. ``And 
the Nasdaq Stock Market is a model of investors providing capital 
to growing companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China, whose doctrinaire communism kept its markets tightly  
state-controlled until the early 1980s, is embracing capitalism 
while simultaneously trying to retain government control over its 
economy. It now has its own stock markets, and NASD, the dealers 
association, said Tuesday it would open an office in Shanghai by 
mid-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this is the beginning of a process to create for China  
a way to bring investors' capital to growing companies,'' Zarb 
said. The office will also provide support for listed Nasdaq 
companies in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's visit comes at a time when tensions between China and the  
United States are high. In recent months, U.S. officials have 
accused China of spying and continue to attack its human-rights 
record. China has denounced human-rights criticism as meddling in 
its internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, China and the United States failed last week to  
reach a trade agreement that would clear the way for China's 
membership in the World Trade Organization. Negotiations continue, 
and Zhu has vowed during his visit that China would open ``wider 
and wider to the outside world'' if it joins the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu spoke to President Clinton by phone Tuesday afternoon, and  
the two agreed talks on the matter would proceed ``more 
intensively,'' according to a joint statement. The leaders agreed 
negotiators would meet in Beijing by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American  
Bankers Association, said Zhu seemed optimistic at a private 
luncheon and discussion with 21 executives, former Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger and James Sasser, the U.S. ambassador to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was ``considerable discussion'' about China's WTO  
membership and its ultimate effects in opening China's economy to 
more outside business. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem eager to get on with it,'' Ogilvie said.  
</P>
<P>
	But New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican who also met  
privately with Zhu, said he told the premier that increased 
economic ties must be accompanied by attention to human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can talk in economic terms without bringing  
up the respect for rule of law and human rights,'' Pataki said. He 
called it a ``productive discussion'' and said Zhu seemed receptive 
to discussing the matter.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Blind Baby Girl $6.9M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A doctor should pay a blind 2-year-old  
girl $6.9 million for failing to make sure she received a key eye 
examination months before doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her 
sight, a jury has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Scott was born Aug. 15, 1996, about three months  
premature at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange. She had retinopathy of 
prematurity, an eye disease common in many premature babies of her 
birth weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is often considered curable when diagnosed in time.  
</P>
<P>
	The girl's family sued Dr. Robert Hillyard, the medical director  
of St. Joseph's nursery, claiming he failed to ensure the baby 
received a follow-up eye exam deemed critical to her care. 
</P>
<P>
	An ophthalmologist wrote in a hospital report Oct. 1, 1996, that  
the exam should happen within two weeks. However, no follow-up took 
place until Nov. 26, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency surgery finally began Dec. 6, but doctors were too  
late to prevent permanent blindness, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	An Orange County Superior Court jury on Monday awarded the girl  
$5 million for future wage loss, $1.345 million for future damages, 
$500,000 for future pain and suffering and $40,000 for past pain 
and suffering, family attorney Mark Hiepler said. 
</P>
<P>
	A phone message left at the office of the Hillyard's attorney,  
Tony Discoe, was not returned.

	HASTINGS, Minn. (AP) -- A former high school science teacher who  
helped four student athletes tattoo their jersey numbers on their 
arms with nitric acid was fined $900, placed on six years' 
probation and ordered to pay for any surgery they need for the 
scars. 
</P>
<P>
	James Alvin Bartholow, 40, pleaded guilty Monday to child  
endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Thomas Poch also ordered the former Farmington High School  
teacher to perform 100 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15- and 16-year-old athletes had asked Bartholow for the  
tattoos. Bartholow told police he had applied nitric acid to his 
palms without permanent scarring and assumed the same would be true 
for the boys' arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors described the boys' injuries as third-degree chemical  
burns that resulted in permanent scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartholow resigned last year and now works in construction.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Hoping for Russian Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia has always walked a fine  
line between Washington and Moscow in a balancing act that became 
state policy under communist leader Josip Broz Tito. 
</P>
<P>
	Now with NATO the main enemy, nonalignment has been cast aside  
for the first time in Yugoslav history. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance with Russia and Belarus that was agreed upon by the  
leaders of what's left of Yugoslavia is opposed by West-leaning 
Montenegro, the smaller of Yugoslavia's two republics. But it's 
embraced by Serbia and its people, who pray such ties will bring 
them Russia's military support. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Moscow suggests any formal strengthening of ties will have  
to wait until the end of the NATO bombing campaign that began March 
24. And it remains officially opposed to becoming involved 
militarily, despite Serb wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a multi-ethnic Balkan federation of six republics, today's  
Yugoslavia now is essentially comprised of Serbia. With its 10 
million mostly Serb residents -- Montenegro has only 600,000 people 
-- Serbia calls the shots in the name of Yugoslavia. President 
Slobodan Milosevic is Serbian, as are most of his lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs are traditionally close to Russians, because of shared  
Slavic and Orthodox Christian links. Those ties -- which grew 
throughout the Croatian, Bosnian and Kosovo conflicts -- have taken 
on greater prominence with the NATO airstrikes and Moscow's 
opposition to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Predictably, Serbs overwhelmingly approve moving closer to  
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in Russia, I believe they can help us,'' Nadezda  
Rancic, 73, declared Monday at an anti-NATO concert in Belgrade's 
central Republic Square that featured Serb folk songs. ``I believe 
NATO cannot hurt us if we are with the Russians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Yugoslavia's embrace of Moscow, the former Cold War  
superpower, would have been unthinkable even a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, Yugoslavia was still a Balkan federation featuring a  
mix of Serbs and Macedonians and millions of Croats, Bosnian 
Muslims and Albanians who mistrusted Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	They generally believed in nonalignment -- a creation of Tito,  
who founded Yugoslavia in 1945 and, though communist, was able to 
coexist between a capitalist Washington and Moscow despite 
sometimes ferocious pressure from hard-line Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, it was not forbidden to read an American book, to watch  
an American film, to travel to America,'' Milan Bozic, a government 
minister who taught at several U.S. universities in the 1980s, told 
The Associated Press. ``It was the most pro-Western country of all 
in the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That began to change with Yugoslavia's disintegration. Slovenia,  
Croatia and Bosnia broke away one after the other in the early 
1990s. Serbia supported insurgent Serbs in those republics, who 
were opposed to the declarations of independence. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1995, when the Bosnian war ended, ethnic tolerance was a  
thing of the past and Russia was feted as the champion of 
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, with Tito a co-founder of the nonaligned movement, some  
nostalgia remained for the idea of strict neutrality until 
recently. Once the NATO airstrikes began March 24, that was a thing 
of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that even Tito would turn to Russia at a time like  
this,'' declared Sava Sunjevaric, pushing a stroller with his 
7-month-old daughter, when asked about parliament's backing for 
some sort of union with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States used to be our friend, but the world has  
become topsy-turvy,'' Sunjevaric said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slavoljub Milasinovic, 67, remembers the better times under Tito  
but now backs the idea of close ties to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping distant from Moscow made sense in the 1950s, ``when we  
had to defend ourselves from Stalin,'' he said. ``Now, Clinton is 
the enemy, so we had to join the Slavic pact -- by doing so we are 
fighting for independence.''

<HEADLINE> Cards' Morris Has Elbow Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Matt Morris  
underwent surgery in Los Angeles on Tuesday to repair his pitching 
elbow and it was considered a success. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris had a 95 percent tear of the medial collateral ligament  
of his elbow, making the injury worse than expected, team spokesman 
Brad Hainje said. He added that Morris was expected to be released 
from the hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they got in there, they said it was a good thing that  
they went ahead with the surgery,'' Hainje said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Dodgers physician and arm specialist Dr. Frank Jobe  
performed ``Tommy John'' surgery on Morris. Jobe, with assistance 
from Cardinals team physician George Paletta, took a tendon from 
the palm of Morris' hand and implanted it into his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery is scary for pitchers because it has ended some  
careers and turned terrific pitchers into mediocre ones. Morris, 
24, acknowledged he has concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're everything -- nervous, scared, anxious, every word you  
can come up with,'' he said. ``But I pretty much just want to get 
it over with. I can't go forward until I get it done. I just want 
to get the surgery done, start recuperating and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals were counting on Morris to be their No. 1 starter.  
He was 7-5 with a 2.53 ERA in 1998, when he missed all but one 
start prior to the All-Star break with a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Morris won't return until the start of spring  
training. But he plans to spend the season with the team and will 
watch games intently enough that he hopes he will improve at least 
by learning some lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his rehabilitation, that will be a learn-as-he-goes  
process. He knows there will be pain and work and frustration and 
progress. But Morris said he didn't seek advice from other pitchers 
who have undergone the same type of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, it's almost more discouraging listening to other  
people who have had it, listening to how long they took to come 
back and the pain they had to go through,'' he said. ``Everyone is 
different. I'll go through things however I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his rookie season, 1997, Morris was 12-9 with a 3.19 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Euro; Down Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro Tuesday as news  
surfaced that Serbian forces moved into Albania, briefly taking 
over a border village during a firefight with Albanian soldiers and 
border police. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the dollar was mixed against major currencies,  
falling against the Japanese yen in lackluster trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0754, down  
from $1.0820 late Monday. The dollar was worth 119.83 Japanese yen, 
down from 120.19 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading within narrow ranges against major  
currencies during the Asian and European trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	As the New York session began, news bulletins alerted traders  
about 8:45 a.m. that Serbian infantry troops had crossed into 
Albania. Border police and then the Albanian army engaged the 
invaders until Albania's interior minister announced several hours 
later that the Serbs had withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro was on its lows'' as hostilities were first reported,  
said Ralph DelZenero, a foreign exchange marketing vice president 
at First National Bank of Chicago. ``That's what probably drove the 
dollar stronger against the euro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar barely reacted if at all to economic reports in Japan  
and the United States. The Bank of Japan said the worst parts of 
Japan's recession were ending. In the U.S., inflation was nearly at 
a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aside from the initial down move, certainly towards the latter  
part of the afternoon, it's been very quiet,'' DelZenero said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.4905 Swiss francs, up from 1.4843,  
and 1.4908 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4935. The British pound 
was quoted at $1.6158, up from $1.6129. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8188 
German marks, up from 1.8077; 6.1013 French francs, up from 6.0643; 
and 1,801.80 Italian lire, up from 1,788.91.

<HEADLINE> Online Tax Services Go Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- People hoping to make income tax  
filing less painful by punching a few buttons on their computer 
keyboard got a surprise when a popular filing service was 
unavailable for more than 14 hours Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic filing for Intuit Inc.'s TurboTax, one of the most  
popular tax-preparation software packages, was out of action from 
about 1 a.m. EDT until 3:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday, Intuit spokesman 
Robert Blodgett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most taxpayers still file returns through the mail, the  
outage created a furor among users of the electronic services. 
</P>
<P>
	Blodgett said Intuit routinely backs up its system on Friday  
nights when there is less filing activity, but made the additional 
backup Monday night in anticipation of continued heavy filing 
activity through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As of April 8 about 1.2 million tax returns had been filed  
Intuit's tax service, Blodgett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blodgett said users were not warned the system would be down.  
When they tried to file their forms they got a message asking them 
to try again later. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic tax-filing has grown rapidly this year, encouraged by  
the Internal Revenue Service, which is seeking to reduce paperwork. 
Companies like Intuit have attracted customers by promising faster 
refunds than taxpayers would receive through regular mail.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Discusses Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized Congress on  
Tuesday for seeking international-spending cuts that she said would 
undermine America's ability to lead in the Balkans and around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that is a demonstration of responsible  
leadership,'' she told a coalition of business, humanitarian and 
environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mrs. Clinton chided Congress for cutting international  
spending, President Clinton was meeting with lawmakers at the White 
House seeking additional money to pay for the NATO offensive in 
Yugoslavia. Pentagon officials estimated the supplemental budget 
request for the Kosovo operation would total $3 billion to $4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration budget for fiscal 2000 calls for  
international spending of $21.3 billion. The Senate and House both 
have proposed steep cuts that would reduce outlays to $15 billion 
to $16 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President ``Slobodan Milosevic's brutal and inhuman  
policies of ethnic cleansing were ones that have been addressed by 
economic sanctions, by diplomacy, by human intervention and now by 
military action,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But it is important that we 
recognize that military and humanitarian efforts there underscore 
once again the United States government having the resources we 
need to maintain American leadership, not only in Kosovo but in 
other troubled regions of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who is considering a campaign for the Senate from  
New York, said the United States should pay its back dues to the 
United Nations and increase spending on foreign aid to demonstrate 
its commitment to democracy and free market economies. ``We also 
see the need for Americans to cooperate with multilateral 
organizations and international institutions like the United 
Nations to share the cost burdens of intervention and assistance,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has conditioned payment of back U.S. dues to the United  
Nations on financial and other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spoke to the Campaign to Preserve U.S. Global  
Leadership, a coalition that includes companies such as Lockheed 
Martin Corp. and humanitarian organizations such as CARE. She 
received three standing ovations, and after her speech stopped to 
shake hands and pose for pictures with members of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition plans to lobby Congress about U.S. leadership in  
international affairs and the need for sufficient financial means 
to exercise it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said the Kosovo crisis makes this a ``particularly  
fitting moment to be making the case for international 
engagement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our military and humanitarian efforts there underscore the  
need once again that the United States government have the 
resources'' to lead in the Balkans and elsewhere in the world, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has made some progress in stemming  
reductions in spending on international affairs, according to Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we also suffered some defeats,'' she said, ``Once again  
Congress refused to pay our debts to the United Nations. Overall, 
we have to recognize that (foreign) development assistance is at 
its lowest level since World War II'' and less in percentage terms 
compared with what U.S. allies spend. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations says the United States owes $1.7 billion.  
Congress passed legislation last year that would have paid off a 
chunk of the debt, but Clinton vetoed the bill because it contained 
unrelated abortion restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Names New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. announced a major executive  
reshuffle Tuesday aimed at helping the top Japanese automaker ride 
out drastic changes in the global auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujio Cho, an executive who ran the U.S. production of Toyota  
Motor Corp. for six years, was named the new president, replacing 
Hiroshi Okuda. Okuda will remain influential as the company's 
chairman, a post similar to chief executive in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Okuda said Cho was well-suited to lead Toyota during these  
``turbulent times'' for the industry, seen in the DaimlerChrysler 
merger and in French automaker Renault's taking a stake in ailing 
Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has shown outstanding talent in improving production. And  
he won praise for his success in setting up our operation in 
Kentucky in the United States,'' Okuda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cho, 62, who joined Toyota in 1960 and is now executive vice  
president, served as president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing in the 
United States for six years until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``My most memorable job was building the Kentucky plant out of  
scratch. When I went to the United States, there was nothing,'' Cho 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive changes will become official at a board meeting in  
late June. Shoichiro Toyoda, a member of the automaker's founding 
Toyoda family and the current chairman, will become honorary 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The long rumored moves were unlikely to bring about broad  
changes at Toyota, as Cho is expected to continue to carry out 
Okuda's basic plans, said Peter Boardman, auto analyst at Warburg 
Dillon Read in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company has a strategy set up, and now it's a matter of  
implementing the strategy,'' Boardman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Okuda, 66, took over as president in 1995 with an aggressive  
plan to turn Toyota into a global automaker and expand world market 
share. In his new post, he will shape the overall strategy of the 
Toyota Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Okuda's new job will be to come up with a group strategy at a  
time when global competition is heating up,'' said Noriyuki 
Matsushima, auto analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Okuda refused to go into details of how Toyota hoped to reshape  
its business, saying that was still undecided. Okuda did say that 
Toyota had no plans for mergers or spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said other personnel moves were in the works that will  
show that Toyota wants a younger leadership to better respond to 
changing times. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media reports have speculated that Toyota will set up a  
Western-style holding company to strengthen the parent company's 
grip on its various other projects that include auto parts 
manufacturing, financing, insurance and telecommunications. Holding 
companies only recently became legal in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he acknowledged that he had little experience in sales,  
Cho said he had no plans to overhaul Toyota's sales strategy in 
Japan, which like other automakers have been hurt by the lingering 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel we have to fix anything right away. It is  
important to keep the relationship of trust with the dealers,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Crane Worker Undaunted by Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Less than 24 hours after he was plucked from a  
burning crane 250 feet above the ground, Ivers Sims said today he 
won't be afraid to return to his construction job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go back,'' the crane operator said at a hospital news  
conference, displaying little emotion. But not until he takes ``a 
month or so'' off. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wants to meet again with firefighter Matt Moseley,  
whose daring, dangling stunt at the end of a helicopter rope saved 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
	He sent a message to Moseley this morning via television, saying  
on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' show: ``Thank you, Matt. Thank 
God for your courage and bravery. I'm going to change your name to 
Moses, not Moseley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims, 49, of Woodland, Ala., waited more than an hour Monday to  
be rescued from the crane as flames consumed a former cotton mill 
that was being converted to loft apartments in east Atlanta. About 
20 feet away from where he lay, flames and smoke could be seen at 
the center of the crane that towered over the burning five-story 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims said he didn't realize the fire below him was out of  
control until it was too late to get down. He talked to those on 
the ground through his radio, then crawled out to a concrete 
counterweight, at the end of the crane's horizontal arm, to get 
away from the smoke and heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had to get out on this counterweight because my shoes  
were getting hot on the deck,'' he said. He admitted he feared the 
tower might collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley, tethered to a helicopter by a 50-foot rope, swooped in  
from the sky, then climbed and crawled along the teetering crane to 
where Sims was lying, strapped him into a harness and held him 
tightly as they were lowered to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims said he wasn't afraid on the ride down. ``I'm just used to  
heights,'' he said. ``The only thing I was kind of thinking about 
was hoping that the rope would hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted to walk to the waiting stretcher under his own  
power. ``If I'd had time, I would have kissed the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims was treated at Atlanta Medical Center for smoke inhalation  
and exposure to high heat, but otherwise was uninjured. He left the 
hospital this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The dramatic rescue was watched by crowds of gawkers on the  
ground and television viewers nationwide. Onlookers cheered and 
clapped as Moseley helped Sims into the harness and brought him 
safely to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley even cracked a joke. ``I told him his boss sent me up so  
he could knock off early,'' he said Monday shortly after the 
ordeal. ``That helped lighten things up a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley, 30, declined today to be labeled a hero.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a profession we've chosen and this is part of our job.  
Heroes are for the 'Late Show.' We're just working-class 
individuals,'' he said. ``We're just happy we could help Mr. Sims 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish he could've had a better trip to Atlanta, but at least  
he'll have some good stories to tell his grandchildren.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopter pilot Boyd Clines, who had to keep the aircraft  
steady amid dangerous drafts as Moseley worked below him, played 
down his role, too. ``A rescue is a rescue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trained to do this,'' Clines said. ``It wasn't anything  
too difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims' wife, Marilind, said she was watching on TV with their  
three children in Alabama as the rescue unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I freaked out,'' she said, ``then I got myself back together  
for the kids.'' She and the children drove to Atlanta later Monday 
to spend the night with Sims at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she won't mind if he goes back to work on a crane. ``It  
pays the bills,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the fire burned the old mill, the wind scattered large,  
burning embers over several blocks, where it landed in a 
neighborhood of closely clustered houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames gutted one home and damaged about a dozen others. There  
was no immediate word on how the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-story mill has been undergoing renovation for several  
years and was unoccupied. It was built in the 1880s and was in use 
until 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane remained standing today, but police cordoned off some  
streets around it for fear it might fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a fire like that that wasn't made out of  
Hollywood,'' said Pat Pirkle, whose neighbors doused her home with 
a garden hose as flames gutted a house on the street behind them.

	Serbs Pull Back From Albania  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces crossed into Albania  
today and briefly captured a border village, Albanian officials 
said, but withdrew hours later. Serb infantry troops exchanged 
gunfire with Albanian border police and seized control of Kamenica. 
Houses were reported on fire about a mile inside northeastern 
Albania. Yugoslavia denied its forces entered Albania, saying Serb 
forces were only defending the country's borders. In reaction to 
the reports, the State Department warned the Yugoslavs not to widen 
the war.

	More Refugees Head for Albania  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The U.N. refugee agency reported  
that nearly 5,000 ethnic Albanians poured into Albania earlier 
today after what they described as a systematic clearing out of 
their villages near Pristina, Kosovo's capital. Refugees said 
Serbian soldiers at the border shot and killed a young woman who 
was trying to escape them. More than a half-million ethnic 
Albanians have fled or been driven out of Kosovo since the NATO air 
campaign began. The refugees say they were terrorized by Serb 
forces, their homes set ablaze, possessions taken, identity papers 
confiscated.

	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Russia and the United States sharply

pledged to work together to try to settle the conflict. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright said ``it is in the interest of both 
governments to work together whenever we can.'' Russia's foreign 
minister says his nation is still against the airstrikes, and said 
the ``sooner NATO ceases airstrikes, the easier it will be to find 
a solution.'' The Russian official also objected to the idea of a 
NATO-led peacekeeping force for Kosovo.

half and the clocks on the test side were rolled forward from an 
imaginary date of Dec. 31, 1999, to Jan. 1, 2000. The computers 
plotted the movement of one plane in particular, United Airlines 
Flight 2778, which landed at the airport. Data on Flight 2778 from

	PARIS (AP) -- A ventilation duct that was apparently left in the  
wrong position by Italian authorities may have fed a deadly blaze 
in the Mont Blanc tunnel, French investigators said today. Instead 
of sucking smoke out of the tunnel, as it should have done, the 
two-way duct blew cold air in, an interim report said. The French 
report said the duct was ``an important element to consider'' in 
analyzing why the fire spread so quickly, but not the only factor 
in determining what happened during the blaze, which killed 41 
people in the 7-mile-long tunnel.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, whose  
investigation of President Clinton revived a debate over special

put him in power, The Associated Press has learned. Starr is to 
testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee tomorrow. 
He submitted prepared remarks against renewing the Independent

pounds of frankfurters and luncheon meats produced at its Forrest 
City, Ark., plant because of possible contamination with the 
listeria bacteria. USDA officials concluded that no meat and

	Serb Forces Take Albanian Village  
</P>
<P>
	BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) -- Albania's interior minister says  
Yugoslavian troops crossed the border today, shot at Albanian 
police and took over the village of Kamenica. There are reports of 
houses in flames in the village, but no word of casualties. 
Albanian state television quoted a European security official as 
saying Serbs also entered a second village, Padesh. But there has 
been no confirmation of that action. In recent days, Yugoslavia has 
taken an increasingly hard line toward Albania, suggesting it would 
hold it responsible for KLA action initiated from its soil. A White

<HEADLINE> Whooping Cranes Lay Eggs in Wild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Two whooping cranes have produced  
the first eggs laid in the U.S. wild in decades, raising hopes that 
the majestic birds will make a comeback after nearly being wiped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old cranes are part of an experimental flock raised  
in captivity and placed in central Florida's Kissimmee Prairie. 
None had produced eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be happy if the eggs hatch, and we'll be really happy if  
they do raise these chicks,'' George Archibald, director of the 
International Crane Foundation, said Monday. ``But we don't really 
expect it to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biologist Kathy Sullivan said the eggs themselves were ``a big  
enough accomplishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once, thousands of whooping cranes soared across the United  
States, their bugling calls audible for miles. But settlers drained 
marshes and plowed prairies, destroying the crane's habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1938, only two small flocks remained: one that nested in  
Canada and wintered in Texas, and another that lived in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm wiped out most of the Louisiana birds, and none laid  
eggs again. The last survivor of that flock died in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers desperate to save the birds from extinction found  
the Canadian birds' nesting grounds and, beginning in the late 
1960s, started taking eggs to try to resurrect the species by 
raising birds in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, federal officials started sending whooping cranes  
raised in captivity in Maryland to Florida as an experiment. Over 
the last three years, biologists have seen six of the birds pair 
off. But none had laid eggs.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Violence, Holocaust Compared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As an Auschwitz prisoner, Elie Wiesel often  
told himself that the leaders of the free world did not know what 
was going on behind those ``black gates'' at Nazi concentration 
camps. ``If they knew, surely those leaders would have moved heaven 
and earth to intervene,'' the Nobel peace laureate thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence in Kosovo today, 54 years later, has prompted many  
to draw parallels with the Nazi extermination of Jews during World 
War II. But, Wiesel said, ``this time the world was not silent. 
This time the world responded. This time we intervened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo, and the Holocaust, were much on the minds of Wiesel's  
listeners Monday night at a White House ``Millennium Evening'' 
lecture hosted by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	His program, ``The Perils of Indifference: Lessons of a Violent  
Century,'' also included references to the atomic bombing of 
Hiroshima, countless civil wars and assassinations of numerous 
world figures, including President Kennedy, Egyptian President 
Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so much easier to look away from these things. It is so  
much easier to avoid such rude interruptions to our work,'' Wiesel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States had learned from past mistakes,  
including its unwillingness to intervene in the ethnic slaughter 
five years ago of hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda, and 
vowed it would resist becoming apathetic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot be indifferent at home or abroad -- that is why we  
are in Kosovo,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked by an audience member, Clinton denied that the slow  
U.S. response to the killings in Rwanda was based upon race. In 
Kosovo, unlike the African nation, the NATO alliance has been a 
``mechanism'' that allowed a group of armed forces to gather fast 
and act quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is ``determined not to turn away from the  
horrors we leave behind, but to act on their lessons and principles 
and purpose,'' Clinton said. ``That is what we are trying to do. 
Kosovo could be a very good place to begin the new century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, however, warned the nation against ``demonizing''  
Serbians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot be indifferent to the fact that the Serbian leader  
has defined destiny as a license to kill,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton acknowledged that the recent upwelling of support for  
U.S. involvement in Kosovo stems from the countless photographs and 
television images capturing the violence and the massive uprooting 
of ethnic Albanians there. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked Wiesel whether he thought the barrage of 24-hour-news  
coverage of Kosovar Albanian refugees ultimately would make 
Americans immune to such tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Numbness is a danger,'' Wiesel admitted.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, he sees no alternative.  
</P>
<P>
	``We must know what is happening,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Worker-Safety Agency Under Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- OSHA, the federal agency responsible for  
ensuring worker safety, hasn't done its job and needs an overhaul, 
the parents of two men who were killed in on-the-job accidents told 
senators Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as they blamed the Occupational Safety and Health  
Administration for the accidents that claimed their sons' lives, 
both men said their comments were intended only to help the agency, 
not to hurt it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never ask you to get rid of OSHA. It's the only safety  
net we have,'' said Ron Hayes, of Fairhope, Ala., whose 19-year-old 
son was sucked into a Florida grain elevator and smothered by 60 
tons of corn in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said the charges leveled against the  
agency, which it oversees, and some of its staff, were ``groundless 
and untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes and Charles LeCroy of Tallahassee, Fla., testified for a  
bill by Sen. Michael Enzi, R-Wyo., intended to help the agency by 
enlisting private consultants to inspect work sites and free 
federal workers to concentrate on the worst offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Enzi said it would take the agency more than 167 years to reach  
every work site in the country, and that hampers its ability to 
protect the health and safety of more than 100 million employees at 
better than 6 million places of employment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that OSHA neither helps those good-faith employers  
who want to achieve compliance with safety laws nor effectively 
deters bad employers from breaking the law,'' said Enzi, chairman 
of the employment, safety and training panel of the Senate Health, 
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	LeCroy, whose son was killed when a chemical vat used to treat  
and boil wood into pulp exploded at a Florida paper mill in 1994, 
said inspectors visited the site several times and knew that much 
of the equipment was substandard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yet OSHA did not force the mill to correct the problems, nor  
did they declare the work area to be unsafe,'' LeCroy said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement distributed after the hearing, Charles Jeffress,  
assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health, 
defended the agency and lashed out at the ``one-sided, inaccurate 
testimony'' presented. 
</P>
<P>
	``OSHA sets high professional standards and holds its staff to  
them,'' he said. ``Our compliance officers are dedicated to 
enforcing the law, not breaking it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Department officials did not testify at Tuesday's hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	At a March hearing, Jeffress said Enzi's plan would undermine  
the agency's mandate because of inherent conflict of interest and 
accountability problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He said inspectors are concentrating on the most hazardous  
workplaces, spending less time at safer ones and are using Labor 
Department data to target inspections to industries with the 
highest injury and illness rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffress announced the appointment Wednesday of Art DeCoursey as  
a special liaison to help victims and their families get 
information from OSHA. DeCoursey is Jeffress' liaison for small 
business.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Pay $89,951 in Fed. Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President and Mrs. Clinton earned $504,109  
last year, including more than $275,000 in capital gains and 
business income, and paid $89,951 in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons released their tax returns today, two days before  
the April 15 filing deadline. They overpaid their taxes by $4,267 
and chose to have that amount applied to their 1999 tax bill rather 
than receive a refund. Their tax payment amounted to 17 percent of 
their earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 1998 return closely mirrored their taxes from the previous  
year. The first family reported $569,511 in adjusted gross income 
for 1997, and they paid $91,964 in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper,  
released their tax forms, showing they paid $52,951 in federal 
taxes for 1998 on adjusted gross income of $224,132. 
</P>
<P>
	After being criticized last year for giving only $353 to charity  
in 1997, the Gores reported giving $15,197 in 1998, mostly to 
groups that support the homeless, the mentally ill and religious 
and educational organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the first lady reported $509,345 in total income,  
which was reduced to $504,109 in adjusted gross income after 
deduction of self-employment taxes. Their income sources included 
$200,000 from his salary as president, $16,665 in interest, $16,736 
in dividends, $1,329 in taxable refunds or credits, $74,289 in 
business income and $200,318 in capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The dividend and interest income includes $12,000 from a trust  
fund established in 1912 for whomever is the spouse of the 
president. The first lady will contribute that money to charity, as 
she has in prior years, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons took a $161,938 deduction for charitable gifts,  
including $99,220 for gifts in 1998 and $62,718 in gifts carried 
over from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The $74,289 in business income came from profits generated by a  
book written several years ago by Mrs. Clinton about child raising, 
entitled, ``It Takes a Village.'' Proceeds from another books she 
wrote about the family's cat, Socks, and dog, Buddy, go directly to 
a national parks foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said that all book  
income, minus taxes and administrative expenses, would be donated 
to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The first family received $53,462 in short-term capital gains  
and $146,856 in long-term capital gains -- both from the Pell Rudman 
Trust Co., which holds a private trust for the Clintons. The 
arrangement shields the Clintons from involvement with their 
investments and prevents public disclosure of their income sources.

<HEADLINE> Officials Probe 4 Hantavirus Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Health officials are investigating four  
recent hantavirus cases in New Mexico, including two that were 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest case cropped up last week when a 15-year-old San Juan  
County girl was admitted to University Hospital in Albuquerque, 
hospital spokesman Greg Johnston said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was placed on a machine that helps the lungs and heart  
by infusing blood with oxygen. A 10-year-old boy from the same 
county was treated and released earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	A 43-year-old Cibola County woman died March 25 and a  
42-year-old McKinley County man died Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists say the virus is spread in airborne particles of  
rodent waste -- in New Mexico, mainly from the deer mouse. Flu-like 
symptoms can quickly develop into serious respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease was first recognized in 1993 in the Four Corners  
area where New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado meet. The four 
recent New Mexico cases have all happened in the northwestern part 
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the reason for the concern is that there's not a good  
explanation (for the frequency),'' said Dr. David Keller, director 
of infectious disease epidemiology for the state. ``Last year we 
braced for a lot of cases, but we only had six all year.''

<HEADLINE> AP, NY Times, WSJ Win Pulitzers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press, The New York Times and The  
Wall Street Journal each won two Pulitzers while The Washington 
Post was awarded the 1999 prize for public service. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP won the two photography awards, the first time staff  
members of the same organization have swept the photo categories. 
In 1974, the AP won both photo Pulitzers, one for a picture by a 
staff member and the other by a free-lancer whose work the AP 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize for commentary went to Maureen Dowd of the Times for  
columns on President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. The 
Times staff, notably Jeff Gerth, won for national reporting for a 
series that disclosed the sale of American technology to China 
despite national security risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal won for international reporting for coverage of the  
Russian financial crisis. The Journal's Angelo Henderson won the 
feature writing category for his portrait of a druggist driven to 
violence by his encounters with armed robbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't be more thrilled,'' said Bob Davis, a member of the  
Journal's international reporting team. ``It was a team effort in 
covering the meltdown in Russia, of which I was a small part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AP won the spot news photography award for a portfolio on  
the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. It won for feature 
photography for a collection of photographs of the events 
surrounding Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky and his impeachment. 
The AP has won nine Pulitzers in the past nine years, including 
eight for photography. 
</P>
<P>
	Vin Alabiso, AP vice president and executive photo editor,  
called it ``just a tremendous tribute to the staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post won the public service award for a series on reckless  
gunplay by city police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize for explanatory reporting went to Richard Read of The  
Oregonian of Portland for showing the impact of the Asian economic 
crisis on a local french fries exporter. When word reached The 
Oregonian newsroom that business reporter Richard Read had won for 
the four-part series titled ``The French Fry Connection,'' a brass 
band played and the 350 staffers washed down hundreds of orders of 
McDonald's fries with champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a riot in here right now,'' executive editor Peter Bhatia  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize for criticism went to Blair Kamin of the Chicago  
Tribune for his coverage of architecture, including a series on the 
development of Chicago's lakefront. His work originally was entered 
in that category, but was moved by jurors to beat reporting and 
then moved back to criticism by the Pulitzer board. 
</P>
<P>
	The beat reporting prize went to the Los Angeles Times' Chuck  
Philips and Michael Hiltzik for stories on corruption in the 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize for breaking news reporting was awarded to The  
Hartford Courant for coverage of a shooting rampage in which a 
lottery worker killed four supervisors and himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winning of this award really validates what we all knew:  
This is the best newsroom in the country,'' Publisher Marty Petty 
told the staff. She then asked for a moment of silence in memory of 
those slain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody at the Courant would gladly give this award back if  
we could bring one of these people back,'' said John Springer, who 
was one of the first journalists on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Herald won for investigative reporting for exposing  
pervasive voter fraud in the city's mayoral election that was later 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Daily News won for editorial writing for its  
campaign to rescue Harlem's Apollo Theatre from mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	The editorial cartooning prize went to David Horsey of the  
Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pulitzers, the most prestigious awards given for journalism,  
are presented annually by Columbia University. The awards carry a 
prize of $5,000, except for public service. The winning newspaper 
of that category gets a gold medal.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Mixed in Quiet Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term bonds fell Tuesday as new signs of  
strong consumer demand overshadowed another tame inflation report. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/8 point,  
or $6.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose 5.49 percent from 5.45 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds sagged as the Commerce Department reported that retail  
sales rose just 0.2 percent in March, but also revealed a sharp 
upward revision in the prior month's data. 
</P>
<P>
	The new reading of a 1.7 percent gain for February marked the  
largest monthly advance in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	With investors worrying that strong consumer spending will  
aggravate inflationary pressures, little attention was paid to a 
report showing that consumer prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in 
March. Inflation makes fixed-income investments such as bonds less 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell 1/32 to 3/32 point and intermediate maturities fell 
from 3/16 to 3/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.26 percent, while  
the discount fell 0.03 percentage point to 4.16 percent compared 
with Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields eased to 4.48 percent, while the discount was  
unchanged from 4.32 percent in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields were unchanged at 4.62 percent as the discount  
held steady at 4.41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.63 percent from 4.69 percent Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/4 point to 124 5/8. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.21 percent from late Monday's 5.20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Judge Holds Clinton in Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton faces a new blot on his  
record and thousands of dollars in fresh legal expenses after a 
federal judge cited him for contempt of court. Historians believe 
he is the first chief executive to receive such a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright concluded Monday that  
the president lied about his relationship with former White House 
intern Monica Lewinsky in a Jan. 17, 1998, deposition in the Paula 
Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply put, the president's deposition testimony ... was  
intentionally false,'' Wright wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones ``any reasonable  
expenses including attorneys' fees caused by his willful failure to 
obey this court's discovery orders'' and also to pay $1,202 as 
reimbursement for the judge's travel in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	One option is for Clinton to use his legal defense fund, which  
has raised $4.5 million, to pay the sanction. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers were mum, leaving their options open until  
they see what sort of penalty Mrs. Jones requests. One of her 
lawyers said Monday night it could be tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, however, hinted in her ruling if Clinton attempts to  
contest her findings, it could have political costs for a president 
eager to put the impeachment crisis behind him that ended in 
January when he was acquitted on perjury and obstruction of justice 
charges in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This court is fully aware that the president may have engaged  
in other ... conduct warranting'' punishment and if Clinton 
exercises his right to contest the finding it would open the door 
for hearings complete with witnesses ``on all matters concerning 
the president's conduct,'' she warned. 
</P>
<P>
	At her home in Cabot, Ark., Mrs. Jones was overjoyed. ``Ah! Ta  
ta ta ta ta. That's all I have to say,'' she said, waving her hands 
above her head and dancing. Asked whether she believed the sanction 
against the president was good for the country, Mrs. Jones said, 
``I could care less. It's not about that, it's about what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also set in motion a process that could strip Clinton  
of his law license, referring the president's testimony to the 
Arkansas Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said she would delay enforcement for 30 days to give  
Clinton an opportunity to ask for a hearing or to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a vindication,'' said John Whitehead, one of Mrs.  
Jones's lawyers. ``This is the first event in the whole proceeding 
where the president was actually held accountable in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Historians said they believed the action was a first.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have never heard of any case where a president has been  
found in contempt in a civil case,'' said Mark Rozell, a professor 
of political science at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's historical ``boxscore'' will say in part ``first  
elected president impeached and first to be held in contempt while 
in office,'' said Rozell. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright directed Mrs. Jones' lawyers to submit within 20 days a  
statement of their expenses, which Whitehead said could be ``tens 
of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have all the expenses related to seven lawyers who  
attended the deposition -- air fares, the time spent there (in 
Washington), the time preparing, meals, and what we believe was the 
cause and effect of the whole thing,'' said Whitehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior presidential aides, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Clinton lawyers regarded the penalty as less severe since the 
judge had the option of making a criminal referral against the 
president to the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said any finding of criminal contempt would have  
required a more lengthy process involving hearings and taking 
evidence. Also, she noted that much of Clinton's conduct had been 
investigated by the independent counsel's office and she wanted to 
``prevent any potential double jeopardy issues from arising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bennett, the private lawyer who represented Clinton in  
the Jones case, said he would have no comment on the judge's ruling 
``until I have had the opportunity of reviewing this matter 
fully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, the Arkansas Republican who was one of the  
House prosecutors in the impeachment trial, said a ``nonpartisan 
and nonpolitical judge'' had found the president had willfully 
disobeyed court orders to be truthful and ``I have to underline the 
'willful' part of her ruling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The office of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, whose  
investigation prompted the impeachment crisis, declined comment 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said her decision to dismiss the Jones case a year ago  
would not have changed, even if the president had been ``truthful 
with respect to his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones appealed the dismissal, but then settled the case by  
accepting an $850,000 payment from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In his deposition in the Jones case, Clinton said: ``I have  
never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' But after his 
DNA was found on a dress belonging to Ms. Lewinsky, he acknowledged 
an ``inappropriate intimate relationship'' with her before a 
federal grand and in a nationally televised address. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the relationship did not fall under the definition  
of ``sexual relations'' provided by Mrs. Jones' lawyers during his 
deposition, and that his testimony was legally accurate.

<HEADLINE> New Stress Test Predicts Heart Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors just won approval of a powerful way to  
predict which of their patients are at risk of dying from cardiac 
arrest in time to protect them: a nonsurgical exam that essentially 
is a super stress test. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration ruled Tuesday that Cambridge  
Heart Inc.'s Alternans test is the diagnostic equivalent to a more 
dangerous surgical test that until now has been the only way to 
predict cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	It works by enhancing one of the world's oldest heart tests, the  
electrocardiogram. Patients taking a standard EKG-monitored 
treadmill stress test simply have special electrodes placed on 
their chests. The Alternans system then can measure unusual, 
extremely subtle heartbeat patterns that indicate patients are at 
risk of ventricular fibrillation, a lethal irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 350,000 Americans die each year of sudden cardiac arrest,  
collapsing when this deadly irregular beat stops their hearts. If 
doctors knew who was at high risk, that patient could receive an 
implanted defibrillator, a tiny device that automatically 
jump-starts a heart sliding into an arrhythmia, or abnormal 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, most patients identified as needing defibrillators  
were those lucky enough to be revived by paramedics after cardiac 
arrest, only about 10 percent to 15 percent of arrhythmia victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alternans test ``has extraordinary potential for impacting  
on the problem of sudden death,'' said Dr. David Rosenbaum of Case 
Western Reserve University, who helped discover that ``T-wave 
alternans'' signals predict future cardiac arrest. ``It's something 
patients should be aware of and talk to their physicians about if 
they have heart disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 9 million people a year take treadmill-style stress tests  
to diagnose their risk for the artery clogging that causes most 
heart disease. But irregular heartbeats aren't caused by clogged 
arteries -- they happen when the electrical system that pumps the 
heart goes haywire. 
</P>
<P>
	A regular stress test won't diagnose that risk. But Cambridge  
Heart's device enhances the stress test to analyze T-wave 
alternans, beat-to-beat electrical fluctuations that measure just a 
millionth of a volt. 
</P>
<P>
	The signals reflect abnormalities in how individual heart cells  
recover after relaying a heartbeat's electrical impulse, Rosenbaum 
recently reported in the journal, Circulation. If the cells' 
voltage oscillates, a chain reaction can be started that ends in a 
lethal irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies suggest that only 18 percent of heart patients detected  
with problematic T-wave alternans are alive 20 months later, while 
95 percent of heart patients without the abnormality live that 
long, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Electrophysiology testing, where electrodes are surgically put  
onto the heart, can detect high-risk patients. But that's risky and 
expensive, so only about 70,000 Americans are tested each year, 
Cambridge Heart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alternans test is equivalent to the surgical test but  
doesn't automatically identify at-risk patients, cautioned FDA's 
Dr. Dan Spyker. Specially trained cardiologists must read the 
machine's T-wave measurements to determine each patient's risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients must be healthy enough to exercise at 70 percent of  
their maximum heart rate during the treadmill test, Spyker said. 
But the Alternans test itself poses no risk to patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The hope is that a noninvasive test will let doctors detect more  
people at risk of cardiac arrest in time to protect them, Rosenbaum 
said. The big question is who should be tested. 
</P>

	Half of cardiac arrest victims have no previous history of  
irregular heartbeat or heart disease, yet testing everyone who gets 
a treadmill exam would be exorbitant, he said. First tested 
probably will be heart attack survivors who have additional serious 
cardiac disorders such as heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
	The test should add about $100 to a conventional treadmill test,  
which averages $250, Cambridge Heart said.

<HEADLINE>  The 'Great One' May Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY KEN RAPPOPORT   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With speculation growing about Wayne Gretzky's  
future, even he admits it's time to think about retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, Gretzky insisted he had not made up his mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have 1,000 different thoughts, to be honest,'' Gretzky said  
after the New York Rangers played their second-last game at Madison 
Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old hockey great is in the last year of a contract  
and has said he would decide sometime after the season. He 
acknowledged, however, retirement was under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to think about it. ... All of a sudden it's become a  
bigger issue than I imagined,'' he said. ``Let's see what happens 
over the next five or six days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post reported today that Gretzky will retire after  
the Rangers' season finale Sunday, citing what it described as 
``unimpeachable sources in whom The Great One has confided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has made up his mind, but he has had his reasons for not  
wanting to make an announcement,'' the Post quoted an unidentified 
person it described as having knowledge of the retirement decision 
as saying. ``But it's done. He is not coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto Sun also reported Gretzky would retire, saying the  
only way he would revise his decision to quit would be if his wife, 
Janet, and agent, Michael Barnett, urged him to step back and 
review his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out soon enough,'' Rangers coach John Muckler said  
following Monday night's 2-1 victory over Tampa Bay. ``Everybody is 
speculating, but only one person knows for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun and ESPN quoted unidentified sources as saying Gretzky  
asked for an unusually large number of tickets for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest speculation was inspired by a television report that  
said Gretzky's retirement was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	John Davidson, a color commentator for the Rangers, said Sunday  
on Fox TV that after speaking with Gretzky he believed the player 
was 80 percent sure he would retire after Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people very close to Wayne ... and I mean very close, feel  
there's a very strong possibility Sunday will be the last time he 
plays,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky responded to questions about Davidson's report by  
saying, ``There's been times where I've said things to friends that 
get blown way out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I will say is that I will not be one of those  
guys who says `I'm 90 percent sure' or `maybe I'm coming back.' The 
decision I make will be 100 percent. No ifs ands or buts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans at Madison Square Garden held up signs Monday night with  
slogans such as ``Wayne Don't Go.'' Gretzky said the fan reaction 
made it difficult to consider retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said it a hundred times that I've been here over the three  
years,'' Gretzky said. ``This is the greatest city to be an athlete 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as one old friend is concerned, the answer won't come  
easily, and certainly won't come soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing Wayne, he would weigh everything and talk to a lot of  
people before making that decision,'' said Bruce MacGregor, 
assistant general manager of the Edmonton Oilers. ``It's a very 
hard decision. When you retire, it's for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Tuele, another member of the Oilers' organization who also  
is a longtime friend of Gretzky, wasn't so sure he would retire 
after this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say this. Wayne has not shared any final decision with  
anyone,'' Tuele, the Oilers' vice president and public relations 
head, said in a telephone interview. ``Wayne's dad doesn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a February game in Calgary, Gretzky admitted it was his  
last game there because he knew the Rangers weren't visiting the 
Flames next season. He received an emotional response that night 
from the Calgary fans, and has received similar tributes in other 
arenas as the season drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been a typical season for Gretzky, who missed 11 games  
at one point with a neck injury. He had played in 223 straight 
games since signing with the Rangers as a free agent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was the second in Gretzky's career involving a disc.  
In 1992-93, he missed most of the season with a lower back injury 
before coming back to lead the Los Angeles Kings to the Stanley Cup 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no playoffs for the Rangers this season, however.  
They missed for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a frustrating year for him ... the way the club has  
played and the (neck injury). Those kind of injuries bother you a 
lot,'' MacGregor said in a telephone interview from Edmonton. 
``Maybe there's some speculation that he's not 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect (Gretzky's retirement) would have to do more with  
this than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998-99 season has included at least one milestone for the  
NHL's leading career scorer. His ninth goal of the year gave him 
1,072 as a professional, moving him past boyhood hero Gordie Howe.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To OK Boost of NATO Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the Pentagon preparing to approve a NATO  
request for hundreds of additional U.S. warplanes to use against 
Yugoslavia, congressional leaders are urging their members not to 
rush to judgment on the divisive issue of ground troops in the 
Balkans conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's military commander, Army Gen. Wesley Clark, requested  
``several hundred'' more U.S. aircraft, and Defense Secretary 
William Cohen was expected to give quick approval, said defense 
officials, speaking Monday night on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The reinforcements would be in addition to the 500 U.S. aircraft  
already part of the 700-plane NATO force. The additional planes 
would include ground-attack jets, radar-jamming planes to disrupt 
Serb air defenses and refueling tankers to allow allied pilots to 
stay aloft longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to increase NATO's ability to attack to Yugoslav  
army and security forces in Kosovo,'' one official said. 
``Secretary Cohen has already said he is going to approve any 
request from General Clark for additional assets. I would 
anticipate that the request will be approved expeditiously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, meanwhile, was pressing its  
insistence that the conflict in the Balkans could be resolved by 
air power alone, despite a movement in Congress to arm Clinton with 
the ground troop option. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's too early to have that vote,'' House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said following a Monday night meeting with 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, advocates of authorizing ground troops were circulating  
language and pressing for an early vote as lawmakers returned from 
a two-week recess. Kosovo seemed destined to dominate discussion 
this week on Capitol Hill, even if no votes were planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 50-60 members of Congress, most of them from committees  
dealing with national security, were getting a White House briefing 
today from President Clinton. Cohen and other national security 
officials were to brief an even wider group of lawmakers at the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional and administration officials also said the  
administration would ask Congress this week for $2.5 billion to $3 
billion to pay for the conflict with Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton on Monday said the United States and its allies ``would  
like to nip this conflict in the bud before it destabilizes all of 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to military personnel and their families at Barksdale  
Air Force Base, La., Clinton said the United States was 
``determined to continue this mission'' and that Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic ``should be under no illusions that we will end 
it from weariness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress was joining the debate in earnest as new rounds of NATO  
attacks pounded Yugoslav fuel depots and heavy industry. Serb 
officials said at least 10 people aboard a Yugoslav passenger train 
were killed and 16 injured on Monday when NATO bombed a railroad 
bridge. The alliance expressed regret at the loss of civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other NATO foreign  
ministers, meeting for the first time Monday in Brussels, Belgium, 
since the three-week air campaign began, vowed to press ahead with 
the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	They discussed establishing a protectorate to shield the  
rebellious Serbian province from Milosevic's forces. The developing 
plan likely would be coupled with refusing to allow Yugoslav troops 
in Kosovo and would provide a way to support self-rule after a 
settlement of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic of what's  
left of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	After Monday night's White House meeting, Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he didn't think it was helpful for other 
members to be pressing for ground troops. But, he also said, ``I 
don't think we should preclude anything. ... I think we need to see 
how this thing progresses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and House Minority  
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., asserted that North Atlantic allies 
remain determined. ``Mr. Milosevic should understand that the NATO 
countries are united,'' Gephardt said. ``We want his troops to pull 
back out of Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties were divided on the ground-force issue -- although  
momentum appeared to be moving in favor of at least planning for 
such a contingency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything should be left on the table, including using ground  
forces in Kosovo. ... You don't want to preclude a legitimate 
option,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., back from a weekend 
tour of a refugee camp in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Armed Services  
Committee, and Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on 
the Foreign Relations Committee, on Monday were circulating a 
resolution giving the president ``the authority to use all 
necessary force'' to meet NATO's goals in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are advocates of planning for a possible ground operation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to push the ball down the court a little,''  
Biden said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Biden said he doubts the measure could win congressional  
passage as long as the Clinton administration contends the 
operation can succeed by air power alone.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Clinic Operator Accused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The operator of a clinic where a man died two  
hours after receiving an antibiotic injection in 1997 has been 
accused by the state Medical Board of using unlicensed 
practitioners to treat patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint against Dr. Miguel Ramon Castillo-Inzunza comes  
during a crackdown on unlicensed clinics serving immigrants in 
Southern California. Such clinics have been blamed for several 
deaths in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The gross-negligence complaint filed Monday could lead to the  
loss of the doctor's license. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo-Inzunza, who runs clinics in Santa Ana and Escondido,  
was accused of employing unlicensed practitioners who treated and 
examined patients, administered injections and forged prescriptions 
in his name. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Monday, Castillo-Inzunza called the allegations  
``pure lies'' and said all people who work in his clinic are 
licensed. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint cited the case of Pedro Cruz-Sanchez, 32, who died  
of pneumonia after he went to the Escondido clinic coughing up 
blood and having difficulty breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of being transferred to an emergency room, he was  
allegedly given an inappropriate dose of an antibiotic and two 
unapproved drugs from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo-Inzunza wasn't present and had left the treatment of  
the patient in the hands of unlicensed people, according to the 
Medical Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he allegedly altered the medical records to make it appear  
he had treated the man and advised him to go the emergency room.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake, USOC Differ on Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake and U.S. Olympic officials are  
supposed to work together when it comes to fund raising, but lately 
there have been some disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the two groups have a chance to iron out  
their differences today at a Salt Lake Organizing Committee 
financial meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, SLOC's new head, has been identifying contingency  
cuts in the committee's $1.45 billion budget should revenues fall 
short, and he also has expressed concerns about the optimistic 
goals set in the two groups' joint marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's contingency cuts include $5 million to allow U.S.  
athletes training access at the Utah venues before the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said Monday that the SLOC does not plan to contribute for  
the USOC's $9 million project to restore public trust in the wake 
of the Salt Lake bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	While Romney has ruled out a cash donation, he said he is still  
considering whether the SLOC can afford to give $1 million in goods 
and services. He said he informed USOC officials of his decision 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're behind in fund-raising, and everything can't be laid at  
Salt Lake's feet to solve,'' Romney said. ``Our view is their role 
is to raise the money. They need to take any and all action 
necessary to do that. If there's some costs, that's something they 
should bear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Salt Lake does have a responsibility to participate with the  
(USOC) in conveying to sponsors and the nation as a whole ... that 
we've worked very hard to try and put this scandal behind us,'' 
USOC Secretary General John Krimsky told the Salt Lake Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that within the state of Utah much of this scandal  
has been effectively closed and concluded and people are moving 
on,'' he said. ``But that's not quite true in the rest of the 
United States. We cannot sit quietly and wait for the press to die 
down, and then expect the sponsors to come flooding back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign was announced Saturday by executive director Dick  
Schultz at the USOC meeting in New Orleans, the first since the 
Salt Lake scandal broke late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigations revealed that Salt Lake Olympic boosters gave  
more than $1 million in cash, scholarships, shopping sprees and 
free medical care to International Olympic Committee members who 
then voted on the city's bid to host the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the new program, to be launched on a national  
Olympic Day on June 23, would be aimed at restoring ``a trust 
between the people of the world and the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC Chairman Bob Garff had called the campaign a worthwhile  
investment for the organizing committee because it would help 
fund-raising for the Salt Lake games. But Romney called Garff's 
support a ``miscommunication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC-SLOC joint marketing venture , called the Olympic  
Properties of the United States -- OPUS -- has a goal of raising $859 
million in sponsorship cash, goods and services. About $300 million 
still remain to be raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said last week that the OPUS budget appeared ``very  
optimistic'' and he said it had raised just $13 million since June 
and has run out of repeat sponsors to sign.

<HEADLINE> Broadcasting Boosts Tribune Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Tribune Co., the parent company of the Chicago  
Tribune and the Chicago Cubs, reported higher first-quarter profits 
Tuesday thanks largely to strong gains in its broadcasting 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended March 28, the Chicago-based company  
reported profits from operations of $73 million, or 53 cents a 
share, which excluded several one-time gains. In the same period a 
year ago, the company earned $66 million, or 46 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations of 51 cents a  
share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. The 
company's stock was off 6 1/4 cents at $76.12 1/2 in morning trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased 7 percent to $719.9 million from $672.7  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribune had a pretax gain of $348 million, or $1.62 a share, for  
the exchange of the company's CBS-affiliated TV station, WGNX-TV in 
Atlanta, and cash for the Fox affiliate KCPQ-TV in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribune also sold 1 million shares of America Online Inc. stock  
for a pretax gain of $95 million, or 45 cents. The gains gave it 
net income of $343.3 million, or $2.61 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Tribune's gains on operating profit came from strong  
returns from its 25 percent interest in the WB network. The joint 
venture with Time Warner has seen significant gains this year in 
audience share with such shows as ``Felicity,'' ``Dawson's Creek'' 
and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' The company also said syndication 
of ``Friends'' has brought strong returns at television stations in 
Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	In the publishing division, operating profit increased 4 percent  
to $103 million from $99 million last year, mostly due to retail 
and classified advertising revenue and lower newsprint prices, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides WGN, Tribune Broadcasting operates 16 television  
stations and four radio stations. In addition to the Tribune, it 
also publishes the Sun-Sentinel in South Florida, The Orlando 
Sentinel and the Daily Press of Hampton Roads, Va.

<HEADLINE> Hindsight Can Fool Fund Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As mutual fund investors have watched the Dow  
Jones industrial average break 10,000, it has been hard not to 
second-guess the diversification strategy in any fund portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	What am I doing, an investor may lament, with these  
going-nowhere international funds, these small-stock funds, these 
bond funds, these money-market funds? If I had just put all my 
money in funds that concentrate on solid U.S. blue chips, I'd be 
home free now. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips' advantages are plain for everyone to see: These  
companies can throw their weight around in the worldwide 
marketplace. They have proved they know how to succeed in all kinds 
of economic conditions. And they provide diversification on their 
own with their different lines of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking back, it's obvious that blue chips were the way to go.  
Why did I listen to the people who told me to spread my money 
around? 
</P>
<P>
	Such sentiments are all too human. The mind tends to confuse  
hindsight with insight, and to presume that whatever happens was 
the only thing that could have happened. Since the way things 
played out was inevitable, any smart person ought to have figured 
it out beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Before you berate yourself much in this manner, or start  
frantically shaking up your whole investment plan, remind yourself 
that neither you nor anybody else knew in advance how the economic 
history of the 1990s was going to unfold. Likewise, nobody knows 
now how the first decade of the 21st Century will go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is never that simple,'' says Paul Merriman, a Seattle  
adviser and money manager, in his newsletter FundAdvice.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think for a moment about the investment situation in Japan  
exactly 10 years ago. It was obvious then to anybody who read the 
newspapers that Japan was on a meteoric rise. Japan's economy, the 
second largest in the world, seemed to be on the brink of 
threatening the United States for the No. 1 position. 
</P>
<P>
	Merriman continues, ``Imagine you were an investor working and  
living in Japan 10 years ago. If you were prudent, you might have 
thought about buying some stocks in big U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would have been scoffed at. You might have been told,  
'There's no need to invest outside Japan. Everything you need is 
right here.' Investment risk was seen as an outdated, stodgy 
concept. Nirvana had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sound familiar? But a funny thing happened on the way to  
Nirvana. The average annualized Japanese stock fund return from 
1989 through 1998 was a loss of 3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``So today we give the same counsel to U.S. investors that  
millions of Japanese investors must wish they had heard and heeded 
10 years ago: Don't invest all your money in your own country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wait, you might object, the United States today is nothing like  
Japan of 10 years ago. Perhaps you're right. But that doesn't 
change the fact that the future remains unknowable, presenting an 
array of risks beyond anyone's ability to analyze. 
</P>
<P>
	The point of diversification is to protect against surprises.  
You don't want to bet all your money on a single outcome, and you 
don't need to take that kind of chance, unless you are sure that 
you want to go for a killing -- and are prepared to live with the 
consequences if you are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	To put it another way, return on investment is only one of  
several ends most investors want to pursue. They also want to 
preserve their principle, and to pursue their goals realistically, 
with a plan that gives them the best chance of getting where they 
want to go with the least possible exposure to risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The first step in being realistic is to acknowledge that the  
future is uncertain -- that surprises are very likely, no matter how 
hard you work at analyzing in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	But you don't want to let this uncertainty immobilize you,  
scaring you away from taking any chances whatsoever. So if growth 
is your objective, you invest in risky propositions like stocks -- 
and take advantage of the best protective measure available to you, 
which is diversification. 
</P>
<P>
	As Merriman told his clients, ``The most fundamental piece of  
investment advice I know can be summed up in one word: 
Diversify.''

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty in Pastor's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A man accused of shooting his pastor after a  
Bible class pleaded guilty today to aggravated murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Nance, 59, was charged in the shooting of the Rev.  
Andrew Lofton, 65, on Sept. 16 at Christ Temple Apostolic Faith 
Church in suburban Trotwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said religious differences between the two men may  
have been the motive. Nance and his attorney provided no more 
information about the motive during today's court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance had sat quietly during the Bible class, in which Lofton  
explained the Book of Revelation and urged his Bible students to 
prepare themselves for the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	He entered the plea before Montgomery County Common Pleas Judge  
Dennis Langer as part of a deal with prosecutors. Nance will 
receive a mandatory life term when Langer sentences him April 26. 
Nance would be eligible for parole after 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, prosecutors dropped a reference to use of a  
gun, which would have added at least three years to the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting had shocked Nance's neighbors, who described him as  
a kindhearted churchgoer who chauffeured his elderly friends on

often meeting with friends to study the Bible.

<HEADLINE> Titanic Explorer Seeks More Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``I believe that everyone sank to the bottom  
of the ocean crying bitter tears,'' says the Japanese veteran, 
mourning at the isolated Pacific Ocean site of the battle of 
Midway. 
</P>
<P>
	Five decades later, Yuji Akamatsu is reliving his part in the  
turning point for America in its Pacific campaign against Japan 
during World War II. He's here now on a mission of peace and 
history: traveling with Robert Ballard, the explorer who found 
Titanic, in a hunt for the lost ships of Midway. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ballard are U.S. veterans Bill Surgi and Harry Ferrier, and  
Haruo Yoshino, Akamatsu's shipmate. Their stories, as much as 
Ballard's search, are at the heart of TBS' gripping ``The Battle 
for Midway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film, part of ``National Geographic's Explorer'' series,  
debuts 8:05 p.m. EDT Wednesday. Exceptionally well written and 
strongly narrated by actor Peter Coyote, it was produced by 
Emmy-winning filmmakers Peter Schnall and Brian Breger. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentary deftly builds parallel tension -- over the  
outcome of the battle and the search for the USS Yorktown and the 
Japanese carrier Kaga -- as it cuts between an account of the battle 
and Ballard's painstaking quest. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget the 1976 star-studded Hollywood extravaganza ``Midway.''  
The brave men we see here are the real deal. So is the fiery battle 
footage, including some 16mm color film shot by famed director John 
Ford, who was at Midway as a Navy reservist. 
</P>
<P>
	We also get the memories of onetime enemies, the Japanese and  
Americans who clashed on June 4, 1942. Looking backward from the 
vantage point of age, they give the film a melancholy tone; this is 
the tragedy of war more than the glory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Battle for Midway'' opens with a sweeping view of an island  
cupped in the Pacific waters between Japan and Hawaii and far from 
both. The peaceful curve of land seems, at first glance, equally 
far from the fury of battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard to ignore the architecture of war in this place,''  
narrator Coyote says, and the camera pans over the bombed-out 
rubble of the Midway Islands U.S. military outpost to prove the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Five months after Japan's devastating December 1941 attack on  
the U.S. Navy at Pearl Harbor, a Japanese task force moved to 
finish the job on America's weakened forces with the Midway attack. 
</P>
<P>
	American code breakers, however, discovered the plan; U.S.  
carriers and aircraft were hastily mustered for a surprise attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle was furious. In its aftermath, the Yorktown was sunk  
(its 2,270 survivors rescued) along with the destroyer USS Hammann. 
But after Midway, U.S. forces were on the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard, who has led 110 ship-hunting expeditions, couldn't  
resist the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the pivotal battle. You can't do 'em all and if  
you're going to do any, you should do Midway,'' he said in an 
interview. ``There's also the challenge of finding an aircraft 
carrier in 17,000 feet of water, and coming out with the survivors 
and having them relive it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The search, which cost about $1 million, was funded by National  
Geographic and Newport News Shipbuilding of Virginia, the 
Yorktown's builder. Ballard calls support for such expeditions 
invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deep sea is a giant museum. It has more history in it than  
all of the museums of the world combined, and we are now only 
finding the Pyramids of the deep,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the documentary, he talks of the excitement of tracking  
history through the ocean's depths. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is like going to Gettysburg. This is like going to Bull  
Run. This is like going to Normandy. This is where a great chapter 
in human history, tragic in many ways, was played out on the stage. 
And we're on the stage right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And virtually in it. As he and his crew maneuver a  
remote-controlled exploration submersible vehicle, they get an 
intimate glimpse of the Yorktown and entombed history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ship has been sitting there half a century in silence. You  
shine your light in a window and it hits a mirror and reflects back 
at you. It's like a poltergeist ... like going into a haunted house 
with a flashback,'' Ballard recounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The clarity of the water surprised him: ``We could see all the  
way across the flight deck.'' The ship's name, painted on the 
stern, was still easily readable. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard compares his career-landmark find of the Titanic with  
the search for Yorktown. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a ship of war as opposed to innocent passage with  
children and women. There's a different emotion there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaze at the smiling faces of the young aviators in Ford's film,  
who look more like a high school softball team off to a game than 
soldiers off to war, and the loss seems just as painful. All save 
one died at Midway. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Compaq CEO: We Won't Change Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. President and Chief  
Executive Officer Eckhard Pfeiffer said Tuesday the world's largest 
personal computer maker would not change course despite stock 
prices that tumbled in the wake of an expected first-quarter 
earnings decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will not slow us down,'' Pfeiffer told about 4,500  
customers attending a Compaq-organized trade show. ``We will move 
forward aggressively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Compaq dove 22 percent Monday following the company's  
announcement after stock markets closed last week that its 
first-quarter earnings per share would amount to just half of what 
most Wall Street analysts were forecasting. The stock showed little 
improvement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``While market conditions will continue to be competitive, we  
fully intend to extend our business and grow market share and 
profitability in 1999,'' Pfeiffer said after emerging from an 
igloo-like geodesic dome and accompanied by a strobe light 
introduction on a theater stage at Houston's George R. Brown 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference later, he declined to discuss the financial  
performance of the Houston-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've given a number of comments...,'' he said. ``Until we  
have final results April 21, the company is in a quiet period and 
more specific questions we may not be able to answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Compaq's stock closed down 6 7/8 to 24. Over the past  
year, the stock had been as high as 51 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer has blamed decreased demand for business PCs, falling  
prices and customers choosing less-profitable products for the 
decline in profits. Analysts had been expecting 32 cents a share on 
sales topping $9.7 billion for the first quarter. Compaq is 
anticipating 15 cents a share on sales of $9.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	He sidestepped a question about whether he was selling or buying  
Compaq shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am significantly in Compaq stock, believe me,'' he said.  
``And if anybody has a key incentive to make Compaq stock move up, 
it's me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also defended Compaq's strategy to offer computers through a  
wide variety of sources, including retailers, while competitors 
like Dell and Gateway only make machines to order. 
</P>
<P>
	``The customer choice model is clearly superior,'' he said. ``If  
you're either one or the other, you're limiting yourself in your 
access and fulfillment to customers. The fact we're offering 
consumer product through retail channels, of which we have 12,000 
in the United States, is a convenience to the customer who wants to 
buy in the retail store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that, like its main rivals, Compaq also had the  
capability to handle specific customer requests from a direct PC 
web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that clarifies this,'' he said. ``In total, it reaches  
more customers, is more efficient at no more cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At ``Innovate Forum 99,'' Compaq's two-day Houston trade show,  
Pfeiffer touted the company's service availability and 
responsiveness to customers with a force of 27,000 technicians 
worldwide and said Compaq's goal was to be the Internet computing 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that the Internet will become the dominant means  
of doing business worldwide,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> News Execs Get High-Tech Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The news industry faces a dramatic shift in  
coming years and more and more readers turn to the Internet to get 
their information, technology leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anybody who picks up the newspaper anymore to get  
a stock price or to see which team won a game,'' Lawrence Kramer, 
founder of Internet news provider MarketWatch.com, told the 
American Society of Newspaper Editors on Tuesday at the 1999 
convention in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	News content will always be an important commodity, but the way  
stories are delivered is going to change dramatically, agreed Intel 
Corp. chairman Andy Grove. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three years from now, traditional newspapers are going to face  
an obvious profit squeeze,'' Grove said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based research firm Jupiter Communications found last  
year that 16 percent of online users had reduced their newspaper 
reading time to use the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech leaders told editors they have to move their content  
onto the Internet, make those stories interactive, and improve 
in-depth coverage in their print versions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to realize that the Internet is a whole new  
medium, not an extension of what you have been doing,'' said Cox 
Interactive Media vice president Hilary Goodall. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodall said Internet users like to respond to news stories,  
participate in virtual discussion groups and personalize news to 
their interests. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose Mercury News executive editor Jerome Ceppos, whose  
Silicon Valley-based newspaper has invested heavily in a widely 
used, interactive Web site, said newspaper leaders are trying to 
keep up with ``the collision of newspapers and technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, these changes won't be cheap, said Christian Hendricks,  
president of Nando Media, an Internet news provider. 
</P>
<P>
	``Publishers simply need to allocate more money to cover the  
news,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of the more than 500 newspaper executives attending  
the conference agreed, in a show of hands, that they can't afford 
not to prepare for the massive changes taking place as a result of 
the Internet.

	Kevorkian Gets 10 to 25 Years  
</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian has been sentenced to  
10 to 25 years in prison for the videotaped death of a man who had 
Lou Gehrig's disease. The 70-year-old retired pathologist was 
convicted last month of second-degree murder in the death of 
52-year-old Thomas Youk. Youk's death by injection was videotaped 
and shown on CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' Judge Jessica Cooper said, ``You 
had the audacity to go on national television, show the world what 
you did and dare the legal system to stop you. Well, sir, consider 
yourself stopped.'' Kevorkian also was sentenced to three to seven 
years for delivery of a controlled substance.

	Clinton: Strikes Grinding Down Serbs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that NATO  
airstrikes against Yugoslavia are ``diminishing and grinding down'' 
Serb forces, damaging Slobodan Milosevic's refineries, tanks and 
artillery and destroying half of his advanced MiG-29 fighter jets. 
Clinton said the bombing, in its third week, has reached a ``next 
level.'' He said he would ask Congress soon for an emergency 
supplemental appropriation to pay for the war costs. NATO military 
officials have requested about 300 more U.S. aircraft. 

</P>

	Serbs Pull Back From Albania  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces crossed into Albania  
today and briefly captured a border village, Albanian officials 
said, but withdrew hours later. Serb infantry troops exchanged 
gunfire with Albanian border police and seized control of Kamenica. 
Houses were reported on fire about a mile inside northeastern 
Albania. Yugoslavia denied its forces entered Albania, saying Serb 
forces were only defending the country's borders. In reaction to 
the reports, the State Department warned the Yugoslavs not to widen 
the war.

	Vatican Makes Kosovo Rape Stand  
</P>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Use of the ``morning after'' pill by rape  
victims is tantamount to abortion, a senior Vatican official said 
today, expressing church opposition to their distribution to Kosovo 
refugees by U.N. aid workers. He called the pill an ``abortion 
technique'' that should not be confused with contraceptives. The 
U.N. Population Fund last week said that it was providing emergency 
reproductive health kits for about 350,000 people. Reports of rape 
suffered by ethnic Albanian women, who are overwhelmingly Muslim, 
have been increasing in recent days.

	'80s Stamps To Depict Video Games  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans have chosen video games as the topic  
they most want to see on a postage stamp commemorating the 1980s. 
The fall of the Berlin Wall was a close second. Ballots were cast 
throughout February to choose 15 topics for stamps commemorating 
that decade, to be released in January. The set is one of 10 
recalling each decade of this century. Other stamps commemorating 
the 1980s will depict the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the movie 
``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' and the Cabbage Patch Kids.

	Promise for Pancreatic Cancer  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An immune-system booster derived from cow  
bile shows promise in early testing against pancreatic cancer, the 
deadliest of all malignancies. Though it is probably no cure for 
most patients, the drug, called Virulizin, seems to work about as 
well as the standard medicine with far fewer side effects. The next 
step will be to try giving them together. About 29,000 cases of 
pancreatic cancer are diagnosed yearly in the United States. Only 2 
percent of these patients survive a year.

	Canada Helping Seabirds From Oil  
</P>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Canada's coast guard and other federal agencies  
are escalating their fight against clandestine, deliberate oil 
spills that are killing tens of thousands of seabirds annually in 
busy shipping lanes off Newfoundland. Aerial surveillance is being 
increased, and authorities want to step up the pace of prosecutions 
and fines for the owners and operators of the ships. The coast 
guard estimates that oil spills annually kill 60,000 to 100,000 of 
the roughly 10 million seabirds that congregate off the 
Newfoundland coast each winter.

been one of the NHL's most sought-after free agents, agreed today 
to a three-year, $30 million contact extension with the Colorado 
Avalanche. Forsberg has 30 goals and 97 points this season. He was 
a first-round pick of Philadelphia in 1991 and was traded to Quebec

<HEADLINE> Food, Parties Mark Taxation Ritual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unable to put it off any longer, thousands of  
Americans will trudge to the post office Thursday to file their 
income taxes. In many places, they'll be greeted by a party. 
</P>
<P>
	Local radio stations and restaurants are providing music and  
goodies at dozens of post offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Some folks may even find a second job waiting.  
</P>
<P>
	In Laguna Beach, Calif., for example, producers of the ``Got  
Milk'' advertising campaign will offer screen tests to late filers 
who think they have star quality. 
</P>
<P>
	For those more trusting in luck, Virginia lottery officials will  
give out free scratch-off tickets in the ``Instant Refund'' game in 
Norfolk and Charlottesville. 
</P>
<P>
	For dedicated baseball fans, a mobile post office will be set up  
outside the ballpark in Phoenix, so they can drop off their taxes 
on the way to the game between the Dodgers and Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Angry taxpayers who want to exercise their throwing arms can go  
to Harrisburg, Pa., or Sacramento, Calif., where tax agents will be 
present in dunking tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	The patriotic or historically minded may want to mail their tax  
forms in Hartford, New Haven or Putnam, Conn.; Gainesville, Fla.; 
Greenville, Pa.; Bryan, Texas; or Clarksburg, W.Va. -- all of which 
claim that Uncle Sam will be present. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal officials say free food will be available at dozens of  
offices across the country, with donations being provided by local 
outlets of Pizza Hut, Chick-fil-A, Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
McDonald's and Bruegger's Bagels. 
</P>
<P>
	Music will be provided in various locations by barbershop  
quartets, local college bands and younger students. 
</P>
<P>
	A radio station in Bridgman, Mich., will offer aspirin to tax  
filers in that community, while in Pittsburgh a local drug store 
chain is providing samples of Mylanta. 
</P>
<P>
	And taxpayers in Harrisburg who aren't completely tapped out  
will also have the opportunity to donate to the Central 
Pennsylvania Blood Bank.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 75.48 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher Tuesday as enthusiastic  
investors extended a buying spree that pushed major indexes into 
record territory on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 75.48 at 10,414.99, after climbing 165.67 to an all-time high of 
10,339.51 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum,  
said today's gains were driven mainly by momentum from Monday's 
advance, which came despite a negative earnings warning from Compaq 
Computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Positive earnings reports also sent the market higher this  
morning, particularly in the financial services sector. Merrill 
Lynch was up 1 3/16 to 101 1/8, and PaineWebber was up 3 15/16 at 47 1/2, 
both after releasing strong earnings reports this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Hyman said, in a trend that began a few weeks ago but  
really picked up momentum Monday, market leadership has broadened 
beyond the technology sector and big-company stocks to 
smaller-company stocks, and that is raising optimism that the 
market could go even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secondary market is starting to show some life,'' Hyman  
said. ``The secondary markets have to participate'' in order for 
the market to go higher. Hyman noted that the Russell 2000 index of 
smaller companies was up 4.09, or 0.56 percent, at 739.41, in early 
trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices had fallen sharply in Monday's early trading after  
Compaq Computer warned that its first-quarter earnings would fall 
short of expectations. But investors used the lower prices as a 
buying opportunity, sent the market higher Monday afternoon, and 
continued moving it upward today. Compaq shares were up 7/16 to 24 1/2 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyman said the market was still anxiously awaiting the release  
of Intel's results after the closer of trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well today, also after  
making new highs Monday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 
1.76 at 1,360.40, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index 
was up 30.84 at 26,629.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the NYSE, where volume came to 265.76 million shares, up from 
Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.26 percent after  
Wall Street's historic run on Monday. In afternoon trading, 
Germany's DAX index was up 0.50 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
0.50 percent, but France's CAC-40 was down 0.32 percent.

<HEADLINE> NFL's Dwight To Run College Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Simply put, Tim Dwight would rather run  
track as a fifth-year senior for Iowa than earn endorsement money 
as a football player for the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one of the reasons Iowa track coach Larry Wieczorek is  
ecstatic that the former Hawkeye All-American football player is 
rejoining the track team this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa won the Big Ten 400-meter relay in 1998 with Dwight leading  
off, and he was second in the conference 100-meter dash last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's giving up a lot of money, I'm sure,'' Wieczorek said  
Tuesday at a news conference. ``He's a very hot item. He can be 
down in Atlanta right now, appearing every day somewhere, I can 
guarantee you that, and making money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight was to return to the Iowa track team last weekend at the  
Hayward Relays in Eugene, Ore., but had to scratch at the last 
minute because of hamstring cramps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going all the way out to Eugene, I told coach I felt like  
excess baggage out there because it's never happened to be before, 
two minutes before a race and I can't run,'' said Dwight, who 
claimed four Class 4A titles in the 200 meters, three in the long 
jump and one in the 400 hurdles while competing for Iowa City High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't run, but there's no way he was excess baggage, I  
guarantee you that,'' Wieczorek said. ``Just being around him is a 
great experience for our guys. He adds to our team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's helping us every day. They see him come out to practice  
and how hard he works and how disciplined he is. It's a great 
learning experience for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight said he'll be ready to run this weekend at the Mount Sac  
Relays in Walnut, Calif., and praised Falcons coach Dan Reeves for 
allowing him to come back to Iowa City to complete work for his 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight still has eight hours of internship work left at Iowa  
before completing his undergraduate degree, and he plans to do that

	``It's kind of nice to have a coach like that, of his stature,  
to give me that kind of opportunity and that kind of confidence -- 
that he trusts me,'' Dwight said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight almost couldn't compete because the NCAA had questions  
about endorsements and other outside payment he received from 
helping Atlanta reach the Super Bowl, where as a rookie he scored a 
touchdown and set a Super Bowl kick return record. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA eventually decided Dwight met eligibility requirements  
because the activities he received payment for were football 
related. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight said he was bitter toward the NCAA and thinks the  
organization may take a second look at some of its requirements.

	``Obviously they know as a professional you have other  
opportunities to make money off the field,'' he said. ``It was 
ridiculous.''

<HEADLINE> McDougal Acquitted on One Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Prosecutors say they will decide soon  
whether to retry Whitewater figure Susan McDougal after a jury 
deadlocked on two criminal contempt charges while acquitting her of 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a little numb,'' Mrs. McDougal said after the  
verdicts Monday. ``I've been indicted since 1993, and this is the 
first day I haven't been indicted in years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he was ``pleased to learn'' that Mrs.  
McDougal, his former friend and business partner, had been 
acquitted of obstruction of justice, said White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart. ``He wishes all the best for her and her family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was indicted after she refused twice to answer  
questions before the grand jury about the Clintons business 
dealings. She said she believed independent counsel Kenneth Starr 
was out to ``get'' the Clintons and would charge her with perjury 
if he didn't like her answers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Barrett said Starr anticipated making a decision  
this week on whether to seek a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a notorious case of someone basically being warned  
time and again and simply not answering questions,'' said Barrett. 
``I make no apologies for bringing this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense criticized Starr's tactics during the trial, and  
McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos challenged prosecutors to try his 
client again. ``They don't have the guts to retry this case again 
because now we know where the bodies are buried,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said if there is a retrial on the two criminal contempt  
counts, it is unlikely Mrs. McDougal would be allowed to again 
inject her allegations that Starr wanted her to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors planned to ask the court for permission to speak to  
the jurors before deciding whether to retry the case. The jury 
deadlocked 7-5 in favor of acquittal on the contempt counts. A 
sticking point apparently was the defense argument that Mrs. 
McDougal feared Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge instructed the jurors that they could consider whether  
Mrs. McDougal believed Starr wanted her to lie only in deciding the 
obstruction charge. But his instruction on the contempt charges 
allowed them to consider whether Mrs. McDougal ``willfully'' 
violated a court order by refusing to answer the questions. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the jurors who wanted to acquit Mrs. McDougal on all  
three counts, Michael Nance, said he believed she refused to 
testify because ``She honestly believed that she could be held for 
a false statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After eight hours and 45 minutes of deliberations, spread over  
three days, the jurors sent out a note at midday Monday saying they 
were ``hopelessly deadlocked'' on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal took the witness stand in her own defense at one  
point during the five-week trial, answering some of the same 
questions she refused to address in front of the grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal already had served 18 months in jail for civil  
contempt based on her refusal to answer grand jury questions. She 
also served 3 1/2 months of a two-year term on four felony convictions 
in her 1996 trial. Howard released her from prison because of a 
back problem before she finished serving her time on the felony 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent so many months in jail thinking that someday I'll get  
to tell the people the truth,'' Mrs. McDougal said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To OK Boost of NATO Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the Pentagon preparing to approve a NATO  
request for hundreds of additional U.S. warplanes to use against 
Yugoslavia, congressional leaders are urging their members not to 
rush to judgment on the divisive issue of ground troops in the 
Balkans conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's military commander, Army Gen. Wesley Clark, requested  
``several hundred'' more U.S. aircraft, and Defense Secretary 
William Cohen was expected to give quick approval, said defense 
officials, speaking Monday night on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The reinforcements would be in addition to the 500 U.S. aircraft  
already part of the 700-plane NATO force. The additional planes 
would include ground-attack jets, radar-jamming planes to disrupt 
Serb air defenses and refueling tankers to allow allied pilots to 
stay aloft longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to increase NATO's ability to attack to Yugoslav  
army and security forces in Kosovo,'' one official said. 
``Secretary Cohen has already said he is going to approve any 
request from General Clark for additional assets. I would 
anticipate that the request will be approved expeditiously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, meanwhile, was pressing its  
insistence that the conflict in the Balkans could be resolved by 
air power alone, despite a movement in Congress to arm Clinton with 
the ground troop option. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's too early to have that vote,'' House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said following a Monday night meeting with 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, advocates of authorizing ground troops were circulating  
language and pressing for an early vote as lawmakers returned from 
a two-week recess. Kosovo seemed destined to dominate discussion 
this week on Capitol Hill, even if no votes were planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 50-60 members of Congress, most of them from committees  
dealing with national security, were getting a White House briefing 
today from President Clinton. Cohen and other national security 
officials were to brief an even wider group of lawmakers at the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional and administration officials also said the  
administration would ask Congress this week for $2.5 billion to $3 
billion to pay for the conflict with Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton on Monday said the United States and its allies ``would  
like to nip this conflict in the bud before it destabilizes all of 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to military personnel and their families at Barksdale  
Air Force Base, La., Clinton said the United States was 
``determined to continue this mission'' and that Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic ``should be under no illusions that we will end 
it from weariness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress was joining the debate in earnest as new rounds of NATO  
attacks pounded Yugoslav fuel depots and heavy industry. Serb 
officials said at least 10 people aboard a Yugoslav passenger train 
were killed and 16 injured on Monday when NATO bombed a railroad 
bridge. The alliance expressed regret at the loss of civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other NATO foreign  
ministers, meeting for the first time Monday in Brussels, Belgium, 
since the three-week air campaign began, vowed to press ahead with 
the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	They discussed establishing a protectorate to shield the  
rebellious Serbian province from Milosevic's forces. The developing 
plan likely would be coupled with refusing to allow Yugoslav troops 
in Kosovo and would provide a way to support self-rule after a 
settlement of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic of what's  
left of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	After Monday night's White House meeting, Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he didn't think it was helpful for other 
members to be pressing for ground troops. But, he also said, ``I 
don't think we should preclude anything. ... I think we need to see 
how this thing progresses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and House Minority  
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., asserted that North Atlantic allies 
remain determined. ``Mr. Milosevic should understand that the NATO 
countries are united,'' Gephardt said. ``We want his troops to pull 
back out of Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties were divided on the ground-force issue -- although  
momentum appeared to be moving in favor of at least planning for 
such a contingency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything should be left on the table, including using ground  
forces in Kosovo. ... You don't want to preclude a legitimate 
option,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., back from a weekend 
tour of a refugee camp in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Armed Services  
Committee, and Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on 
the Foreign Relations Committee, on Monday were circulating a 
resolution giving the president ``the authority to use all 
necessary force'' to meet NATO's goals in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are advocates of planning for a possible ground operation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to push the ball down the court a little,''  
Biden said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Biden said he doubts the measure could win congressional  
passage as long as the Clinton administration contends the 
operation can succeed by air power alone.

<HEADLINE> Huang Asserts Fifth Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Democratic fund-raiser John Huang  
asserted his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination 
Tuesday and declined to answer questions in a civil lawsuit, a 
conservative legal group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang testified in a deposition for a freedom-of-information  
case filed by Judicial Watch. The organization contends that 
Clinton administration officials at the Commerce Department, where 
Huang once worked, gave seats on trade missions to heavy campaign 
contributors for the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Judicial Watch also asserts that while on the missions,  
officials came in contact with Chinese agents linked to illegal 
Democratic contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Klayman, head of Judicial Watch, said he asked Huang in a  
deposition whether he had provided truthful testimony earlier in 
the case and whether he had produced documents required by a 
subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang pleaded Fifth Amendment rights to both questions, Klayman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang's lawyer, Ty Cobb, was not immediately available for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The deposition will resume April 15.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Edge Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices edged up a modest 0.2 percent  
in March as falling food costs helped to offset the biggest 
increase in energy prices in more than two years, the Labor 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's increase in the Consumer Price Index was up  
slightly from 0.1 percent gains turned in for both January and 
February, but still showed that inflation is remaining under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second report, the Labor Department said retail sales rose  
a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in March, but that modest 
advance followed big upward revisions to sales in the two previous 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The January increase in retail sales -- which account for  
one-third of total economic activity -- was put at 1.3 percent. The 
February increase was revised up to 1.7 percent, the biggest 
monthly surge in five years, as consumers continue to spend with 
abandon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still very fortunate. We have awfully strong growth and  
very low inflation. You can't ask for anything better from the 
economy,'' said Cynthia Latta, economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination pleased Wall Street, where the Dow Jones average  
of industrial stocks pushed further into record territory today. At 
midmorning, the average was up 75 points to 10,414. Yields on 
30-year bonds held at Monday's late rate of 5.45 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, consumer inflation is rising at an annual rate  
of 1.5 percent, even better than the 1.6 percent price rise turned 
in for all of 1998, the best performance on the inflation front 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists are expecting prices will advance at a faster clip  
this year as the global economy begins to recover from last year's 
severe financial crisis and prices of commodities such as oil begin 
to rise as demand picks up. 
</P>
<P>
	The March inflation report showed that energy prices jumped 1.6  
percent in March. It was the first increase since a small 0.1 
percent rise last October and the biggest one-month gain in energy 
prices since December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices rose 3.7 percent in March, their biggest rise  
since August 1997. Analysts believe motorists will see more price 
pressures in the months ahead as refiners pass on the costs of a 27 
percent surge in crude petroleum prices following the decision of 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut back on 
production in an effort to firm up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	For March, the big gain in energy prices was partially offset by  
a 0.2 percent fall in food costs, the biggest one-month drop in 
this category since September 1997. The price declines were led by 
a 5.5 percent plunge in the vegetable prices. The price of tomatoes 
dropped by 6.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.2 percent rise in overall inflation was slightly below  
analysts expectations. They had been looking for a 0.3 percent jump 
in March because of the rapid run-up in energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of the volatile energy and food categories, inflation  
was well-behaved with the so-called core inflation rate rising just 
0.1 percent, matching the small increases recorded in January and 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline fares should a big gain last month, rising by 4.7  
percent. Throughout the first three months of this year, airline 
fares are up by 41.8 percent at an annual rate, the sharpest 
increase for any of the major categories in the CPI. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical care costs rose 0.2 percent in March and are up 3.3  
percent at an annual rate through the first three months. Housing 
costs climbed 0.2 percent and are up at a rate of 1.2 percent 
through March. 
</P>
<P>
	While economists believe that rising energy costs will add  
probably 0.6 percentage point to overall inflation this year, they 
look for price pressures to remain well-behaved in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	If that forecast is correct, it should give the Federal Reserve  
the leeway to leave interest rates unchanged. Normally, at this 
advanced stage of an economic expansion the Fed would be raising 
interest rates to fight growing inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	However, even though the unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent  
last month, the lowest level since February 1970, wage pressures 
and overall inflation have remained well contained.

phone operator's new Internet access site, the companies announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, the Internet's leading search and directory service, and  
SmarTone refused to put a value on the deal that will allow 
SmarTone mobile phone users to access iSmart, the Internet service 
to be launched next week. 
</P>
<P>
	iSmart will give SmarTone a means to compete with services  
offered by Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., the territory's 
largest telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in SmarTone rose 3.5 percent on Tuesday to close at 25.10  
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $3.21), following a 7.1 percent rise on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition in the mobile phone market is stiff, with some 3  
million of Hong Kong's 6.8 million residents owning mobile phones. 
SmarTone offers its users a variety of services including traffic 
speed trap updates, stock quotes and trading via mobile phone and 
news updates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal with Yahoo!, SmarTone users will eventually be able  
to access the service through their mobile phones, executives said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yahoo! partnership with SmarTone is not an exclusive  
deal, said Savio Chow, Asia managing director for Yahoo!. Yahoo!, 
based in Santa Clara, California, will be looking to cooperate with 
other companies in Hong Kong and Asia in the future, co-founder 
Jerry Yang said at a news conference without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet activities have been heating up recently in Hong Kong.  
</P>
<P>
	British Telecommunications PLC last week said that it was  
investing 3.02 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $387 million) to buy

<HEADLINE> 1980s: Video Games, Berlin Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans have chosen video games as the topic  
they most want to see on a postage stamp commemorating the 1980s. 
The fall of the Berlin Wall was a close second. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballots were cast throughout February to choose 15 topics for  
stamps commemorating that decade, to be released in January. The 
set is one of 10 recalling each decade of this century. 
</P>
<P>
	A Postal Service advisory committee picked subjects for the  
first five decades of the century and the public has now voted on 
subjects for the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Subjects for the 
1990s will be selected during nationwide balloting scheduled for 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Celebrate The Century program continues to give the  
American public a voice in how the 20th century will be remembered 
in years to come,'' Postmaster General William Henderson said in a 
statement. ``Once this one-of-a-kind collection of stamps is 
completed next year, it will serve as a unique chronicle of 
American history, providing decade-by-decade glimpses of our past, 
as we head into the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s voting, video games collected 268,746 votes to  
become first choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of the Berlin Wall earned 265,147 votes and Washington's  
Vietnam Veterans Memorial was third with 258,515. Fourth was the 
movie ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' with 239,189 votes, and 
Cabbage Patch Kids were fifth at 207,505. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the 1980s stamps will be personal computers, 205,527  
votes; compact discs, 199,925; figure skating, 198,841; ``The Cosby 
Show,'' 194,517; cable TV, 190,533; the National Football League's 
San Francisco 49ers, 188,845; American hostages freed in Iran, 
182,784; Space Shuttle program, 177,138; the Broadway show, 
``Cats,'' 169,357 and hip-hop culture, 158,509. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, 1998, the public voted on which subjects would  
best commemorate the 1970s. The yellow smiley face topped that 
voting, followed closely by ``Sesame Street,'' disco music and 
Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1960s stamps were voted on in May, 1998. Winners included  
the first Moon walk, the integrated circuit, lasers and Martin 
Luther King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Stamp subjects for the 1950s were determined by popular vote in  
February, 1998. The public's top choices were drive-in movies, teen 
fashions, cars with tail fins and chrome and 3-D movies.

<HEADLINE> Gas Leads Energy Futures Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gasoline futures rose sharply Tuesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange ahead of weekly inventory figures that were expected to 
show driving demand is increasing. Other energy futures also 
gained. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, wheat futures retreated, while corn and  
soybeans advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline jumped ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's late  
release of its weekly inventory figures, which market participants 
were betting would detail a decline of as much as 2 million 
barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	But the API report, which was released after markets closed  
Tuesday, showed that U.S. crude oil stocks rose 1.039 million 
barrels last week to 343.191 million barrels. Gasoline stocks rose 
3.066 million barrels to 218.506 million barrels. Refineries 
operated at 96.8 percent capacity, up from 94.8 the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are closely watching weekly inventory figures for  
signs the world's top oil producers are serious about cutting 
supplies and boosting prices above $17 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and  
other key producers say they began on April 1 to slash a combined 
2.1 million barrels daily from world supplies. To that end, 
investors were predicting crude supplies last week also fell by as 
much as 2 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil analysts say if world producers meet about 70 percent of the  
target cuts, prices likely would rise above $18 a barrel and remain 
there at least through the peak summer driving period when U.S. and 
European refineries are working to meet heavy demand from increased 
leisure travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also received underlying support from the continuing NATO  
bombings of targets in Yugoslavia. There are some fears the 
extended air campaign might provoke Russia into some kind of 
military action.

<HEADLINE> Gates To Donate $20 Million to MIT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology is getting $20 million richer, courtesy of Microsoft 
mogul Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will fund a new computer lab building, to be named  
after Gates, at the institute's Laboratory for Computer Science, 
MIT President Charles Vest announced today. The funds come from the 
William H. Gates III foundation, run by the software giant's 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great idea. It's great to be here. I hope this facility  
gets done as soon as possible,'' Gates said during a talk at the 
institute this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to look back at how we're doing things today and  
we're going to view it as very primitive in 10 years,'' he told a 
crowd of about 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	MIT, he said, will continue to be a leader in software and  
computer development. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates has given $6.5 billion to his two charitable foundations  
since 1994. The foundations then give money to schools and other 
causes.

<HEADLINE> NATO Targets Yugoslav Oil Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Aiming to bring the Yugoslav war  
machine to a halt by wiping out fuel supplies, NATO planes early 
today targeted the country's biggest oil refinery for the second 
time in 24 hours, along with military installations and transport 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance has said Yugoslav air defenses remain a formidable  
threat, and frequent flashes of anti-aircraft fire lit the sky as 
NATO planes flew in waves over Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacks continued well into daylight hours today. Four big  
detonations were heard at midmorning in the Kosovo capital of 
Pristina, with first reports indicating military barracks were 
being targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Western military officials, meanwhile, moved to beef up the NATO  
air armada. In Washington, defense officials said they were 
planning to send several hundred more U.S. warplanes -- including 
ground-attack jets, radar-jamming planes and refueling tankers -- to 
join in the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has said it is doing everything possible to avoid civilian  
casualties, but Monday saw one of the more gruesome episodes of the 
3-week-old air campaign -- an apparently accidental hit on a 
passenger train that turned it to a heap of twisted, charred metal. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance said the intended target was the rail bridge the  
train was on at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb officials said at least 10 passengers were killed and 16  
injured in what they called a ``criminal attack.'' Reporters 
brought by Yugoslav authorities to the rural scene, about 180 miles 
south of Belgrade, described scattered human limbs, smashed rail 
carriages and the stench of burning flesh. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO expressed regret over any loss of civilian life, but vowed  
to continue the bombing campaign until Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic withdraws his forces from Kosovo and accepts a peace plan 
calling for the presence of an international force. 
</P>
<P>
	The composition of that force is still being discussed, and the  
allies are making a point of telling Russia it is welcome to join. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was meeting Russian Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov today in Oslo, seeking to bridge a growing 
rift between NATO and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has sharply criticized the bombing campaign, which the  
allies launched in a bid to halt attacks by Serb forces on Kosovo's 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half a million Kosovars have fled the province in the  
past three weeks. Ethnic Albanians continued to trickle out today, 
though in much small numbers than the enormous exodus in the early 
days of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, refugees have described what appeared to be  
concerted efforts by the Serb military to clear areas including 
border zones of ethnic Albanians, possibly to make way for 
fortification against any ground attack. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Macedonian border, a group of more than 500 refugees  
crossed over this morning, telling of being forced from homes 
across the frontier. One of the arrivals, Azemine Seka, wept as she 
described the torching of her home in a village near the southern 
Kosovo town of Urosevec. 
</P>
<P>
	Using airstrikes, the allies hope to reduce the movement of  
Yugoslav troops, particularly in and out of Kosovo, by cutting off 
military fuel supplies. Fuel supplies for civilians are already 
running low throughout Yugoslavia, and strict rationing of gasoline 
and diesel are already in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest wave of strikes at fuel-related targets:  
</P>
<P>
	--Yugoslavia's biggest oil refinery, at Pancevo just across the  
Danube from Belgrade, was hit late Monday and again early today, 
local officials said. Strong explosions were heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Pancevo regional civil defense headquarters had said Monday that  
raids the previous night caused more than half a billion dollars 
damage, incapacitating it for a ``period of some length,'' the 
state-run Tanjug news agency reported. The refinery had produced 
more than 100,000 barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
	--Six NATO missiles hit an oil depot and plastics factory today  
near Kosovo's capital, Pristina, setting a fuel reservoir ablaze, 
Tanjug said. More than 15 missiles rained down on southeastern 
regions of the city early today, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	--Fire lit the night sky in Smederevo, central Serbia, late  
Monday and early today after NATO missiles targeted an industrial 
zone housing installations of the state fuel giant Jugopetrol, 
according to Tanjug. 
</P>
<P>
	--Northern targets included an oil depot outside Sombor, and  
another major refinery at Novi Sad, local media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Military installations, too, were targeted. Studio B radio said  
a barracks in a residential Belgrade suburb was hit and that one 
person was injured in the attack, which smashed all the windows in 
a nearby medical complex. 
</P>
<P>
	South of Serbia's central Kraljevo region, a rustic hotel  
complex in the winter-summer resort of Mt. Kopaonik was wrecked, 
according to the local radio. The likely target was a nearby radar 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Strikes on transport targets included attacks in the Krusevac  
area, 110 miles southeast of Belgrade, where a bridge spanning the 
Rasina River on a secondary road to Pristina was blasted, Tanjug 
said. The area had been hammered two nights previously by strikes 
that wrecked a heating plant and a heavy-machine factory. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearby Ladjevci airport was also hit overnight, Serb media  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, fighting between Serb forces and Kosovo rebels was  
reportedly intensifying along Albania's northern border. Serb 
artillery fire on Monday struck the Albanian border village of 
Kamenica, hit several times in recent days, according to 
international monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug claimed at least 150 members of the rebel Kosovo  
Liberation Army were killed in a border clash -- if true, the 
highest single death toll in months.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Remember Holocaust Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- As a two-minute siren sounded across the  
nation, traffic ground to a halt today and Israelis stood in 
silence in schools and offices to remember the 6 million Jews 
killed in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 refugees from Kosovo stood at attention after  
their hosts explained the meaning of the siren, one of the central 
events of Holocaust Remembrance Day. The refugees, who arrived 
Monday, are being housed in a nature retreat on the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	In Stenkovec, Macedonia, near the Kosovo border, relief workers  
at an Israeli army field hospital held an impromptu ceremony to 
remember a tragedy that for many resonated with events unfolding in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout Israel, cars pulled to the side of the road,  
pedestrians paused on crosswalks and radio and TV broadcasts 
stopped until the wail of the siren faded. 
</P>
<P>
	At Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial, visitors bowed their  
heads near a statue commemorating the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. Among 
those paying their respects were Holocaust survivors, including 
some wearing yellow stars pinned to their chests, similar to those 
the Nazis made them wear as a badge of shame. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those wearing a star made of yellow construction paper,  
with the word ``Jude'' -- or ``Jew'' in German -- scribbled on it, 
was Sarah Chlamanovitch Geffen, 68, who narrowly escaped death in 
the Stutthof concentration camp in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was at the door next to the crematorium when they said  
enough, there is no more room,'' she said. ``That's why I am alive 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yad Vashem officials issued a plea today for survivors to come  
forward and fill out so-called pages of testimony for friends and 
relatives who perished in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Each page of testimony lists a name and includes details of the  
victim's life and death. The museum is trying to collect and 
computerize names of the victims. So far, it has 3 million names. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone center set up to answer questions about submitting  
testimony has received more than 6,000 phone calls since the 
campaign began last week. A World Wide Web site gives friends and 
relatives instructions on how to fill out the forms. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300,000 Holocaust survivors live in Israel, a country  
of 6 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Restaurants and places of entertainment were closed out of  
respect today, and radios and TVs broadcast solemn music and 
programs about the Holocaust.

<HEADLINE> Judge Upholds Hubbell Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge gave Independent Counsel  
Kenneth Starr a pretrial victory Tuesday, dismissing a defense 
challenge to the fraud indictment of presidential friend Webster 
Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also signaled a likely delay in the June trial date of  
Hubbell, once an associate attorney general in the Justice 
Department. The case results from law work Hubbell and his former 
law partner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, did on an Arkansas land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Robertson ruled that the indictment  
did not result from documents produced by Hubbell under an immunity 
agreement with Starr. Hubbell's lawyers had argued the case was 
tainted by Starr's use of the documents, part of a separate case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied the grand jury that indicted Mr. Hubbell was not  
exposed to any'' of the material produced under the immunity grant, 
the judge said in an oral ruling during a pretrial hearing. ``It's 
also clear the investigation leading to the indictment ... was 
active and was ongoing'' before Hubbell produced the documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office also sought, and won, a halt to much of the  
pretrial work while the prosecutors pursue an appeal to the judge's 
dismissal of a major count against Hubbell in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissed count accused Hubbell of scheming to conceal work  
done by him and Mrs. Clinton, his former law partner, on a failed 
Arkansas land deal known as Castle Grande. Robertson agreed with 
Hubbell's lawyers that the allegations were too vague. 
</P>
<P>
	While Robertson said he would not immediately postpone the June  
14 trial date, he conceded ``the likelihood'' of a delay while the 
appeal is pursued. ``I will predict the case will not go to trial 
as scheduled in June,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson postponed a Wednesday deadline that would have  
required Starr's office to turn over its witness list to the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell still remains accused of fraudulent actions in the land  
deal, including making ``false and fraudulent'' statements and 
representations to U.S. banking regulators. The indictment refers 
36 times to Mrs. Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Brokerage Profits Beat Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Paine Webber Group Inc.  
reaped the benefits of the Dow industrials' race past 10,000, with 
the brokerages on Tuesday reporting first-quarter profits that 
easily exceeded Wall Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results confirm that these companies, as well as the  
industry, have recovered from the turbulence that rocked the 
financial-services companies'' in late 1998, said Michael A. 
Flanagan, a brokerage industry analyst with Financial Service 
Analytics. 

</P>
<P>
                         *Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch reported its first-quarter profits rose 18.4  
percent on record trading commissions and renewed strength in the 
global bond business. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment firm earned $609 million, or $1.44 a share, in  
the first quarter, compared to $514 million, or $1.26 a share, a 
year earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected 
Merrill Lynch to earn $1.22 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 10.6 percent to $5.27 billion from $4.76 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch said record levels of commissions, asset  
management and portfolio service fees, and net interest contributed 
to the strong revenue growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissions rose 7 percent to $1.57 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch's global bond and stock businesses grew by 14  
percent and 15 percent respectively from the first quarter of 1998, 
providing further evidence of the company's recovery from the 
global financial crises that derailed profits last fall and 
prompted it to cut 3,400 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch said client assets reached a record $1.5 trillion  
at the end of the first quarter, an increase of $122 billion from 
the comparable period in 1998, and $36 billion higher than at the 
close of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from investment banking was the only real laggard in  
Merrill's first quarter, sliding 24 percent to $633 million. The 
company cited an industrywide slowdown in the issuing of new 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch remains the leading underwriter of debt and equity  
securities, with 16 percent of the U.S. market share, according to 
Securities Data Corp. But analysts said some rival investment banks 
have been more successful at securing deals from the high-flying 
technology firms that have driven the market's dramatic rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch increased its focus on the Internet in the first  
quarter, introducing online trading and acquiring the assets of 
D.E. Shaw Financial Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``This quarter's results show the full-service brokerage  
industry is not being overly impacted by the online trading 
businesses,'' said Flanagan, the analyst, adding that the online 
brokerages are expected to gain ground as more U.S. investors 
embrace the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Merrill Lynch slipped $2.56 1/4, or by 2.6 percent, to  
$97.37 1/2 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts 
suggested investors may have zeroed in on weaker investment banking 
revenue, and a trader said the stock may have fallen on rumors 
Merrill Lynch may be considering an acquisition of discount broker 
Charles Schwab. 
</P>
<P>
	A Merrill Lynch spokesman did not immediately return a call  
seeking comment on the takeover speculation. 

</P>
<P>
                       *Paine Webber Group Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber easily beat analysts' estimates as higher  
commission fees and asset management revenues boosted first-quarter 
profit 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage earned $160.6 million, or $1.01 a share, in the  
quarter that ended March 31, up from $120.7 million, or 77 cents a 
share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call expected Paine Webber to earn 73  
cents and shares of Paine Webber shot up $4.04 1/4, or by 9.3 percent, 
to $47.62 1/2 a share on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber had net revenue of $1.31 billion, up 18 percent  
from $1.11 billion in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth was fueled by higher commissions from trading stocks  
and bonds as Americans continued pouring money into the market. 
Revenue from commissions totaled $478.9 million, an increase of 17 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber also profited from a 50 percent increase in net new  
client assets, which averaged $155 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Asset management revenue rose 30 percent in the quarter.  
</P>
<P>
	Like many of its rivals, including Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber  
has increased its efforts to attract Web-savvy investors. In the 
first quarter, the brokerage had 85,685 households signed on as 
members of its online client service, up from approximately 71,000 
in the previous quarter and 43,000 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clients may now access account information over the Internet,  
but Paine Webber won't introduce online trading until the third 
quarter.

<HEADLINE> Pollen Affecting Allergy Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A lack of rain has sent a steady, miserable  
stream of allergy sufferers to Atlanta-area doctors' offices as 
pollen readings soar to levels not seen in years. 
</P>
<P>
	The airborne pollen particles exceeded 6,000 grains per cubic  
millimeter Monday, a particularly nasty day during a spring that's 
already had a lot of sniffling, sneezing, wheezing, rasping and 
watering eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``(People) keep on sneezing until they get exhausted,'' said  
Fauzia Durrani, a Valdosta allergist who has been administering to 
pollen victims for two decades. ``They feel like they have a fever, 
but they don't have a fever. They're just so tired from the 
sneezing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the pollen allergic, the body perceives pine, oak and maple  
emissions as yet another invading germ and reacts accordingly, 
flooding the sinuses and tear ducts with mucus to flush the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like having a cold. Sometimes a real bad cold,'' said  
Dennis Ownby, a pediatric allergist at the Medical College of 
Georgia in Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	While some people's discomfort is generally no worse than seeing  
their cars glazed yellow with pine pollen, others require weekly 
injections to control sensitivity to pollens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh gosh, it's been a really bad week,'' accountant Beth  
Schnurmann said as she received two injections at the Atlanta 
Allergy and Asthma Clinic. ``The whole side of my face swells up, 
my eyes itch. It's bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A mild winter is generally blamed for the heavy pollen  
production and spring growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trees and the pollen-producing plants are fairly healthy  
coming into this spring,'' said David Tanner, an allergist at the 
Atlanta clinic.

<HEADLINE> Yoko Ono Sues Lennon's Ex-Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yoko Ono continued a long feud with a former  
assistant to John Lennon, suing him Tuesday and claiming he stole 
priceless personal items after the ex-Beatle was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a federal lawsuit, Ono contends that the former aide, Fred  
Seaman, agreed in 1983 to return boxes of Lennon's personal items 
but has held on to hundreds of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was prompted by Seaman's claim in a February letter  
to Capitol Records that a photograph of Lennon with his son Sean, 
overlooking a beach in Bermuda, was improperly included in a 
recently released compact disc box set. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman said he shot the photograph and calls Capitol's use of it  
``an egregious'' copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol sued Seaman separately on Tuesday, seeking a declaration  
that the photograph does not infringe on any copyright rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman did not return a telephone message left at his Brooklyn  
residence. A lawyer for Ono did not return a telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman provided extensive material for celebrity biographer  
Albert Goldman's unflattering portrayal of Lennon and in 1991 
published his own book. Although it was kinder in its descriptions 
of Lennon, Seaman's book portrayed Ono as an adulterous heroin 
addict. 
</P>
<P>
	Ono's lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, said that after  
Lennon was shot to death in 1980 outside his Manhattan apartment, 
Seaman routinely took shopping bags full of documents and personal 
items from the Lennons. 
</P>
<P>
	The items included unreleased recordings, paintings, love  
letters, a novella by Lennon titled ``Skywriting by Word of 
Mouth,'' and Lennon's journals from 1975 until he was killed, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman pleaded guilty in 1983 to stealing four journals and was  
sentenced to five years' probation. He promised to return all items 
that he wrongfully took, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Seaman returned several boxes of personal items,  
including family pictures, Lennon's journals and many of his 
private letters, Ono contends Seaman is now showing off hundreds of 
other Lennon family photographs, even in a recent television 
special and in several books.

	Starr To Oppose Counsel Act  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, whose  
investigation of President Clinton revived a debate over special 
prosecutors, will tell Congress he opposes renewing the law that 
put him in power, The Associated Press has learned. Starr is to 
testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee tomorrow. 
He submitted prepared remarks against renewing the Independent 
Counsel Act, said officials familiar his written testimony. They 
said Starr opposes the law because, for one thing, he feels it 
violates the constitutional separation of powers between the 
executive and judicial branches.

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian, 70, was sentenced  
today to 10 to 25 years in prison in the death of a Lou Gehrig's 
disease patient. Judge Jessica Cooper lectured the euthanasia 
crusader, saying ``No one, sir, is above the law. No one.'' The 
death of Thomas Youk was videotaped and shown by CBS-TV's ``60

appeals his murder conviction.

	Pentagon Set To Call Reserves  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a major buildup of American air power in  
the Balkans, U.S. military reservists will probably be ordered to 
active duty, officials said today. ``There will likely be a reserve 
call-up,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. ``The details 
aren't ready to be announced at this stage,'' including how many 
would be called, how soon, and for what tasks. Several hundred Air 
National Guard members already are participating as volunteers. But 
300 additional planes are expected to be sent to Europe. There 
currently are about 22,000 active-duty U.S. forces involved in the 
NATO operation against Yugoslavia.

	BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) -- After crossing into northern  
Albania, Serb forces today fought for an hour with Albanian troops, 
seized a border hamlet and torched homes before withdrawing, 
Albanian officials and international observers said. Washington 
warned that Yugoslavia, under air attack by NATO in the Kosovo 
conflict, would make a grave mistake in expanding the fighting. 
Sokol Gjoka, an Albanian Foreign Ministry official, said his 
country would defend itself, ``in close coordination with our 
allies.'' Yugoslavia denied any incursion into Albania.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal food inspectors declared unfit for  
human consumption 21 million pounds of meat and poultry produced by 
the same Arkansas plant from which 30 million pounds of meat 
products were recalled three months ago. The meat, products of the 
Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City, Ark., plant, was being housed in 
warehouses and waiting to be shipped to distributors, the 
Agriculture Department's food safety and inspection service said. 
It said people should check their refrigerators for products 
bearing the codes ``EST 13529'' or ``EST P-13529.'' Those products 
should be returned.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- First-quarter profits at Intel Corp., the  
world's largest maker of personal computer chips, rose 57 percent, 
beating Wall Street forecasts amid cost-cutting and an 18 percent 
rise in revenue. However, Intel said it expected second-quarter 
revenue to stay the same or fall slightly from its first-quarter 
revenue of $7.1 billion, citing ``seasonal factors'' in the 
microprocessor business. In after-hours trading, Intel dropped to 
$57.75 a share.

such as a car wreck or the death of a loved one. A group of 112

<HEADLINE>  Avalanche Signs Forsberg for $30M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Locking up one of their stars for several more  
seasons, the Colorado Avalanche on Tuesday signed All-Star forward 
Peter Forsberg to a three-year, $30 million contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which begins next season, will pay Forsberg $8 million  
in the first year, $9 million the second year and $9.5 million the 
final year, according to sources close to the team. It also 
includes a $3.5 million bonus prorated over the three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Forsberg, one of the NHL's top scorers and most  
imaginative skaters, is earning $6 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The new contract elevates Forsberg to a level just shy of the  
elite wage-earners in the NHL, such as Philadelphia's Eric Lindros, 
Phoenix's Keith Tkachuk and Florida's Pavel Bure, who are paid in 
the $10-$12 million range. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg shrugged off suggestions he might have been able to  
command more money by declaring for free agency this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have waited until after the season,'' Forsberg said,  
``but I decided to sign here because I like it here and I want to 
keep playing here. I've been having a great time since I got here. 
I didn't see any reason to wait until the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This organization has shown a commitment by signing long-term  
deals with Joe (Sakic), Patty (Patrick Roy) and Adam (Foote). We've 
got a good chance to go far in the playoffs this year, and we're 
going to be good in the future. I wanted to be a part of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Forsberg has matched his career high in goals (30)  
and has a total of 97 points, his highest total since the 1995-96 
season when he posted 116 points in helping lead the Avalanche to 
the Stanley Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	His value to the Avalanche as a goal-scorer is evident in the  
club's 69-10-12 record over the last four seasons when he scores a 
goal. He was the NHL's rookie of the year in 1994-95 with the 
Quebec Nordiques, and has been an All-Star in each of the past four 
seasons since the franchise moved to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for Peter,'' Roy said. ``For me, there's nothing  
better than that. I want to play the rest of my career with Peter 
in the lineup, and now I don't have to worry about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next goal of Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix is to  
sign Theo Fleury, the high-scoring forward whom the team acquired 
in a trade with Calgary earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peter is one of the best players in the game,'' Fleury said.  
``He's extremely skilled and he brings a lot to the table every 
night. I think it's great he signed. He deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a real positive for the organization. They've got a  
nice nucleus of guys here. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I want to concentrate on hockey right now. The reason I  
came here is to help this team win a Stanley Cup. We don't need to 
be talking about whether I'm going to sign here or not. That will 
sort itself out. The future of this organization right now is the 
playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix gave no indication he intended to reach an agreement  
with Fleury before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	As for Forsberg, Lacroix said Avalanche ownership ``since we  
moved to Denver has always made the commitment that they were going 
to be supportive in order to keep an exciting product on the ice. 
This is further proof of that commitment. It clearly shows our 
ownership's intention of having a very competitive hockey club for 
the coming seasons in the Pepsi Center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new arena is scheduled to open in October.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Ascent Entertainment is looking to sell the franchise,  
Lacroix said he doubted the sale would affect any future 
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> King World Gets Earnings Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Hollywood Squares'' helped give leading TV  
syndicator King World Productions Inc. a 17 percent earnings boost 
in the second quarter, the company reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	King World, which recently agreed to be acquired by CBS Corp.  
for $2.5 billion, earned $39.3 million, or 53 cents per share, for 
the three months ending Feb. 28. That was up from $33.6 million, or 
44 cents per share, for the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``Hollywood Squares,'' King World also  
distributes ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of 
Fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations. The  
company's stock rose 31 1/4 cents to $35.18 3/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were up 14 percent, to $197.5 million from $173.9  
million. The increase was attributed chiefly to the September 
premiere of ``The Roseanne Show'' and ``Hollywood Squares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``The Roseanne Show'' has not prospered, ``Hollywood  
Squares'' is the top new daily syndicated program. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the new revenues offset losses from the  
cancellation of ``American Journal'' and poorer performance by 
``Inside Edition,'' which remains the top syndicated news magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' was the company's biggest moneymaker,  
accounting for nearly half of its revenues.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Public Safety Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police, firefighters and other public safety  
officers who perform acts of heroism would be eligible for a new 
honor -- a Medal of Valor -- under a bill the House passed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill creates an 11-member review board that would solicit  
and review nominations for the medals. It also would create a 
National Medal office within the Department of Justice to run the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medal of Valor would recognize and reward ``too often unsung  
acts of valor committed by public safety officers,'' said Rep. Bill 
McCollum, R-Fla., the measure's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the board would be appointed by the president and by  
Congress to four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed 412-2, requires the attorney general to consult  
with the Institute of Heraldry within the Defense Department on the 
appropriate design, shape, size and color of the medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office estimates the program will cost  
about $250,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a similar measure last year, but the Senate did  
not vote on it before the 105th Congress adjourned. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 46.

<HEADLINE> RJR Nabisco To Buy Back Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. has offered to buy  
back nearly $4.8 billion in notes, bonds and preferred stock with 
proceeds from its recent deal to sell its international tobacco 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyback will eliminate most of RJR Nabisco's $5 billion in  
outstanding debt, and facilitate the company's reorganization which 
includes a plan to spin off its domestic tobacco business to its 
shareholders. The nation's second-biggest tobacco company makes 
Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco would be left with its 80.6 percent stake in Nabisco  
Holdings Corp., the maker of Oreo cookies, Planters nuts and Ritz 
crackers. Nabisco carries an additional debt of about $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the tender offer, holders of RJR debt and  
preferred stock would receive a premium for redeeming the 
securities early, if they agree to the offer quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments will vary according to the type of security being  
redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
	The holders of the securities also will get an additional  
payment for consenting to let RJR waive conditions it accepted when 
selling the securities. Among other things, RJR had agreed not to 
have its tobacco company borrow money on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyback also depends on completion of the sale of the  
international tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR agreed in March to sell its international tobacco business  
to Japan Tobacco Co., Japan's largest tobacco company, for $7.8 
billion in cash. Japan Tobacco is also assuming $200 million in 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the completion of the sale, RJR plans to spin off its  
domestic R.J. Reynolds Tobacco business to its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR officials say the tobacco and food businesses will fare  
better separately. They say the legal problems faced by the tobacco 
business have depressed the stock market's valuation of the food 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Icahn, a onetime corporate raider who holds about 7.7  
percent of RJR stock, is waging a proxy fight for control of the 
RJR board, which is to be elected at the May 12 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants the company to spin off its Nabisco holdings to  
shareholders instead of spinning off the domestic tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, RJR Nabisco was  
up 6 1/4 cents at $25.06 1/4 a share while Nabisco Holdings was down 
$1.18 3/4 at $41.37 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Fla., Ala., Sue Federal Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida officials have sued the federal  
government, seeking to block new rules they fear could lead to Las 
Vegas-style casinos on the state's Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, which Alabama joined as a co-plaintiff, came in  
response to rules approved Monday that allow Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt to settle gambling-related disputes that tribes can't 
work out with the states. 
</P>
<P>
	In such an impasse, Babbitt would act as a final judge. Such  
cases include current plans for casinos by Florida's Seminole and 
Miccousukee tribes; both tribe's proposals have been resisted by 
state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In filing the suit, Attorney General Bob Butterworth said  
Babbitt's newly granted powers conflict with his role as a trustee 
for the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect, one federal bureaucrat can defy the wishes of  
elected state officials, and more important, the millions they 
represent,'' Butterworth said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush called the federal rules an attack on Florida's  
sovereignty, and said he hopes other states will join the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambling halls on some Indian land offer high-stakes bingo,  
low-stakes poker and electronic slot machines, but state law 
prohibits roulette wheels, blackjack tables and other casino-type 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Floridians have long resisted Las Vegas-style gambling. In three  
elections since 1978, voters have rejected casino initiatives, and 
Bush has vehemently fought expanded gambling, even turning away an 
offer for Florida to join the multi-state Powerball game. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Department spokeswoman Stephanie Hanna said the lawsuit  
came as no surprise, and that Babbitt believes the question should 
ultimately be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we would make sure it was a fair and unbiased process,  
but I guess everybody's entitled to their opinion,'' Hanna said.

<HEADLINE> Law Dean, N.Y. Firm Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The dean of the University of Chicago's law  
school and his former partners won a $50 million settlement Tuesday 
in their lawsuit accusing a top New York law firm of trying to 
destroy their reputation by including them in a racketeering case. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement came a day after a U.S. District Court jury  
awarded law Dean Daniel Fischel and his partners $45 million in 
compensatory damages. A hearing on punitive damages was to begin 
Tuesday morning when the settlement was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's extremely pleased with the result -- he thinks justice has  
been done,'' Fischel attorney Alan N. Salpeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes and Lerach of  
New York wired $50 million to the plaintiffs Tuesday, Salpeter 
said. The law firm denied any wrongdoing, he said. The settlement 
allows no appeal and ends the bitter seven-year legal feud, 
Salpeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milberg Weiss is known for filing shareholder class-action suits  
in which investors go against corporate management with big money 
at stake. Fischel and Lexecon, which provided expert testimony on 
economics and the law, help to defend big corporations from such 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Milberg Weiss included Lexecon as one of many defendants in a  
$1.2 billion racketeering lawsuit filed by shareholders in 1990 
over the Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexecon prepared financial reports for Lincoln Saving and was  
dismissed from the racketeering lawsuit, which also named Charles 
Keating, lawyers and accountants. 
</P>
<P>
	Salpeter said the only reason Milberg Weiss sued Lexecon was to  
try to taint the three men by tying them to the unpopular Lincoln 
Savings case. The motive, the lawsuit said, was revenge for 
Fischel's work in a 1988 case that cost Milberg Weiss a $200 
million verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will destroy you,'' one Milberg Weiss partner was quoted as  
telling Fischel. Another allegedly boasted that ``we're going to 
put that little ... out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fischel smiled broadly and laughed with friends in the courtroom  
after the agreement was announced but sent word through Salpeter 
that he would not have any comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishel and his partners sold Lexecon for $63 million in  
December. Salpeter said the $50 million was paid to Lexecon 
Enterprises, created by the ex-partners for the sake of pursuing 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischel declined to comment as did Chicago attorney Jerold  
Solovy, who represented Milberg Weiss, one of the nation's top 
class-action law firms. A receptionist at Milberg Weiss said that 
no one was available to comment.

<HEADLINE> Worker Downplays Fear in Crane Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A construction worker plucked from a crane 250  
feet above an inferno said he knew he was in trouble when he felt 
the heat coming through the soles of his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked down in my crane and I had to start worrying about  
myself then, because I couldn't get down,'' Iver Sims said at a 
news conference Tuesday, the day after a firefighter dangling from 
a helicopter plucked him uninjured from atop the crane. 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked by his wife and three children, the 49-year-old Sims  
showed little emotion as he patiently recounted the 1 1/2 hours he was 
trapped above the inferno that engulfed a five-story cotton mill 
being converted into apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't afraid,'' Sims said coolly. ``I'm used to heights.''  
</P>
<P>
	When the fire first broke out, Sims stayed in contact with  
people on the ground by radio from the crane's cab. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the flames spread and the heat grew, he moved along the  
short end of the crane's horizontal arm to the top of the massive 
counterweight at the end. That put about eight feet of concrete 
between Sims and the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``My shoes were starting to get hot on that iron deck,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims lay on his stomach as heavy winds fanned the flames and the  
smoke. From his perch he could see the swirl of activity 250 feet 
below -- firefighters battling the blaze and crowds of spectators 
watching the drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Several helicopters tried to get close enough to rescue him, but  
they were held at bay by the winds and heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Alabama, Sims' family joined viewers nationwide in  
watching the rescue unfold on live television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just dropped to my knees. I freaked out,'' said Sims' wife,  
Marilind, who wept during the news conference. ``But I got myself 
back together for the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, pilot Boyd Clines and crew chief Larry Rogers of the  
state Department of Natural Resources took off with a helicopter 
equipped to dangle a rescuer by rope. Atlanta firefighter Matt 
Moseley tethered himself to the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley grabbed Sims and the helicopter lifted both men into the  
air and circled slowly before bringing them to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent the night at Atlanta Medical Center before returning  
home to Woodland, Ala., Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the ordeal, Sims said he plans to return to work on  
construction cranes in a month or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go back,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ceremony Recalls Holocaust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The solemn mantra of Holocaust survivors --  
``Never again!'' -- sounded with special resonance as speakers 
evoked the plight of Kosovo refugees during a remembrance service 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Victims of humankind's evil impulses and behavior cry out at  
the last moment of this 20th century,'' Ruth Mandel told Holocaust 
survivors, members of Congress and others at a ceremony in the 
rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandel, vice chairwoman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council,  
was an infant passenger aboard the S.S. St. Louis during its 
``voyage of the damned'' in 1939. Forced to return to Europe after 
Cuba and the United States turned away the ship, many of the Jewish 
passengers later were killed at Nazi death camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60th anniversary of the voyage of the St. Louis is the theme  
of this year's ``Days of Remembrance,'' a weeklong commemoration of 
the Holocaust. An exhibit on the St. Louis and its passengers 
opened Monday at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	In the St. Louis story, some see lessons for current events.  
</P>
<P>
	``The impossible is possible again,'' said Benjamin Meed, who  
organized this year's Days of Remembrance activities. ``Ethnic 
cleansing, genocide, is happening as I speak now. It can happen to 
any group of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four passengers from the St. Louis lit candles during the  
Capitol ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 900 Jewish refugees boarded the St. Louis in Hamburg,  
Germany on May 13, 1939, bound for freedom in Cuba. But Cuba 
refused to let the passengers land, as did the United States when 
the ship approached Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually the ship returned to Europe, where many of the  
passengers later died in Nazi death camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few countries would lend their national rotunda to recall  
a moment in their nation's history which should have been different 
than it was,'' said Miles Lerman, the Holocaust council's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what makes America the great country that it is,''  
Lerman added, ``because it understands that nations must have the 
strength to come to terms with their own history, good or bad.''

<HEADLINE> Pearl Arts Owner Faces Tax Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The owner of an art-supply chain  
with stores in six states was indicted Tuesday on charges he 
skimmed millions of dollars used to build one of the most opulent 
homes in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Perlmutter was charged with filing false income tax  
returns between 1992 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlmutter allegedly took up to $10,000 a day of unreported  
income out of his stores. 
</P>
<P>
	A manager at Pearl's headquarters in Fort Lauderdale said there  
would be no comment from Perlmutter. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged skimming began in 1983 and netted Perlmutter $1.2  
million tax-free a year, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators started looking into Perlmutter three  
years ago after a package sent to him from a store manager 
implicated in the scheme broke open during delivery, spilling 
$25,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlmutter and the manager of the East Meadow, N.Y., store,  
Allan Jacobowitz, were charged with conspiring to impede the 
collection and assessment of federal income and employment taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum sentence for the charges is 17 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Perlmutter allegedly used the money to build one of the largest  
houses in Broward County, a 22,000-square-foot mansion with 19 
bathrooms and 12 bedrooms in suburban Weston. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also charged with enticing contractors to take cash for  
work and not report the income to the Internal Revenue Service. 
Eight contractors were charged with tax evasion as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearl Arts and Crafts operates several stores in Florida, New  
York and New Jersey and has outlets in Chicago, Houston, Atlanta 
and in the Washington, D.C., area.

<HEADLINE> High-Speed Web Connections Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the nation's biggest high-tech  
companies are fighting over how future consumers will connect to 
the Internet using new high-speed data pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing Tuesday, America Online  
and another Internet provider complained that cable television 
companies won't grant their subscribers easier access to their new 
high-speed connection lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies, investing billions to improve their networks,  
want the government to continue allowing them to require 
subscribers of their high-speed lines to also pay for their bundled 
Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., promised after the  
hearing Tuesday to introduce legislation later this month requiring 
the Commerce Department to investigate and report its findings to 
the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators indicated they are loath to interfere with the  
industry's burgeoning success but that they're also eager to avoid 
placing too much power in the hands of a few ``bandwidth barons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're discussing is what shape the architecture will be  
for future communications for this country,'' said John Kerry, 
D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	So-called broadband access over cable lines, with connection  
speeds dozens of times faster than today's telephone modems, 
promises to further propel the economy's rocket ride already fueled 
by the technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeing consumers from the frustrating, sluggish performance of  
the Internet, high-speed connections will finally make possible new 
computer applications that include TV-quality video and better 
audio on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	But the promise of these faster connections is marred by a  
potentially ugly battle among Internet providers, cable companies 
and local Bell telephone companies, all of which see an enormously 
lucrative industry maturing. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Case, America Online's billionaire chairman, testified for  
the first time before Congress -- wearing a suit and tie instead of 
his usual khaki slacks and denim shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of offering consumers choice, cable is requiring  
consumers who want a high-speed cable connection to the Internet to 
buy the Internet service affiliated with a local cable company, 
even if they have another Internet service they like and want to 
keep,'' Case said. 
</P>
<P>
	With McCain's agreement to try to require the government at  
least to consider AOL's requests, Case walked away from his rookie 
appearance before Congress with a success. 
</P>
<P>
	But he drew a mild rebuke from Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who  
cautioned that AOL, as the world's largest Internet provider with 
more than 16 million subscribers, could run up against antitrust 
laws because of its own dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable industry contends it needs the money it generates from  
its own Internet services to help pay some of its costs of building 
a new national, digital infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	James Robbins, president of Cox Communications Inc., said Cox  
already has spent $4 billion to develop high-speed Internet 
connections over its cable lines, and the industry expects to spend 
$10 billion on similar upgrades this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized Case's call for rules changes requiring cable  
companies to open their systems to other Internet providers. ``Call 
it whatever you want, a light touch or whatever, it will scare 
investment away,'' Cox said. ``If you even move in that direction, 
you will dry up the greatest hope for competitive 
telecommunications services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain complained about excessive cable fees, which he blamed on  
a lack of competition among cable television companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon Trujillo, president of US West, also complained at the  
hearing that local Bell companies are discouraged under federal law 
from building sprawling, high-speed digital telephone networks that 
compete with cable lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Trujillo wants his company to be allowed to transmit computer  
data across 197 geographic boundaries established by the government 
and the industry in 1982 to limit long-distance voice calls. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hollings held even sharper criticism for Trujillo than he  
directed at Case, citing figures showing that US West has 98 
percent of the local telephone market in its region. 
</P>
<P>
	``You come up here with a straight face and talk about parity?''  
Hollings said to Trujillo. ``This isn't about open access.''

<HEADLINE> AlliedSignal Profits Rise 11.7 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- AlliedSignal Inc. reported Tuesday  
its first-quarter profits rose 11.7 percent on increased sales in 
some of its aerospace businesses and improved productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a slight dip in total revenues from selling off some  
operations, AlliedSignal reported net income of $335 million, or 59 
cents per share, up from $300 million, or 52 cents per share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales slipped 1.4 percent, to $3.60 billion from $3.65 billion  
in 1998's first quarter, although the company's aerospace systems 
and turbine technology divisions posted record sales. First-quarter 
sales would have been up 4 percent, AlliedSignal said, had it not 
sold off some operations in the performance polymers, aerospace 
systems and specialty chemicals divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met the expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal said its improved performance was due primarily to  
higher sales of electronic flight safety equipment, strong sales of 
replacement aerospace parts and services, a substantial jump in 
turbocharger sales in Europe, as well as lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The aerospace systems segment posted record sales of $1.15  
billion, up 2 percent, thanks to continue strong demand for 
commercial and military aircraft components. The turbine 
technologies segment also posted record sales, up 5 percent to $863 
million, due to higher turbocharger sales in Europe's growing 
market for turbo-diesel-powered passenger cars and stronger sales 
of aircraft engine products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal also makes fibers, plastics and other advanced  
materials, and automotive products such as truck braking systems, 
Fram filters and Prestone car care products. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AlliedSignal fell 6 1/4 cents to $53.06 1/4 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Fire Danger Leads to Fla. Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Florida's governor declared a state of emergency Tuesday as  
windy, dry weather raised the threat of wildfires across the 
Southeast, where flames have blackened thousands of acres of forest 
and brush. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of 60 homes near Wilkesboro in western North Carolina  
remained under an evacuation order Tuesday because of that state's 
largest fire, which had burned 600 acres. The blaze was 75 percent 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration Monday night by Florida Gov. Jeb Bush allows the  
National Guard to help firefighters, and two Blackhawk helicopters 
were immediately put to work dumping water on fires in Hillsborough 
and Polk counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor is being proactive and putting all his tools in  
the toolbox,'' said Jon Myatt, a spokesman for the Florida Military 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard helicopters also fought fires in Tennessee over  
the weekend. Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist asked the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency for help, and all outdoor burning 
permits were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush noted that an index of fire potential calculated by  
Florida's Division of Forestry was above 600 -- on a scale where 400 
denotes significant danger. Humidity dropped to as low as 20 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a red-alert day,'' said Fire Services Deputy Chief  
Frank Pocica. ``We're in very dangerous, high-burn conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brush fires in central Florida on Monday blackened at least  
1,400 acres and destroyed three houses. And weekend fires in 
southern Florida burned hundreds of acres of brush and grass 
southwest of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks of drought also have dried out Georgia's forests, and the  
state Forestry Commission reported 131 fires on more than 5,000 
acres Monday. That followed 119 weekend fires that forced a 
precautionary evacuation of campers from Stephen Foster State Park 
and briefly closed a major highway north of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was the roughest day we've had in recent years,''  
Alan Dozier, chief of forest protection for the Georgia Forestry 
Commission, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 30 weekend fires in eastern Tennessee more than 3,000  
acres. Two vacation homes were destroyed. Arson was suspected in 11 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the other states in the region, North Carolina got help  
from the weather as the wind died down Tuesday, and cloudy, humid 
weather was expected Wednesday.

	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins re-signed running back Karim  
Abdul-Jabbar, fullback Stanley Pritchett and defensive end Shane 
Burton to one-year contracts Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar, 24, started 15 games in 1998 to lead the team in  
rushing for the third straight season. He had 960 yards on 270 
attempts and scored six touchdowns. The former UCLA standout also 
caught 21 passes for 102 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritchett, 25, started 12 games for Miami last season but was  
used primarily as a blocker in coach Jimmy Johnson's offense. He 
caught 17 passes for 97 yards -- a big drop from the year before -- 
and rushed for 19 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, 25, played as a reserve in 15 games last year, finishing  
with 23 tackles, two sacks and one fumble recovery. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yoko Ono Sues Lennon's Ex-Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the latest episode in a long feud, Yoko Ono  
has sued a former assistant to John Lennon, claiming he stole 
priceless personal items after the ex-Beatle was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a federal lawsuit, Ono contends that the former aide, Fred  
Seaman, agreed in 1983 to return boxes of Lennon's personal items 
but has held on to hundreds of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was prompted by Seaman's claim in a February letter  
to Capitol Records that a photograph of Lennon with his son Sean, 
overlooking a beach in Bermuda, was improperly included in a 
recently released compact disc box set. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman said he shot the photograph and calls Capitol's use of it  
``an egregious'' copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol sued Seaman separately on Tuesday, seeking a declaration  
that the photograph does not infringe on any copyright rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman did not return a telephone message left at his Brooklyn  
residence. A lawyer for Ono did not return a telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman provided extensive material for celebrity biographer  
Albert Goldman's unflattering portrayal of Lennon and in 1991 
published his own book. Although it was kinder in its descriptions 
of Lennon, Seaman's book portrayed Ono as an adulterous heroin 
addict. 
</P>
<P>
	Ono's lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, said that after  
Lennon was shot to death in 1980 outside his Manhattan apartment, 
Seaman routinely took shopping bags full of documents and personal 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	The items included unreleased recordings, paintings, love  
letters, a novella by Lennon titled ``Skywriting by Word of 
Mouth,'' and Lennon's journals from 1975 until he was killed, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman pleaded guilty in 1983 to stealing four journals and was  
sentenced to five years' probation. He promised to return all items 
that he wrongfully took, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Seaman returned several boxes of personal items,  
including family pictures, Lennon's journals and many of his 
private letters, Ono contends Seaman is now showing off hundreds of 
other Lennon family photographs, even in a recent television 
special and in several books.

<HEADLINE> 3 Siblings Drown in Fla. Van Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- As their father watched from his  
rearview mirror, a van carrying his three children blew a tire, 
swerved out of control and plunged into a canal. All three drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard a little sound behind me. I saw pieces of the tire  
flying,'' said the father, Trevor Ellis, a minister at First 
Apostle Assembly Church of Pahokee. ``I knew he had a blowout. I 
saw the van swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family was driving home from church Sunday when the van,  
driven by the childrens' uncle, lost control after the blowout. 
Ellis was driving ahead. He stopped and rushed toward the van to 
see its front end tipped into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kicked my boots off and jumped in the water. The van just  
went down so, so fast,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis never reached the children, 15-year-old Dean, 12-year-old  
Fiona and 7-year-old Andrew. They were trapped inside the van and 
died in the murky water. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's uncle, Michael Ellis, escaped by taking off his  
seat belt and wriggling out the van's window. His brother and a 
passerby pulled him to land. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was it,'' Trevor Ellis said. ``We couldn't get anybody  
else out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ellis said he saw the children trying to free themselves  
from their seat belts as the water poured in. ``I couldn't help any 
of the children,'' he said. ``I tried but I couldn't because of the 
seat belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trevor Ellis' wife, Esther, lost her only son, Andrew, in the  
crash. The other children were from her husband's previous 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they're at a better place,'' she said. ``God is giving  
me the strength to go on in order that one day I can see them 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the one-story gray apartment building in West Palm Beach  
where the Ellises live, neighbor Juliet Jacobs said her son and 
niece often played with the three children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids lived like a family in the neighborhood. They came  
over and played video games,'' she said. ``It's so depressing 
knowing these kids are not going to be around anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Promise for Pancreatic Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An immune-system booster derived from cow  
bile has shown promise against pancreatic cancer, the deadliest of 
all malignancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Though it is probably no cure for most patients, the drug seems  
to work about as well as the standard medicine with far fewer side 
effects. The next step will be to try giving them together. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Changnian Liu of the University of Nebraska presented data  
on preliminary human testing of the new medicine, Virulizin, in 
Philadelphia on Tuesday at a meeting of the American Association 
for Cancer Research. 
</P>
<P>
	About 29,000 cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed yearly in  
the United States. The outlook is grim because the disease spreads 
silently. In 90 percent of cases, the malignancy has already 
escaped the gland before it is detected. Only 2 percent of these 
patients survive a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, doctors have treated the disease with a standard  
chemotherapy drug called 5-FU with extremely poor results. 
Recently, treatment got a little better with the introduction of 
Eli Lilly's Gemzar, which doubles the average survival term to 
about six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors tested Virulizin on 26 patients who had failed to  
respond to Gemzar. Their average survival was just over six months. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the doctors reported some intriguing glimmers. One  
patient is still alive 22 months later. 
</P>
<P>
	In another, a tumor that had spread to the liver completely went  
away. Even though the patient eventually died of cancer in the 
lung, doctors said the disappearance of cancer that had spread to 
the liver has never been reported before in pancreatic cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Daniel Von Hoff of the Cancer Therapy and Research Center in  
San Antonio said that if Virulizin holds up in further testing, it 
probably will be used with Gemzar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now to have something else to add onto treatment is pretty  
exciting, but we've got a long way to go on this,'' Von Hoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is being developed by Lorus Therapeutics Inc. of  
Toronto. Doctors said the primary side effect is mild fatigue.

<HEADLINE>  Holocaust Survivors Collect Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Two elderly survivors of the Auschwitz death  
camp hunched over a pile of forms they struggled to fill out, one 
for each relative killed in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and cousins -- I remember them  
all,'' said Jack Glicksman, 76, a retired tailor from New York 
City, sitting at a table at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust 
memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	As Israel marked Holocaust Remembrance Day on Tuesday, Glicksman  
and his wife, Rose, 76, along with thousands of others, responded 
to a plea by Yad Vashem to collect the names of the victims before 
it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	At the dimly lit Hall of Names in the Yad Vashem complex, a long  
line of people clamored for the forms, called Pages of Testimony. 
The document asks for basic information about Holocaust victims, 
such as their hometowns, ages and places of death. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 3 million forms are already stored on the shelves of  
the Hall of Names, and Yad Vashem has been entering them into a 
computerized data base. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pages of Testimony are often the only death certificates of  
victims, since the Nazis did not record the names of those they 
killed. Lacking a grave site, relatives often come to the hall and 
chant a prayer for the dead near the stacks of black binders 
containing the pages of names. 
</P>
<P>
	Six days ago, Yad Vashem began a drive to collect the names of  
the nearly 3 million Holocaust victims that have not yet been 
recorded. It set up a telephone center that has been flooded with 
inquiries for forms, receiving about 650 an hour on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A World Wide Web site gives instructions on how to download the  
forms and fill them out. Blank forms were also distributed through 
Israeli newspapers over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Glicksman's painful memories were brought back Tuesday as the  
Brooklyn resident helped his wife fill out forms for her four 
siblings and parents who perished in the gas chambers of Auschwitz 
in Nazi-occupied Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Glicksman, the only member of his large family to survive World  
War II, recalled dancing in the snow at Auschwitz to keep his bare 
feet warm and taking bread from the hands of inmates who had frozen 
to death to feed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a rabbi at home. He keeps saying that if you don't  
listen to God, you're going to go to gehenom,'' said Glicksman, 
using the Hebrew word for hell. ``I say, don't tell me that. I was 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, his eyes glistening with tears, Glicksman said he couldn't  
talk about his memories anymore. ``You see, when I tell you the 
stories, I am there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Across from Glicksman, Moshe Berlson, 60, a retired Jerusalem  
policeman, taped black-and-white photographs on the forms he had 
filled out with his parents', brother's and sister's names. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't do it for them, no one else will. This is how we  
can remember them, it's the least we can do,'' Berlson said as he 
ran his fingers over the picture of his 9-year-old sister, who was 
killed along with his mother at an Auschwitz gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Glicksman met former neighbors from his  
hometown of Belhadov, Poland. They greeted him with open arms and 
told him they thought he had died during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolling up his sweater sleeve to reveal the faded blue number  
tattooed onto his arm at Auschwitz, Glicksman said the Nazis often 
taunted him about his name, which means lucky man in German. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me I had a lucky name,'' Glicksman said, his voice  
choked with grief. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report: LA Dodgers May Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Fox Group and the NFL have held  
preliminary discussions to move the Los Angeles Dodgers to a new 
baseball stadium built next to the Coliseum, the Los Angeles Times 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though still at a very early stage, the proposal has triggered  
enthusiasm from NFL officials wary of bringing football back to the 
lackluster neighborhood surrounding the Coliseum and skepticism 
from critics who question whether such a bold move could win 
community approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL refused to comment on the report. The Fox Group, which  
owns the Dodgers, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal shared with local community leaders, the new  
baseball stadium would be built on the site of the antiquated 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would bring sports activity to the Exposition Park area  
for nearly 100 days a year, bolstering an idea to centralize the 
city's sports and entertainment venues. Shops and restaurants would 
line the street leading from the Coliseum north to the downtown 
Staples Arena, the new home for the Lakers and Clippers of the NBA 
and the NHL's Kings, attracting crowds more than 200 nights a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox and the NFL would privately finance separate baseball and  
football stadiums but gain immensely from infrastructure 
improvements in the area, such as new freeway offramps. 
</P>
<P>
	Public funds would be used to build a new parking structure -- an  
idea that has been strongly resisted by local authorities. Skeptics 
also questioned how the Dodgers would dispose of its land at Chavez 
Ravine, where the team has played since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL team owners voted 29-2 in March to award Los Angeles the  
league's next expansion franchise. But if no acceptable stadium and 
franchise proposal is produced by Sept. 15, the franchise will be 
up for grabs again. 
</P>
<P>
	A group led by Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz wants to build  
a new stadium in Carson, about 18 miles south of downtown Los 
Angeles. The other group, led by real estate developer Ed Roski Jr. 
and billionaire Eli Broad, wants to overhaul the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL officials were in Los Angeles last week to tell local  
officials about the plan. Mayor Richard Riordan, former Dodgers 
owner Peter O'Malley, Los Angeles City Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Broad and Roski were among those briefed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a preliminary exploration of a very powerful  
concept,'' said Ridley-Thomas, who represents the area around the 
Coliseum. ``Over the next several weeks, a lot of work will be done 
to assess its potential. ... What this also is a significant 
affirmation of Exposition Park. It's quickly becoming the most 
exciting urban park in America.''

<HEADLINE> Coloradan Buys Miller Logbook Clue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- An American fan of bandleader Glenn Miller paid  
$35,000 Tuesday for a military logbook that holds a clue to 
Miller's mysterious disappearance aboard an airplane during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never done anything like this in my life,'' said William  
Suitts, a 76-year-old businessman from Boulder, Colo., who bid for 
the book by telephone to Sotheby's auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the time I was about 18 years old, I've always been a  
great, great fan of his,'' Suitts said, adding that he served in 
the Air Force during the World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Miller led one of the most popular ``swing'' bands of the  
1930s and '40s, which had huge hits with songs like ``In The 
Mood,'' ``Kalamazoo,'' and ``Pennsylvania 6-5000.'' He was at the 
height of his fame when an airplane carrying him disappeared over 
the English Channel on a foggy December day in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	No trace was ever found of the single-engine aircraft or its  
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	One theory was that the plane went down due to bad weather, but  
a flight log belonging to the late Royal Air Force navigator Fred 
Shaw suggested Miller's plane may have been blown out of the sky by 
bombs jettisoned by a Royal Air Force squadron returning from an 
aborted raid on Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw found that the date the bombs were jettisoned was Dec. 14,  
the same day Miller's plane disappeared. He remembered seeing a 
small plane spiraling out of control as the bombs burst around it. 
In 1985, the Ministry of Defense wrote a letter to Shaw saying, 
``in retrospect we now lean towards this being the most likely 
solution to the mystery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suitts was drawn to the logbook by a series of coincidences.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being a lifelong Glenn Miller fan, he discovered  
when he moved to Boulder 40 years ago that it was where Miller had 
gone to college -- at the University of Colorado. And Fort Morgan, 
Colo., where Suitts bought a piece of property, was where Miller 
went to high school. 
</P>
<P>
	When Suitts read that the logbook was going to be auctioned by  
Sotheby's, he decided he ``just really would love to have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he got to his office Tuesday and turned on the radio, he  
heard an announcement that June Allyson was going to be appearing 
at a Denver benefit -- and she had co-starred in the movie ``The 
Glenn Miller Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, thinking about making a bid, he went home.  
</P>
<P>
	``As I pulled into the driveway, the radio was playing Miller's  
`Moonlight Serenade''' Suitts said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fate,'' he concluded. ``It was meant to be.''  
</P>
<P>
	The winning bid was 20 times more than Sotheby's had expected.

<HEADLINE> Skating Coach Accused of Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two days after a former student and colleague accused Richard  
Callaghan of sexual misconduct and exploitation, complaints arrived 
by overnight mail at the U.S. Figure Skating Association and 
Professional Skaters Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is likely to take much, much longer.  
</P>
<P>
	Craig Maurizi's grievances, filed Tuesday, were forwarded to a  
member of each organization's grievance committee. The PSA now has 
20 days and the USFSA 30 days to evaluate the complaints and decide 
what to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need an incredible amount of legal documentation ... and  
that's why our rules are very clear there are 30 days of review to 
make sure our direction is the proper one,'' said USFSA president 
Jim Disbrow, who hasn't yet seen the complaint. ``There will be an 
answer, a definite answer, to where we will be moving at that 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a story first published Sunday in The New York Times, Maurizi  
said Callaghan, who coached Tara Lipinski to the gold medal at the 
Nagano Olympics last year, made improper advances to him when he 
was 15. Maurizi, now 36, said Callaghan abused his authority three 
years later to initiate a full sexual relationship, which continued 
for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times story also contained allegations from two other former  
students, who claim Callaghan made inappropriate remarks or 
gestures to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've decided I'm not going to be granting any further  
interviews for the indefinite future,'' Maurizi said. ``This story 
is getting a little bit out of hand for me, and I haven't been 
spending a whole heck of a lot of time with my family in the last 
few days. I want to slow things down for myself and my family, and 
get a little normalcy back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, who also coached Todd Eldredge to five national  
titles and a world championship, has denied all of the allegations. 
He was not notified the complaints were filed, nor does he expect 
to be before a decision is made, said Dean Groulx, his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident that when the chair of the grievance  
committee reviews the allegations, it will find the grievance lacks 
merit and will take the appropriate action,'' Groulx said. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints are now in the hands of a grievance committee  
chairperson, who will decide whether any rule was violated and 
evaluate the timeliness of the complaint. If the chair decides 
there is merit, a panel will be formed to investigate and make a 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In the USFSA, the panel would consist of three to nine people  
who represent the organization, including athletes, coaches and 
judges, USFSA spokesman Bob Dunlop said. In the PSA, it's a 
three-person panel, PSA president Jerry Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grievance panel would also be responsible for deciding what,  
if any, punishment is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too early to even jump to any conclusions,'' Dunlop  
said. ``It just came in a couple of hours ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time anyone -- including Maurizi -- has filed a  
formal complaint against Callaghan. Maurizi continued working with 
him after their alleged relationship ended, coaching with him in 
San Diego and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi was Callaghan's assistant at the Detroit Skating Club  
until last year, when they split after Lipinski turned pro, left 
Callaghan and decided to train with Maurizi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's kind of put a cloud over the club at this  
point,'' said Jo Anne Berry, a board member at the Detroit Skating 
Club. ``You can kind of walk through the lobby and you can feel the 
tenseness, but we are trying to deal with it the best way we can.''

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Heads Discuss News Shift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- News content will always be an important  
commodity, but the way stories are delivered is going to change 
dramatically during the next few years, technology leaders told 
newspaper executives on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three years from now, traditional newspapers are going to face  
an obvious profit squeeze,'' Intel Corp. chairman Andy Grove told 
the American Society of Newspaper Editors at the 1999 convention in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will know it when it's almost too late,'' said Grove.  
</P>
<P>
	Traditional newspaper journalism has shifted in recent years to  
the World Wide Web as they compete with Internet news sources that 
deliver information as it breaks rather than waiting for the 
morning or afternoon edition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anybody who picks up the newspaper anymore to get  
a stock price or to see which team won a game,'' said Lawrence 
Kramer, founder of MarketWatch.com, a leading Internet news 
provider. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based research firm Jupiter Communications found last  
year that 16 percent of online users had reduced their newspaper 
reading time to use the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech leaders told the editors they are going to have to  
move their content onto the Internet, make those stories 
interactive, and improve in-depth coverage in their print versions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to realize that the Internet is a whole new  
medium, not an extension of what you have been doing,'' said Cox 
Interactive Media vice president Hilary Goodall. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodall said Internet users like to respond to news stories,  
participate in virtual discussion groups and personalize news to 
their interests. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose Mercury News executive editor Jerome Ceppos, whose  
Silicon Valley-based newspaper has invested heavily in a widely 
used, interactive Web site, said newspaper leaders are trying to 
keep up with ``the collision of newspapers and technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, these changes won't be cheap, said Christian Hendricks,  
president of Nando Media, an Internet news provider. 
</P>
<P>
	``Publishers simply need to allocate more money to cover the  
news,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of the more than 500 newspaper executives attending  
the conference agreed, in a show of hands, that they can't afford 
not to prepare for the massive changes taking place as a result of 
the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Tips To Prepare for 2000 Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tips from Donna Tanoue, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit  
Insurance Corp., on investment scams exploiting fears that banks 
won't be able to handle the Year 2000 date change: 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't give your bank account numbers or other financial  
information to anyone unless you initiated the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Carefully check out any investment offer before you hand over  
money. 
</P>
<P>
	--Report investment scams to the police and to your bank, thrift  
or credit union. 

</P>
<P>
	To prepare for the Year 2000 change, financial regulators advise  
consumers to: 
</P>
<P>
	--Keep at least six months' worth of bank and brokerage  
statements on hand, in case a problem develops at the turn of the 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask your broker what his or her firm is doing to remedy the  
problem and what procedures are in place for potential problems or 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask for a report on Year 2000 readiness from corporations in  
which you own shares. 
</P>
<P>
	--If you manage your investments and personal finances using  
off-the-shelf money management software, check with the vendor to 
make sure it is Year 2000 compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	--Check with the company that made your computer and its  
operating system to be sure they are ready.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Likely To Pay Contempt Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton probably will pay a  
financial penalty imposed in a contempt-of-court ruling that he 
gave ``intentionally false'' testimony about his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky, a top adviser suggested Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, the White House declined to comment on whether or  
not Clinton would appeal the ruling and referred questions to 
Robert Bennett, Clinton's private attorney. Bennett did not return 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was held in contempt of court Monday by U.S. District  
Judge Susan Webber Wright, who presided in the sexual harassment 
suit brought by Paula Jones. Wright found that Clinton gave 
``false, misleading and evasive answers'' in a January 1988 
deposition in which he denied having sexual relations with Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright ordered Clinton to pay ``any reasonable expenses,''  
including legal fees incurred by Mrs. Jones as a result of 
Clinton's false testimony. The judge also directed Clinton to 
reimburse the court $1,202 for her travel to Washington to preside 
over taking the deposition. And she referred the matter to the 
Arkansas Supreme Court's Professional Conduct Committee, which has 
the power to revoke Clinton's law license or to impose other 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	A top adviser to Clinton, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the ``most likely course'' being discussed by the president's 
lawyers would have Clinton pay the penalty without contesting it, 
provided that Mrs. Jones' demand for reimbursement was reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	This adviser said Clinton was interested in keeping his law  
license and that his attorneys might contest any regulatory effort 
in Arkansas to revoke it. 
</P>
<P>
	Former independent counsel Michael Zeldin said that, ``Prudence  
would dictate that he not appeal the judge's order and that the 
matter be disposed of,'' provided that any financial payment is not 
excessive. ``I think he really needs to have this behind him. He's 
fighting a war in Kosovo which should be his primary interest these 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee found reason to cheer  
Wright's ruling, while Republicans seized on it as proof that 
Clinton had lied. ``It's almost unbelievable, inconceivable that he 
would give those responses under oath,'' Sen. Olympia Snowe, 
R-Maine, said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats said the finding confirmed their belief that  
Clinton should be judged in the courts rather than be subjected to 
impeachment proceedings in Congress, where the president prevailed 
over accusations of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The stiffly worded judicial rebuke also could give political  
cover to Democrats who argued for congressional censure short of 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exactly what we were saying,'' said Rep. Thomas Barrett,  
D-Wis. ``The courts have the appropriate remedies to deal with 
behavior that is unacceptable. The process works and I agree with 
her decision. He was not above the law and this ruling shows he was 
not above the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the House  
Judiciary Committee, said, ``We kept saying that any misstatement 
or omission is not in itself an impeachable offense. There are 
remedies for it. That's what we were saying. A contempt citation is 
a lot different from impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart refused to answer  
questions about the case. Lockhart said he was not aware that the 
White House was considering its own appeal on the constitutional 
point of separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Little Rock, Mrs. Jones met with her attorneys, who were  
given 20 days to submit a statement of legal costs for possible 
reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hesitant to talk with reporters, Mrs. Jones said, ``I'm just  
really happy and that's all, of course. Why wouldn't I be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones, whose case was dismissed by Wright a year ago,  
appealed and then settled her lawsuit with Clinton for $850,000, 
most of which is going to pay attorney fees.

<HEADLINE> Report: LA Dodgers May Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Fox Group and the NFL have held  
preliminary discussions to move the Los Angeles Dodgers to a new 
baseball stadium built next to the Coliseum, the Los Angeles Times 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though still at a very early stage, the proposal has triggered  
enthusiasm from NFL officials wary of bringing football back to the 
lackluster neighborhood surrounding the Coliseum and skepticism 
from critics who question whether such a bold move could win 
community approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL refused to comment on the report. The Fox Group, which  
owns the Dodgers, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal shared with local community leaders, the new  
baseball stadium would be built on the site of the antiquated 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would bring sports activity to the Exposition Park area  
for nearly 100 days a year, bolstering an idea to centralize the 
city's sports and entertainment venues. Shops and restaurants would 
line the street leading from the Coliseum north to the downtown 
Staples Arena, the new home for the Lakers and Clippers of the NBA 
and the NHL's Kings, attracting crowds more than 200 nights a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox and the NFL would privately finance separate baseball and  
football stadiums but gain immensely from infrastructure 
improvements in the area, such as new freeway offramps. 
</P>
<P>
	Public funds would be used to build a new parking structure -- an  
idea that has been strongly resisted by local authorities. Skeptics 
also questioned how the Dodgers would dispose of its land at Chavez 
Ravine, where the team has played since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL team owners voted 29-2 in March to award Los Angeles the  
league's next expansion franchise. But if no acceptable stadium and 
franchise proposal is produced by Sept. 15, the franchise will be 
up for grabs again. 
</P>
<P>
	A group led by Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz wants to build  
a new stadium in Carson, about 18 miles south of downtown Los 
Angeles. The other group, led by real estate developer Ed Roski Jr. 
and billionaire Eli Broad, wants to overhaul the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL officials were in Los Angeles last week to tell local  
officials about the plan. Mayor Richard Riordan, former Dodgers 
owner Peter O'Malley, Los Angeles City Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Broad and Roski were among those briefed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a preliminary exploration of a very powerful  
concept,'' said Ridley-Thomas, who represents the area around the 
Coliseum. ``Over the next several weeks, a lot of work will be done 
to assess its potential. ... What this also is a significant 
affirmation of Exposition Park. It's quickly becoming the most 
exciting urban park in America.''

<HEADLINE> AP Wins Pulitzers for Photography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press won Pulitzer Prizes for  
photographs of embassy bombings in Africa and events surrounding 
President Clinton's impeachment, sweeping both photo categories for 
the second time in the history of the prestigious journalism 
prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's overwhelming. It's just a tremendous tribute to the  
staff,'' said Vin Alabiso, the AP's vice president and executive 
photo editor. ``We are definitely getting out the champagne!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AP, the only news organization ever to sweep the photo  
categories, won the spot news photography award for a portfolio of 
20 pictures of the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. It 
won for feature photography for a collection of 20 images of events 
surrounding Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and his 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, the AP won both photo Pulitzers, one for a picture by a  
staff member and the other for a picture by a free-lancer whose 
work the AP distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheers and applause rang out on the national photo desk in New  
York when Alabiso announced that 15 photographers won in the 
feature category and six won for spot news Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Marc Bouju, AP's chief of photography in East Africa, won  
the spot news award. He praised the photographers in Nairobi for 
their teamwork on an emotionally and physically draining story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked 24 hours a day for two or three weeks ... everyone  
did his share,'' Bouju said today. ``It's not the kind of story one 
person could have done, it was too big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bouju, who won a Pulitzer in 1995 as part of a team covering the  
Rwandan genocide, was a finalist last year for a sequence of an 
execution by rebels in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Borea, the AP's Baltimore news photo editor, was one of  
the winners in the feature category. His photo captured Clinton, 
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, 
walking hand-in-hand across the South Lawn of the White House with 
their dog, Buddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great group of people,'' Borea said. ``I'm just happy  
to be a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Marquette, who also won in the feature category, said  
winning the Pulitzer was ``truly a team effort. I feel a very 
insignificant part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marquette was at the AP Washington photo desk, where three  
winners celebrated with him: Scott Applewhite, Khue Bui and Pablo 
Martinez Monsivais. 
</P>
<P>
	Applewhite said he had just landed at Andrews Air Force Base  
after covering Clinton at the Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana 
when his office beeped him to tell him about the Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a humbling experience,'' said Applewhite, who was on a  
team of AP photographers that won a Pulitzer in 1993 for its 
portfolio of the 1992 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no greater, sweeter praise than from your peers,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsivais, who joined the AP staff only four months ago, said he  
won for a photo he took on his second day on the job, that of 
former Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who was in line to become 
speaker of the House. Livingston left the House after revealing 
that he had had extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best things are unexpected,'' Monsivais said. ``It's a  
great bunch of photographers here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Loh, a member of the AP Philadelphia staff whose photo of  
Ms. Lewinsky was included in the feature category, said, ``It's 
going to take a couple hours to sink in. It's all so shocking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other feature category winners were: Robert Bukaty, Ruth  
Fremson, Ron Heflin, Greg Gibson, Charles Krupa, Wilfredo Lee, Doug 
Mills, Stephan Savoia and Susan Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Bouju, the winners in spot news were Sayyid Azim, Dave  
Caulkin, Brennan Linsley, John McConnico and Khalil Senosi. 
</P>
<P>
	Azim said he wept after learning he had won: ``I couldn't  
control my joy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The awards bring to eight the number of photo Pulitzers the AP  
has won since 1991. Overall, the AP has won 45 Pulitzers, 27 of 
them in photography.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Pay $89,951 in Fed. Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President and Mrs. Clinton earned $504,109  
last year, including more than $275,00s0 in capital gains and 
business income, and paid $89,951 in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons released their tax returns today, two days before  
the April 15 filing deadline. They overpaid their taxes by $4,267 
and chose to have that amount applied to their 1999 tax bill rather 
than receive a refund. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper,  
released their tax forms, showing they paid $52,951 in federal 
taxes on adjusted gross income of $224,132. 
</P>
<P>
	After being criticized last year for giving only $353 to charity  
in 1997, the Gores reported giving $15,197 in 1998, mostly to 
groups that support the homeless, the mentally ill and religious 
and educational organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the first lady reported $509,345 in total income,  
which was reduced to $504,109 in adjusted gross income after 
deduction of self-employment taxes. Their income sources included 
$200,000 from his salary as president, $16,665 in interest, $16,736 
in dividends, $1,329 in taxable refunds or credits, $74,289 in 
business income and $200,318 in capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons took a $161,938 deduction for charitable gifts,  
including $99,220 for gifts in 1998 and $62,718 in gifts carried 
over from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Gamecocks a Challenge for Holtz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- It took five months and a handful of  
spring practices for South Carolina coach Lou Holtz to realize he 
never faced a challenge like this. 
</P>
<P>
	Five times before Holtz was asked to lift sluggish programs to  
prominence, and five times he took teams to the postseason by his 
second year. The way Holtz talked Tuesday, he will need every ounce 
of his reputation and skill to pull the same thing off at South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be the most difficult,'' he said. ``It may be the  
most difficult because of the difficulty of the schedule, because 
of the expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides a full Southeastern Conference schedule, the Gamecocks  
play North Carolina State and Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	And talk about high expectations. Holtz's words are cherished  
like gold by fans and followed like law. His remark about too much 
litter on state highways touched off a full legislative effort to 
clean the roads. The team's spring game, always a nice way for 
backers to dream of fall success, will be on the radio this year 
with a full pre-game show. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz isn't sure the hype can match the product. With his arms  
folded tightly against his chest and brow furrowed, he saw nothing 
but problems on offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The line is slow to come together. There's no depth at  
quarterback. Runners are thin and unaccomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty well decimated on offense,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	As one reporter asked him, ``What's a nice coach like you doing  
in a place like this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it would be difficult,'' Holtz said. ``And in some  
respects, it hasn't been as difficult as I thought because the 
players have always been cooperative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What still bothers Holtz is that his team is not strong enough  
mentally to overcome adversity on the field. That only comes with 
practice, he said, and he doesn't have more of those until August. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't going to be an overnight turnaround,'' he said.  
``This is going to be, hopefully, a constant improvement in our 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz has had to learn patience this spring, something he says  
he's not good at. ``South Carolina fans have been waiting a long 
time. I guess I can wait a little too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are bright spots, Holtz said. The coaching staff has  
meshed better than expected. John Abraham, switched from lineman to 
linebacker, could be a defensive impact player. The secondary has 
shown quickness, mobility and coverage skills. Phil Petty is 
unquestionably the starting quarterback, ``and a good one,'' Holtz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He still feels the competitive fires that brought him back to  
coaching in December. At times he has flashed his combative style 
at practices to make points; at others he has taken time to 
personally explain things to players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been a better fit for me than it has been for the  
players,'' Holtz said. ``I think I haven't had to change.''

<HEADLINE> Bank Puts Its Money Behind Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- These days, sports and corporate sponsorship are  
as American as, well, baseball and hot dogs. Airlines, brewers, 
computer companies have all spent big bucks to get their names on 
stadiums and ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a bank is putting its money behind the most national of  
pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet Financial Group has become an official sponsor of Major  
League Baseball and the 1999 All-Star Game, to be played in Boston 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Announced at Fenway Park Monday, the sponsorship comes a month  
after Fleet detailed plans to merge with BankBoston, becoming the 
nation's eighth-largest bank and New England's dominant lender. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball agreement, however, does not mean the All-Star game  
will be named after the bank. The rights to that moniker belong to 
Major League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 other corporations have some form of sponsorship with  
Major League Baseball, but Fleet is the first bank among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the sponsorship were not disclosed, and bank officials  
declined to give even a ``ballpark'' figure. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsorship helps cement the bank's presence in New England  
and give it a broader advertising reach across the country -- one 
they plan to use to full marketing advantage, bank officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us a capacity that we didn't have before. It gives  
us a reach we certainly didn't have before,'' said Anne Finucane, 
Fleet's senior vice president for corporate marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsorship strengthens the bank's ties to baseball. Last  
year, Fleet arranged $425 million in financing for Major League 
Baseball. Fleet also has relationships with 12 major league teams, 
including the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing couldn't be better for Fleet, marketing specialists  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there's a lot of questionable press about the  
Fleet-BankBoston merger and what the effect is going to be on the 
New England economy,'' said Kathleen Brewer Doran, a professor of 
marketing at Babson College in Wellesley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really what they're going after here in my opinion is a chance  
to prove their roots in the Boston market,'' she said. ``If the 
All-Star game were going to be in San Diego, there's no way they 
would have done this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsorship also gives them some national clout, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bank plans an advertising blitz -- both inside and outside  
ballparks -- with the theme, ``Fleet keeps baseball going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who played a brief game of  
catch with Fleet Chairman Terrence Murray on Monday, will also 
serve as a bank spokesman.

<HEADLINE> NY Mayor Makes Move to Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now he's officially thinking about it.  
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took a big step toward a run for the U.S.  
Senate Monday, announcing that he's forming an exploratory campaign 
committee for the race. That allows him to raise money more 
aggressively and accept larger contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican mayor still is officially undecided, but his move  
sends a clear signal to potential rivals, including first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, that he is serious about the seat being 
vacated next year by Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Forming the exploratory committee allows the mayor to use funds  
for polling and traveling. He also can accept contributions of 
$2,000 -- $1,000 each for the primary and general elections -- 
without submitting paperwork to the Federal Election Commission 
from the donors stating the purpose of the contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing limits Giuliani to running for the U.S. Senate seat  
instead of the presidency. The mayor was to head to Austin, Texas, 
today to meet with Republican presidential contender Gov. George W. 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a formal way, this states that he has decided to begin in  
earnest to explore his candidacy for the U.S. Senate,'' said 
Giuliani's campaign chief, Bruce Teitelbaum. ``It is the natural 
progression of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor has raised about $2 million for the campaign so far,  
including more than $700,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference Monday, Giuliani said fund-raising has  
gone much better than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last six weeks since Bruce Teitelbaum has been aboard,  
we've raised probably two-and-a-half to three times more money than 
we thought we would raise,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to allowing the mayor to raise more money,  
Republican political consultant Jay Severin said, the exploratory 
committee sends a message to potential opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mayor has been sending signals, and while the motive is  
certainly open to question, it could be to try to frighten Hillary 
out of the race -- because it's possible that Rudy won't run if 
Hillary does,'' said Severin. ``He's also freezing out or stalling 
other Republican candidates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has said she is considering a run for the seat and  
has sought advice in private meetings with local politicians and 
labor leaders about what likely would be a rough-and-tumble race. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potential candidates include U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, a  
four-term Long Island Republican, and U.S. Rep. Nita Lowey, a 
Democrat who has said she will not run if Mrs. Clinton does. Mrs. 
Clinton is unlikely to decide before June or July. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's move was expected, said Harold Ickes, an adviser to  
Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has said he is interested in the seat and obviously has a  
right to do an exploratory committee,'' said Ickes. ``We are 
certainly not surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent statewide poll conducted by the Siena (College)  
Research Center had Mrs. Clinton favored by 45 percent of New 
Yorkers questioned, to 41 percent for Giuliani, a statistical 
dead-heat given the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 
percentage points. The telephone poll of 469 adults was conducted 
March 3-24.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Down at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slid against the yen Wednesday morning  
as overseas investors bought the Japanese currency. Tokyo share 
prices dropped, pushed down by falling high technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.44 yen at late morning, down 0.92 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its level of 119.83 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 231.26 points, or 1.38 percent, to  
16,483.90 at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the index 
gained 207.76 points, or 1.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the yen was supported by domestic  
newspaper reports that Japan's major life insurers will decrease 
their foreign-currency-denominated bond purchases, traders said.

	The Nihon Keizai business daily said Wednesday that Japan's five  
major life insurers will sharply reduce or suspend altogether 
purchases of foreign currency-denominated bonds under the current 
fiscal year as they shift their investment focus to domestic 
assets.

	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.72 yen, down

	On the stock market, share prices turned lower amid  
profit-taking in high-technology issues.

<P>
	The yen's renewed strength against the dollar also made  
investors bearish. A higher yen tends to make Japanese exports more 
expensive abroad and thus less competitive.

	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 55.50 points

<HEADLINE> PBA Holds Vote on NYC Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York's police union voted no-confidence  
Tuesday in the city's police commissioner, who has come under fire 
for actions rank-and-file officers say would get them in trouble -- 
such as using detectives to chauffeur guests at his daughter's 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir is also under attack for taking  
a trip to the Oscars, courtesy of a Revlon executive, and used 
officers to track down the driver involved in a fender-bender with 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are actions that ordinary police officers can be and  
have been suspended for,'' union acting president James Savage told 
some 400 delegates of the 27,000-member Patrolmen's Benevolent 
Association before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time in the PBA's 105-year history that its  
delegates have issued a vote of no confidence in a commissioner. 
The vote is non-binding. Only Mayor Rudolph Giuliani can remove 
Safir from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir said he believes he did not act inappropriately.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that you in the media are playing a game and a  
feeding frenzy and that's OK,'' he said. ``Nobody twisted my arm to 
take this job. I'm fair game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Safir said politics were behind the vote -- Savage is in a bitter  
battle with James Higgins for the PBA presidency. The election is 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said he is behind Safir.  
</P>
<P>
	``Police Commissioner Safir is the police commissioner. He's  
going to remain the police commissioner. He is not only a good 
police commissioner, he is a great one,'' the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir has admitted he used detectives for his personal affairs,  
but in each instance, he insisted he was justified. The city's 
Conflict of Interest Code bars public officials from using their 
offices to obtain benefits or advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous voice vote by the PBA delegates comes at a time  
when crime in the city is at record lows. However, there is 
increasing tension between police and the minority community, 
especially in the aftermath of the February slaying of an unarmed 
African immigrant who died in a hail of 41 bullets fired by four 
white officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegates also said that Giuliani should suspend Safir until  
the commissioner can demonstrate his ability to lead the 
40,000-person department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commissioner Safir's conduct has destroyed the union's  
confidence in his ability to fulfill his responsibilities toward 
police officers and the public,'' Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
	Savage also criticized current NYPD strategies -- implemented by  
Safir -- such as ticketing jaywalkers, owners of unleashed dogs and 
bicyclists riding on sidewalks or without helmets. He said the 
NYPD's ``zero-tolerance'' for crime has created quotas for how many 
arrests, summonses or tickets officers must make. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged PBA members to ``exercise the maximum degree of  
discretion'' before writing tickets or making ``zero-tolerance'' 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Wendel, an adjunct professor of law and police science at  
John Jay College, said that the ``zero-tolerance'' policy is not 
working and that it has greatly turned the rank and file against 
Safir. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NYPD measures its success by the number of people they  
arrest,'' Wendel said. ``When crime was high, that worked. But with 
crime having dropped so much, trying to hit the same benchmarks as 
before is putting officers under tremendous pressure to make 
arrests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wendel said he is not certain whether the PBA vote will affect  
Safir's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's Giuliani's boy. The reason he was chosen was for his lack  
of leadership ability,'' he said. ``His predecessor, William 
Bratton, had plenty of leadership ability and was dismissed for 
being too independent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York  
Civil Rights Coalition, said he believes Safir will be forced to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Giuliani is going to have to cut his losses in light  
of his potential Senate run, and must restore confidence in the 
police department,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Leading Shipbuilder Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Europe's largest shipbuilder, the  
Norwegian-British engineering conglomerate Kvaerner ASA, will sell 
or close its remaining shipbuilding yards to stem losses, the 
company announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipbuilding has been a drain on Kvaerner's profitability  
because of increased competition from low-cost producers in South 
Korea and Japan, and limited demand for new ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to restructure its operations toward engineering and  
construction will affect shipyards in Scotland, Norway, Russia and 
the United States, with reduction of 10,000 jobs in shipbuilding 
alone and plans to cut the workforce by an additional 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kvaerner, which employs 80,000 people in 100 countries, also  
plans to dispose of operations in metals, manufacturing and pulp 
and paper later this year and to save $129 million in its remaining 
businesses by cutting overhead costs and consolidating offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plan for this 'new Kvaerner' is to create a group that is  
significantly smaller and much leaner, but infinitely stronger,'' 
chief executive Kjell Almskog said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kvaerner posted a pretax loss of $175 million for 1998, after  
years of rapid expansion in shipyards, metals and construction. It 
did not release a figure for after-tax profit. Revenues rose to 
$10.8 billion from $9.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will sell or shut down its biggest shipyards -- Govan  
in Scotland, Vyborg in Russia and Kleven and Mandal in Norway -- as 
well as smaller operations including the naval shipyard in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Govan, the largest commercial shipyard in Britain and the last  
one in Glasgow's Firth of Clyde, has failed to turn a profit for 
most of the time since Kvaerner bought it in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very good yard with a very good workforce. The problem  
again is a lack of orders,'' said company spokesman Monty Meth. 
</P>
<P>
	Scottish Business and Industry Minister Lord Macdonald  
immediately set up a task force to try to find a new buyer for the 
yard before orders run out in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shipyard has benefited greatly from its ownership by  
Kvaerner,'' Lord Macdonald said. ``It is now a modern, productive 
shipyard capable of building ships to the highest technical 
specification. It has good labor relations and modern working 
practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clyde has been the heart of the British shipbuilding  
industry since the Industrial Revolution. During the shipbuilding 
peak at the time of World War I, some 80 shipyards operated on the 
banks of the Clyde. 
</P>
<P>
	Kvaerner estimates that the shipyard sales or closures will  
result in a one-off charge of up to $258 million in the first 
quarter. It anticipates an additional charge of $258 million to 
result from its sales of other businesses, including a London-based 
property firm, later this year.

<HEADLINE> Mary Slaney sues IAAF, USOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mary Slaney has sued the International  
Amateur Athletic Federation and the U.S. Olympic Committee in a bid 
to stop the testosterone test that determines whether a female 
athlete has committed a drug violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, the best woman's distance runner in U.S. history, tested  
positive during the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials with a 
testosterone-epitestosterone (T-E) ratio above the 6-to-1 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	She was suspended from competition the following year, then  
later reinstated, although the IAAF referred the case to 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel in Monte Carlo last week adjourned the arbitration  
hearing until April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Testosterone is a naturally occurring hormone that builds muscle  
mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney's lawyer, Jim Coleman, said today it was ``fraudulent''  
to apply the T-E ratio to female athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both the USOC and IAAF know that things other than doping can  
cause a women's T-E ratio to go above 6-to-1,'' he said. ``But 
neither of them takes that in consideration in investigating cases 
involving female athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the lawsuit, the arbitration panel will reconvene  
in Monte Carlo, IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IAAF cannot be under the jurisdiction of a court in  
Indiana,'' he said. ``IAAF rules are enforced in 209 countries and 
the rules are the same for everyone. Otherwise there would be 
confusion and chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports rules must be enforced by the governing body of the  
particular sport,'' Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said he has asked the IAAF and USOC to suspend the use  
of the T-E ratio because the elevated numbers could be caused by 
such factors as birth control pills, which Slaney was taking at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis,  
also seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USOC is being sued because this was the USOC test, and at  
the very outset they said an investigation had to be done to rule 
out the possibility that this could be explained by innocent 
factors,'' Coleman said. ``That was never done, and the USOC never 
assured that it was. It just simply ignored what the IAAF was 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to stop this was to bring a lawsuit,'' he said.  
``We gave both the USOC and the IAAF an opportunity voluntarily to 
avoid the litigation. They weren't willing to do it. The IAAF 
wasn't going to do it because it has no other way to detect the use 
of testosterone. Rather than trying to find a valid way, they are 
willing to take the chance that they will prosecute and damage an 
innocent athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally irresponsible what both of these federations have  
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E ratio normally is about 1-to-1. The IAAF maintains that  
the test is an accurate method of detecting testosterone in 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	During the arbitration hearing, Slaney's legal team collected  
research from statisticians and endocrinologists at Duke University 
that suggests the testing that she underwent is flawed for women in 
their late 30s and early 40s who take birth control pills. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, 40, was world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters in  
1983.

<HEADLINE> Paine Webber Profits Rise 33 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paine Webber Group Inc. easily beat analysts'  
expectations as higher commission fees and asset management 
revenues boosted its first-quarter profits 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber earned $160.6 million, or $1.01 per diluted share,  
up from $120.7 million, or 77 cents per share, in last year's first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. estimated Paine Webber  
would earn 73 cents per share. After the brokerage released its 
results Tuesday morning, shares of Paine Webber shot up $2.93 3/4, or 
7 percent, to $46.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber had net revenues of $1.31 billion, up 18 percent  
from $1.11 billion in the first quarter of 1998. The growth was fed 
by higher commissions from trading stocks and bonds as Americans 
continued pouring money into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from commissions totaled $478.9 million, up 17 percent  
from $408.1 million in last year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber also profited from a 50 percent increase in net new  
client assets, which averaged $155 million per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Asset management revenues rose 30 percent in the quarter, to  
$206.1 million from $158.7 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of its rivals, Paine Webber has increased its efforts  
to attract online investors. In the first quarter, the brokerage 
had 85,685 households signed on as members of its online client 
service, up from approximately 71,000 in the previous quarter and 
43,000 a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Names New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fujio Cho, who ran the U.S. production operations  
of Toyota Motor Corp. for six years, was named today as president 
of the Japanese automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	He will succeed Hiroshi Okuda who stays on as chairman, said  
outgoing Toyota chairman Shoichiro Toyoda. Toyoda, a member of the 
automaker's founding Toyoda family, will become honorary chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Okuda said Cho was chosen as his successor to ride out ``the  
turbulent times in the auto industry'' that has seen the merger of 
Germany's Daimler-Benz with Chrysler Corp. of the United States and 
in French automaker Renault's taking a stake in ailing Japanese 
automaker Nissan Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has shown outstanding talent in improving production. And  
he won praise for his success in setting up our operation in 
Kentucky in the United States,'' Okuda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cho, 62, who joined Toyota in 1960 and is now executive vice  
president, served as president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing in the 
United States for six years until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``My most memorable job was building the Kentucky plant out of  
scratch. When I went to the United States, there was nothing,'' Cho 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive changes will become official at a board meeting in  
late June. 
</P>
<P>
	The long rumored moves were unlikely to bring about broad  
changes at Toyota, as Cho is expected to continue to carry out 
Okuda's basic plans, said Peter Boardman, auto analyst at Warburg 
Dillon Read in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company has a strategy set up, and now it's a matter of  
implementing the strategy,'' Boardman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Okuda, 66, took over as president in 1995 with an aggressive  
plan to turn Toyota into a global automaker and expand world market 
share. In his new post, he will shape the overall strategy of the 
Toyota Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Okuda's new job will be to come up with a group strategy at a  
time when global competition is heating up,'' said Noriyuki 
Matsushima, auto analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Okuda refused to go into details of how Toyota hoped to reshape  
its business, saying that was still undecided. Okuda did say that 
Toyota had no plans for mergers or spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said other personnel moves were in the works that will  
show that Toyota wants a younger leadership to better respond to 
changing times. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media reports have speculated that Toyota will set up a  
Western-style holding company to strengthen the parent company's 
grip on its various other projects that include auto parts 
manufacturing, financing, insurance and telecommunications. Holding 
companies only recently became legal in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he acknowledged that he had little experience in sales,  
Cho said he had no plans to overhaul Toyota's sales strategy in 
Japan, which like other automakers have been hurt by the lingering 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel we have to fix anything right away. It is  
important to keep the relationship of trust with the dealers,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Awaits Sentencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian's crusade on behalf of  
assisted suicide may hinge on a judge's willingness to act outside 
the state's sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors were expected to ask Judge Jessica Cooper to  
sentence Kevorkian to 10 to 25 years in prison for his conviction 
on second-degree murder. The maximum sentence is a life term. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was found guilty March 26 in the death of 52-year-old  
Thomas Youk, who suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease. Kevorkian 
taped Youk's death on Sept. 17 and gave the video to CBS's ``60 
Minutes,'' which aired the footage. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys have argued that the retired pathologist's  
crime shouldn't be treated as any other murder, and doesn't require 
sending a 70-year-old man to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	If the judge goes outside state sentencing guidelines, Kevorkian  
could be sentenced to probation after today's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges are allowed to bypass state guidelines if there are  
compelling reasons for doing so, and Kevorkian attorney Meyer 
Morganroth said Monday he would ask Cooper for a departure ``as far 
down as you can go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's previous trials, all on assisted-suicide charges,  
have resulted in three acquittals and one mistrial. He has admitted 
helping 130 people commit suicide; this was the first time he stood 
trial for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ed Pierce, who led a failed effort to legalize assisted  
suicide in Michigan last year, said Kevorkian's tactics in recent 
years have not helped the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think on the whole he's been a pioneer in bringing the issue  
to our attention. But I don't think he can go on like he's been 
doing in the past,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce added that Kevorkian has been known to help people who  
weren't terminally ill, something most assisted suicide advocates 
oppose. Still, Pierce said Kevorkian shouldn't have to go to prison 
for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ``60 Minutes'' interview, Kevorkian threatened a hunger  
strike if sent to prison, a claim he has not repeated. If he does 
start a hunger strike, prison policy calls for forced feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian staged a three-day hunger strike when jailed in  
November 1993 for refusing to pay bond. He accepted only juice and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	He staged a 17-day hunger strike in December 1993 until a judge  
lowered his bond. During that hunger strike he consumed only 
limited amounts of juice, water and vitamins and lost 12 pounds. He 
was hospitalized several days while he recovered.

<HEADLINE> Brand Set To Leave Duke For NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- After leading Duke to the Final Four, center  
Elton Brand, the consensus national college basketball player of 
the year, may be leading a bevy of departures from the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand and associate head basketball coach Johnny Dawkins  
scheduled a 2 p.m. news conference today to announce whether the 
6-foot-8, 270-pound sophomore center will leave Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for  
comment Tuesday. Dawkins did not return a call to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds this past season and  
was the main cog in a Blue Devil machine that racked up a 37-2 
record and made it to the NCAA championship game, which Duke lost 
to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first sophomore to win the John R. Wooden Award,  
presented by the Los Angeles Athletic Club to college basketball's 
top player. Brand also was honored this season by The Associated 
Press, the Atlanta Tipoff Club and the United States Basketball 
Writers Association as national player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers of the game said Brand's expected announcement  
could lead sophomore Will Avery and freshman Corey Maggette to join 
the underclassmen jumping to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery's mother said she and her son met Friday with coach Mike  
Krzyzewski at his home, where he is recovering from hip surgery, to 
discuss Avery's pro prospects. Terry Simonton said her son is 
leaning toward staying in school next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we talked to him, we were staying,'' she told The News &AMP;  
Observer of Raleigh. ``But K said it wasn't a decision that has to 
be rushed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer Tuesday at an Augusta, Ga., telephone  
listing in Simonton's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Simonton said she was irked by a report in the Duke student  
newspaper Monday that Avery was considering leaving the Blue Devils 
partly because of poor grades. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with Will's grades,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Underclassmen have until May 15 to announce their intentions.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Graphics Changes Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- Silicon Graphics, Inc., the  
17-year-old high-tech company known for breakthrough graphics in 
movies such as Jurassic Park, is changing its name and image to 
avoid becoming a Silicon Valley dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will announce Tuesday that that its new trade name  
will be SGI. The initials are already in the company's World Wide 
Web address (www.sgi.com) and the corporation's symbol on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is part of a major branding shift, which also  
includes a new logo, national advertising and consolidation of 
hundreds of separate product brands. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the surface, sure, this looks like a ho-hum move, but in  
the long run it's really going to help this company become known 
for something other than workstations,'' said Jay Moore, a senior 
analyst with Aberdeen Group in Boston, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI decided to change its name after a branding consultant found  
that while the company's products were perceived as innovative and 
visionary, the company was viewed as a niche-oriented, 
high-performance 3D graphics workstation provider. In fact, company 
officials say their servers and supercomputers for small, medium 
and large businesses generate about half of their revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been struggling for several years, losing money  
in nine of the past ten quarters as competitors have come on strong 
and the supercomputer market has weakened. In late March, the 
company warned investors that third-quarter losses will much 
greater than expected, mostly because of production delays in its 
workstation computers. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI vice president of worldwide marketing and communications  
Kathi Kaplan said Monday that while the new computers are still not 
rolling out, the identity change is part of a much broader shift 
for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	And CEO Rick Belluzzo said the company has made significant  
progress in turning around this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The move to create a corporate identity that reflects our  
position is a logical next step in the company's turnaround,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Edge Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices edged up a modest 0.2 percent  
in March as falling food costs helped to offset the biggest 
increase in energy prices in more than two years, the Labor 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's increase in the Consumer Price Index was up  
slightly from 0.1 percent gains turned in for both January and 
March, but still showed that inflation is remaining under control. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, consumer inflation is rising at an annual rate  
of 1.5 percent, even better than the 1.6 percent price rise turned 
in for all of 1998, the best performance on the inflation front 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists are expecting prices will advance at a faster clip  
this year as the global economy begins to recover from last year's 
severe financial crisis and prices of commodities such as oil begin 
to rise as demand picks up. 
</P>
<P>
	In other economic news, the Commerce Department reported today  
that retail sales were up a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in 
March, following much larger gains of 1.3 percent in January and 
1.7 percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little immediate reaction in financial markets. Yields  
on 30-year bonds this morning held at Monday's late rate of 4.45 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The March inflation report showed that energy prices jumped 1.6  
percent in March. It was the first increase since a small 0.1 
percent rise last October and the biggest one-month gain in energy 
prices since December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices rose 3.7 percent in March, their biggest rise  
since August 1997. Analysts believe motorists will see more price 
pressures in the months ahead as refiners pass on the costs of a 27 
percent surge in crude petroleum prices following the decision of 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut back on 
production in an effort to firm up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	For March, the big gain in energy prices was partially offset by  
a 0.2 percent fall in food costs, the biggest one-month drop in 
this category since September 1997. The price declines were led by 
a 5.5 percent plunge in the vegetable prices. The price of tomatoes 
dropped by 6.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.2 percent rise in overall inflation was slightly below  
analysts expectations. They had been looking for a 0.3 percent jump 
in March because of the rapid run-up in energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of the volatile energy and food categories, inflation  
was well-behaved with the so-called core inflation rate rising just 
0.1 percent, matching the small increases recorded in January and 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline fares should a big gain last month, rising by 4.7  
percent. Throught the first three months of this year, airline 
fares are up by 41.8 percent at an annual rate, the sharpest 
increase for any of the major categories in the CPI. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical care costs rose 0.2 percent in March and are up 3.3  
percent at an annual rate through the first three months. Housing 
costs climbed 0.2 percent and are up at a rate of 1.2 percent 
through March. 
</P>
<P>
	While economists believe that rising energy costs will add  
probably 0.6 percentage point to overall inflation this year, they 
look for price pressures to remain well-behaved in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	If that forecast is correct, it should give the Federal Reserve  
the leeway to leave interest rates unchanged. Normally, at this 
advanced stage of an economic expansion the Fed would be raising 
interest rates to fight growing inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	However, even though the unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent  
last month, the lowest level since Febuary 1970, wage pressures and 
overall inflation have remained well contained.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Falls; Corn, Soybeans Rise / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures fell Tuesday on the Chicago Board  
of Trade, while corn and soybeans rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures continued their slide on slow exports. Crops in  
China and the United States are in excellent condition, setting the 
stage for bumper supplies to be added to world inventories already 
at their highest in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans gained on the National Weather Service's  
latest forecast, which predicted normal to below-normal 
temperatures and above-average rainfall in Midwest planting 
regions. That kind of weather could slow the rapid early pace of 
planting and result in smaller acreage figures if it is sustained. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also were supported by steady export business, as  
reported by shipments inspected for delivery by the U.S. 
Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.67 a bushel; May  
corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.16 a bushel; May corn rose 1/4 cent to 
$1.14 3/4 a bushel; May soybeans rose 5 1/2 cents to $4.85 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork bellies futures retreated on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .68 cent to 64.32 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .80 cent to 72.92 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .47 cent to 55.35 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 1.65 
cents to 53.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> George W. Bush Plans Iowa Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush plans an Iowa  
campaign swing June 12 to raise money for local Republicans, 
congressional staff members said Tuesday. It would be Bush's first 
political trip to the state that holds precinct caucuses launching 
the presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to Republican Rep. Greg Ganske said Bush would raise money  
for the 4th District congressman in what is likely to be one of the 
state's biggest political events. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before that Bush will be getting indications of still more  
endorsements in Iowa, said two GOP sources, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Wednesday news conference in Washington, all four  
Republicans in Iowa's congressional delegation will formally 
endorse Bush, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Nussle has already announced support for Bush, as has  
Rep. Jim Leach. Ganske and Rep. Tom Latham will join the list at 
the Capitol news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has not officially announced a decision to run for  
the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, Bush has collected 
backing from important figures in the GOP establishment. His aides 
declined to confirm details of his initial campaign swing in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said, ``We have not yet confirmed  
a date but we have said the governor will be going to Iowa and New 
Hampshire, probably in June.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire is the site of the nation's first presidential  
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has formed an exploratory committee looking to the  
Republican presidential nomination, and most early polls show him 
atop the pack. Bush has said he would not begin campaign travels 
until after the Texas Legislature adjourns in late May. Aides say 
he will skip a May 2 gathering of presidential candidates in New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's first visit to an important state such as Iowa is likely  
to draw huge attention, and the Ganske aide said one option would 
be to hold the event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Potential Bush rival Steve Forbes, a conservative looking to  
supplement his sizable campaign bank account, is opening his 
fund-raising drive with two letters mailed this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that any presidential candidate can really win  
if he doesn't raise donations from large numbers of people,'' 
Forbes writes in one of the letters sent to 150,000 potential 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say he will not accept federal matching money, a move that  
allows him to exceed spending limits by dipping into his vast 
personal fortune. They hope to raise $25 million from outside 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Forbes did not raise any money in the first quarter of  
the year -- a period in which Bush raised more than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should underestimate Steve Forbes' ability to raise  
tens of millions of dollars based on the appeal of his ideas,'' 
spokeswoman Juleanne Glover said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush, still not an official presidential candidate, has lined up  
campaign office space until late 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	His exploratory committee has signed a lease on new offices that  
runs through Oct. 31, 2000, spokeswoman Mindy Tucker says. ``We are 
preparing for the best case scenario -- which is that the governor 
will decide to run and he will receive the (GOP) nomination,'' Ms. 
Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Should things not work out quite so well, an option allows the  
lease to be canceled in May, she said.. 
</P>
<P>
	The lease on 28,000 square feet in downtown Austin begins next  
Monday, and the committee staff plans to start moving in later that 
week, Ms. Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he plans to make a decision on running for  
president by late summer. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Johnson, an aide to Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle,  
is headed to the White House later this spring to take on a senior 
adviser's position. Johnson, 38, will provide advice on strategy 
and communications for the final 18 months of President Clinton's 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House had been looking to fill the job since Paul  
Begala left after Clinton's impeachment acquittal in the Senate. 
Johnson's resume includes stints as an aide to former Sen. Howard 
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and as head of the Democratic Study Group in 
the House under the late Rep. Mike Synar of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is expected to make the switch sometime after Memorial  
Day.

<HEADLINE> Jim Kelly Urges Research Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly  
had never even heard of Krabbe's Disease when his infant son, 
Hunter, was diagnosed with the fatal condition and given less than 
two years to live. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the quarterback who made the no-huddle offense  
famous went to Capitol Hill to make sure Congress knew about the 
rare neurological disease and to urge it to provide money for a 
cure. Flanked by his wife, Jill, and Buffalo Rep. Jack Quinn, Kelly 
told a House subcommittee weighing health research funding about 
his family's battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can imagine, every day is a struggle for our little  
buddy,'' Kelly said of his son, now 2. ``I have been surrounded by 
tough individuals throughout my entire playing career but never 
have I witnessed more strength and toughness than that of my son, 
Hunter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly described how his son was born on Valentine's Day in 1997,  
a seemingly healthy 7-pound, 14-ounce baby. But things deteriorated 
quickly. Hunter began to cry constantly. His arms and legs 
stiffened and he was unable to smile, play with toys or even hold 
up his head. He had trouble swallowing and was starting to have 
seizures when the diagnosis came. There was no known cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were basically told to take our son home, make him  
comfortable and watch him slowly die,'' Kelly said. ``I remember my 
wife saying to me if there was ever a time to use your name and 
celebrity it's now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institutes of Health, the federal government's  
biomedical research arm, is funding five studies on Krabbe's 
Disease and more studies were focusing on leukodystrophy research 
in general, spokesman Carol Rowan said Tuesday. Krabbe's Disease is 
one of nine types of leukodystrophies, genetic conditions caused by 
problems with the white lining of the brain and nervous system. 
Krabbe's Disease affects only a small handful of children but more 
than 100,000 children suffer from leukodystrophies, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	On their own, the Kellys have set up Hunter's Hope, a foundation  
to fund research on Krabbe's Disease and the other 
leukodystrophies. Hunter's Hope has already raised about $3 million 
and will award its first research grant on June 1, Kelly said. A 
team of medical and financial experts are deciding how to best 
spend the foundation money. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said even though the cash raised so far seems impressive,  
it is ``just scratching the surface'' in terms of what is needed to 
fund sustained research. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Porter, chairman of the House Appropriations  
Subcommittee hearing Kelly's testimony, pledged to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we don't fund by disease ... it seems we should be able  
to fashion some language in this year's report to bring some 
attention to this,'' the Illinois Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly took the Buffalo Bills to four consecutive Super Bowls in  
the early 1990s and retired after the 1996 season. He worked last 
season as a commentator for ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	In his new role as lobbyist, Kelly met with about 15 members of  
Congress in the morning over coffee. After testifying, he was to 
meet with House Speaker Dennis Hastert and some other lawmakers, 
including his old football pal Steve Largent, a Hall of Fame 
receiver with the Seattle Seahawks and now a congressman from 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to see if Largent can still go long,'' Kelly joked.

<HEADLINE> Aikman Signs $85.5M Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Troy Aikman once again is the highest-paid  
player in the NFL, reworking his contract with the Dallas Cowboys 
so he'll get $85.5 million through 2007, a league source who asked 
to remain anonymous told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal includes a whopping $20 million signing bonus. Aikman  
already has received $13 million and will get the remaining $7 
million in early 2001, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Cowboys owner Jerry Jones nor Aikman's agent, Leigh  
Steinberg, would discuss the terms of the deal other than to say it 
gives the team much more flexibility under the salary cap for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to free up cap room so that Troy could play with  
a competitive team,'' Steinberg said. ``He wants more rings on his 
fingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a contract that previously made Aikman pro football's  
salary leader, Aikman was to make $6.5 million in 1999, $7.25 
million in 2000 and $8 million in 2001. The new deal drastically 
lowers those figures but includes a six-year extension, locking 
Aikman up beyond his 41st birthday. The source did not have the 
annual breakdown of the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have extended the contract of Troy Aikman to the point  
where this franchise and our fans are sure to have him for the rest 
of his career,'' Jones said. ``We are very pleased this agreement 
has been completed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman has reworked his previous contract practically every  
season to help Dallas get under the cap. The Cowboys were desperate 
for space now because they're trying to sign several free agents 
and must have money left for the players they pick in the draft 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had been six years since we'd last done Troy's last  
contract, and in those six years there had been major changes,'' 
Steinberg said. ``Rarely does someone play that long on one 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was hammered out mostly during an all-night negotiating  
session late Friday through early Saturday. It was finalized Monday 
and announced Tuesday during a news conference that also featured 
the signing of center Mark Stepnoski, a former Cowboy and a close 
friend to Aikman. Stepnoski was given a five-year, $10.5 million 
contract, plus a $3.5 million signing bonus. Neither Aikman nor 
Steinberg attended the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman isn't the first marquee quarterback signed to more  
seasons than he's likely to play. Denver and San Francisco made 
similar deals with John Elway and Steve Young to take immediate 
advantage of a lower salary cap figure while gambling the cap 
eventually will go up enough to help absorb those deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Two season ago, it didn't seem likely Aikman would even consider  
playing nine more years in Dallas. He was tired of his teammates' 
off-field transgressions and felt the franchise's focus on winning 
had waned after three Super Bowl victories. He mostly blamed 
then-coach Barry Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzer left after going 6-10 in 1997 and was replaced by Chan  
Gailey. Aikman's performance and demeanor seemed revived by the new 
coach and the team responded by winning its sixth NFC East title in 
seven years. They were ousted from the playoffs in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman, the first overall selection in the 1989 draft and the  
first player picked under Jones' regime, guided Dallas' 
transformation from 1-15 to Super Bowl champions three seasons 
later. He's one of only three quarterbacks to lead a team to three 
Super Bowl victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``His talent and commitment will help us ultimately get back to  
the Super Bowl,'' Jones said. ``That's his goal, that's what he's 
all about. ... Any time you have ever seen him in any form of 
excitement or frustration it's because of the direction the team 
was going in his mind toward doing things to win the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stepnoski broke into the NFL with Aikman in 1989 and they made a  
formidable tandem for six years. But Stepnoski signed with Houston 
after the 1994 season, when Dallas didn't make re-signing him a 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepnoski said Tuesday it was the right decision at the time,  
but things didn't turn out as he hoped. The Oilers missed the 
playoffs all four seasons and the team moved to Tennessee halfway 
through his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole emphasis on winning is definitely one of the key  
features that motivated me to come back,'' said Stepnoski, who is a 
bit undersized for a lineman at 6-foot-2, 265 pounds but makes up 
for it with speed and technique. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepnoski's bonus will count $700,000 against the cap each  
season through 2003. His annual salaries are $400,000 in 1999, $1.7 
million in 2000, $1.9 million in 2001, $3 million in 2002 and $3.5 
million in 2003. There are hefty roster bonuses payable in February 
of 2000-2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones isn't done dealing, with several more signings likely  
before the draft begins Saturday. Topping his wish list are 
receiver Raghib Ismail and linebacker Quentin Coryatt. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' negotiations with Stepnoski, Ismail and Coryatt have led  
to an NFL investigation of possible salary cap violations. 
Whistleblowers say the Cowboys agreed to terms with all three 
players, but couldn't finalize them until clearing room under the 
salary cap. The team reportedly had about $400,000 before reworking 
Aikman's contract.

<HEADLINE>  St. John's Artest Enters NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ron Artest went home to leave school.  
</P>
<P>
	The third-team All-America announced Tuesday he is forgoing his  
final two years of eligibility at St. John's to enter the NBA 
draft. He held the news conference at the Jacob Riis Community 
Center in Queensbridge, the neighborhood in which he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke for 30 minutes, thanking everybody he could remember  
who had affected his life, from relatives and friends to coaches 
and teachers. At one point he apologized for ``making this like the 
Academy Awards,'' but no one seemed to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I showed it's not hard to make it out of Queensbridge, or any  
project,'' Artest said, looking directly at a group of kids 
standing just behind the eight TV cameras set up on the court where 
Artest learned to play basketball. ``I'm on my way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also found a new way to describe leaving school early for the  
possible riches of pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get a job,'' he said. ``I'm not leaving college.  
I'm just not playing basketball there. I'll never leave St. John's. 
I'm always going to be there. I love the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his two seasons at St. John's, the Red Storm went 50-19 and  
twice played in the NCAA tournament. The 6-foot-6 swingman averaged 
13.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.9 rebounds in his 
two-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm fell one game shy of the Final Four this season,  
losing to Ohio State in the South Regional final. Not bad for a 
team that was unranked when the season began and finished ninth in 
the final poll with a 28-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very special year with one of the closest teams I  
ever played for. There were no individuals,'' Artest said. ``I had 
a pretty decent year and it would have been great to get to the 
Final Four. Once the season was over, I made the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The range of comments about when Artest's name will be called in  
the June 30 draft go from a sure lottery pick to a suspect shooter 
who may not be picked until the late teens. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's coach Mike Jarvis is sure Artest handled the  
situation correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a right way to make a decision and a wrong way, and  
Ronnie talked to the people who mattered and did it the right 
way,'' Jarvis said. ``I can tell you we never talked about this at 
all during the season. The team was always first. I can't be more 
supportive than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior forward Tyrone Grant is the only other player not  
returning to St. John's next season. So the outlook is bright, even 
with Artest gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was selfish and told him he should stay, but he didn't  
listen,'' said sophomore forward Reggie Jessie, who grew up in the 
same neighborhood and has known Artest since they were children. 
``He's a hero around here whether he plays in the NBA or not. Just 
what he's done coming from here is special, and now he has the 
opportunity to play basketball with the best players there are.''

<HEADLINE> Maryland Must Pay Ex-Football Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) -- Maryland must pay former football  
coach Mark Duffner nearly $89,000, a Prince George's County judge 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Maureen Lamasney said in a written ruling April 7  
that the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland System owed 
Duffner $85,000 for the sixth year of his secondary contract for 
radio and television appearances and consulting. She also awarded 
him $3,699.05 as the balance of a 1.25 percent cost-of-living 
increase under his primary contract as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the school said he is considering an appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	University lawyers had argued that since Maryland's obligation  
under Duffner's coaching contract ended when he became the 
Cincinnati Bengals' linebackers coach in February 1997, it no 
longer had to honor the secondary contract or the cost-of-living 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Duffner's lawyer, Michael G. Trainer, said on Monday that the  
school tried to use a technicality to avoid paying Duffner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might not have won enough games, but they agreed to give  
him the money,'' Trainer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Roach, Maryland's chief counsel, issued a statement on  
Tuesday saying: ``We respectfully feel that the ruling is in error. 
At this time, we are deciding whether to pursue an appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland fired Duffner in 1996 after his fifth season. He had a  
20-35 record from 1992 to 1996. His best year was 1995, when the 
Terrapins started 4-0 and broke into the national rankings, but 
lost five of their last seven games.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Pay $89,951 in U.S. Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, took  
home $504,109 in 1998 -- less than they earned the year before -- and 
paid 17 percent of their earnings in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to tax returns released Tuesday, the Clintons earned  
$65,402 less than in 1997. They paid $89,951 in federal taxes this 
year. They overpaid their taxes by $4,267 and applied that amount 
to next year's tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons' 1998 return closely mirrored that from the  
previous year, when they reported $569,511 in adjusted gross income 
and paid $91,964, or 16 percent, in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the Bushes paid 15 percent of their income in  
federal taxes in 1991, and 22 percent in 1990. The Reagans paid 
27.5 percent and 25 percent of their income in taxes in 1986 and 
1987, and the Carters paid 34 percent and 33 percent of their 
income in federal taxes in 1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the most recent IRS statistics, taxpayers earning  
between $200,000 and $500,000 from 1994 to 1996 paid an average of 
25.5 percent of their adjusted gross income in taxes. For incomes 
between $500,000 and $1 million, the average was 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, there were 1.2 million taxpayers with adjusted gross  
incomes between $200,000 and $500,000, and 200,000 in the group 
between $500,000 and $1 million. That's out of 120.4 million tax 
returns filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons reported $509,345 in total income, which was  
reduced to $504,109 after deduction of self-employment taxes. Their 
income sources included $200,000 from Clinton's salary as 
president, $16,665 in interest, $16,736 in dividends, $1,329 in 
taxable refunds or credits, $74,289 in business income and $200,318 
in capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The dividend and interest income includes $12,000 from the Henry  
G. Freeman Jr. Pin Money Fund, a trust fund established in 1912 for 
the spouse of the president. As in previous years, the first lady 
will contribute that money to charity, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons took a $161,938 deduction for charitable gifts,  
including $99,220 for gifts in 1998 and $62,718 in gifts carried 
over from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The $74,289 in business income came from profits generated by a  
book written several years ago by Mrs. Clinton about child raising, 
``It Takes a Village.'' Proceeds from another book she wrote about 
the family's cat, Socks, and dog, Buddy, go directly to a national 
parks foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said that all book  
income, minus taxes and administrative expenses, would be donated 
to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The first family received $53,462 in short-term capital gains  
and $146,856 in long-term capital gains -- both from the Pell Rudman 
Trust Co., which holds a private trust for the Clintons. The 
arrangement shields the Clintons from involvement with their 
investments and prevents public disclosure of their income sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, paid $52,951 in  
federal taxes for 1998, or 23 percent of an adjusted gross income 
of $224,132. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gores gave more than $15,000 to various causes in 1998. They  
were roundly criticized last year for giving only $353 to charity 
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Denver Considers Online Adoption Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The city's plan to advertise adoptive children  
online is being criticized by two city council members who fear the 
practice may lead to exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most accommodating vehicles for pedophilia is the  
Internet, and the Denver Department of Social Services is giving 
pedophiles the key,'' said Councilman Ed Thomas, a former Denver 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's Human Services Department handles children that courts  
have deemed dependent and neglected. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 25 children awaiting placement. They include 3-  
to 12-year-olds with crack addictions, fetal alcohol syndrome and 
emotional scars from family violence or separation from their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting next month, pictures, biographies and audio interviews  
of those hard-to-place children will be posted on the city's Web 
site, www.denvergov.org. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of the plan say it is an effective way to spread the  
word about children who in many cases have waited months and even 
years for permanent homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we said we'd never do this because of the possibility (of  
abuse), imagine all the children who would never have placement,'' 
said Gini Hansen, supervisor of the research unit in the city's 
foster care and adoptions unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be kind of silly not to advertise when there is a  
need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Human Services officials, concerned about pedophilia on the  
Internet and other illicit activities associated with adoption, 
like the sale of babies, said they will take precautions to protect 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thomas said, ``if one of these children is harmed ...  
because of this decision to put them on the Web, the end doesn't 
justify the means. There's got to be better ways to find homes for 
these kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city said no last names will be listed, and photos will  
emphasize kids' faces, not their bodies. Human Services officials 
said they will thoroughly screen interested parents, doing 
background checks for abuse and criminal activity, before pairing 
them with the children. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first reaction is, why?'' said Ramona Martinez, chairwoman  
of the Human Services Committee. ``It sounds pretty insensitive to 
me. I need to learn more about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Use of Internet technology for adoption began in the mid-1990s,  
mostly among private agencies, including those working with 
overseas kids. Public agencies followed suit, and close to 20 
states now have their own adoption sites.

<HEADLINE>  St. John's Artest Enters NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ron Artest went home to leave school.  
</P>
<P>
	The third-team All-America announced Tuesday he is forgoing his  
final two years of eligibility at St. John's to enter the NBA 
draft. He held the news conference at the Jacob Riis Community 
Center in Queensbridge, the neighborhood in which he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke for 30 minutes, thanking everybody he could remember  
who had affected his life, from relatives and friends to coaches 
and teachers. At one point he apologized for ``making this like the 
Academy Awards,'' but no one seemed to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I showed it's not hard to make it out of Queensbridge, or any  
project,'' Artest said, looking directly at a group of kids 
standing just behind the eight TV cameras set up on the court where 
Artest learned to play basketball. ``I'm on my way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also found a new way to describe leaving school early for the  
possible riches of pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get a job,'' he said. ``I'm not leaving college.  
I'm just not playing basketball there. I'll never leave St. John's. 
I'm always going to be there. I love the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his two seasons at St. John's, the Red Storm went 50-19 and  
twice played in the NCAA tournament. The 6-foot-6 swingman averaged 
13.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.9 rebounds in his 
two-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm fell one game shy of the Final Four this season,  
losing to Ohio State in the South Regional final. Not bad for a 
team that was unranked when the season began and finished ninth in 
the final poll with a 28-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very special year with one of the closest teams I  
ever played for. There were no individuals,'' Artest said. ``I had 
a pretty decent year and it would have been great to get to the 
Final Four. Once the season was over, I made the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The range of comments about when Artest's name will be called in  
the June 30 draft go from a sure lottery pick to a suspect shooter 
who may not be picked until the late teens. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's coach Mike Jarvis is sure Artest handled the  
situation correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a right way to make a decision and a wrong way, and  
Ronnie talked to the people who mattered and did it the right 
way,'' Jarvis said. ``I can tell you we never talked about this at 
all during the season. The team was always first. I can't be more 
supportive than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior forward Tyrone Grant is the only other player not  
returning to St. John's next season. So the outlook is bright, even 
with Artest gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was selfish and told him he should stay, but he didn't  
listen,'' said sophomore forward Reggie Jessie, who grew up in the 
same neighborhood and has known Artest since they were children. 
``He's a hero around here whether he plays in the NBA or not. Just 
what he's done coming from here is special, and now he has the 
opportunity to play basketball with the best players there are.''

<HEADLINE> Masters Ratings Slip Slightly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Since Tiger Woods' record-breaking performance  
at Augusta National in 1997, it's been all downhill for the Masters 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	After it appeared as though ratings for CBS' final round  
coverage of the Masters would be up following an 8 percent increase 
from last year in the overnight ratings, the national ratings 
slipped 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight year that ratings for the finale of  
the country's most prestigious golf tournament have dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight ratings measure the top 44 markets in the country,  
while the nationals measure the entire country. Therefore, the 
dropoff was a result of fewer viewers in the smaller markets. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS' final round coverage of Jose Maria Olazabal's victory  
posted a 10.1 national mark and a 22 share, compared with a 10.2/28 
during Mark O'Meara's win in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's third-round action recorded a 5.0/15, which was down  
24 percent from 1998, and the two-day average for CBS was a 7.9/19 
-- down from a 8.6/19 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods broke the course record in 1997 by shooting a 270.  
</P>
<P>
	``No other golf tournament in America comes within 50 percent of  
the Masters,'' said CBS sports president Sean McManus. ``There's 
something appealing to the casual golf fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the dip continues a trend in which the ratings of  
nearly all of the major sporting events has fallen in the past 
year, including the Super Bowl, World Series and NCAA men's 
basketball championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	When Olazabal won his first Masters in 1994, the tournament  
posted a 8.1 national rating for the final round and a 5.8 for the 
third round. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each network point represents 994,000 
homes. The share is the percentage tuned to a program among those 
televisions on at the time.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Names New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. announced a major executive  
reshuffle Tuesday aimed at helping the top Japanese automaker ride 
out drastic changes in the global auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujio Cho, an executive who ran the U.S. production of Toyota  
Motor Corp. for six years, was named the new president, replacing 
Hiroshi Okuda. Okuda will remain influential as the company's 
chairman, a post similar to chief executive in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Okuda said Cho was well-suited to lead Toyota during these  
``turbulent times'' for the industry, seen in the DaimlerChrysler 
merger and in French automaker Renault's taking a stake in ailing 
Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has shown outstanding talent in improving production. And  
he won praise for his success in setting up our operation in 
Kentucky in the United States,'' Okuda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cho, 62, who joined Toyota in 1960 and is now executive vice  
president, served as president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing in the 
United States for six years until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``My most memorable job was building the Kentucky plant out of  
scratch. When I went to the United States, there was nothing,'' Cho 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive changes will become official at a board meeting in  
late June. Shoichiro Toyoda, a member of the automaker's founding 
Toyoda family and the current chairman, will become honorary 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The long rumored moves were unlikely to bring about broad  
changes at Toyota, as Cho is expected to continue to carry out 
Okuda's basic plans, said Peter Boardman, auto analyst at Warburg 
Dillon Read in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company has a strategy set up, and now it's a matter of  
implementing the strategy,'' Boardman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Okuda, 66, took over as president in 1995 with an aggressive  
plan to turn Toyota into a global automaker and expand world market 
share. In his new post, he will shape the overall strategy of the 
Toyota Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Okuda's new job will be to come up with a group strategy at a  
time when global competition is heating up,'' said Noriyuki 
Matsushima, auto analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Okuda refused to go into details of how Toyota hoped to reshape  
its business, saying that was still undecided. Okuda did say that 
Toyota had no plans for mergers or spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said other personnel moves were in the works that will  
show that Toyota wants a younger leadership to better respond to 
changing times. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media reports have speculated that Toyota will set up a  
Western-style holding company to strengthen the parent company's 
grip on its various other projects that include auto parts 
manufacturing, financing, insurance and telecommunications. Holding 
companies only recently became legal in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he acknowledged that he had little experience in sales,  
Cho said he had no plans to overhaul Toyota's sales strategy in 
Japan, which like other automakers have been hurt by the lingering 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel we have to fix anything right away. It is  
important to keep the relationship of trust with the dealers,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Tops Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. reported its first-quarter  
profits rose 18.4 percent on record trading commissions and renewed 
strength in the global debt business. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment firm earned $609 million, or $1.44 per share, in  
the first quarter, compared to $514 million, or $1.26 per share, in 
the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected Merrill Lynch  
to earn $1.22 per share. Merrill became the latest of several Wall 
Street brokerages to reap stronger-than-expected profits from the 
continuing bull market. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 10.6 percent from the comparable period in 1998, to  
$5.27 billion from $4.76 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch said record levels of commissions, asset  
management and portfolio service fees, and net interest contributed 
to the strong revenue growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissions rose 7 percent to $1.57 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch's global debt and global equities business grew 14  
percent and 15 percent respectively from the first quarter of 1998, 
providing further assurance that U.S. investment banks have 
recovered from the global financial crises that hurt their results 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Merrill Lynch said client assets reached a record $1.5  
trillion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of $122 
billion from the comparable period in 1998, and $36 billion higher 
than at the close of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from investment banking was the only real laggard in  
Merrill's first quarter, sliding 24 percent to $633 million. The 
company cited an industrywide slowdown in the issuing of new 
equities. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch remains the leading underwriter of debt and equity  
securities, with 16 percent of U.S. market share, according to 
Securities Data Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of its rivals, Merrill Lynch increased its efforts to  
embrace the Internet during the first quarter. The brokerage 
introduced online trading and acquired the assets of D.E. Shaw 
Financial Technology.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ruling Surprised Few </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers involved in President Clinton's  
impeachment trial said they were anything but shocked when a 
federal judge in Arkansas held the chief executive in contempt for 
testifying falsely in the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was disagreement over the importance of the finding.  
</P>
<P>
	Any element of surprise disappeared last September, when U.S.  
District Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock -- a onetime law 
student of Clinton's -- said in a footnote to a ruling that she was 
looking at the contempt issue. She also mentioned it to lawyers 
during a conference call months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a surprise,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a  
House Judiciary Committee member who opposed impeachment. But he 
said it ``wasn't material'' to Mrs. Jones' allegations that Clinton 
made an unwanted sexual advance to her in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	While the House failed to approve a proposed impeachment article  
charging the president with lying in his Jones case deposition, 
prosecutors in the Senate trial incorporated that allegation into 
their perjury and obstruction-of-justice case. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the key House prosecutors, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.  
said the ruling Monday ``doesn't surprise me.'' He called the 
finding ``a significant matter for anyone who values his license to 
practice law. I have to underline that 'willful' part of her 
ruling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, in her opinion, cited Clinton's ``intentionally  
false'' testimony and his ``willful failure'' to obey the court's 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Frank found no fault with the ruling, commenting, ``There  
was a pretty good consensus he lied in the deposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Carpenter-McMillan, who has been Mrs. Jones' spokeswoman,  
said: ``We're thrilled. While we did not agree with the judge's 
decision to dismiss the case, we applaud the fact that she found 
Clinton blatantly lied under oath. We always said he lied. Now the 
very judge who sat in the room confirmed that. And it's history. A 
president has never been slapped with a contempt citation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead of the conservative Rutherford Institute and one  
of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said if Clinton appeals, the judge could 
hold a full-blown hearing with witnesses -- adding to Clinton's 
legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitehead said the ruling was ``a vindication'' for his client  
and the first time ``where the president was actually held 
accountable in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the other Clinton-related court news of the day, Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said 
the ruling ``offsets the disappointing results in the McDougal 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, the Clinton's former Whitewater partner, was  
acquitted of obstructing Kenneth Starr's investigation and received 
a mistrial on two contempt counts. Hyde said he hadn't read the 
opinion and couldn't comment further.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Warned on Y2K Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Watch out for new investment scams playing on  
fears that banks won't be able to handle the Year 2000 change, 
lawmakers and regulators warned the public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, heard testimony from  
business leaders and lawmakers warning of dire economic results if 
Congress does not pass legislation limiting what experts predict 
could be $1 trillion in lawsuits arising from the computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress grappled with the Year 2000 problem on several  
fronts, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking 
Committee, said at another hearing that the banking industry 
appears well prepared but some troubling questions remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach asked, for example, why companies assessing banks' Year  
2000 readiness have been less confident than banking regulators. He 
also noted that the inspectors general at some agencies, such as 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., have raised questions about 
the thoroughness or accuracy of the agencies' Year 2000 
examinations of banks.

<P>
	The nation's banks, thrifts and credit unions ``need to be  
prepared for a confidence deficit'' on the part of the public, 
Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As in the case of fire, if there is a panic in the banking  
sector, and everyone rushes to the door, someone is likely to get 
hurt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	People should avoid panic and steer clear of the proliferating  
investment scams exploiting Year 2000 fears, Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some con artists have tried to persuade people to take their  
money out of banks to avoid computer foulups, then turn it over to 
be invested with them in gold, silver, small-company stocks or 
other assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Some unscrupulous promoters are sending unsolicited e-mail  
messages selling investment opportunities in companies or products 
that are touted as fixing the Year 2000 problem, according to state 
securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be cases of Y2K fraud or swindle,'' testified Donna  
Tanoue, the FDIC chairwoman. ``If a deal seems too good to be true, 
it probably is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's bankers have promised that ATM machines, credit  
cards, checks and banking services will function normally through 
the millennial date change. They have warned that withdrawing 
massive amounts of cash could make consumers vulnerable to being 
robbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tanoue and other regulators appearing at Tuesday's hearing  
reminded consumers that bank accounts are federally insured up to 
$100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Federal Reserve has ordered an additional $50 billion  
of new currency to be put into circulation in the event people make 
a run on banks and automated teller machines late in the year. By 
the end of the year, $200 billion in currency will be stored in 
government vaults, up from the $150 billion normally held in 
reserve. That's in addition to the $460 billion in notes 
circulating in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal debated by the Judiciary Committee seeks to head  
off a flood of lawsuits by giving companies that are potential 
defendants up to 90 days to fix Year 2000 problems before a suit 
goes to court, and by promoting mediation. The legislation also 
would cap punitive damages, make it more difficult to file 
class-action suits and allow those sued to claim they are making 
``reasonable efforts'' to remedy problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Year 2000 lawsuits, said Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., one of the  
bill's sponsors, ``pose a threat to the nation's continued economic 
prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another sponsor, Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., said such suits could  
dwarf the $300 billion to $400 billion now at stake in all U.S. 
litigation annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Two similar bills are pending in the Senate. All the legislation  
faces strong opposition from consumer groups that warn they could 
seriously undermine consumers' legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson, in a statement, said  
the administration supports efforts to mediate cases outside the 
courtroom, but is concerned about rewriting laws in what would be 
``by far the most sweeping litigation reform measure ever 
enacted.''

<HEADLINE> Predators' Bordeleau Hurts Neck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Nashville Predators center Sebastien  
Bordeleau suffered a cracked vertebra in his neck when checked by 
an opponent, but he should recover and play again, doctors said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bordeleau left Monday night's game after the first period  
complaining of neck pain after a check by Los Angeles Kings 
defenseman Sean O'Donnell. X-rays showed two vertebrae knocked out 
of alignment and he was taken by ambulance to Baptist Hospital, 
where further tests found one was fractured. 
</P>
<P>
	Bordeleau was in traction Tuesday to realign the two vertebrae.  
If that doesn't work, he may need surgery, team physician Dr. 
Michael Pagnani said. He offered no timetable for Bordeleau's 
recovery or return to the ice.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pictures of a somber President Clinton, a  
defiant Linda Tripp and a determined Monica Lewinsky were among the 
images of a president's struggle against impeachment that won a 
Pulitzer Prize for The Associated Press for feature photography. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragging on for more than a year, the story required  
round-the-clock vigilance by members of the AP's photo team in 
Washington and around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys were there at 5 o'clock in the morning,'' Sandra K.  
Johnson, chief of the Washington bureau, said during a celebration 
after Monday's announcement. ``They were there at midnight. They 
were at the courthouse. They were at (special prosecutor) Ken 
Starr's house every single day. And this is the payoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Sweets, assistant chief of bureau for photos, congratulated  
the photographers and inside staff who worked the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, this might be corny -- it sounds like the Oscars when  
you say you had a lot of support. I can't say enough about the team 
effort -- the photo editors, the photographers, the support staff. 
They worked long, hard hours for 13 months to make AP a success,'' 
Sweets said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20 winning photos were taken by nine photographers in  
Washington and five from Baltimore, Boston, Dallas and Portland, 
Maine. Among them were Khue Bui's images of Mrs. Tripp, the woman 
who secretly taped Ms. Lewinsky's phone calls, and presidential 
confidant Vernon Jordan; Dan Loh's close-up of Ms. Lewinsky and her 
attorney William Ginsburg; and Joe Marquette's photo of a tense 
confrontation on Capitol Hill between Clinton lawyer David Kendall 
and Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Photographer Scott Applewhite's photo of a downcast Clinton  
walking through stately columns at the White House was among the 
winners. ``I knew it was something special when I brought it back 
to the office,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pablo Martinez Monsivais took his winning photo the second day  
on the job in Washington when he snapped a photo of former Rep. Bob 
Livingston, R-La., who was in line to become speaker of the House.

<HEADLINE>  Transplant Patient at Phillies Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After hurling the first pitch at the  
Philadelphia Phillies home opener with a left hand he didn't have 
11 weeks ago, Matthew Scott smiled and pumped his hands in the air 
like he had just won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the 25-foot throw was high and outside, and soft enough  
that Mark McGwire would have had no trouble slugging it into the 
upper deck for a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was perfect enough for Scott, who became the first person  
in the United States to receive a hand transplant during a 15-hour 
operation at Louisville Jewish Hospital in Kentucky on Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	With his 7-year-old son, Ian, looking on, Scott said afterward  
he was so nervous he was thankful he didn't throw the ball into the 
stands or bounce it past the Phillie who caught the pitch, reserve 
Rob Ducey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something that the whole world was seeing for the first  
time. I wanted the whole world to see that (the operation) works. 
To me it is unbelievable,'' a beaming Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott threw the ball with a protective glove he wears every day  
as part of his recovery process. He cannot detect texture, such as 
the seams of the baseball, with the new hand, but can feel the 
pressure he applies on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a thrill, an absolute thrill,'' the left-handed Scott  
said, donning a number 13 Phillies jersey and a bright red Phillies 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who had been using a prosthetic device since losing his  
hand in a 1985 fireworks accident, had said he wanted to play catch 
with his children after he recovered from the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials decided to give Scott the opportunity to throw  
out the first pitch after hearing about his surgery and learning 
the Absecon, N.J., man was a lifelong Phillies fan. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing for the game -- which the Phillies lost 8-6 to the  
Atlanta Braves -- became part of his physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of had to start from the beginning,'' said Scott, 37.  
``Every day for about 20 minutes to a half-hour a day, we practiced 
the motion of throwing and then the hand grip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott's ceremonial pitch capped a dizzying pregame opening day  
ceremony for the Phillies. Scott received the ball after a man with 
a jet-propelled backpack rocketed to the upper level of the 
stadium, handed the ball to a man who used a hang glider to fly 
down to the field, who finally gave the ball to Scott's son. 
</P>
<P>
	After throwing the pitch, Scott raised both his hands in triumph  
and pointed to the stands. He was greeted by hugs and handshakes in 
the Phillies dugout from family and team members, including star 
pitcher Curt Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say Scott is progressing right on schedule and that his  
ability to throw a ball is another milestone in his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked hard for this,'' said physical therapist Ann  
Hodges, who traveled with Scott. ``He's progressing well and has 
been looking forward to this day for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an entourage of hospital officials from Louisville nearby,  
Scott said throwing the first pitch went a long way towards his 
goal of teaching Ian how to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the transplant, ``actually showing how to field a ground  
ball with two hands was more of an abstract discussion,'' he said. 
``Now that I have the ability to do that, it will probably be a lot 
easier now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Scott said he had no idea he would be at the point where  
he is now. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you asked me a couple weeks ago, I would have been just as  
happy scratching my upper palm with it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Trademark Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Holders of U.S. trademarks would be allowed to  
file applications for international versions in the United States 
instead of abroad under a bill the House passed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the application is processed and approved, the trademark  
would be protected by both domestic and international law. U.S. 
businesses would no longer have to register for trademarks in each 
country where they market their products. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed by voice vote, would implement provisions of  
the 1989 Madrid Protocol, a treaty that seeks to develop a low-cost 
international system for registering trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	If the bill becomes low, however, it will not make the United  
States a treaty participant. International agreements must be 
signed by the president and ratified by the Senate, the process for 
approving all international treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters of the House bill said it would send a message to  
international businesses that the United States is serious about 
participating in such a trademark protection agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have balked at signing the agreement over the  
issue of voting rights for members of the European Union. Each of 
the EU's 15 member countries is given a vote and the EU as a whole 
receives an additional vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. State Department is concerned by this provision since  
it contradicts the traditional democratic concept of one vote per 
participating country,'' said a statement released by the House 
Republican Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a similar measure last year, but the Senate did  
not vote on it before the adjournment of the 105th Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	------

<HEADLINE> Gov't Mulls Suit Against American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines has engaged in settlement talks  
to avoid a possible antitrust lawsuit over charges that it tried to 
bully a small competitor out of Dallas, says a source close to the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's antitrust chief Joel Klein has not  
decided whether to proceed with the case against American, but a 
decision is near, the source said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If suit is filed, it would be the first since the Justice  
Department began investigating allegations by small carriers that 
their big competitors hold and enforce monopolies over some U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard Airlines, a tiny Kansas City, Mo.-based carrier, filed  
the first complaint in 1996, saying that American and Northwest 
Airlines added flights and cut prices to put it out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Gillman, general counsel for Vanguard, said that Justice  
Department investigators expanded their questioning this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That at least leads the company to believe that they're still  
very serious about bringing a case against American for attempts to 
monopolize and predatory pricing,'' said Gillman, who added he 
doesn't know when or if the government will file charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard, a low-cost airline operating with 11 planes, contends  
that the major airlines' pricing forced it to end flights between 
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Wichita, Kan., and 
Dallas and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the allegations, when an upstart such as Vanguard  
enters a market and offers lower fares, the dominant airline 
matches prices and adds hundreds of seats on the contested route. 
After the small carrier gives up under the weight of the 
competitive pressure, airline fares typically return to earlier, 
higher levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillman said consumers saw fares between Wichita and Dallas  
increase 85 percent after it was pushed out of those routes in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that was with the Justice Department investigation. Could  
you imagine what it would have been without it?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Tuesday, American reasserted it has done  
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we have acknowledged previously, we have been cooperating  
with the Justice Department investigation for almost two years,'' 
the airline said. ``American's action of matching price and service 
is a predictable and well-established competitive response in 
virtually every consumer-oriented business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department sent civil subpoenas last year to small  
airlines looking at air routes at hub airports including, Chicago, 
Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis, Atlanta and New York. The 
department also asked Northwest to hand over records, and 
questioned officials at Delta Air Lines and United Airlines.

<HEADLINE> International Paper Profits Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- International Paper's profits fell 41 percent in  
the first quarter because of lower paper prices, but the company's 
earnings still easily beat Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper reported earnings of $44 million, or 14  
cents a share, down from $75 million or 25 cents a share in the 
same quarter a year ago. Analysts were expecting 5 cents a share, 
according to a survey by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $5 billion in the first quarter of 1999, compared to  
$4.9 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper attributed the profit decline to sharply  
lower paper prices. Many raw materials companies, including paper 
producers, have been hurt by a drop in demand due to economic 
problems in Asia, Latin America and some European countries 
including Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purchase, N.Y.-based company said a higher tax rate also cut  
earnings by 6 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper officials said they have been able to  
increase paper prices in recent months, and sales in Asia are 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, business has clearly improved, and we are optimistic  
that the price increases we announced will be fully implemented in 
the second quarter,'' said John T. Dillon, chairman and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	He cautioned that weakness in several European economies remain  
a concern.

	Kosovo Conflict Widens Into Albania  
</P>
<P>
	BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) -- Serb forces pushed into northern  
Albania on Tuesday, fought an hour-long skirmish with Albanian 
troops, seized a border hamlet and torched homes before 
withdrawing, Albanian officials and international observers said. 
In Belgrade, Yugoslav officials denied any incursion into Albania, 
while at the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said Washington 
had received ``credible reports'' of a Serb incursion, as well as 
past instances of Serb forces crossing the border or shelling 
Albanian territory.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said Tuesday that U.S. reservists  
will probably be ordered to active duty in a buildup of NATO air 
power in the Yugoslavia conflict. ``There will likely be a reserve 
call-up,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon announced. ``The 
details aren't ready to be announced at this stage.'' Several 
hundred Air National Guard members already are on duty as 
volunteers. Three hundred more planes are expected to be sent to

	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar  
Ibrahim was convicted of corruption and sentenced to six years in 
prison Wednesday. The conviction and sentence bars Anwar from 
returning to politics for at least five years after his release. 
During the bizarre trial, which ran for 78 days, the state argued 
that Anwar was a corrupt adulterer. A mattress said to contain 
Anwar's seminal fluids was dragged into the courtroom and key 
witnesses testified he had sex with women and men. Anwar's 
conviction and jail term could make him a larger hero in Malaysia 
and a rallying point for the fragmented opposition.

hostages was identified as a 76-year-old Italian, Giovanni Ferrazi. 
The hostages were freed not far from the remote northern airstrip 
where the twin-engine Fokker 50, carrying 41 passengers and five 
crew, was forced to land after being commandeered Monday en route 
from the northeastern city of Bucaramanga to Bogota.

	Chicago Gun Lawsuit Takes Turn

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A gun dealer has reached a settlement with the  
city in a $433 million landmark lawsuit accusing the gun industry 
of flooding the streets with weapons deliberately marketed to 
criminals. Robert Taborden, owner of Bob's Sports Headquarters in 
suburban Justice, is one of 40 gun dealers and manufacturers named 
in the lawsuit, which was filed by the city and Cook County last 
fall. He is the first to settle. The lawsuit, which officials 
expect to be a national test case, charges the gun industry with 
creating a public nuisance by oversupplying suburban gun stores 
with firearms, knowing they will eventually make their way back 
into the city.

night's game against Seattle. Rodriguez hit a three-run homer in 
the first, a two-run single in the second and his first career 
grand slam in the third as Texas took a 13-0 lead. The All-Star 
catcher came up again with two runners on base in the fifth inning. 
But with a chance to tie the major league record for RBIs in a 
game, he flied out.

<HEADLINE> Shock Vest May Aid in Heart Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Patients waiting for heart transplants are  
testing a vest that could automatically jump-start the heart 
anywhere at anytime, prolonging the lives of cardiac arrest 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liken it to an emergency room on your chest,'' said Douglas  
Zipes, vice president of the American College of Cardiology. ``It 
acts like an emergency room that monitors the heartbeat and 
responds appropriately, much like a doctor would in an ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the device, which looks much like a women's bra with  
small electric shock paddles inside the straps, can jolt a heart 
into beating again and eliminate the need for patients to have 
defibrillators implanted during open chest surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Drug Administration has approved the study at  
clinics around the country and 150 to 300 patients are expected to 
enroll over the next year or so, according to clinics sponsoring 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Eisen, principal investigator for the 6-month-old study  
at Temple University, said Monday that the vest is working well for 
his patients. 
</P>
<P>
	It operates by using sensing electrodes to continuously monitor  
a patient's heart beat. If a potentially fatal rapid heart beat is 
detected, the vest gives a sequence of warning alarms. If the 
patient fails to shut it off in 20 seconds, an electrically 
conductive gel is ejected onto the patient's chest and back, and a 
shock is delivered to restore normal heart rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	If the rhythm is not restored, it will repeat this process up to  
five times in 30-second intervals. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, 350,000 Americans collapse and die of cardiac arrest  
-- their hearts just suddenly stop beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Ricafort, who suffers from a virus that has weakened his  
heart, has been wearing the device about 23 hours a day for the 
last three weeks. The device is barely noticeable underneath his 
clothes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to know I can still have peace of mind of knowing  
that if something goes haywire with me, I have a security 
blanket,'' the 35-year-old former jewelry repairman said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Clinic Operator Accused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The operator of a clinic where a man died two  
hours after receiving an antibiotic injection has been accused by 
the state Medical Board of using unlicensed practitioners to treat 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint against Dr. Miguel Ramon Castillo-Inzunza comes  
amid a crackdown on unlicensed clinics serving immigrants in 
Southern California. Such clinics have been blamed for several 
deaths in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The gross-negligence complaint filed Monday could lead to the  
loss of the doctor's license. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo-Inzunza, who runs clinics in Santa Ana and Escondido,  
was accused of employing unlicensed practitioners who treated and 
examined patients, administered injections and forged prescriptions 
in his name. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Monday, Castillo-Inzunza called the allegations  
``pure lies'' and said all people who work in his clinic are 
licensed. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint cited the case of Pedro Cruz-Sanchez, 32, who died  
of pneumonia in 1997 after he went to the Escondido clinic coughing 
up blood and having difficulty breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of being transferred to an emergency room, he was  
allegedly given an inappropriate dose of an antibiotic and two 
unapproved drugs from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo-Inzunza wasn't present and had left the treatment of  
the patient in the hands of unlicensed people, according to the 
Medical Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he allegedly altered the medical records to make it appear  
he had treated the man and advised him to go the emergency room.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Spanish Prime Minister  
Jose Maria Aznar met Tuesday over dinner to discuss the NATO 
airstrikes in Kosovo and the alliance's upcoming 50th anniversary 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	The president greeted Aznar at the White House driveway and  
escorted him into the residence for what officials described as an 
informal working dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain has contributed F-16s and a C-130 tanker to the NATO

<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton  
appreciates Aznar's ``personal leadership in this matter'' and the 
meeting was ``a chance for both leaders to take stock of the 
campaign to date and look forward to the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other bilateral concerns included Morocco, Algeria, Western  
Sahara and Latin America, Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Discusses Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized Congress on  
Tuesday for seeking international-spending cuts that she said would 
undermine America's ability to lead in the Balkans and around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that is a demonstration of responsible  
leadership,'' she told a coalition of business, humanitarian and 
environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mrs. Clinton chided Congress for cutting international  
spending, President Clinton was meeting with lawmakers at the White 
House seeking additional money to pay for the NATO offensive in 
Yugoslavia. Pentagon officials estimated the supplemental budget 
request for the Kosovo operation would total $3 billion to $4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration budget for fiscal 2000 calls for  
international spending of $21.3 billion. The Senate and House both 
have proposed steep cuts that would reduce outlays to $15 billion 
to $16 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President ``Slobodan Milosevic's brutal and inhuman  
policies of ethnic cleansing were ones that have been addressed by 
economic sanctions, by diplomacy, by human intervention and now by 
military action,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But it is important that we 
recognize that military and humanitarian efforts there underscore 
once again the United States government having the resources we 
need to maintain American leadership, not only in Kosovo but in 
other troubled regions of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who is considering a campaign for the Senate from  
New York, said the United States should pay its back dues to the 
United Nations and increase spending on foreign aid to demonstrate 
its commitment to democracy and free market economies. ``We also 
see the need for Americans to cooperate with multilateral 
organizations and international institutions like the United 
Nations to share the cost burdens of intervention and assistance,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has conditioned payment of back U.S. dues to the United  
Nations on financial and other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spoke to the Campaign to Preserve U.S. Global  
Leadership, a coalition that includes companies such as Lockheed 
Martin Corp. and humanitarian organizations such as CARE. She 
received three standing ovations, and after her speech stopped to 
shake hands and pose for pictures with members of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition plans to lobby Congress about U.S. leadership in  
international affairs and the need for sufficient financial means 
to exercise it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said the Kosovo crisis makes this a ``particularly  
fitting moment to be making the case for international 
engagement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our military and humanitarian efforts there underscore the  
need once again that the United States government have the 
resources'' to lead in the Balkans and elsewhere in the world, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has made some progress in stemming  
reductions in spending on international affairs, according to Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we also suffered some defeats,'' she said, ``Once again  
Congress refused to pay our debts to the United Nations. Overall, 
we have to recognize that (foreign) development assistance is at 
its lowest level since World War II'' and less in percentage terms 
compared with what U.S. allies spend. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations says the United States owes $1.7 billion.  
Congress passed legislation last year that would have paid off a 
chunk of the debt, but Clinton vetoed the bill because it contained 
unrelated abortion restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers To Stay in Stadium for Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fox intends to keep the Los Angeles Dodgers  
in Dodger Stadium, at least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Group, which owns the team, and the Dodgers confirmed a  
report that ``parties associated with the NFL'' had presented a 
proposal to relocate the team to a new stadium next to the Los 
Angeles Coliseum, some five miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proposal brought to us, one of many we have seen, is too  
preliminary and nonspecific for us to comment on,'' Fox and the 
Dodgers said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nonetheless, we are progressing with our plans of investment  
in -- and limited renovation of -- Dodger Stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Included in those plans are club level suites, a new Dugout  
Club, and additional seats in the dugout area and along the foul 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Though very preliminary, the proposal to have the Dodgers move  
to Exposition Park has triggered enthusiasm from NFL officials wary 
of bringing football back to the drab neighborhood surrounding the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL has indicated that they wish to give the idea  
significant consideration. This could be a blockbuster idea,'' said 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, whose district includes Exposition 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea also brought skepticism from critics questioning  
whether the move could win community approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, the new baseball stadium would be built on  
the site of the antiquated Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The renovation of Dodger Stadium apparently would not end the  
possibility of the team getting a new stadium in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we have said before, this program does not resolve the  
long-term issues that the Dodgers face,'' Fox officials said. ``We 
will work to develop a long-term plan to address these issues, 
while recognizing the special relationship our fans have with 
Dodger Stadium.''

<HEADLINE> King World Gets Earnings Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Hollywood Squares'' helped give leading TV  
syndicator King World Productions Inc. a 17 percent earnings boost 
in the second quarter, the company reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	King World, which recently agreed to be acquired by CBS Corp.  
for $2.5 billion, earned $39.3 million, or 53 cents per share, for 
the three months ending Feb. 28. That was up from $33.6 million, or 
44 cents per share, for the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``Hollywood Squares,'' King World also  
distributes ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of 
Fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations. The  
company's stock was up up 2.4 percent or 81 1/4 cents at $35.68 3/4 on 
the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were up 14 percent, to $197.5 million from $173.9  
million. The increase was attributed chiefly to the September 
premiere of ``The Roseanne Show'' and ``Hollywood Squares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``The Roseanne Show'' has not prospered, ``Hollywood  
Squares'' is the top new daily syndicated program. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the new revenues offset losses from the  
cancellation of ``American Journal'' and poorer performance by 
``Inside Edition,'' which remains the top syndicated news magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' was the company's biggest moneymaker,  
accounting for nearly half of its revenues.

<HEADLINE> IRS: Not Much Taxpayer Rights Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service's criminal  
division has ``drifted'' from its proper focus on tax enforcement 
but is not guilty of widespread violation of taxpayer rights, 
according to an independent review released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A task force of federal law enforcement officials headed by  
William Webster, a former federal judge and former director of both 
the FBI and the CIA, said instances in which taxpayer rights are 
violated are ``isolated and individual'' despite some high-profile 
horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``No evidence was found of systemic abuses,'' Webster wrote. But  
he cautioned that agents must be aware ``that even isolated 
instances of abuse of authority can create impressions that 
undermine the public's confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found that the 3,000-agent IRS Criminal  
Investigation Division properly uses search warrants, grand juries 
and raids, and that deadly force was extremely limited. In fact, 
since 1995 only one case involved use of a firearm -- the shooting 
of a pit bull dog that charged an agent during a search. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence in the use-of-force incidents to suggest  
that CI agents are overly aggressive, use force unnecessarily or 
are improperly trained,'' Webster wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, of 87 claims of rights violations filed against  
IRS agents from 1996 through 1998, none was successful. And 93 
percent of lawsuits against IRS enforcement agents during that 
period involved motor vehicle accidents. Only three cases involved 
IRS use of search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	But the division, Webster wrote, has ``drifted from its primary  
mission,'' which is to ``investigate criminal violations of the 
internal revenue code.'' This has happened mainly because the 
division possesses ``sophisticated financial expertise'' needed by 
other law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, 25 percent of agents' time is spent on drug  
investigations and they are often under the control of a local U.S. 
attorney as part of a wider-ranging criminal probe. This does 
little to help collect an estimated $195 billion in annual unpaid 
taxes, Webster found. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster urged the division to rededicate itself to enforcing the  
tax laws and not get sidetracked on the tax aspects of crimes such 
as money laundering and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS strategy, he added, should ``determine who is not paying  
their taxes and what remedies will most effectively bring them into 
compliance and deter others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., said  
this conclusion ``raises the question of whether the whole division 
should be restructured'' to ensure it does the job right. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Webster, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti agreed  
with the conclusions and promised ``more considered decisions'' 
regarding use of criminal investigation agents for matters other 
than tax compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti told reporters Tuesday he was pleased that the report  
recognized CID as ``an important part'' of the IRS mission and that 
the vast majority of its agents did their jobs professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need this function,'' he said. ``This is the only  
operation in the government that can do this.''

<HEADLINE> Brother Said To Brag of Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Last week, Chevie Kehoe's mother  
testified that her son admitted killing an Arkansas gun dealer and 
his family. Now his younger brother has done the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheyne Kehoe, avoiding eye contact with his older sibling, told  
a federal court jury Monday that Chevie Kehoe bragged about the 
killings shortly before the pair were involved in a shootout with 
Ohio police. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevie Kehoe, 26, of Colville, Wash., is charged along with  
Danny Lee, 26, of Yukon, Okla., with racketeering, conspiracy and 
murder in an alleged plot to set up a whites-only nation in the 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheyne Kehoe, 22, said he and Chevie were touring the South with  
their families when his brother told him about killing gun dealer 
William Mueller, his wife, Nancy, and her 8-year-old daughter, 
Sarah Powell. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that Danny and him had decided to do a hit on the  
Muellers due to the fact that, for one thing, he thought that they 
were government informants and he knew that they had a large amount 
of gold and silver stored at their house,'' Cheyne Kehoe told 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by prosecutors about Chevie Kehoe's attitude about the  
killings, the younger brother replied: ``It was a braggart-type 
attitude -- a macho attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheyne Kehoe said he continued traveling with his brother out of  
fear that he would be killed if he left. They eventually camped in 
Ohio and were returning from a gun show when they were pulled over 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kehoes' subsequent shootout with law officers was taped by  
police video cameras and televised nationally. Both Chevie and 
Cheyne Kehoe were convicted in the Feb. 15, 1997, gun fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheyne Kehoe was sentenced to 24 1/2 years in state prison. The  
judge deferred Chevie Kehoe's sentencing until the Arkansas case is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal case,  
Cheyne Kehoe testified against his brother and Lee under a grant of 
immunity. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Gloria Kehoe testified with tears in her eyes that  
her eldest son had admitted to killing the Muellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be told, Chevie,'' Mrs. Kehoe said. ``There's  
wrong and there's right. God won't let me live with it anymore. I'm 
very sorry.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vows To Seal China Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu  
Rongji agreed Tuesday to ``move intensively'' toward resolution of 
negotiations on trade and China's entrance into the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement in a joint U.S.-China statement issued by the  
White House came as the administration rebutted congressional 
criticism of its failure to complete a trade deal and open China's 
vast market to U.S. exporters during Zhu's visit here last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu and Clinton spoke by phone while the Chinese premier was  
visiting New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the conversation, they agreed that both sides should  
move intensively on negotiations toward resolution of the remaining 
issues in their talks on China's accession to the WTO,'' the joint 
communique said. ``They have agreed to have negotiations continue 
by the end of the month in Beijing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a CNN interview broadcast Tuesday night, Zhu said  
negotiations were in ``the final stages'' and he expressed optimism 
an agreement would be reached this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, based on what I've heard from some Congress people and  
also some other information and other reports that I've heard, they 
say that it may take another two or three months,'' he said. ``But 
of course, I would much rather see it happen in another two weeks 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told lawmakers  
earlier Tuesday that Clinton was committed to seeing that 
negotiations are finished in time to clear the way for China to 
join the World Trade Organization this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will re-engage with the Chinese shortly ... and work on  
each of the issues that are open to bring this full agreement to 
closure,'' Barshefsky told members of the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators expressed fear that a number of major concessions  
China was willing to make last week in order to close a deal during 
a U.S. visit by Zhu may now be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Several pointed to comments made by Zhu and other Chinese  
officials criticizing the administration for mischaracterizing 
commitments China has made and even the United States issued a 
detailed 17-page fact sheet outlining the Chinese offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu complained last Friday the administration had ``made public  
many documents and said we had agreed to them, but in fact we have 
not agreed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., warned Barshefsky that the  
administration was in danger of losing a deal that is very good in 
its effort to get better offers in a few sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, was even blunter. He accused the  
administration of abandoning free-trade principles in an effort to 
force the Chinese to agree to blatantly protectionist provisions 
being pushed by U.S. textile and steel companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the government's stance ``raw, rotten protectionism,''  
Gramm said the administration was trying to force China to extend 
U.S. textile quotas for five years longer than currently allowed 
under WTO rules. He said America's high barriers in this area 
already cost the average family of four $700 more in clothing bills 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to lose more jobs by protecting noncompetitive  
American industries than we are going to possibly gain in those 
areas,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky denied reports that she urged Clinton to accept the  
offers China had on the table but was overruled by the president. 
She said the administration was unified in the belief that it had 
to have a better offer to present to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have expressed the idea that  
allegations about Chinese espionage and human rights abuses in 
China had made it even harder to win congressional approval for any 
trade deal short of an exceptional market-opening package. 
</P>
<P>
	According to one administration strategy being considered, U.S.  
and Chinese negotiators would wrap up a deal this year but delay a 
congressional vote on the matter until after the 2000 presidential 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Under this approach, China would join the Geneva-based WTO, but  
the United States would ``reserve approval.'' That would mean U.S. 
business would not get the benefits of China's market-opening moves 
until Congress got around to passing legislation ending annual 
reviews of U.S. tariff rates for Chinese goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky told reporters after the hearing that the  
administration was intent on restarting negotiations quickly once 
Zhu returns to China. He was in New York on Tuesday and travels to 
Canada before returning to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky rejected suggestions that Chinese negotiators are  
likely, if the talks drag on, to start withdrawing offers already 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should expect to see Chinese backsliding in  
these areas,'' she said. ``I do expect that we will be able to take 
up negotiations where we left off.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Iraq Investment Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States rejected a proposal to  
allow foreign investment in Iraq's struggling oil sector, saying 
increasing oil prices mean Baghdad may not need outside help. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has been exporting less oil than the full amount allowed  
under the U.N. oil-for-food program recently, in part because its 
industry is dilapidated. A U.N. panel had recommended investment as 
a way to bring more money into the program, which allows Iraq to 
sell oil to buy humanitarian aid for its people. 
</P>
<P>
	But deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh noted Monday that  
prices for Iraqi crude are up and oil industry experts are 
projecting a further increase, which by the end of the year could 
be high enough to fill the sales quota. 
</P>
<P>
	The program allows Iraq to sell $5.2 billion in oil over six  
months for humanitarian aid for its 22 million people suffering the 
effects of U.N. sanctions. In the last six-month period Iraq only 
exported about $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the oil-for-food program reported that Iraq exported  
$211 million of oil in the week ending April 9, the highest amount 
in months. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also opposes foreign investment in Iraq  
because it would have the unintended effect of lifting some 
sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Burleigh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burleigh spoke after the council met to consider the  
humanitarian panel's recommendations, which also included a 
proposal that Iraq be allowed unlimited oil exports -- provided the 
revenues continue to be funneled through the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said Iraq should be allowed to purchase food and  
medicine already exempt from sanctions, without getting approval 
from the U.N. sanctions committee. It also recommended ways to 
improve distribution and support local farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared to agree to some changes now,'' Burleigh said,  
``but not these deep structural ones like the foreign investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While France, Russia and China are calling for the lifting of  
sanctions to entice Iraq to allow arms inspections to continue, the 
United States and Britain are wary of any proposal that could be 
seen as weakening the sanctions regime.

<HEADLINE> Breezes Bring Plant-Killing Spores / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- Cuban imports are ruining the business of  
some Southern tobacco farmers, but don't blame Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind, not Cuba's cigar-smoking leader, is responsible for  
these imports: killer spores that are damaging the tobacco crop in 
southern Georgia and northern Florida this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The spores also are plaguing tobacco plants as far north as  
Canada and as far west as Kentucky, as well as tobacco farmers in 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny invaders known as sporangiospores cause a disease  
called blue mold, and they have cost Kentucky burley tobacco 
growers an estimated $300 million since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue mold losses this year have forced some Georgia growers to  
replant their fields, said Rick Moss, a Colquitt County farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are billions and billions of spores that blow in here  
from the Caribbean,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Infected plants often die, or fail to produce normal yields. But  
with effective fungicides and proper weather conditions, they can 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Released by tobacco plants, the spores can spread quickly  
through greenhouses and plant beds during their 72-hour lifespan. 
Initially, they attacked only the tender tobacco plants grown in 
covered plant beds or greenhouses during the winter and moved to 
the fields in the spring. Blue mold could not survive hot, summer 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed about 1979, with the arrival of a heat-tolerant  
strain that caused a $250-million loss in the United States and a 
$100-million loss in Canada. The disease changed again in the early 
1990s, becoming resistant to the pesticide Ridomil, which had been 
the most effective defense against it. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture Tommy Irvin  
approved the use of fungicide Acrobat MZ on a temporary basis. 
Acrobat -- which protects healthy plants, but does not cure diseased 
plants -- costs between $20 and $30 per acre and has to be applied 
every five to seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be an economic disaster if we have to spray ... every  
five days from now until August,'' Moss said. ``Even if we control 
it, it could dramatically drive up our cost of production. We're 
hoping we can make one or two applications and have a normal 
crop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blown in from Latin America and the Caribbean, where tobacco is  
a winter crop, the spores invade Florida, Georgia and Texas first 
and then spread farther north. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is more serious than usual this year because blue  
mold was discovered in March, a month early, said Charles E. Main, 
leader of the school's North American Blue Mold Forecast Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that happens it gives the disease more time to go farther  
and cause more damage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The center provides three forecasts a week from March through  
September to give growers an early warning. If growers spray 
fungicides before the spores arrive, they can minimize losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the latest forecasts show the spores traveling from  
western Cuba to the Florida Panhandle, from Statenville and 
Moultrie, Ga., into South Carolina and from Mexico into Texas, 
Oklahoma and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	If Georgia and Florida growers don't attack blue mold  
aggressively, it intensifies problems farther north, possibly 
moving the disease through Pennsylvania, Missouri, Wisconsin, Ohio, 
Connecticut, Massachusetts and, ultimately, Canada.

<HEADLINE> Wohlers Ready To Try Another Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark Wohlers is ready to see if a change of  
scenery might be what he needs to revive his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think, for personal and professional reasons, that it's  
best for me to get a new start,'' the Atlanta Braves reliever said 
told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The relief ace, unable to solve his control trouble, refused to  
accept an outright assignment to Triple-A Richmond, his right under 
baseball's labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Braves don't trade him by April 22, they will have to  
release him and have to pay the rest of his $5.2 million for this 
season and an $800,000 buyout for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my contract being up, was I going to have to start with a  
new organization next year?'' Wohlers said in an interview 
published Tuesday. ``If that was going to happen and I was going to 
go to Richmond now, then maybe there's an opportunity where I can 
pitch in the minor leagues for someone else. Maybe I'd have an 
opportunity to come back and pitch in the big leagues this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers was the Braves' star reliever in 1995, when he saved the  
final game of the only World Series the Braves have won. He set an 
Atlanta record with 39 saves the following year and had 22 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1998 he pulled a muscle in his side, apparently tried to  
come back too soon and had trouble throwing strikes. He was sent to 
Richmond, but had no success there either. 
</P>
<P>
	He came back this spring and showed progress in exhibition  
games, but he walked four of his first seven batters in the season 
opener and walked two of three in his next appearance, and also 
made a throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the ultimate decision was (that) I think I've tapped  
as many resources as I can in this organization,'' Wohlers said. 
``I tried the Richmond thing and it didn't work out. Several people 
very close to me -- the therapist I've been working with -- have said 
that going back there just kind of repeats history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wasn't surprised at the Braves' move.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know something obviously needed to be done,'' he said. ``You  
know, I don't blame them for having to make this decision. It's 
unfortunate that it's ended this way. It's been a heck of a run for 
me, back since 1991. There's nothing more I could have hoped for 
than to be able to contribute to this organization's winning 
another championship. But it's just not going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox called Wohlers from Philadelphia, where the  
Braves beat the Phillies 8-6 Monday, to wish him well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's smart on his part,'' Cox said. ``There will be 29  
clubs clamoring to get him. I think a fresh start will be good for 
him. I'm pulling for him. I hope he goes to the American League and 
shoots lights out.''

	Kevorkian Gets 10 to 25 Years  
</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A judge sentenced Dr. Jack Kevorkian to 10  
to 25 years in prison today for the killing of a Lou Gehrig's 
disease patient who asked to die. Judge Jessica Cooper sentenced 
the 70-year-old Kevorkian after harshly criticizing his methods in 
killing Thomas Youk, whose death by injection was videotaped and 
shown on CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes.'' He was convicted of second-degree 
murder in that case. Kevorkian also was sentenced to three to seven 
years for delivery of a controlled substance. The sentences will 
run concurrently. Kevorkian will be eligible for parole after 
serving two-thirds of his sentence.

	Clinton Calls Airstrikes Effective

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that the NATO  
airstrikes are ``diminishing and grinding down'' Slobodan 
Milosevic's military capabilities. Clinton offered his assessment 
after talks with House and Senate members, many of whom urged him 
either to use ground troops or to preposition them in Europe for 
possible use. But the administration pressed its insistence that 
the conflict in the Balkans could be resolved by air power alone. 
The Pentagon was preparing to send another 300 U.S. warplanes into

Albanian officials said. Yugoslavia denied its forces entered 
Albania. ``This is an absolutely false allegation,'' said Nebojsa

warned the Yugoslavs not to widen the war. The reported incident 
occurred hours after NATO aircraft hit Yugoslavia's biggest oil

<HEADLINE> New Breast Cancer Drug Result Noted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- More research on the newly approved drug  
Herceptin has yielded convincing evidence that it extends the lives 
of victims of advanced breast cancer, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement in survival is small -- an average of about four  
months so far -- but experts say it is noteworthy in a disease that 
until now has eluded all efforts to slow the progression to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Herceptin, a tailor-made antibody that targets bad genes, was  
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September for use 
in breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. 
Doctors call that metastatic disease. 
</P>
<P>
	One of its key developers was Dr. Dennis Slamon of the  
University of California at Los Angeles. Slamon reported updated 
survival figures Tuesday when he received an award for his work at 
a meeting in Philadelphia of the American Association for Cancer 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was conducted between 1995 and 1997. Last year,  
doctors reported modestly improved survival with Herceptin after 
one year of follow-up. The risk of death was 16 percent lower in 
those getting the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they say the survival advantage of Herceptin patients seems  
to be increasing. The latest data show that two years after the 
study ended, this risk was 22 percent lower in the Herceptin women. 
Their survival averaged 24.8 months, compared with 20.4 months in 
women receiving standard treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Metastatic breast cancer is not a curable disease,'' Slamon  
said. ``That's the dogma. All we can do is fight a staying action. 
This is the first time that we have ever seen a survival impact of 
a treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted that further follow-up will show an even greater  
survival advantage among women getting the new drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors believe Herceptin is especially notable because it  
represents a new approach to cancer -- targeting the peculiarities 
of malignant cells without harming the rest of the body. In 
addition, Herceptin carries none of the usual cancer drug side 
effects, such as nausea and hair loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``These results are particularly landmark,'' said Dr. Drew  
Pardoll of Johns Hopkins University. ``This ushers in a new age of 
understanding cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is intended for the one-quarter or more of breast  
cancer patients whose tumors are driven by multiple copies of a 
gene called HER-2. It substantially boosts the power of ordinary 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers predict the results could be much more impressive  
when the drug is given at earlier stages of the disease, before it 
has moved beyond the breast and lymph nodes.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Rise 0.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retail sales rose in March for the eighth  
straight month as consumers rushed spring shopping for an early 
Easter and spent big tax refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales -- which represent about a third of the nation's  
economic output -- climbed a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent last 
month to a seasonally adjusted $239.6 billion, the Commerce 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	That modest rise came on top of big sales gains of 1.3 percent  
in January and 1.7 percent in February -- the biggest monthly jump 
in five years. Both the January and February figures were revised 
upward from previous estimates -- February's substantially, from 0.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales have climbed every month since August.  
</P>
<P>
	Contributing to the March rise, tax refunds are up nearly 20  
percent compared to this time last year and usual holiday shopping 
sprees came early, since Easter fell on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Also driving the recent stretch of robust sales: Unemployment is  
near a 29-year low, stock prices as measured by the Dow Jones 
average of industrial stocks have hit record highs and interest 
rates are tame. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans' appetite for shopping is helping keep economic growth  
brisk even though the country's export sales are slow because of 
global economic problems that began two years ago in Asia. 
</P>

	In March, sales of durable goods -- items expected to last three  
years or more -- fell 0.2 percent, after rising a big 2.7 percent in 
February. The March decline was the first since July. 
</P>
<P>
	Automotive sales were off 0.5 percent and sales at building  
supply and hardware stores fell 0.4 percent, also after much larger 
gains the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at furniture stores, however, continued to rise, by 0.2  
percent in March. Low mortgage rates have fueled a home-buying boom 
that has led to spending on new furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding volatile auto sales, total retail sales were up 0.5  
percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of nondurable goods were up 0.6 after rising by 1 percent  
in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at apparel and accessory shops jumped 1.6 percent and rose  
0.7 percent at department and general merchandise stores. At 
grocery and other food stores, sales dropped 0.5 percent after a 
1.5 percent increase in February, and bar and restaurant patronage 
declined by 0.4 percent. Drug store sales were up 1 percent and 
sales at gasoline service stations rose 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Fourth Lynx Dies in Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A fourth Canada lynx reintroduced into the Rio  
Grande National Forest has apparently starved to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead female's carcass was discovered Saturday. Three other  
tuft-eared cats have died this year and one was recaptured because 
of weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had made kills out there,'' Division of Wildlife spokesman  
Todd Malmsbury said Monday. ``But she'd obviously not gotten enough 
to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The division's goal is to reintroduce 50 to 55 animals into the  
remote wilderness this spring as the first phase of a three-year, 
$1.4 million project. 
</P>
<P>
	Some animal rights activists have asked officials to discontinue  
the program, questioning whether the area's habitat is still 
suitable for the lynx. 
</P>
<P>
	But conservationists note that reintroduction efforts often face  
stumbling blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Malmsbury, who predicted a 50 percent mortality rate before the  
lynx program began, said the recent deaths are disheartening but 
don't justify canceling the project. 
</P>
<P>
	There are now eight cats roaming Colorado's mountains, and 23  
cats in a holding facility waiting for release. Seven more cats 
were expected to arrive from Alaska today, said Malmsbury. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's lynx population was declared endangered after the  
last was found in 1973 just outside the Vail ski area.

<HEADLINE> Aikman Signs $85.5M Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Leave it to Jerry Jones to pay Troy Aikman  
an NFL-record $85.5 million and still walk away looking like he got 
the better end of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	By reworking the three remaining years on Aikman's contract, the  
Dallas Cowboys owner freed enough room under the salary cap to sign 
center Mark Stepnoski on Tuesday and likely add free agents Raghib 
Ismail and Quentin Coryatt before the Saturday's college draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman's reward for being a good trooper? A six-year extension  
that makes him the highest-paid player in pro football history and 
includes a $20 million signing bonus that's among the biggest in 
pro sports history. Aikman, who will be 41 when the deal ends in 
2007, already has received $13 million and will get the other $7 
million in early 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	A league source speaking on condition of anonymity divulged the  
contract details to The Associated Press late Tuesday. Neither 
Jones nor Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, would discuss the 
specifics of the deal other than to say it gives Dallas much more 
flexibility under the salary cap for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's structured in a way that it is beneficial to the longterm  
goals of our organization from the standpoint of the salary cap,'' 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman's previous contract also put him atop the NFL's salary  
chart, and he reworked it almost every year to help Jones re-sign 
key players or to bring in free agents. Steinberg said Aikman again 
did not want his contract to be an obstacle for Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to free up cap room so that Troy could play with  
a competitive team,'' Steinberg said. ``He wants more rings on his 
fingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys reportedly have had verbal agreements with  
Stepnoski, Ismail and Coryatt for several weeks, but couldn't 
finalize the deals until they had the salary cap room to sign them. 
The NFL is investigating whether that happened and if the team 
violated league rules. 
</P>
<P>
	With that black cloud hovering, Jones met with Steinberg at team  
headquarters late Friday into early Saturday and hammered out the 
framework for Aikman's new deal. It was signed Monday and announced 
Tuesday during a news conference intended to feature Stepnoski. 
Neither Aikman nor Steinberg were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said that while the dollar distribution of the Aikman deal  
will greatly help the team in free agency, he thinks a bigger 
benefit is that Aikman will definitely be a Cowboy for many years 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players like to come to teams that have great quarterbacks.  
And we believe in this organization that we have one of, if not the 
finest skilled player at the position,'' Jones said. ``We can 
fundamentally build our organization around Troy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman was the first overall selection in the 1989 draft and the  
first player picked under Jones' regime. He guided Dallas' 
transformation from 1-15 to Super Bowl champions three seasons 
later. He's since become one of only three quarterbacks to lead a 
team to three Super Bowl victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``His talent and commitment will help us ultimately get back to  
the Super Bowl,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones may not be done trimming Dallas' payroll. Fullback Daryl  
Johnston, who was exposed in the expansion draft, will likely have 
to take a pay cut or be released. Ditto for receiver Billy Davis, 
who didn't live up to the big contract he signed before last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, who also represents Johnston, said his client ``would  
very much like to stay with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Next on Jones' list of contracts to extend is Deion Sanders, who  
is going into the last year of his deal. Jones called his talks 
with Sanders' agent Eugene Park ``a work in progress,'' adding that 
no deal is imminent.

<HEADLINE> Masters To Change Entry Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The next big change at the Masters took  
place as soon as Jose Maria Olazabal made his short par putt to win 
his second green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this one has more to do with Magnolia Lane than the  
Eisenhower Pine. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem for just about everyone was how to navigate the  
additional 25 yards on the 17th hole, which made the infamous pine 
tree look like a huge catcher's mitt waiting to nab any tee shot 
that wasn't high and long, or right to left. 
</P>
<P>
	What used to be the ninth-easiest hole in the Masters became the  
third hardest. Where Mark O'Meara and Jack Nicklaus once made 
crucial birdies, Olazabal locked up his victory with a par. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year's change won't be found anywhere on the course. The  
key landmark could be the small, green security shack that sits at 
the front gate of Augusta National Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every PGA Tour winner will get in.  
</P>
<P>
	Starting this week with the MCI Classic, winning on the PGA Tour  
no longer guarantees an invitation to the Masters. Augusta National 
is looking for a field that reflects the time, and it's looking 
more at the world ranking and the money list than someone it feels 
may have done nothing more than catch lightning in a bottle for 
four days. 
</P>
<P>
	One of eight players to get into the 63rd Masters that way was  
accident-prone Steve Pate, whose win in the CVS Charity Classic 
last year earned him his first trip down Magnolia Lane in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Pate, we would not have had his Masters-record seven  
consecutive birdies for a 65 in the third round, the best score of 
the tournament, and his gritty par saves that kept him around the 
lead until the 70th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other end of the spectrum was Joe Durant, who won the  
Western Open in July. He stood wide-eyed outside the Augusta 
National clubhouse Wednesday morning while getting ready to play in 
the Par-3 Contest, soaking in the environment around him. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminded that no one has ever won the Par-3 and the Masters,  
Durant smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll dunk a few in the water,'' he replied.  
</P>
<P>
	He won the Par-3 and had an 87 in the first round. Still, it was  
a week to cherish. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Masters has been a rite of spring for more than 60  
years, getting into the most exclusive major championship has 
always been just as fascinating. The thrill for winning tournaments 
had just as much to do with getting in the Masters as it did with a 
two-year exemption on tour or the boodle of money that came with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've read everything there is to read about Augusta,'' said  
Brandel Chamblee, who won in Vancouver last year and could barely 
sleep the night before he showed up for the Masters. ``I'd love to 
be a member here. Who wouldn't?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Stankowski won the week before the 1996 Masters and was so  
excited to be there that he scooped sand out of the bunker to take 
home as a memento. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember Davis Love III? He failed to win in 1994 and finished  
outside the top 30 on the money list. The only way to get to 
Augusta was by winning in New Orleans the week before, which he 
did. Then he finished one stroke behind Ben Crenshaw in the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	There are new ways to get back to the Masters. Instead of taking  
the top 30 on the money list, Augusta National has expanded it to 
the top 40. Still, seven PGA Tour members who won a tournament last 
year finished lower than that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Masters will also take the top four from the British Open  
instead of just the champion. Only the top 16 from the Masters 
(down from 24), the top eight from the U.S. Open and the top four 
from the PGA (both cut in half from previous years) will be invited 
back to Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea behind the change is to strengthen the field, even  
though the Masters will remain the weakest of the fields among 
majors as long as Doug Ford, Gay Brewer and other aging former 
champions continue to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not to say that the tournament winners aren't very good  
players ... but it's going to be the most consistent player week 
after week that's going to be in there,'' said Will Nicholson, 
chairman of the competition committee for the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	The message to this week's winner, assuming it's not Love for  
the fifth time at Hilton Head or someone else with world-class 
credentials, is simple. 
</P>
<P>
	It's going to take a lot more than one great week to get past  
the guard at Augusta's gate.

<HEADLINE> Grounded Boat Spills Gas Off Hawaii </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPAA, Hawaii (AP) -- A commercial fishing vessel grounded on a  
reef off Kauai's east coast broke up in heavy surf Tuesday, 
spilling about 16,000 gallons of diesel fuel into waters with 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard said the pilothouse of the 95-foot longliner Van  
Loi separated from the main deck after a pounding by strong winds 
and waves of up to 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The waters are inhabited by endangered Hawaiian monk seals and  
green sea turtles. 
</P>
<P>
	The seals are the second-most endangered mammal in American  
waters after the northern right whale. About 1,300 seals remain in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't found any evidence of standing diesel fuel on any  
beaches or in wave pools around here,'' Coast Guard Lt. Danny 
LeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors in several hotels complained of nausea from the fumes.  
</P>
<P>
	Debris such as fishing equipment, floats, lumber, insulating  
foam and fishing nets have washed ashore, smelling of fuel. The 
ship's cargo of fish also spilled into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Honolulu-based vessel grounded Saturday morning on the reef  
just off shore and began taking on water. Its six Vietnamese 
crewmen were evacuated.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lights at the White House residence, the Old

<HEADLINE> Former Umpire John Flaherty Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- John F. ``Red'' Flaherty, a former  
American League umpire, died at his home after a lengthy illness. 
He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Flaherty, who died April 1, worked four World Series in his  
21-year big league career that began in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Flaherty found himself in the limelight in 1954, when he was  
officiating at a game between the Washington Senators and the New 
York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	He called a Senators' base runner ``out'' at home plate when he  
tried to score from second on a single. Attending the game was 
President Eisenhower, who yelled out, ``No!'' Later in the locker 
room, Flaherty was asked whether Eisenhower's displeasure made him 
rethink his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Flaherty said. ``It wasn't even close.''  
</P>
<P>
	Flaherty's survivors include his wife of 54 years, Jeannette C.  
(Thompson); a son, Peter and grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 10,395.01 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials closed at a record  
high for the second straight day Tuesday, but the rest of the stock 
market lagged as investors collected profits, particularly from 
technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 55.50 to 10,395.01, topping Monday's record close,  
after having moved in and out of positive territory throughout the 
day. The blue chip index rose as high as 10,418.87, a gain of 
nearly 80 points, in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors bought the shares of economically sensitive companies  
such as basic materials processors and manufacturers, which sent 
the Dow higher. But they shed technology issues, aside from 
Internet-related stocks, for a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	That selling took broader market indicators lower. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 8.82 to 1,349.82, while the 
technology-sensitive Nasdaq composite fell 15.31 to 2,583.50. 
Tuesday was the Nasdaq market's second-heaviest trading day ever, 
with more than 1.3 billion shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a continuation of the last week or so's trend of  
market rotation out of tech stocks and into other sectors of the 
market,'' said Charles Crane, chief market strategist at Key Asset 
Management in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, still unsettled by Compaq Computer's warning late  
Friday of a disappointing earnings report, sold technology stocks. 
Compaq, which fell nearly 7 on Monday, eased another 3/16 to 23 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were anxiously awaiting microchip maker Intel's  
earnings, which were released after the close of trading Tuesday. 
Intel, whose performance is seen as a bellwether for other 
high-tech companies, fell 3/4 to 60 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders' fears proved unfounded. Intel said its  
first-quarter profits rose sharply to 57 cents a share, beating 
analysts' forecasts of 55 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Positive earnings reports lifted some stocks Tuesday,  
particularly in the financial services sector. Broker Paine Webber 
climbed 3 5/8 to 47 1/4 after releasing its quarterly report. 
</P>
<P>
	But Merrill Lynch retreated 2 5/8 to 97 3/8 despite its announcement  
of strong first-quarter profits. Analysts suggested investors may 
have zeroed in on weaker investment banking revenue at Merrill, and 
one trader said the stock may have fallen on rumors that Merrill 
may be considering an acquisition of discount broker Charles 
Schwab, whose stock climbed 15 1/2 to 150 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller-company stocks put in a good day as well, said Barry  
Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, noting 
that the broader market must follow along with the Dow stocks for 
the market to go higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.92 to 417.24.  
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues edged out decliners by 1,554 to 1,488 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume totaled just 
under 1 billion shares, down slightly from Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 1.46 to 631.67, but the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.48 to 737.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, stocks were also depressed by higher bond market  
interest rates. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 5.49 
percent from 5.45 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields rose on supply concerns, with $10 billion in new  
corporate and government-agency debt to be issued soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were unaffected by a Labor Department report that  
consumer prices edged up a manageable 0.2 percent in March, a sign 
that inflation is under control. The government also reported 
retail sales rose a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo advanced 1.26  
amid anticipation of another strong day on Wall Street. In Europe, 
the FT-SE 100 index in London closed up 71.9 points, or 1.1 percent 
at a record high of at 6,513.1, boosted by strong performances of 
blue-chip issues on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The DAX index in Frankfurt added 0.78 percent, and the CAC in  
Paris rose 0.28 percent.

<HEADLINE> Brits Warn Belfast Talks Could Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Northern Ireland peace  
agreement will fail if the province's feuding politicians keep 
sticking selfishly to their positions, Britain's top official here 
warned today as negotiations to form a Protestant-Catholic 
government resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the British and Irish prime ministers, Tony  
Blair and Bertie Ahern, published a compromise plan for forming the 
new Belfast government, the intended centerpiece of last year's 
peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Irish Republican Army and its allied Sinn Fein party  
already have rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo Mowlam, Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland,  
said the plan represented the two governments' best estimation of 
how to resolve the dilemma blocking progress: how to get past the 
IRA's refusal to disarm, when Protestant politicians demand 
disarmament begin before they work alongside Sinn Fein in 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The premiers' proposal called for Sinn Fein to receive its two  
allotted posts in the envisioned 12-member government -- if, in 
exchange, the IRA promised to start disarming within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the two prime ministers' best guess as to how we  
might move forward,'' Mowlam said. ``But let us not be under any 
illusion. Any alternative must be acceptable to both traditions, 
otherwise this is not going to work. If people are only prepared to 
fight their own corner, then progress cannot be made ... and 
nothing that the prime ministers can do will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Blair and Ahern said they might get directly  
involved again in the Belfast negotiations, possibly Thursday, but 
only if the key local parties inched closer together. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists,  
emphasized following an internal policy-making meeting Monday that 
they considered the Ahern-Blair formula ``a basis for 
negotiation,'' particularly since it emphasized the IRA's 
``obligation'' to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sinn Fein today accused Ahern, Blair and the Ulster  
Unionists of trying to rewrite the April 1998 landmark accord, 
which specified no date when disarmament must start, only that it 
should finish by May 2000. It also did not explicitly tie 
disarmament to Sinn Fein's eligibility for office. 
</P>
<P>
	The major Catholic-supported party, the Social Democratic and  
Labor Party, has also criticized Sinn Fein and the IRA for 
receiving benefits from the agreement, such as paroles for IRA 
prisoners, but delivering nothing new in return. 
</P>
<P>
	The SDLP, however, is loath to sanction what the Ulster  
Unionists have repeatedly sought -- to form a government that 
excludes Sinn Fein and leaves all Catholic representation in 
moderate SDLP hands.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded  
heavily Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock

<P>
                               *NYSE

<P>
 *Schwab Corp. rose 15 1/2 to 150 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
 *National Discount Brokers rose 23 15/16 to 86 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of online brokerages rose Monday and today along with  
those of traditional brokerages. In addition, there were rumors 
that Merrill Lynch was about to buy Schwab. 

</P>
<P>
 *Coca-Cola rose 1 7/16 to 63 5/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch analyst Douglas Lane upgraded the soft-drink  
company's stock to ``buy'' from ``accumulate.'' Lane said he 
expects Coke's earnings growth to accelerate to 12 percent in 1999 
from 10 percent in recent years, and that earnings should 
accelerate beginning in 2000, as a recent increase in capital 
spending pays off. Lane also said the soft-drink industry could 
benefit from a recovery in prices. 

</P>
<P>
 *International Paper rose 2 1/4 to 48 5/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter earnings fell to 14 cents a share from 25 cents.  
But they exceeded analysts' estimated 5 cents a share. The paper 
producer blamed the drop on sharply lower paper prices in the first 
quarter, but said it expects improvements in its containerboard 
operations and that its profits will be increased by cost cuts. 

</P>
<P>
 *Weyerhaeuser Co. rose 2 5/16 to 64 7/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	Citing a ``particularly strong'' increase in pulp and paper  
prices, the paper and forest-products company reported earnings of 
51 cents a share, up from 43 cents a year ago and beating analysts' 
36-cent projection. 

</P>
<P>
 *Hewlett-Packard rose 2 7/16 to 70 13/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	Chief Executive Officer Lewis Platt said his company will  
benefit from falling personal-computer prices because they will 
boost demand for Internet services and the big computers, called 
servers, that Hewlett-Packard makes. 

</P>
<P>
 *NASDAQ   	

</P>
<P>
 *Intel fell 3/4 to 60 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The stock was down amid nervousness about the company's  
first-quarter earnings report, scheduled for release after the 
close of trading on Tuesday. The earnings, which came in at 57 
cents a share, were above First Call's average estimate of 55 cents 
share. 

</P>
<P>
 *Informix Corp. rose 1 21/32 to 8 21/32.    	
</P>

sites. 

</P>
<P>
 *Pairgain Technologies rose 2 1/4 to 12 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The stock rose on strength in the Internet sector and rumors  
that the company will announce that it has won a large contract, as 
well as a positive note from NationsBanc Montgomery Securities Inc. 
But after the close of trading, Pairgain announced first-quarter 
earnings of 6 cents a share, down from 17 cents a year ago and 
missing analysts' expectations by a penny. Pairgain cited tighter 
margins and lower prices for Internet access.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The widower of Tammy Wynette denied  
allegations that he helped cause the country star's death. 
</P>
<P>
	George Richey and Ms. Wynette's physician, Dr. Wallis Marsh of

million. The daughters claim Richey and Marsh didn't monitor her 
medical condition closely enough and gave her too many painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wynette died last April at her home. She was 55. Marsh ruled  
she died of a blood clot to the lungs. There was no autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these allegations are totally false, without  
foundation, and that will be proven in a court of law,'' Richey 
said in a statement Monday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tourist Robber Sentenced to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The man prosecutors called the ringleader of a  
loose-knit gang of robbers who preyed on tourists was sentenced 
Tuesday to nearly 18 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	David Harrell, 31, and band of others were accused of robbing  
foreign tourists, particularly women and the elderly, because they 
figured they would be easy marks and not likely to return to pursue 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal prosecutors paid for victims to come from countries  
like Argentina, Germany and Japan to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	The rash of robberies prompted international headlines and  
caused travelers to avoid Florida in the early 1990s, hurting one 
of the state's biggest industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrell will serve the federal sentence at the same time he  
serves a 15-year state term arising from the same series of 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 11 others were tried last year, the trial ended with  
only Harrell being convicted of a single weapons count. The others 
were acquitted or the jury deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrell was the only one retried. Two others took plea bargains.

	Starr To Oppose Counsel Act  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, whose  
disputed investigation of President Clinton clouded the debate over 
special prosecutors, will tell Congress he opposes renewing the law 
that appointed him, The Associated Press has learned. Starr is to 
testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee tomorrow. 
He submitted prepared remarks against renewing the Independent 
Counsel Act, said officials familiar his written testimony. They 
said Starr now opposes the law partly because he believes it 
violates the constitutional separation of powers between the 
executive and judicial branches of government.

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the assisted-suicide  
crusader who videotaped himself giving a man a lethal injection, 
was sentenced today to 10 to 25 years in prison by a judge who told 
him: ``Sir, consider yourself stopped.'' Judge Jessica Cooper 
refused to release Kevorkian, 70, on bail while he appeals his 
murder conviction. The widow and brother of Thomas Youk, the 
52-year-old Lou Gehrig's disease patient whose videotaped death was 
shown on CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes,'' had sought leniency for 
Kevorkian.

	Pentagon Set To Call Reserves

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Because of a major buildup of allied air power  
in the Balkans, U.S. military reservists will probably be ordered 
to active duty. ``There will likely be a reserve call-up,'' 
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. ``The details aren't ready 
to be announced at this stage,'' including how many would be 
called, how soon, and for what tasks. Several hundred Air National 
Guard members already are working as volunteers. But 300 additional 
planes are expected to be sent to Europe. Late Tuesday, air raid 
alerts sounded in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, as they have 
nightly for three weeks. There were no immediate reports of damage.

Albanian officials and international observers said. Washington 
warned that Yugoslavia, under air attack by NATO in the Kosovo

Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City, Ark., plant, was being housed in 
warehouses and waiting to be shipped to distributors, the

It said people should check their refrigerators for products

<HEADLINE> Zhu, Daley Say Trade Pact Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's has 375 restaurants in 38 Chinese  
cities. Motorola, a longtime supporter of China, is one of the 
country's biggest investors. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not surprising then that executives from both companies --  
members in the Mid-America Committee for International Business and 
Government Cooperation -- greeted Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji with 
open arms at their group's luncheon Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some went as far as supporting China's admission into the World  
Trade Organization -- something both Zhu and U.S. Commerce Secretary 
William Daley said could still happen this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu -- on a nine-day, six-city tour of the United States -- vowed  
China would open ``wider and wider to the outside world'' if it 
joins the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	He also cautioned U.S. officials to step in before other Western  
countries lay claim to billions of dollars worth of business with 
his country. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you demand too much too soon, maybe you'll end up with  
nothing,'' Zhu, who spoke through an interpreter, said at a 
luncheon at a downtown Chicago hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said President Clinton would like to see China admitted  
into the WTO this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is good for America. And it is good for world trade,''  
Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure of talks in Washington last week deprived visiting  
Zhu of a potent weapon to push forward his sweeping free-market 
reforms that have cost millions of jobs in an attempt to turn 
around money-losing state industry. 
</P>
<P>
	After 13 years of on-again, off-again talks, China appeared  
increasingly intent in recent months on membership and showed new 
willingness to offer concessions. Daley said Monday that U.S. 
officials want to be more sure of China's willingness to open its 
markets to U.S. companies and imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, the premier toured the currency trading floor of  
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where harried traders briefly 
greeted him with applause. Zhu rang the exchange's bell and flashed 
the Chinese hand signal for ``good fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the applause, some traders said they had mixed feelings  
about Zhu's visit. One chuckling trader even held up two pieces of 
paper -- one reading ``Free'' and the other ``Tibet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu next heads to New York, part of a six-city tour that has  
already taken him to Los Angeles, Denver and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ruling Surprised Few </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers involved in President Clinton's  
impeachment trial said they were anything but shocked when a 
federal judge in Arkansas held the chief executive in contempt for 
testifying falsely in the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was disagreement over the importance of the finding.  
</P>
<P>
	Any element of surprise disappeared last September, when U.S.  
District Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock -- a onetime law 
student of Clinton's -- said in a footnote to a ruling that she was 
looking at the contempt issue. She also mentioned it to lawyers 
during a conference call months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a surprise,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a  
House Judiciary Committee member who opposed impeachment. But he 
said it ``wasn't material'' to Mrs. Jones' allegations that Clinton 
made an unwanted sexual advance to her in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	While the House failed to approve a proposed impeachment article  
charging the president with lying in his Jones case deposition, 
prosecutors in the Senate trial incorporated that allegation into 
their perjury and obstruction-of-justice case. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the key House prosecutors, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.  
said the ruling Monday ``doesn't surprise me.'' He called the 
finding ``a significant matter for anyone who values his license to 
practice law. I have to underline that 'willful' part of her 
ruling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, in her opinion, cited Clinton's ``intentionally  
false'' testimony and his ``willful failure'' to obey the court's 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Frank found no fault with the ruling, commenting, ``There  
was a pretty good consensus he lied in the deposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Carpenter-McMillan, who has been Mrs. Jones' spokeswoman,  
said: ``We're thrilled. While we did not agree with the judge's 
decision to dismiss the case, we applaud the fact that she found 
Clinton blatantly lied under oath. We always said he lied. Now the 
very judge who sat in the room confirmed that. And it's history. A 
president has never been slapped with a contempt citation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead of the conservative Rutherford Institute and one  
of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said if Clinton appeals, the judge could 
hold a full-blown hearing with witnesses -- adding to Clinton's 
legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitehead said the ruling was ``a vindication'' for his client  
and the first time ``where the president was actually held 
accountable in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the other Clinton-related court news of the day, Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said 
the ruling ``offsets the disappointing results in the McDougal 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, the Clinton's former Whitewater partner, was  
acquitted of obstructing Kenneth Starr's investigation and received 
a mistrial on two contempt counts. Hyde said he hadn't read the 
opinion and couldn't comment further.

<HEADLINE> Internet Plays Role in Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- E-mail, chat groups and Web sites may not  
replace the coffee social in New Hampshire's presidential primary 
campaigns. But candidates increasingly look to reach voters through 
the Internet, not just in person. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential hopefuls are using Web sites to recruit and  
organize volunteers, solicit donations and discuss issues more than 
they did during the 1996 campaign, said J. Lynn Reed, a campaign 
consultant for former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, a Democratic 
hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer, a Republican, is the only  
candidate without a Web site. Vice President Al Gore, whose site 
went online Tuesday, was the last candidate to bring his campaign 
to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, who oversaw the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign Web site, said  
more than 11,000 supporters have registered with Bradley's site. 
The campaign recently used the list to urge supporters -- via e-mail 
-- to attend an event for the Democratic contender. 
</P>
<P>
	The typical person checking out a candidate's site these days is  
someone who follows politics, Reed said. But she expects that as 
Election Day nears, more undecided voters will turn to the sites 
for candidates' positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet gives candidates access to a politically interested  
segment of the electorate, said D. Todd Harris, press secretary for 
Rep. John Kasich's campaign. More than 5,000 volunteers have signed 
up through the Ohio Republican's site in the last two months, 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a huge difference between the person who actively  
seeks out a political Web page versus the person who sits on their 
couch and watches TV and happens to see a political ad,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican frontrunner, has yet  
to visit New Hampshire. But residents can check out his Web site, 
which touts his accomplishments and includes personal information. 
</P>
<P>
	But browsing a Web site is not the same as talking to a  
candidate at a mall or town hall, according to University of New 
Hampshire political science professor John Camobreco. For one 
thing, not everybody has access to the Internet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Camobreco expects campaigns will continue to use the  
Internet, he said cyberspace encounters can't replace face-to-face 
interaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're logging onto a candidate's Web site, you're getting  
essentially a political advertisement,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Resists Invading Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the day President Clinton took what he  
called the best among bad alternatives, the air war for Kosovo, he 
has resisted the more perilous option of invading. But if it comes 
to that, the Republican Congress may provide him policy insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional message could be that the use of U.S. ground  
forces in a NATO invasion should be an option, at least as a 
threat. Actually doing it would take weeks. There are both 
Republicans and Democrats arguing that the ground troop option 
should be readied. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a marked turn from long-standing congressional  
reluctance at the use of American forces in the Balkans, even by 
invitation to keep the peace, let alone by invasion to win it. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP Sen. John McCain has taken the lead in pressing the ground  
force option, saying it should be embodied in bipartisan 
resolutions authorizing whatever force is necessary, including 
ground troops, to gain NATO objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton defines them as the withdrawal of Serb forces from  
Kosovo, the return of ethnic Albanians driven from their homes, 
autonomy for the province and an international peacekeeping force 
there. The bombing was launched because Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic would not accept those terms for ending civil war in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	By U.N. estimate, more than 500,000 refugees have fled Kosovo in  
the ``ethnic cleansing'' onslaught by Yugoslavia since NATO 
airstrikes began on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says the airstrike strategy is succeeding by  
weakening Yugoslav Serb forces. But McCain says Milosevic is 
getting what he wanted by driving what was the Albanian majority 
out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who delayed his declaration of 2000 presidential  
candidacy because of the Balkan conflict, said the administration 
has to change its position against the option of ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	It has not. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday that the  
administration is not considering the possibility because the NATO 
command has not requested ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a somewhat circular argument, since the NATO commander is  
an American. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should it become necessary, we'll take it under advisement,''  
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	But at this point, he said, there is strong consensus for the  
air campaign. And the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said he 
remains convinced that air power alone will suffice. 
</P>
<P>
	The air war risks NATO and U.S. casualties, but not on the scale  
that would go with a ground invasion in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	The House was edgy about agreeing to the use of Americans as  
peacekeepers to guarantee a Kosovo settlement, before Milosevic 
blocked that deal. The House voted 219 to 191 on March 11 for a 
resolution endorsing a peacekeeping mission. With the airstrikes 
imminent, the Senate voted 58 to 41 to support them. Again, it was 
grudging support for Clinton's policy. In each case, the vote was 
on commitments the president already had made, as he did in 1995 in 
sending American peacekeeping troops to Bosnia to enforce a 
U.S.-brokered settlement of ethnic wars there. While that force has 
been reduced by two-thirds, more than 6,000 Americans are still 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	When Congress got around to endorsing the Bosnia force, the  
resolution pointedly said that the commitment was Clinton's and 
that its approval came with reservations about the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now there are reservations about a Clinton policy that precludes  
the threat of ground troops. While the White House still says that 
Clinton does not intend to send them into the Kosovo conflict, its 
officials also say that NATO made standby plans for that 
eventuality in late 1998, and they could be updated quickly if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana, a Republican leader on foreign  
policy, says a diplomatic settlement won't be possible until 
Clinton stops saying no on ground forces. Other Republicans contend 
that Clinton has been misleading in saying the airstrikes will be 
enough, without ground forces. Not that Congress is about to tell 
him to send them in. The critics of his air-only stance are saying 
that Milosevic shouldn't be told he won't face NATO and thus U.S. 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Milosevic could end the airstrikes tomorrow by  
coming to terms with NATO. ``But until he does, he should be under 
no illusions that we will end it from weariness,'' Clinton said 
Monday at Barksdale Air Force Base, La. ``We are determined to 
continue on this mission.''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Signs Forsberg for $30M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- All-Star forward Peter Forsberg agreed today to a  
three-year, $30 million contract extension with the Colorado 
Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the contract, which begins next season, Forsberg will be  
paid $8 million the first year, $9 million the second year and $9.5 
million the third year, with a $3.5 million bonus spread over the 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg, the NHL rookie of the year in 1994-95, has equaled a  
career high in goals this season with 30 and has 97 points, his 
highest total since the 1995-96 season, when he posted 116 points. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the Avalanche in scoring with 91 points during the  
1997-98 season. 
</P>
<P>
	In signing Forsberg before he could test the free-agent market,  
Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix said the ownership showed 
it was determined to have a strong team when the Pepsi Center opens 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg was the first-round draft pick of the Philadelphia  
Flyers, sixth overall, in the 1991 entry draft. He was traded to 
Quebec with five other players, future draft picks and cash for 
Eric Lindros on June 30, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg is known as Sweden's ``Magic Boy'' and is the first  
hockey player to appear on a Swedish postage stamp. He was a 1994 
Olympic gold medalist, scoring the game-winning goal in a shootout 
against Canada.

<HEADLINE> International Paper Profits Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- International Paper's profits fell 41 percent in  
the first quarter because of lower paper prices, but the company's 
earnings still easily beat Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper reported earnings of $44 million, or 14  
cents a share, down from $75 million or 25 cents a share in the 
same quarter a year ago. Analysts were expecting 5 cents a share, 
according to a survey by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $5 billion in the first quarter of 1999, compared to  
$4.9 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper attributed the profit decline to sharply  
lower paper prices. Many raw materials companies, including paper 
producers, have been hurt by a drop in demand due to economic 
problems in Asia, Latin America and some European countries 
including Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purchase, N.Y.-based company said a higher tax rate also cut  
earnings by 6 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper officials said they have been able to  
increase paper prices in recent months, and sales in Asia are 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, business has clearly improved, and we are optimistic  
that the price increases we announced will be fully implemented in 
the second quarter,'' said John T. Dillon, chairman and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	He cautioned that weakness in several European economies remain  
a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of International Paper rose $2.25 to $48.62 1/2 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

	Dow Closes at Record 10,395.01  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials closed at a record  
high for the second straight day today, but the rest of the stock 
market lagged as investors collected profits, especially in 
technology shares. The Dow closed up 55.50 points at 10,395.01, 
topping yesterday's record close, after having moved in and out of 
positive territory throughout the day. Investors bought the shares 
of economically sensitive companies such as basic materials 
processors and manufacturers, which sent the Dow higher. But they 
also shed technology shares, aside from Internet-related stocks, 
for a second day. The Nasdaq composite index fell 15.34 to

	Intel Profits Rise 57 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp., the world's largest maker of  
personal computer chips, reported today that its first-quarter 
profits rose 57 percent, beating Wall Street forecasts. It credited 
cost-cutting and an 18 percent rise in revenue. Intel, based in 
Santa Clara, Calif., said it earned $2.0 billion, or 57 cents a 
share, in the three months ended March 27. That was up from a 
profit of $1.27 billion, or 36 cents a share, in the year-ago 
quarter. Revenue rose to $7.1 billion from $6.0 billion. The 
results were released today after the close of financial markets, 
where Intel stock fell 75 cents a share to $60.50 on the Nasdaq. In 
after-hours trading, Intel dropped further to $59 a share.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Paine Webber Group Inc.  
reaped the benefits of the Dow industrials' race past 10,000, with 
the brokerages today reporting first-quarter profits that easily 
exceeded Wall Street's expectations. ``The results confirm that 
these companies, as well as the industry, have recovered from the 
turbulence that rocked the financial-services companies'' in late 
1998, said Michael A. Flanagan, a brokerage industry analyst with 
Financial Service Analytics. Merrill Lynch reported its 
first-quarter profits rose 18.4 percent on record trading 
commissions and renewed strength in the global bond business. It 
earned $609 million, or $1.44 a share, in the first quarter. Paine 
Webber profits were up 33 percent. It earned $160.6 million, or 
$1.01 a share. in the quarter that ended March 31. Merrill Lynch 
shares were at 97 3/8 down 2 9/16. Paine Webber shares were at 47 1/4 up

	Gas Prices Rise, but Inflation Low  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation remained restrained in March even as  
gasoline prices under $1 a gallon disappeared. And Easter shopping 
and fat tax-refund checks helped keep retail sales advancing for 
the eighth consecutive month. The Consumer Price Index rose a 
modest 0.2 percent in March, the Labor Department said Tuesday. The 
inflation rate for the first three months of the year, at 1.5 
percent, held just under the 12-year low of 1.6 percent for all of 
last year. Retail sales, meanwhile, rose 0.2 percent, the Commerce 
Department said. That would be considered rather weak, except it 
came on top of a revised 1.7 percent gain in February, the 
strongest in five years and nearly double the original 0.9 percent 
estimate, and a 1.3 percent gain in January.

proceeds from its recent deal to sell its international tobacco 
business. The buyback will eliminate most of RJR Nabisco's $5 
billion in outstanding debt, and facilitate the company's 
reorganization which includes a plan to spin off its domestic 
tobacco business to its shareholders. The nation's second-biggest 
tobacco company makes Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes. RJR 
Nabisco would be left with its 80.6 percent stake in Nabisco 
Holdings Corp., the maker of Oreo cookies, Planters nuts and Ritz 
crackers. Nabisco carries an additional debt of about $3.6 billion.

	Brazilian Coffee Exports Driven Up  
</P>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Thanks to the devaluation of Brazil's  
currency, Brazilian coffee exports soared 181 percent in March over 
the same month last year. Brazil, which beats Colombia as the 
world's largest producer of coffee, exported 2.08 million bags of 
coffee last month, up from 739,100 a year ago and 22 percent more 
than in February, coffee exporting groups said today. Each bag 
contains 132 pounds of green coffee. Exporters said the gain was 
due to the devaluation of the currency, the real, which lost nearly 
30 percent of its value since mid-January. The drop in the real's 
value allows Brazilian exporters to charge lower prices on world 
markets for their goods.

instead of abroad under a bill the House passed today. Once the 
application is processed and approved, the trademark would be 
protected by both domestic and international law. U.S. businesses 
would no longer have to register for trademarks in each country 
where they market their products. The bill, passed by voice vote, 
would implement provisions of the 1989 Madrid Protocol, a treaty 
that seeks to develop a low-cost international system for 
registering trademarks.

following the company's announcement after stock markets closed 
last week that its first-quarter earnings per share would amount to 
just half of what most Wall Street analysts were forecasting. The

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Welcomed at Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Glimpsing American capitalism from the inside,  
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji received a welcome today from one of the 
world's largest stock markets and offered his own wishes for 
continued economic prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always bull market,'' a smiling Zhu told officials at the  
Nasdaq-Amex MarketSite in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, Zhu received a welcome in Chinese -- ``huanying'' -- from  
Nasdaq officials. Frank Zarb, chairman and chief executive of the 
National Association of Securities Dealers and the Nasdaq-Amex 
Market Group, which operates Nasdaq, told him the United States and 
China should work together. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time in the history of both of our economies that we  
could both benefit greatly by cooperating,'' Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu watched attentively as officials outlined Nasdaq's inner  
workings, and later asked questions about the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this is the beginning of a long relationship,'' said  
Nasdaq stock market president Alfred R. Berkeley III. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing agreed. ``Capital formation is  
critical to the Chinese economy,'' he said in a statement. ``And 
the Nasdaq stock market is a model of investors providing capital 
to growing companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China has stock markets of its own as it embraces capitalism  
while simultaneously trying to retain government control over its 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The premier is visiting New York as part of his nine-day,  
six-city U.S. visit, which comes at a time when tensions between 
China and the United States are high. In recent months, U.S. 
officials have accused China of spying and continue to attack its 
government's human-rights record. China has denounced human-rights 
criticism as meddling in its internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, China and the United States failed last week to  
reach a trade agreement that would clear the way for China's 
membership in the World Trade Organization. Negotiations continue, 
and Zhu has vowed during his visit that China would open ``wider 
and wider to the outside world'' if it joins the WTO.

<HEADLINE> China Defends Human Rights Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China defended its human rights record against  
U.S. criticism today, saying it was making progress in ensuring 
that its people enjoyed the fundamental right of survival, with 
less poverty and longer life expectancies. 
</P>
<P>
	A long report from the State Council, the highest government  
body, came as the United States lobbied governments to support a 
resolution condemning Beijing's record before the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission, now meeting in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	China has long tried to deflect criticism of its human rights  
record by arguing the supreme importance of economic development in 
a largely poor nation. In that vein, the lengthy report marshaled 
these facts: 
</P>
<P>
	--Over the last 21 years, the number of Chinese living in severe  
poverty has declined from 250 million to 42 million today. 
</P>
<P>
	--People are living longer, from an average 35 years when the  
communists came to power in 1949 to 71 years now. 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of TV sets per 100 households is higher than the  
world average, although no specifics were given. 
</P>
<P>
	The barrage of statistics was also intended to show that the  
rights of the Chinese are being protected. Appeals of court cases 
are increasing and corrupt officials are being dismissed, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	What was not mentioned was the Communist Party's unchecked power  
and the government's willingness to trample constitutional 
guarantees of free speech and assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, courts sentenced three veteran dissidents to prison  
terms of 11 to 13 years for trying legally and peacefully to set up 
an opposition political party. 
</P>
<P>
	That crackdown prompted Washington to seek China's censure  
before the U.N. commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft resolution, scheduled for submission next week, cites  
``continuing reports of violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in China'' and ``increased restrictions on the exercise of 
cultural religious and other freedoms of Tibetans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing's report on its own record says the central government  
has spent $145 million annually on subsidies to Tibet, protected 
the Himalayan region's traditional culture and religious freedom, 
and raised Tibetans' living standards and access to education and 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no response to allegations government officials have  
forbidden loyalty to Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai 
Lama, and forced some monks and nuns out of monasteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did acknowledge that China's rights record was not  
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same as the rest of the world, China has many problems  
which should be solved in the field of human rights,'' it said. 
China was willing to learn from other countries through ``dialogues 
and cooperation,'' it added.

<HEADLINE> Five Tennis Players Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- Five tennis players were suspended by  
the Ohio Valley Conference for fighting during a match between 
Tennessee Tech and Austin Peay, including one player who swung his 
racket at an opposing player 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee Tech's Volkan Salar was suspended for five matches and  
Gustavo Castro for four for their parts in the melee April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Dan Beebe said in a statement he found that Austin  
Peay's Steve White started the fight by cursing Castro during a 
singles match. Castro reacted by punching White several times. 
Salar left his own match on another court and attacked White with 
his tennis racket. 
</P>
<P>
	White, apparently, has a history of antagonizing his opponents,  
Beebe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, Mr. Castro elevated the confrontation to a  
physical attack, which cannot be tolerated and must be addressed 
with a severe penalty,'' the commissioner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beebe suspended White for two matches and his teammates Marcus  
Rutsche and Pavel Levitanus one match each for leaving their 
matches, even though they apparently tried to stop the fight.

<HEADLINE> Whitney Houston: I'm Crazy in Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whitney Houston says she's the aggressor in her  
marriage to Bobby Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to belief, I do the hitting, he doesn't. He has never  
put his hands on me. He is not a woman-beater,'' the singer and 
actress said in the May issue of Redbook. ``We are crazy for one 
another. I mean crazy in love, love, love, love, love. When we're 
fighting, it's like that's love for us. We're fighting for our 
love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's arrest history includes drunken driving and battery  
against women other than his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was sentenced in 1998 to five days in jail and a year on  
probation for drunken driving. On Monday, a judge in Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., put him back on probation for showing up drunk to 
do his time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Houston conceded that her singer husband is ``a party guy''

<HEADLINE> Payton Bedridden After Opening Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- NFL great Walter Payton, suffering from a rare  
liver disease, called off a personal appearance and was in bed 
today after throwing out the ceremonial first pitch on opening day 
at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, the NFL's all-time leading rusher as a tailback with the  
Chicago Bears, was scheduled to speak to the Machinery/Materials 
Conference and Exposition this morning at Chicago's McCormick 
Place. But his appearance was canceled at the last minute, 
convention spokesman Leo Nadolske said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadolske said he was told that Payton went to bed sick Monday  
right after arriving home from Wrigley Field and his first public 
appearance in months. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton's spokeswoman did not immediately return a telephone  
message seeking comment and the phone at Payton's business 
headquarters in suburban Chicago went unanswered today. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wrigley, the 44-year-old Payton looked decidedly healthier  
than he did more two months ago when he announced that he needed a 
liver transplant because he was suffering from primary sclerosing 
cholangitis. He was placed on the transplant list at Mayo Clinic in 
February.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Theorize Tunnel Blaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A wrongly switched air duct may have fed in oxygen  
instead of filtering out smoke, fueling a devastating fire in the 
Mont Blanc tunnel that killed at least 41 people, investigators 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An interim report by French experts found that Italian  
authorities did not try to switch the reversible vent to pump out 
smoke out until more than 20 minutes after the fire erupted in the 
seven-mile mountain tunnel linking France and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found that although alert systems and rescue  
procedures worked properly, a lack of coordination between French 
and Italian officials compromised those measures. It also said 
security precautions should have been improved long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said it wasn't yet clear how much of an impact the  
duct error had, but that it could be an important factor. The blaze 
broke out March 24 on a Belgian truck carrying flour and margarine 
and raged for two days, trapping dozens of cars in the tunnel under 
Europe's highest peak. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were careful not to attribute the duct problem  
explicitly to human error by the Italians. However, a French 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the problem 
indeed appeared caused by human error -- but that the French will 
await Italy's own inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian officials running the tunnel on their country's side  
defended the use of the duct, saying ensuing oxygen allowed 
rescuers to save people and did not worsen the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Italian workers who let in fresh air through every channel  
available, including those normally dedicated to venting smoke, 
permitted the rescue squad to save 10 people when the smoke from 
the fire had already sowed death on the French slope,'' the Italian 
Mount Blanc Tunnel Co. said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators said the French and the Italians each control  
a reversible duct with the capacity to blow cold air into the 
tunnel or to suck out smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	The French put their duct, which runs until about the midway  
point of the tunnel, into ``maximum extraction position'' at 10:56 
a.m., three minutes after fire broke out. But the Italians left 
their duct in the blowing position, the French investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, not only did the Italians not reverse the duct, but  
they put the cold air flow at maximum level after the alert 
sounded, the investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a decision that seems at first glance to be absolutely  
the opposite of what should have been done,'' investigator Michel 
Marec told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The French report noted that the problem was ``very likely an  
important element to consider in the analysis of the rapid spread 
of the fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said at 11:15, Italian officials tried to reverse the  
duct's position using an automatic system, but failed. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next half hour, they tried to reverse the duct manually,  
but that didn't work either. ``No smoke was sucked out through the 
extraction duct,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The interim report was prepared by Pierre Duffe, the inspector  
general, and Marec, general engineer of the bridge and tunnel 
authority, for the Interior and Transport ministries. The final 
report is due May 31. There is also a judicial inquiry in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five people were reported missing after the blaze, but the  
death toll has been set at 41, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said all but seven of the victims were found in their cars,  
and they died within the first few minutes, before the flames even 
reached them -- indicating the fumes reached them before they knew 
they were in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the lack of coordination between the two  
companies, French and Italian, that run the tunnel meant that 
``despite continued investments, optimal security conditions were 
not in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only two joint emergency drills have been held by officials of  
the two countries -- the last a decade ago, Marec said. One had been 
planned for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mont Blanc tunnel has been closed since the March 24 blaze,  
and will not be opened for several months.

<HEADLINE> 'Voice' of Wilma Flintstone Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANA POINT, Calif. (AP) -- Jean Vander Pyl, the voice of Wilma in  
``The Flintstones'' and the last surviving original cast member of 
the pioneering animated series, has died. She was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Vander Pyl died Saturday of lung cancer, said Michael  
O'Meara, one of her three sons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Flintstones,'' a Hanna-Barbera cartoon that humorously  
chronicled family life in the Stone Age, ran from 1960 to 1966 and 
has been in worldwide syndication ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Vander Pyl played the sometimes stern but always loving wife  
of Fred Flintstone. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was an anonymous celebrity,'' O'Meara said. ``You could go  
out with her and nobody would recognize her. 
</P>
<P>
	``All she'd have to do was go `Fr-ed!' and people would say:  
`Wilma Flintstone! I grew up with you!' She'd light up the room,'' 
her son said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Vander Pyl also voiced Rosie the Robot and Mrs. Spacely on  
``The Jetsons'' -- until she became too ill about six months ago. 
She also made an appearance in Steven Spielberg's 1994 live-action 
movie based on the series.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Scandal Moves to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Olympic scandal moves to Capitol Hill on  
Wednesday, with its leading player staying away and theories 
swirling about a U.S. conspiracy to take over international sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost five months after the bribery scheme in Salt Lake's  
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games was exposed, the Senate 
Commerce Committee holds hearings into what went wrong with an 
event and an organization so wrapped in idealism and goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch  
spurned an invitation to testify, and the relatively short list of 
witnesses -- including former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell 
-- is unlikely to present much new information about the scandal or 
its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing comes 19 years to the day after perhaps the  
best-known American government foray into the Olympic arena. On 
April 14, 1980, the U.S. Olympic Committee gave in to White House 
pressure and agreed to boycott the Moscow Summer Games to protest 
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Four investigations of the Salt Lake scandal, including one  
headed by Mitchell, already have been completed, with 10 IOC 
members resigning or expelled, Salt Lake's Olympic leaders kicked 
out and programs started for what would be revolutionary change in 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Justice Department and the Utah attorney general  
continue to investigate whether the million-dollar program of cash, 
gifts and services to get IOC votes violated any laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hearing, run by Commerce Committee chairman Sen. John  
McCain, still could have a major impact on the future of the 
Olympics, especially their billion-dollar finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member of the Commerce Committee, Alaska Republican Ted  
Stevens, has drafted a bill to strip the IOC's tax-exempt status 
and limit deductions sponsors can take for Olympic fees, a move the 
sponsors say would drive them away. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would give the USOC control over U.S. TV rights fees for  
the games, still the IOC's single biggest income source. 
</P>
<P>
	Two members of the House of Representatives, meanwhile,  
introduced a bill this week that would bar U.S. corporations or 
individuals from ``providing any financial support'' to the IOC 
unless the committee adopts the Mitchell commission's 
recommendations for more openness and accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., noted that  
U.S. corporations make up 90 percent of top-level IOC sponsorship, 
while NBC has paid $3.5 billion for TV rights through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	What happens Wednesday could determine whether Stevens  
introduces his legislation in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to hearing what the senators wish to  
examine,'' USOC president Bill Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others see a deeper agenda lurking around the Dirksen Senate  
Office Building -- an American plan to control the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	German press reports said Tuesday that a USOC strategy paper  
laid out ``a scenario of how the USA could take over the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting an unidentified senior IOC member, the reports said the  
hearings were part of a Hybl-designed plan to ``flex financial and 
political muscle to seize effective control'' of the 
scandal-weakened international panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl and other USOC officials said there was no truth to the  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no such document,'' the USOC president said. Mike  
Moran, the committee's chief spokesman, called the timing of the 
report ``most curious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl, who appointed the Mitchell investigation, has been picked  
for a key part of the IOC's efforts to rebound from the scandal -- a 
seat on a prestigious commission to restructure the committee from 
top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	That commission, IOC 2000, will be chaired by Samaranch and  
include former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Los Angeles 
Olympic organizer Peter Ueberroth and IOC vice president Anita 
DeFrantz. 
</P>
<P>
	Another panel, to ride herd on the behavior of IOC members,  
includes former United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar and Howard Baker, a former Senate majority leader and White 
House chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are doing what we said we would do,'' DeFrantz said. ``We  
are finding the best people we can find. I hope the Senate will be 
pleased as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, scheduled as the leadoff witness, chastised the IOC in  
his inquiry report for creating a ``culture of improper 
gift-giving'' that led to the Salt Lake scandal. But he said last 
weekend he was impressed by recent IOC actions, adding it was too 
soon to tell if true reforms were under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Even McCain, who has been harshly critical of the IOC and  
Samaranch the last two months, gave a warm reaction to Kissinger's 
appointment last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, who addressed a weekend meeting of the USOC board that  
was dominated by the scandal, said he had no plans to suggest 
congressional action on the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expected a good part of the hearing to deal with his  
suggestion that the IOC be placed under international 
corrupt-practice laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including IOC member and scheduled witness Jim Easton,  
have called the hearing a stage for McCain's political aspirations, 
including a possible run for the White House. Easton has since 
apologized for his comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Because federal law gives the USOC power over all  
Olympic-related activities in the United States, Mitchell said, it 
was ``important and appropriate'' for Congress to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, congressional oversight of the Olympics is far from  
rare. DeFrantz, the top IOC representative at the hearing, said 
this would be her fifth time testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Senate testimony,'' said the former rower, who sued  
over the 1980 boycott. ``You are speaking to a senator. It's 
important. I have to be prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other scheduled witnesses include former White House chief of  
staff Ken Duberstein, baseball union chief Donald Fehr and lawyers 
Roberta Cooper Ramo and Jeff Benz -- all members of Mitchell's 
commission -- and Andrew Jennings, author of ``Lords of the Rings,'' 
a 1992 book that described widespread corruption and influence 
peddling in the Olympics.

	CROSS CITY, Fla. (AP) -- A woman angry at a high school senior  
who was arguing with her son sprayed the student with gasoline from 
a gas pump nozzle and then set him ablaze, sheriff's deputies said.

<HEADLINE> Shoulder Pain Slows Lowell's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Rookie third baseman Mike Lowell's debut with the  
Florida Marlins will be delayed because of a sore throwing 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell had been expected to join the Marlins as early as this  
week, but he was recalled Tuesday from a rehabilitation assignment 
with Triple-A Calgary. He'll join the Marlins' extended spring club 
in Melbourne on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, 25, is coming back from surgery Feb. 21 for testicular  
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be careful not to rush him,'' general manager Dave  
Dombrowski said. ``Mike has some shoulder tenderness and is going 
to have a couple of days' rest. We want to give him the appropriate 
time he needs to be 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move came one day after the Marlins placed Alex Fernandez on  
the 15-day disabled list with inflammation in his pitching 
shoulder. Their top hitter, Cliff Floyd, is also on the disabled 
list recovering from minor knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	In four games with Calgary, Lowell went 4-for-12 (.333) with  
three runs scored. Lowell, who hit a combined 56 homers in the 
minors in 1997 and '98, is to become Florida's starting third 
baseman when activated from the disabled list.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defends China-Trade Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration today defended its decision  
to walk away from a Chinese offer to lower its trade barriers to a 
wide range of American products. U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky said the deal simply did not measure up in several 
critical areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky told a congressional committee that China had been  
willing to make a number of trade concessions last week during 
high-level meetings between President Clinton and Chinese Premier 
Zhu Rongji. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said the offers were not significant enough, especially  
in the area of enforcement. The United States is insisting that 
China give it the right to impose unilateral trade sanctions on 
China even after the country joins the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	China balked, arguing that one of the biggest benefits it would  
receive from WTO membership would be protection against unilateral 
action in future trade disputes by the United States, China's 
biggest export market. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's action has come under criticism from many  
in the business community, who contend that China had made major 
concessions in an effort to get U.S. backing for it WTO membership, 
a goal it has sought for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. businesses fear that China will now pull off its very  
attractive offers to slash tariffs on thousands of American 
products and remove a wide array of other trade barriers that U.S. 
companies have long complained are a major factor in America's huge 
trade deficit with China. That deficit last year hit a record $57 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barshefsky insisted the talks with China will continue and a  
better deal is possible by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have for six years pursued these negotiations in a  
methodical manner, insisting at every juncture that accession must 
be on commercially meaningful terms,'' Barshefsky said in her 
prepared testimony. ``Now is not the time to depart from this 
careful, substantive approach and allow arbitrary deadlines to 
influence our negotiating position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to gain a trade agreement clearing the way for WTO  
membership has clearly upset the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu told a Washington audience Friday that China might well  
decide to lower its market-opening offers if the talks drag on 
without agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	China is hoping to win WTO membership by the end of this year so  
that it will have a place at the negotiating table when the 
134-nation trade group begins another round of global trade talks. 
Those discussions are scheduled to be launched in late November at 
a meeting of trade ministers in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Gets 10 to 25 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A judge sentenced Dr. Jack Kevorkian to 10  
to 25 years in prison today for the videotaped death of a Lou 
Gehrig's disease patient, lecturing the euthanasia crusader: ``No 
one, sir, is above the law. No one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jessica Cooper also sentenced the 70-year-old Kevorkian to  
three to seven years for delivery of a controlled substance. The 
sentences will run concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian will be eligible for parole after serving two-thirds  
of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who could have been sentenced to life in prison, was  
convicted of murder in the second degree in the death of 
52-year-old Thomas Youk. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian injected Youk with a lethal cocktail of chemicals on  
Sept. 17 and videotaped the death. The video was shown two months 
later on CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This trial was not about the political or moral correctness of  
euthanasia,'' Cooper told Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was about lawlessness. It was about disrespect for a  
society that exists because of the strength of the legal system. No 
one, sir, is above the law. No one. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had the audacity to go on national television, show the  
world what you did and dare the legal system to stop you. Well, 
sir, consider yourself stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was led from the courtroom in handcuffs after the  
judge denied bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper pronounced sentence after hearing emotional testimony  
from Youk's widow, Melody, who praised Kevorkian and urged the 
judge to show ``compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Youk was confined to a wheelchair,  
could barely move his arms or legs and was afraid of choking to 
death on his own saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Youk said her husband ``was not depressed, he was not a  
victim. He requested Dr. Kevorkian's help and was grateful for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not wish to be on a ventilator, nor completely  
dependent on others in a totally paralyzed body,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Youk's brother, Terrence Youk, described Youk's spirited but  
failing efforts to fight a disease that started slowly but that by 
2 1/2 years later left him in extreme pain with little control over 
his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was found guilty March 26. The relatives' testimony  
had been deemed irrelevant during that phase of the trial, because 
a victim's suffering is not considered a defense in a murder trial 
under state law. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first murder trial for Kevorkian, a retired  
pathologist who says he has been involved in some 130 deaths in his 
nine-year crusade for assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	His previous trials, all on assisted suicide charges, resulted  
in three acquittals and one mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Before allowing him to act as his own lawyer in this trial,  
Cooper asked him: ``Do you understand you could spend the rest of 
your life in prison?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much of it left,'' Kevorkian responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian argued passionately that some acts ``by sheer common  
sense are not crimes'' and that ``to have a crime, you need a 
vicious will and a vicious act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Oakland County Circuit Court jury sided with prosecutor  
John Skrzynski, who said Kevorkian ``came like a medical hitman in 
the night with a bag of poison to do his job.''

ground by a white state trooper during a videotaped arrest has 
received a $400,000 out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra A. Antor settled in January, dropping her lawsuit  
accusing the Public Safety Department of negligence in training 
Highway Patrol troopers, The Post and Courier reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Ms. Antor was stopped for speeding on Interstate 95.  
The videotape of her arrest led to allegations of police brutality 
when it showed Lance Cpl. W.H. Beckwith being physically and 
verbally abusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckwith was fired eight weeks later. He was not named in the  
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 chase lasted for more than eight miles. Ms. Antor  
refused to stop even though Beckwith used lights and siren, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Antor finally pulled over, Beckwith approached with his  
gun drawn, used vulgarities and dragged her to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Antor said she did not stop because she did not realize  
Beckwith was behind her.

<HEADLINE> Former Virginia Governor To Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Saying he would work for ``a  
stronger, safer and freer America,'' former Gov. George F. Allen 
announced today that he would seek the Republican nomination to 
oppose Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A race between the two men would be closely watched nationwide  
as Republicans try to keep their majority in the Senate. Polls 
conducted on the premise that Allen would oppose Robb have 
consistently shown the challenger with a lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folks have told me they want Senator John Warner to have a  
principled and vigorous partner in his dedicated work for a 
stronger, safer and freer America,'' Allen said in a statement. 
Warner, Virginia's senior senator, is also a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, 47, who often describes himself as a ``Jeffersonian  
conservative,'' chose the 256th anniversary of Thomas Jefferson's 
birth to announce his bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb, in his second term in the Senate, has not yet said whether  
he will seek re-election. But like Allen, he has been raising money 
for the race. No other Republican has expressed interest in 
opposing Robb. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, after finishing his four-year term as governor,  
Allen formed a committee to explore his chances of winning a race 
against Robb, who barely survived a Republican challenge in 1994 
from Iran-Contra figure Oliver North. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, the namesake son of the famed Washington Redskins and Los  
Angeles Rams football coach, led this decade's Republican 
resurgence in Virginia. When he left office, barred by state law 
from seeking a second term, 62 percent of people responding to a 
poll said he had done an excellent or good job as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen's political acumen was largely underestimated before his  
come-from-behind victory over state Attorney General Mary Sue Terry 
in the 1993 governor's race. Although he had served in the House of 
Delegates for nine years and in Congress for 14 months, he was not 
well known outside his Charlottesville-area base. 
</P>
<P>
	But he led a folksy, conservative campaign, promising to abolish  
the ``liberal, lenient parole system,'' and succeeded in ending a 
12-year Democratic hold on the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb, the 59-year-old son-in-law of the late President Lyndon B.  
Johnson, was credited with bringing about a Democratic revival in 
Virginia in the 1980s following three successive Republican 
governors. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the Senate in 1988 and is the only Democrat  
holding statewide elected office in Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Panel: TV Regressing on Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The bottom line could be at stake  
in the worsening treatment of minorities on television, an industry 
panel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Television depictions reinforce the social segregation that is  
an increasing national problem, said Geraldo Rivera, who 
participated in the Hollywood Radio and Television Society panel on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nely Galan, president of the Hispanic-oriented Telemundo  
Network, said television ignores the way race plays itself out in 
real life. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see shows on TV they're either black shows or white  
shows, and that's not how we live in America,'' Ms. Galan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoopi Goldberg, the panel's moderator, said TV is regressing in  
how and how much it depicts minorities. Of 115 shows on the six 
major broadcast networks, only 18 feature black casts or lead 
characters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	George Gerbner, a Temple University telecommunications professor  
and television researcher, said more minority characters were 
featured in shows canceled in 1998 than there were in series 
remaining on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Galan called multiracial images important to viewers,  
especially young ones: ``I think a lot of our children's 
self-esteem comes from seeing themselves depicted positively on the 
medium that is society's most important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But companies are missing out economically as well, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of money in the Hispanic market,'' Galan told  
the audience of several hundred at the Regent Beverly Wilshire 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several panelists said it was vital to get more minorities in  
positions of power as network executives and producers. One said 
her patience has worn thin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm becoming like Angela Davis,'' said producer Yvette Lee  
Bowser (``Living Single,'' ``For Your Love''). ``I'm militant now. 
I'm angry.''

<HEADLINE> Saints Make Push for Heisman Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints are only a running  
back away from greatness, according to coach Mike Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
	Provided the back is Ricky Williams.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just believe this kid is the real deal,'' Ditka said. He  
said Williams is like Walter Payton, without as many moves, but 
with more power. ``He's a good player and a good person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints are willing to give up every draft pick this year -- a  
No. 1 and Nos. 3 through 7, plus picks next year and veteran 
players -- to get the Heisman Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks with the Cleveland Browns, who have Saturday's No. 1  
overall pick, began Monday. Reportedly the Browns want this year's 
picks, plus the first- and third-round picks next year and a No. 1 
pick in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can get that blockbuster trade that gives you a  
combination of picks, presently and in the future, that can set you 
up for the next 12 years,'' said Browns president Carmen Policy. 
``I think we would be very, very foolish not to give serious 
consideration to that alternative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As much as Ditka covets Williams, he would not give up three No.  
1s to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're already giving the orchard away for the apple tree,''  
Ditka said. ``Now they want us to give 10 orchards away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints expect Cleveland to take Williams if a deal can't be  
made, but they're also making their pitch to the other top five 
teams in the draft, in case Cleveland goes for a quarterback. The 
Browns have been considering Tim Couch of Kentucky and Akili Smith 
of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans has the No. 12 pick in the first round. The Saints  
don't have a second-round choice; that was traded to St. Louis for 
wide receiver Eddie Kennison earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans hasn't had a 1,000-yard rusher since Dalton Hillard  
in 1989. Lamar Smith was the Saints' leading rusher last year with 
457 yards. He asked to be traded after the season, unhappy with 
Ditka's tendency to yank players every time he gets mad. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams would not only give the Saints a dangerous ground game,  
he would give them a marquee name that would help bring back 
disgruntled fans, said Bruce Lemmerman, director of college 
scouting. That's a big consideration for a team that hasn't had a 
winning season since 1992 and just hiked ticket prices on every 
seat in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he would give us some respect on the field,''  
Lemmerman said. ``And he would give us some recognition around the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka likes Miami's Edgerrin James, but not well enough to make  
him a first-round pick. He's not sure James is better than the 
backs he already has. 
</P>
<P>
	And he would not pick Cecil Collins, the former LSU running back  
who played only six college games and pled guilty to two felony and 
two misdemeanor charges in connection with fondling two women. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Cecil Collins is there at the 12th pick, he'll be there for  
the 13th,'' Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Saints can't get Williams, Ditka said a wide receiver  
would probably be their top pick. It's a choice Ditka hopes to 
avoid, believing he has the nucleus of the team he wants -- if only 
he can get Williams to do for him what Payton did when Ditka was 
coaching the Chicago Bears and they were dominating the NFC 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel the future of this football team is now,'' Ditka said.  
``People care about us winning now, not in 2001.''

<HEADLINE> Fire Danger Leads to Fla. Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Florida's governor declared a state of emergency as windy, dry  
weather raised the threat of wildfires across the Southeast, where 
flames have blackened thousands of acres of forest and brush. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of 60 homes near Wilkesboro in western North Carolina  
were allowed to return home Tuesday after the state's largest fire, 
which had burned 600 acres, was contained Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration Monday night by Florida Gov. Jeb Bush allows the  
National Guard to help firefighters, and two Blackhawk helicopters 
were immediately put to work dumping water on fires in Hillsborough 
and Polk counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor is being proactive and putting all his tools in  
the toolbox,'' said Jon Myatt, a spokesman for the Florida Military 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard helicopters also fought fires in Tennessee over  
the weekend and all outdoor burning permits were suspended. 
Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist said Tuesday that the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency granted federal assistance to eight 
southeastern counties to help fight the fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush noted that an index of fire potential calculated by  
Florida's Division of Forestry was above 600 -- on a scale where 400 
denotes significant danger. Humidity dropped to as low as 20 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a red-alert day,'' said Fire Services Deputy Chief  
Frank Pocica. ``We're in very dangerous, high-burn conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brush fires in central Florida on Monday blackened at least  
1,400 acres and destroyed three houses. And weekend fires in 
southern Florida burned hundreds of acres of brush and grass 
southwest of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks of drought also have dried out Georgia's forests, and the  
state Forestry Commission reported 131 fires on more than 5,000 
acres Monday. That followed 119 weekend fires that forced a 
precautionary evacuation of campers from Stephen Foster State Park 
and briefly closed a major highway north of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was the roughest day we've had in recent years,''  
Alan Dozier, chief of forest protection for the Georgia Forestry 
Commission, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 30 weekend fires in eastern Tennessee more than 3,000  
acres. Two vacation homes were destroyed. Arson was suspected in 11 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the other states in the region, North Carolina got help  
from the weather as the wind died down Tuesday, and cloudy, humid 
weather was expected Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Duke Ellington Wins Pulitzer Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At last, a Pulitzer Prize for Duke Ellington.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was a little disappointed, actually very disappointed, when  
he didn't win one during his lifetime, and he always shrugged it 
off by saying, `Maybe God thinks I'm too young.''' said Mercedes 
Ellington, the late composer's granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellington, one of the century's greatest musicians, died in  
1974. 
</P>
<P>
	A special music citation was given posthumously on the  
centennial of his birth. The Pulitzer board said the award was 
given ``in recognition of his musical genius, which evoked 
aesthetically the principles of democracy through the medium of 
jazz and thus made an indelible contribution to art and culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It just shows that Duke Ellington's music is timeless and  
still lives in the present,'' said jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, 
himself a Pulitzer winner. ``Even though it was awarded 
posthumously, his music is still very alive and vibrant and 
meaningful today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellington was the most famous of Monday's honorees, which  
included a kindergarten teacher, a former poet laureate and a 
highly respected essay writer. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Edson won the drama award for her play ``Wit,'' an  
unsentimental look at a woman's fight with ovarian cancer. Edson, 
37, was cleaning her kindergarten classroom at Atlanta's Centennial 
Park Elementary School when she found out she'd won the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the middle of studying insects and nothing can take  
me away,'' she said. ``I will continue teaching. I enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Cunningham received the fiction prize for his novel  
``The Hours'' and Melinda Wagner won the music prize for her 
composition ``Concerto for Flute, Strings and Percussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acclaimed essayist John McPhee won in the general  
non-fiction category for ``Annals of the Former World,'' and former 
poet laureate Mark Strand won for his collection ``Blizzard of 
One.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the sort of thing one anticipates,'' said Strand, 65,  
known for his stoic, sparely written poems. ``I don't even know 
when these prizes are given out. I don't receive the paper every 
day and when I do I generally turn to the obituaries or the sports 
pages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham's novel, which won the PEN/Faulkner Award and was a  
runner-up for the National Book Critics Circle prize, begins in the 
1920s and imagines Virginia Woolf as she worked on her acclaimed 
novel ``Mrs. Dalloway.'' Parts of ``The Hours'' take place decades 
later, in New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiction prize is awarded for a book ``preferably dealing  
with American life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a remarkable thing to imagine a book that starts with a  
genius beginning to write a novel in 1923, and comes sort of 
circuitously to the U.S., could be acknowledged by a prize like 
this,'' said Cunningham, who lives in Manhattan and teaches 
creative writing at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	The history prize was given to ``Gotham: A History of New York  
City to 1898'' by Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, who is 
unrelated to the television newsman of the same name. The biography 
prize went to ``Lindbergh,'' A. Scott Berg's book about the aviator 
Charles Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most exciting day since Anne Morrow gave me  
permission to write the book,'' exclaimed Berg, who lives in Los 
Angeles and is the author of two other biographies. The 49-year-old 
author said it took him a year to persuade Charles Lindbergh's 
widow to agree to the project. He said the book took another nine 
years to write.

<HEADLINE> Banks Y2K Tips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tips from Donna Tanoue, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit  
Insurance Corp., on investment scams exploiting fears that banks 
won't be able to handle the Year 2000 date change: 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't give your bank account numbers or other financial  
information to anyone unless you initiated the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Carefully check out any investment offer before you hand over  
money. 
</P>
<P>
	--Report investment scams to the police and to your bank, thrift  
or credit union. 
</P>
<P>
	To prepare for the Year 2000 change, financial regulators advise  
consumers to: 
</P>
<P>
	--Keep at least six months' worth of bank and brokerage  
statements on hand, in case a problem develops at the turn of the 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask your broker what his or her firm is doing to remedy the  
problem and what procedures are in place for potential problems or 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask for a report on Year 2000 readiness from corporations in  
which you own shares. 
</P>
<P>
	--If you manage your investments and personal finances using  
off-the-shelf money management software, check with the vendor to 
make sure it is Year 2000 compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	--Check with the company that made your computer and its  
operating system to be sure they are ready.

<HEADLINE> Transplant Patient at Phillies Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After hurling the first pitch at the  
Philadelphia Phillies home opener with a left hand he didn't have 
11 weeks ago, Matthew Scott smiled and pumped his hands in the air 
like he had just won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the 25-foot throw was high and outside, and soft enough  
that Mark McGwire would have had no trouble slugging it into the 
upper deck for a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was perfect enough for Scott, who became the first person  
in the United States to receive a hand transplant during a 15-hour 
operation at Louisville Jewish Hospital in Kentucky on Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	With his 7-year-old son, Ian, looking on, Scott said afterward  
he was so nervous he was thankful he didn't throw the ball into the 
stands or bounce it past the Phillie who caught the pitch, reserve 
Rob Ducey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something that the whole world was seeing for the first  
time. I wanted the whole world to see that (the operation) works. 
To me it is unbelievable,'' a beaming Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott threw the ball with a protective glove he wears every day  
as part of his recovery process. He cannot detect texture, such as 
the seams of the baseball, with the new hand, but can feel the 
pressure he applies on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a thrill, an absolute thrill,'' the left-handed Scott  
said, donning a number 13 Phillies jersey and a bright red Phillies 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who had been using a prosthetic device since losing his  
hand in a 1985 fireworks accident, had said he wanted to play catch 
with his children after he recovered from the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials decided to give Scott the opportunity to throw  
out the first pitch after hearing about his surgery and learning 
the Absecon, N.J., man was a lifelong Phillies fan. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing for the game -- which the Phillies lost 8-6 to the  
Atlanta Braves -- became part of his physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of had to start from the beginning,'' said Scott, 37.  
``Every day for about 20 minutes to a half-hour a day, we practiced 
the motion of throwing and then the hand grip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott's ceremonial pitch capped a dizzying pregame opening day  
ceremony for the Phillies. Scott received the ball after a man with 
a jet-propelled backpack rocketed to the upper level of the 
stadium, handed the ball to a man who used a hang glider to fly 
down to the field, who finally gave the ball to Scott's son. 
</P>
<P>
	After throwing the pitch, Scott raised both his hands in triumph  
and pointed to the stands. He was greeted by hugs and handshakes in 
the Phillies dugout from family and team members, including star 
pitcher Curt Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say Scott is progressing right on schedule and that his  
ability to throw a ball is another milestone in his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked hard for this,'' said physical therapist Ann  
Hodges, who traveled with Scott. ``He's progressing well and has 
been looking forward to this day for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an entourage of hospital officials from Louisville nearby,  
Scott said throwing the first pitch went a long way towards his 
goal of teaching Ian how to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the transplant, ``actually showing how to field a ground  
ball with two hands was more of an abstract discussion,'' he said. 
``Now that I have the ability to do that, it will probably be a lot 
easier now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Scott said he had no idea he would be at the point where  
he is now. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you asked me a couple weeks ago, I would have been just as  
happy scratching my upper palm with it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  St. John's Artest Enters NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There was no suspense about Ron Artest's  
announcement Tuesday. The media, family and friends gathered in his 
neighborhood community center knew they were going to hear that the 
third-team All-America was going to forgo his final two years at 
St. John's and apply for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows what I'm doing,'' Artest said during his  
30-minute speech. ``I'm going to get a job. I'm not leaving 
college. I'm just not playing basketball there. I'll never leave 
St. John's. I'm always going to be there. I love the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school and its fans had to have liked what Artest did for  
the Red Storm in his two seasons, both of which ended in the NCAA 
tournament. The 6-foot-6 swingman averaged 13.1 points, 6.3 
rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.9 rebounds as St. John's compiled a 
50-19 record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm fell one game shy of the Final Four this season,  
losing to Ohio State in the South Regional final. Not bad for a 
team that was unranked when the season began and finished ninth in 
the final poll with a 28-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very special year with one of the closest teams I  
ever played for. There were no individuals,'' Artest said. ``I had 
a pretty decent year and it would have been great to get to the 
Final Four. Once the season was over, I made the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Artest held his news conference at the Jacob Riis Center, the  
small building where he played a lot of basketball and learned a 
lot about controlling his temper and setting goals, one of which he 
will realize when his name is called on June 30 in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I showed it's not hard to make it out of Queensbridge, or any  
project,'' Artest said, looking directly at a group of kids 
standing just behind the eight TV cameras. ``I'm on my way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comments from NBA scouts on Artest vary from a sure lottery  
pick to a suspect shooter who may not be picked until the late 
teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a right way to make a decision and a wrong way and  
Ronnie talked to the people who mattered and did it the right 
way,'' coach Mike Jarvis said. ``I can tell you we never talked 
about this at all during the season. The team was always first. I 
can't be more supportive than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  St. John's Artest Enters NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There was no suspense about Ron Artest's  
announcement Tuesday. The media, family and friends gathered in his 
neighborhood community center knew they were going to hear that the 
third-team All-America was going to forgo his final two years at 
St. John's and apply for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows what I'm doing,'' Artest said during his  
30-minute speech. ``I'm going to get a job. I'm not leaving 
college. I'm just not playing basketball there. I'll never leave 
St. John's. I'm always going to be there. I love the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school and its fans had to have liked what Artest did for  
the Red Storm in his two seasons, both of which ended in the NCAA 
tournament. The 6-foot-6 swingman averaged 13.1 points, 6.3 
rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.9 rebounds as St. John's compiled a 
50-19 record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm fell one game shy of the Final Four this season,  
losing to Ohio State in the South Regional final. Not bad for a 
team that was unranked when the season began and finished ninth in 
the final poll with a 28-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very special year with one of the closest teams I  
ever played for. There were no individuals,'' Artest said. ``I had 
a pretty decent year and it would have been great to get to the 
Final Four. Once the season was over, I made the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Artest held his news conference at the Jacob Riis Center, the  
small building where he played a lot of basketball and learned a 
lot about controlling his temper and setting goals, one of which he 
will realize when his name is called on June 30 in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I showed it's not hard to make it out of Queensbridge, or any  
project,'' Artest said, looking directly at a group of kids 
standing just behind the eight TV cameras. ``I'm on my way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comments from NBA scouts on Artest vary from a sure lottery  
pick to a suspect shooter who may not be picked until the late 
teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a right way to make a decision and a wrong way and  
Ronnie talked to the people who mattered and did it the right 
way,'' coach Mike Jarvis said. ``I can tell you we never talked 
about this at all during the season. The team was always first. I 
can't be more supportive than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Artest's teammates all backed his decision and said they expect  
another good season with senior forward Tyrone Grant the only other 
player not returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Ann Artest also supported the decision but she also made a  
deal with her son. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows education is very, very dear to me,'' she said. ``Him  
agreeing to still get his degree is for me. It's important for him 
to do it, but he'll do it for me.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Holds Clinton in Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton faces a new blot on his  
record and thousands of dollars in fresh legal expenses after a 
federal judge cited him for contempt of court. Historians believe 
he is the first chief executive to receive such a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright concluded Monday that  
the president lied about his relationship with former White House 
intern Monica Lewinsky in a Jan. 17, 1998, deposition in the Paula 
Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply put, the president's deposition testimony ... was  
intentionally false,'' Wright wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones ``any reasonable  
expenses including attorneys' fees caused by his willful failure to 
obey this court's discovery orders'' and also to pay $1,202 as 
reimbursement for the judge's travel in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	One option is for Clinton to use his legal defense fund, which  
has raised $4.5 million, to pay the sanction. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers were mum, leaving their options open until  
they see what sort of penalty Mrs. Jones requests. One of her 
lawyers said Monday night it could be tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, however, hinted in her ruling if Clinton attempts to  
contest her findings, it could have political costs for a president 
eager to put the impeachment crisis behind him that ended in 
January when he was acquitted on perjury and obstruction of justice 
charges in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This court is fully aware that the president may have engaged  
in other ... conduct warranting'' punishment and if Clinton 
exercises his right to contest the finding it would open the door 
for hearings complete with witnesses ``on all matters concerning 
the president's conduct,'' she warned. 
</P>
<P>
	At her home in Cabot, Ark., Mrs. Jones was overjoyed. ``Ah! Ta  
ta ta ta ta. That's all I have to say,'' she said, waving her hands 
above her head and dancing. Asked whether she believed the sanction 
against the president was good for the country, Mrs. Jones said, 
``I could care less. It's not about that, it's about what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also set in motion a process that could strip Clinton  
of his law license, referring the president's testimony to the 
Arkansas Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said she would delay enforcement for 30 days to give  
Clinton an opportunity to ask for a hearing or to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a vindication,'' said John Whitehead, one of Mrs.  
Jones's lawyers. ``This is the first event in the whole proceeding 
where the president was actually held accountable in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Historians said they believed the action was a first.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have never heard of any case where a president has been  
found in contempt in a civil case,'' said Mark Rozell, a professor 
of political science at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's historical ``boxscore'' will say in part ``first  
elected president impeached and first to be held in contempt while 
in office,'' said Rozell. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright directed Mrs. Jones' lawyers to submit within 20 days a  
statement of their expenses, which Whitehead said could be ``tens 
of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have all the expenses related to seven lawyers who  
attended the deposition -- air fares, the time spent there (in 
Washington), the time preparing, meals, and what we believe was the 
cause and effect of the whole thing,'' said Whitehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior presidential aides, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Clinton lawyers regarded the penalty as less severe since the 
judge had the option of making a criminal referral against the 
president to the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said any finding of criminal contempt would have  
required a more lengthy process involving hearings and taking 
evidence. Also, she noted that much of Clinton's conduct had been 
investigated by the independent counsel's office and she wanted to 
``prevent any potential double jeopardy issues from arising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bennett, the private lawyer who represented Clinton in  
the Jones case, said he would have no comment on the judge's ruling 
``until I have had the opportunity of reviewing this matter 
fully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, the Arkansas Republican who was one of the  
House prosecutors in the impeachment trial, said a ``nonpartisan 
and nonpolitical judge'' had found the president had willfully 
disobeyed court orders to be truthful and ``I have to underline the 
'willful' part of her ruling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The office of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, whose  
investigation prompted the impeachment crisis, declined comment 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said her decision to dismiss the Jones case a year ago  
would not have changed, even if the president had been ``truthful 
with respect to his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones appealed the dismissal, but then settled the case by  
accepting an $850,000 payment from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In his deposition in the Jones case, Clinton said: ``I have  
never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' But after his 
DNA was found on a dress belonging to Ms. Lewinsky, he acknowledged 
an ``inappropriate intimate relationship'' with her before a 
federal grand and in a nationally televised address. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the relationship did not fall under the definition  
of ``sexual relations'' provided by Mrs. Jones' lawyers during his 
deposition, and that his testimony was legally accurate.

<HEADLINE>  Poles Remember Auschwitz Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSWIECIM, Poland (AP) -- Some 2,000 young people joined Holocaust  
survivors in a march Tuesday at the former Nazi death camp at 
Auschwitz to remember the 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual event was given added weight this year, participants  
said, by developments in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Europe has not learned from the terrible things that happened  
here and we can see that in Kosovo,'' said Agnieszka Chrabalowska, 
19, of Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a half-million ethnic Albanians have fled or been  
driven out of Kosovo since the NATO launched airstrikes to force 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace deal with 
separatist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-mile march from Auschwitz to the gas chambers at  
Birkenau is held on Israel's Holocaust Memorial Day to commemorate 
the Holocaust victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking part this year were retired Israeli army officers who  
survived Auschwitz, 1,700 young Jews from Israel and other 
countries as well as 200 Polish teen-agers, said one of the 
organizers, Acharon Tamir. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come here to remember the victims, but also to  
celebrate the fact that there were survivors,'' said Rachel Boyman, 
16, from Detroit. Boyman's great-grandparents died in the gas 
chambers of Treblinka, another death camp set up by the Nazis in 
occupied Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing blue jackets with a white ``March of the Living'' logo  
and Star of David on the back, the marchers walked in drizzling 
rain along the road linking the two parts of the Auschwitz-Birkenau 
camp, where the Nazis killed more than 1 million Jews from 1940 to 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Many carried wooden tablets with the names of their relatives  
who died at Auschwitz. They placed them around the Birkenau railway 
tracks, where cattle wagons packed with deportees rolled into the 
camp from all over Europe, bringing them to be gassed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the march, candles were lit and the Jewish prayer  
for the dead was said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his  
Polish counterpart, Jerzy Buzek, led some 7,000 young Jews in the 
largest march so far, marking the 50th anniversary of the founding 
of Israel after the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	The first march was organized by the Israeli education ministry  
in 1988 on a biannual basis. Since 1996, the marches have been held 
each year as a history lesson to young Jews around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Before World War II, Poland had a thriving Jewish population of  
3.5 million, compared to about 20,000 today. Some 75,000 non-Jewish 
Poles also perished at the camp.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Statues May Be Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Visitors to the nation's capitol rub Will  
Rogers' toes for luck as they enter stately Statuary Hall, where 
the sculptures include such well-known figures as Virginians George 
Washington and Robert E. Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Most never heard of Sen. John James Ingalls or Gov. George  
Washington Glick, two now-obscure statesman whom Kansas is hoping 
to evict. 
</P>
<P>
	No state has gotten permission to replace a statue in the  
135-year-old National Statuary Hall Collection. The Kansas 
Legislature, hoping to become the first, sent Congress a resolution 
last month urging the Ingalls and Glick be removed to make room for 
two of the 20th century's most celebrated faces, Amelia Earhart and 
Dwight David Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
	The path to Statuary Hall is strewn with obstacles.  
</P>
<P>
	First, Congress will have to decide whether exchanges are  
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has never happened in the history of the collection,''  
said Barbara Wolanin, the curator in the Capitol architect's 
office. ``The law says each state can give two statues. There just 
is no provision, no precedent at this point. There would have to be 
a legally valid system worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Rep. Jim Ryun: ``We're blazing a trail here.'' The  
Republican's district includes aviator Earhart's hometown of 
Atchison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingalls, a Republican senator from 1873 to 1891, also was a  
newspaper editor who championed anti-slavery forces and worked to 
bring Kansas into the union as a free state. Glick was elected the 
state's first Democratic governor, serving from 1883 to 1885. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the architect's office, a statue given to the  
collection becomes the property of the federal government upon its 
unveiling. Forty-six states have contributed two statues each; 
Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming each are eligible to 
donate one more. 
</P>
<P>
	Statuary Hall showcases 38 from the collection; the others are  
located throughout the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection includes founding fathers and civil war heroes,  
including New Hampshire's Daniel Webster and Confederate President 
Jefferson Davis of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also such beloved figures as Rogers, an Oklahoma  
native, and golden-cloaked King Kamehameha I of Hawaii. The most 
recent addition is Colorado's John L. Swigert, the late astronaut 
on the Apollo 13 flight who coolly uttered, ``Houston, we have a 
problem'' when an explosion ripped apart an oxygen tank 200,000 
miles away from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas matter now rests with the House Committee on  
Administration, which likely will seek advice from the Capitol 
architect's office on structural and space questions and on other 
implications of potential swaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress ignored a 1971 plea from Kansas to replace the likeness  
of Glick, a Democrat, with a sculpture of Eisenhower, although 
today's GOP-led Congress might be more friendly to a former 
Republican president. Earhart would become the seventh woman 
represented in the collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the effort is Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., who wants the  
swap tied to a planned World War II veterans memorial on the 
National Mall. He said it is fitting to honor Eisenhower, the war 
hero-turned-president. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiahrt plans to raise private money to pay for casting or  
chiseling new statues, moving them to Washington and bringing the 
others home to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship between the World War II memorial and an  
Eisenhower statue in the Capitol would be ``a nice tie-in,'' said 
J. Carter Brown, chairman of Washington's Fine Arts Commission. But 
he cautioned about setting a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Congress has to weigh whether it means this constant  
revisionism going on, and that gets very political,'' he said. 
``Perhaps it's better to leave things where they are, even if 
they're not ideal, by virtue of what you are opening up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing states to alter the collection might result in a hall  
of presidents, said George Gurney, the National Gallery of Art's 
curator of sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might have Ronald Reagan turning up,'' Gurney said.  
(California's statues -- of orator Thomas Starr King and Spanish 
missionary Father Junipero Serra -- were given in 1931). 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gurney does not necessarily see harm in allowing  
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit of a gamble, but as far as I'm concerned, I  
think the states probably ought to have some control over what's 
there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Skating Coach Accused of Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A former student and colleague of Richard Callaghan asked the  
U.S. Figure Skating Association and the Professional Skaters 
Association on Tuesday to look into his accusations of sexual 
misconduct and exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The USFSA and the PSA received complaints from Craig Maurizi.  
The PSA has 20 days and the USFSA 30 to decide what to do with the 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need an incredible amount of legal documentation ... and  
that's why our rules are very clear there are 30 days of review to 
make sure our direction is the proper one,'' said USFSA president 
Jim Disbrow, who hasn't yet seen the complaint. ``There will be an 
answer, a definite answer, to where we will be moving at that 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, who coached Tara Lipinski to the gold medal last year  
in the Nagano Olympics, was not notified of the complaints, nor 
will he be before a decision is made, said Dean Groulx, his lawyer. 
Callaghan, who was ``shocked and dismayed'' by the accusations, has 
vehemently denied them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident that when the chair of the grievance  
committee reviews the allegations, it will find the grievance lacks 
merit and will take the appropriate action,'' Groulx said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a story first published Sunday in The New York Times, Maurizi  
said Callaghan, who also coached Todd Eldredge to five national 
championships and a world crown, made improper advances to him when 
he was 15. Maurizi, now 36, said Callaghan abused his authority 
three years later to initiate a full sexual relationship, which 
continued for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times story also contained allegations from two other former  
students, who claim Callaghan made inappropriate remarks or 
gestures to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've decided I'm not going to be granting any further  
interviews for the indefinite future,'' Maurizi said. ``This story 
is getting a little bit out of hand for me, and I haven't been 
spending a whole heck of a lot of time with my family in the last 
few days. I want to slow things down for myself and my family, and 
get a little normalcy back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both complaints will go to a grievance committee chairperson,  
who decides whether any rule has been violated and evaluates the 
timeliness of the complaint. If the chair decides there is merit, a 
panel is formed to investigate and make a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In the USFSA, the panel would consist of three to nine people  
who represent the organization, including athletes, coaches and 
judges, USFSA spokesman Bob Dunlop said. In the PSA, it's a 
three-person panel, PSA president Jerry Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grievance panel would also be responsible for deciding what,  
if any, punishment is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too early to even jump to any conclusions,'' Dunlop  
said. ``It just came in a couple of hours ago. Physically, it 
hasn't had enough time to get to anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time anyone -- including Maurizi -- has filed a  
formal complaint against Callaghan. Maurizi continued working with 
him after their alleged relationship ended, coaching with him in 
San Diego and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi was Callaghan's assistant at the Detroit Skating Club  
until last year, when they split after Lipinski left Callaghan and 
decided to train with Maurizi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's kind of put a cloud over the club at this  
point,'' said Jo Anne Berry, a board member at the Detroit Skating 
Club. ``You can kind of walk through the lobby and you can feel the 
tenseness, but we are trying to deal with it the best way we can.''

<HEADLINE> GM To Expand at Texas Truck Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has approved a plan  
to expand GM's light truck plant in Arlington to produce a new 
generation of full-size trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials declined to say exactly what models will be built at  
Arlington, but industry analysts expect them to be GM's new 
generation of full-size sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlington currently makes the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon  
SUVs, which GM plans to replaced with redesigned versions for the 
2000 model year. Plants in Janesville, Wis., and Silao, Mexico, 
already are being retooled to produce the new Tahoe and Yukon. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, approved by GM's board Monday, is expected to cost  
more than $400 million. When completed, it will double the plant's 
capacity and add about 500 workers. The plant now employs about 
2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely a thing that was well-earned by the people  
here in Arlington, Texas,'' said Guy Briggs, a GM vice president. 
``They can be building trucks for a long, long time.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Yahoo! Makes Hong Kong Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. is teaming up with SmarTone Mobile  
Communications Ltd. to provide content for the Hong Kong mobile 
phone operator's new Internet access site, the companies announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, the Internet's leading search and directory service, and  
SmarTone refused to put a value on the deal that will allow 
SmarTone mobile phone users to access iSmart, the Internet service 
to be launched next week. 
</P>
<P>
	iSmart will give SmarTone a means to compete with services  
offered by Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., the territory's 
largest telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in SmarTone rose 3.5 percent on Tuesday to close at 25.10  
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $3.21), following a 7.1 percent rise on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition in the mobile phone market is stiff, with some 3  
million of Hong Kong's 6.8 million residents owning mobile phones. 
SmarTone offers its users a variety of services including traffic 
speed trap updates, stock quotes and trading via mobile phone and 
news updates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal with Yahoo!, SmarTone users will eventually be able  
to access the service through their mobile phones, executives said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yahoo! partnership with SmarTone is not an exclusive  
deal, said Savio Chow, Asia managing director for Yahoo!. Yahoo!, 
based in Santa Clara, California, will be looking to cooperate with 
other companies in Hong Kong and Asia in the future, co-founder 
Jerry Yang said at a news conference without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet activities have been heating up recently in Hong Kong.  
</P>
<P>
	British Telecommunications PLC last week said that it was  
investing 3.02 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $387 million) to buy 
20 percent of SmarTone, adding that Asia, including China, was a

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 10,395.01 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials closed at a record  
high for the second straight day today, but the rest of the stock 
market lagged as investors collected profits, especially in 
technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 4 p.m. close on Wall Street, the Dow was up 55.50 at  
10,395.01, topping Monday's record close, after having moved in and 
out of positive territory throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue chip index rose as high as 10,418.87, a gain of nearly  
80 points, in early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors bought the shares of economically sensitive companies  
such as basic materials processors and manufacturers, which sent 
the Dow higher. But they also shed technology shares, aside from 
Internet-related stocks, for a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in tech shares took both the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and  
the Nasdaq composite lower on heavy volume, reversing early gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 8.81 to 1,349.83, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 15.34 to 2,583.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,554 to 1,488 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 538 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 665.46 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
657.81 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 1.96 to 631.17, but the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.59 to 736.91. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.95 to 417.27.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a continuation of the last week or so's trend of  
market rotation out of tech stocks and into other sectors of the 
market,'' said Charles Crane, chief market strategist at Key Asset 
Management in New York. Today, investors bought ``more cyclically 
sensitive stocks, which explains why the Dow is doing better than 
the other two (major) indexes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sold technology stocks following Compaq's announcement  
on Friday that its first-quarter profits could be lower than 
expected because of softer personal computer prices. Compaq shares, 
which fell nearly 7 points on Monday, were down another 1/4 at 23 
13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co., said  
the market was in an expected pullback after Monday's strong 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's normal after a 165-point (gain in the Dow)  
yesterday,'' Rice said. ``I don't think it's out of the ordinary 
here, in fact, it's doing as I expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also hampered by lower bond prices. The 30-year  
Treasury bond was down 5/8 point, pushing its yield up to 5.49 
percent from 5.45 percent late Monday. Bond traders were bidding 
prices lower in anticipation of $10 billion in new corporate and 
government-agency debt to be issued soon. There was also concern 
that Japanese insurance companies, big buyers of U.S. bonds, might 
cut back their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell despite a Labor Department report that consumer  
prices edged up a manageable 0.2 percent in March, a sign that 
inflation is under control. Labor also reported that retail sales 
rose a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was anxiously awaiting the release of Intel's results  
after the close of trading today. The microchip maker is seen as a 
bellwether for other high-tech companies. Intel shares were down 
15/16 point at 60 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Positive earnings reports lifted some stocks today, particularly  
the financial services sector. Merrill Lynch retreated after an 
early gain tied a strong earnings report today. Art Hogan, senior 
trader at Jeffries &AMP; Co. in Boston, said Merrill might have fallen 
back on rumors it might be considering an acquisition of Charles 
Schwab, whose shares were up sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Broker PaineWebber also surged after releasing a strong earnings  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did the shares of large cyclical companies climb, but  
smaller-company stocks put in a good day as well, said Barry Hyman, 
senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secondary market is starting to show some life,'' Hyman  
said, and it has to participate in the rally in order for the 
market to go higher. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies 
was closing the day higher.

<HEADLINE> Leukemia Claims BoxCar Willie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- He adopted a hobo persona and won a national  
following as he sang of life on the road. But BoxCar Willie found a 
home in Branson, where he died after a long battle with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old singer died Monday evening, surrounded by his  
wife, two daughters, two sisters and close friends, said Chisai 
Childs, a family spokeswoman and friend of 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
	BoxCar Willie was diagnosed with leukemia three years ago. After  
a brief remission, the disease returned last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Family friend Dick Ringler, who was with the entertainer when he  
died, said BoxCar Willie knew he was losing the battle since being 
hospitalized for two weeks in February, but never mentioned it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me how tired he was, and I had to help him get out of  
his chair, which embarrassed him,'' Ringler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until his health began to fail, he had performed as many as six  
shows a week at the BoxCar Willie Theatre in this Ozark mountain 
town that is home to dozens of music theaters and scores of 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was more than one of Branson's most famous performers. He  
was also one of its most beloved. As a member of the Taney County 
Child Welfare Board he raised thousands of dollars for needy 
children, Ms. Childs said, as well as $40,000 a year for police 
programs to fight crime and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``BoxCar Willie is a friend to many of us and a good citizen of  
Branson,'' Mayor Lou Schaefer said, breaking down as he announced 
the entertainer's death during a Board of Alderman meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Lecil Martin in Sterrett, Texas, in 1931, BoxCar Willie was  
the son of a railroad man who used to play his fiddle on the porch 
while his son played guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	By his teens he was performing in jamborees all over the state,  
but gave up show business to enlist in the Air Force. He spent 22 
years there, logging some 10,000 hours as a flier. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from the service he returned to performing, and  
by the 1970s had developed the singing hobo persona, complete with 
overalls, a battered old hat, worn suit jacket and two days growth 
of beard. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he took the BoxCar Willie look and name after seeing a  
freight train pass him by one day in Lincoln, Neb., as he was stuck 
in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``And there was an old boy sitting on a boxcar, dressed the way  
I dress today, and he looked just like a buddy of mine named Willie 
Wilson,'' he told The Associated Press in 1997. ``I said, `There's 
Willie in a boxcar,' and that's where it came from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was devoted to singing and promoting old-fashioned country  
music, including the sorrowful train songs for which he was best 
known. He never had a hit single, but his albums sold well and he 
built a loyal following that made him one of the most popular 
performers in Branson, where he operated a motel and train museum 
as well as his theater. 
</P>
<P>
	While Roy Clark became the first nationally known entertainer to  
put his name on a Branson theater in 1983, BoxCar Willie, who 
arrived three years later, liked to boast that he was the first big 
name to live and work there year-round. 
</P>
<P>
	He counseled newly arrived performers on what worked and what  
didn't in a conservative, heartland town visited by millions of 
tourists each year. He fumed from time to time about performers who 
left Branson, saying it wouldn't last. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been about 30, 35 artists that came into this town and  
then left since I've been here,'' he said in 1996. ``They don't pay 
their taxes here, they don't vote here. Doggone it, it just kind of 
bothers me. So when somebody says they're leaving, I don't get all 
teary-eyed and panicky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor has ordered flags throughout this tourist town of  
3,700 flown at half-staff until the funeral, which Ms. Childs said 
would be Saturday or Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Pollen Affecting Allergy Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A lack of rain has sent a steady, miserable  
stream of allergy sufferers to Atlanta-area doctors' offices as 
pollen readings soar to levels not seen in years. 
</P>
<P>
	The airborne pollen particles exceeded 6,000 grains per cubic  
millimeter Monday, a particularly nasty day during a spring that's 
already had a lot of sniffling, sneezing, wheezing, rasping and 
watering eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``(People) keep on sneezing until they get exhausted,'' said  
Fauzia Durrani, a Valdosta allergist who has been administering to 
pollen victims for two decades. ``They feel like they have a fever, 
but they don't have a fever. They're just so tired from the 
sneezing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the pollen allergic, the body perceives pine, oak and maple  
emissions as yet another invading germ and reacts accordingly, 
flooding the sinuses and tear ducts with mucus to flush the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like having a cold. Sometimes a real bad cold,'' said  
Dennis Ownby, a pediatric allergist at the Medical College of 
Georgia in Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	While some people's discomfort is generally no worse than seeing  
their cars glazed yellow with pine pollen, others require weekly 
injections to control sensitivity to pollens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh gosh, it's been a really bad week,'' accountant Beth  
Schnurmann said as she received two injections at the Atlanta 
Allergy and Asthma Clinic. ``The whole side of my face swells up, 
my eyes itch. It's bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A mild winter is generally blamed for the heavy pollen  
production and spring growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trees and the pollen-producing plants are fairly healthy  
coming into this spring,'' said David Tanner, an allergist at the 
Atlanta clinic.

<HEADLINE> Gun Dealer Settles With Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A gun dealer has reached a settlement with the  
city in a $433 million landmark lawsuit accusing the gun industry 
of flooding the streets with weapons deliberately marketed to 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Taborden, owner of Bob's Sports Headquarters in suburban  
Justice, is one of 40 gun dealers and manufacturers named in the 
lawsuit, which was filed by the city and Cook County last fall. He 
is the first to settle. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement Taborden will cooperate in the ongoing  
investigation of the firearms industry and testify for the city and 
county when the case goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have a witness who can give us an insider's account of  
the manner in which this industry knowingly markets illegal 
firearms in Chicago,'' Corporation Counsel Brian Crowe said in a 
statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the city and county will drop all claims for damages  
against Taborden and his business, the city said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which officials expect to be a national test case,  
charges the gun industry with creating a public nuisance in Chicago 
by oversupplying suburban gun stores with firearms, knowing they 
will eventually make their way back into the city. Chicago has some 
of the toughest gun laws in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar lawsuits have been filed in New Orleans, Miami, Atlanta  
and Bridgeport, Conn.

<HEADLINE> Six AP Photographers Win Pulitzer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Just minutes after hearing a frightening  
explosion, Associated Press photographers Khalil Senosi and Sayyid 
Azim were racing with their cameras past bleeding Kenyans through 
the streets of downtown Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy had just been bombed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We got to the scene and just started clicking. There was panic  
all over,'' Azim said. ``It was awful seeing the people lying in 
the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Azim, Senosi and four other AP photographers won the Pulitzer  
Prize on Monday for spot photography for their coverage of the 
nearly simultaneous bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and 
Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nairobi bombing killed 213 people, all but 12 of them  
Kenyans. In Dar es Salaam, 11 people were killed and 85 injured, 
all of them African. 
</P>
<P>
	The other winners were Jean-Marc Bouju, AP's chief of  
photography in East Africa; Dave Caulkin, a London-based 
photographer; Brennan Linsley, a Rwanda-based photographer; and 
John McConnico, AP's Southeast Asia photo editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Azim and Senosi were among the first to arrive at the bombing  
scene, about a half-mile from the AP office. Not even the U.S. 
Marines had moved into position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just thinking to get the pictures, but I was also  
thinking about the people who were risking their lives trying to 
get people out of the rubble,'' Senosi said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Senosi, a Kenyan who started working for the AP in 1986 as a  
darkroom technician, has been taking photos for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Senosi's photo of ordinary Kenyans scrambling to rescue people  
from the collapsed Ufundi House building next to the embassy made 
front pages of newspapers around the world. That picture won Senosi 
honorable mention in the 1999 World Press Photo competition. 
</P>
<P>
	As news of the bombing spread, Linsley flew to Tanzania, while  
Caulkin and McConnico flew to Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnico praised the rapport among the diverse collection of  
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this group of guys its even more gratifying to win (the  
Pulitzer) as a group than to win it alone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the explosion, the team of photographers worked 24 hour a  
day for weeks covering the aftermath. Some of them slept on couches 
in the office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to have everyone rewarded for a good job on a hard  
story,'' Bouju said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouju praised AP photo editors in London, Frankfurt and New York  
who worked with them on the story, and the Kenyan staff in Nairobi 
who ferried film and performed the vital but unsung jobs that made 
it possible to file more than 40 pictures in the first 48 hours 
after the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning photos included bleeding victims running from the  
scene, emergency workers trying to help them -- and a Kenyan woman 
blinded in the blast holding her newborn daughter in her arms three 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
	In one photo, Kenyans walking through the city morgue covered  
their noses and shielded their eyes even as they tried to identify 
relatives and friends. Another, of a nighttime peace vigil, 
captured the image of Kenyans with their faces illuminated by the 
candles they held. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouju, who shared the 1995 Pulitzer for spot news photography  
for his pictures of the Rwandan genocide, said he hoped the photos 
made a lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe this will help people not to forget, because there are  
still a lot of blind people and people who have to live with 
this,'' he said.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The number of Mexicans who died while trying  
to cross illegally into the United States quadrupled last year as a 
result of tougher surveillance by the U.S. Border Patrol, Mexico's 
undersecretary for migration said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican government estimates more than 350 people died  
trying to enter the United States in 1998. It argues that 
heightened U.S. patrols have forced immigrants into more dangerous 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration Undersecretary Fernando Solis Camara noted the  
increased deaths while meeting Tuesday with four Southern 
California mayors to discuss the impact of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	Camara called on the four mayors -- from Santa Ana, San  
Bernardino, Irvine and Long Beach -- to work to overcome any 
anti-immigrant feelings there may be in California, where most 
Mexicans go.

	ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) -- A court has overturned guilty verdicts  
for 15 state police officers convicted of massacring 17 farm 
workers in the Pacific state of Guerrero in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers, who had been sentenced to 18 years, claimed they  
were forced by a state official to confess to participating in the 
massacre. A total 28 policemen were convicted in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's ruling by the 21st Circuit Court means the 15 officers  
could be freed from jail this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The massacre in the hamlet of Aguas Blancas remains one of the  
most visible stains on Mexico's human rights record and helped 
spark a guerrilla uprising in Guerrero that continues to claim 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said as many as 300 state policemen stopped the  
peasant group and opened fire without warning. Videotapes later 
showed the officers placing guns in the victims' hands.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- President Ernesto Zedillo will lead a Mexican  
trade mission to the Dominican Republic this week, the state 
export-import bank Bancomext said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo will be accompanied by representatives of 25 companies  
interested in discussing business opportunities in the Caribbean 
country on the mission Wednesday and Thursday, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bancomext said Mexico exported $270.3 million to the Caribbean  
country in 1998, mostly in automobiles and parts, tractors, 
pharmaceuticals, textiles and processed food. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dominican Republic exported $13 million in cocoa, leather,  
clothing products and cigars to Mexico in 1998.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Police in the border state of Sonora have  
detained seven soldiers who allegedly fired at a pickup truck 
transporting farm workers, killing a 60-year-old man and seriously 
wounding another, Mexico City media reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting took place Monday in San Luis Rio Colorado, across  
the border from Yuma, Arizona, when the truck's driver failed to 
see a military highway checkpoint and drove past it. The soldiers 
then fired at the truck, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Cervantes died instantly, while another farm worker was  
shot in the head and taken to a hospital in Mexicali. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Reynaldo Reynaga, a local military official, turned the  
seven soldiers over to police, newspapers reported. The Defense 
Ministry in Mexico City said Tuesday it had no comment.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Three Ecuadorian men who had hidden in the

boarded the boat to Tokyo in the Ecuadorian port of Guayaquil on 
March 21, Ecuador's Ambassador in Tokyo, Juan Salazar, said in 
telephone interview with an Ecuadorean television station. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were apparently trying to illegally enter California,  
where the boat stopped en route to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boats have sophisticated systems to preserve the fruit  
which diminish the amount of oxygen in the holds. A human being 
cannot survive in them,'' Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Families members of the stowaways said the men had paid a port  
worker $600 to hide on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were told that it would be easy. That the trip to  
California lasted only seven or eight days and they could climb out 
of the holds to get air,'' said Shelika Parrales, sister of one of 
the dead men.

<HEADLINE> Motorola's Profits Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Motorola Corp.'s first-quarter earnings rose  
sharply as the technology company benefited from the release of 
digital cellular products and sharp improvements in its 
semiconductor business. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended April 3, net income rose to $171  
million, or 28 cents a share, compared with $180 million, or 30 
cents a share, the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The year-ago results, however, included gains from the sale of  
assets and favorable settlement of patent claims. Excluding those, 
the year-ago results were $142 million, or 23 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results announced Tuesday exceeded Wall Street expectations  
of 24 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by First 
Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings report was released after the close of trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Motorola shares rose $1 to $82.93 3/4 on 
Tuesday amid anticipation the company would report strong results. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter rose 5 percent to $7.2 billion from $6.9  
billion in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schaumburg-based communications equipment manufacturer said  
cost-cutting measures, including a work force reduction of 17,000 
employees, are starting to pay off and that strong digital 
telephone sales also are helping. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital wireless telephone sales represented 80 percent of the  
company's wireless telephone sales, and growth was particularly 
strong for CDMA wireless telephones, one of three competing 
standards in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Semiconductor sales rose 4 percent to $1.9 billion and orders  
increased 11 percent in the latest first quarter amid more business 
in Asia and North and South America. Orders declined in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiconductor segment had an operating profit of $47 million  
in the latest first quarter, compared with an operating loss of $58 
million in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Christopher Galvin said Motorola expects results  
to continue improving in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> El-Amin Arrested on Drug Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Khalid El-Amin, who helped Connecticut  
win its first national championship just 15 days ago, was arrested 
Tuesday and charged with possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	The sophomore point guard was in a car when he was arrested and  
charged with possession of less than four ounces of marijuana, 
police said. He was also charged with a minor traffic infraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Another UConn star, junior Richard Hamilton, was with El-Amin  
when he was arrested, said Lt. Mike Manzi, a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, a first-team All-America, was not charged. But members  
of the Statewide Narcotics Task Force, who made the arrest, 
impounded the late-model red Cadillac the players were in. Police 
would not say to whom the car is registered. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin was hustled out of a police substation in the city's  
North End, just after 6 p.m., and taken to the main police station 
where he was booked and released on a written promise to appear in 
Hartford Superior Court on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen teen-agers had gathered at the substation on news  
of the arrest. They cheered as El-Amin eluded reporters and dived 
into the backseat of the waiting cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Johnson, an attorney who represented El-Amin at the  
booking, said the player would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun issued a statement late Tuesday  
saying he will ``deal with the matter within our program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the business of educating and that is an on-going  
process,'' he said. ``I'll stand by Khalid's side as this matter is 
resolved to help insure that he fully understands his position as a 
highly visible student-athlete and role model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin, a 5-foot-10 point guard, led the Huskies (36-2) to a  
77-74 victory over top-ranked Duke in the national championship 
game on March 29. It was the school's first trip to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin announced last week that he would return to UConn for  
his junior season rather than make himself eligible for the NBA 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	He has started 71 games and became the third UConn player to  
score 1,000 points as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two seasons, he has averaged 14.9 points and 4.1  
assists. He finished was second in scoring this season at 13.8 
points and led the team in assists with 140. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin was voted to the Final Four all-tournament team after  
scoring 30 points and handing out 10 assists in the wins over Ohio 
State and Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin's arrest came one day after Minneapolis North High  
School in Minnesota retired his jersey. El-Amin graduated from 
North in 1997 after leading the Polars to three consecutive state 
high school basketball championships.

<HEADLINE>  Judge Sentences Kevorkian to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who videotaped himself  
giving a man a lethal injection and dared prosecutors to stop his 
assisted-suicide campaign, was sentenced to 10 to 25 years in 
prison Tuesday by a judge who told him: ``Sir, consider yourself 
stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who turns 71 next month, grinned as he was led from  
the courtroom in handcuffs, saying to a friend, ``Justice?'' He 
said nothing when given the opportunity to speak at his sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jessica Cooper refused to release him on bail while he  
appeals his murder conviction, saying she couldn't trust his 
promise not to take part in any more suicides. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is what he believes his life mission is,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to giving Kevorkian the sentence prosecutors asked  
for, the judge handed him three to seven years for delivery of a 
controlled substance. The sentences will run concurrently, and 
Kevorkian will be eligible for parole after six years and eight 
months, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have gotten life in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney David Gorosh said that he was surprised by the  
judge's decision and that he hopes it does not amount to a life 
sentence for Kevorkian: ``It would be a terrible tragedy to lose 
such a heroic figure in American life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The widow and brother of Thomas Youk, the 52-year-old Lou  
Gehrig's disease patient whose videotaped death was shown on ``60 
Minutes'' last fall, pleaded for leniency. But Cooper was adamant 
as she lectured Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	``This trial was not about the political or moral correctness of  
euthanasia,'' the judge said. ``It was about you, sir. It was about 
lawlessness. It was about disrespect for a society that exists 
because of the strength of the legal system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one, sir, is above the law. No one,'' she continued. ``You  
had the audacity to go on national television, show the world what 
you did and dare the legal system to stop you. Well, sir, consider 
yourself stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, she predicted the debate that Kevorkian brought to the  
fore will continue ``long after this trial and your activities fade 
from public memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On ``60 Minutes,'' Kevorkian threatened a hunger strike if sent  
to prison -- a claim he has not repeated. If he does go on a hunger 
strike, Michigan prison policy calls for forced feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian injected Youk with lethal chemicals on Sept. 17 at  
Youk's request. Youk was in a wheelchair, could barely move his 
arms or legs and was afraid of choking to death on his own saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical examiners considered the death suspicious. But they had  
little to go on until Kevorkian sent a videotape to CBS. The tape 
and the ``60 Minutes'' interview with Kevorkian were the 
prosecution's main evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first murder trial for Kevorkian, a retired  
pathologist who says he has been involved in 130 deaths since 1990, 
and the first time he was found guilty of taking part in a death. 
His previous trials, all on assisted-suicide charges, resulted in 
three acquittals and one mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	In past cases, Kevorkian said his patients used his homemade  
devices to start the flow of carbon monoxide or intravenous 
chemicals that caused their death. In Youk's case, Kevorkian 
administered the injection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think as far as he's concerned he thinks that what he did  
was proper,'' Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth said. ``He knew 
the risks, and in order to move the process he took the risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian represented himself for most of his short trial, which  
ended last month with a second-degree murder conviction. He 
compared himself to civil rights heroes and all but asked the jury 
to disregard the law, saying that some acts ``by sheer common sense 
are not crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, the judge wouldn't let Kevorkian call Youk's  
widow and brother as witnesses. But they were allowed to speak on 
Kevorkian's behalf at the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Melody Youk choked back tears as she described her husband's  
suffering and praised Kevorkian. ``He was not depressed, he was not 
a victim,'' she said. ``He requested Dr. Kevorkian's help and was 
grateful for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor John Skrzynski argued that Kevorkian created his own  
fate and deserved no leniency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we came in to this court is because Dr. Kevorkian  
appeared on TV with the tape ... and dared the prosecution to do 
its job,'' he said. ``This case is what Jack Kevorkian did, and in 
this state, what Jack Kevorkian did was murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was taken to the state prison at Jackson, where  
officials will evaluate him and determine whether to send him to a 
minimum-, medium- or maximum-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence was applauded by members of Not Dead Yet, a  
disabled-rights group that opposes Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack Kevorkian has been killing members of the disabled  
community for years and has been getting away with it,'' said 
32-year-old Cal Montgomery of Chicago, who suffers from a nerve 
disease and needs crutches. ``I hope this is the end of the 
euthanasia movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Schwartz, Kevorkian's friend and former lawyer who heard  
him say ``Justice?'', said Kevorkian might push a hunger strike in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Dr. Kevorkian says he's going to do something, he'll do  
it,'' Schwartz said. ``Dr. Kevorkian is not going to just sit there 
for the next 10 to 25 years.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Convicted in TWA Evidence Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury convicted a couple of conspiracy and  
aiding and abetting thievery in a trial stemming from the crash of 
TWA 800 that their attorneys tried to turn into a referendum on the 
``missile theory'' and the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict in federal court in Uniondale could mean up to 10  
years in prison for James Sanders, 53, a self-styled investigative 
reporter who claimed the U.S. Navy mistakenly shot down the 
jetliner, and his wife, Elizabeth, 52, a former TWA employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The week-long trial was the first test of a law passed after an  
earlier plane crash in Florida, making it a federal crime to steal 
pieces of evidence from a civil aircraft crash site. 
</P>
<P>
	It also drew a half dozen hard-core believers in the theory that  
a missile brought down the Boeing 747 jumbo jet on July 17, 1996, 
killing all 230 aboard -- not a fuel tank explosion, as government 
investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense argued that Sanders, as an ``investigative  
reporter,'' was protected by the First Amendment in seeking to 
prove his theory and expose a government cover-up, even though it 
involved stolen documents and scraps of upholstery allegedly 
stained with ``missile fuel residue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor David Pitofsky told jurors that the Long Island  
hangar where investigators reassembled the jetliner's wreckage 
after the crash was as much a ``crime scene'' as if the FBI had put 
yellow tape around it, and that Sanders, as a retired California 
cop, should have known better than to steal from it. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board says the Paris-bound  
jetliner was destroyed by a fuel tank explosion. In ruling out 
sabotage or a missile attack, the FBI rejected the ``friendly 
fire'' scenario and said the cloth stains were from glue used to 
hold the seat covers together. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, of Williamsburg, Va., said he was confident of winning  
on appeal. ``I wouldn't have started down this road if I wasn't 
prepared to go to jail.''

<HEADLINE> USDA Declares Meat Products Unfit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal food inspectors declared unfit for  
human consumption 21 million pounds of meat and poultry produced by 
the same Arkansas plant from which 30 million pounds of meat 
products were recalled three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat, products of the Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City,  
Ark., plant, was being housed in warehouses and waiting to be 
shipped to distributors, officials with the Agriculture 
Department's food safety and inspection service said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Thorn Apple Valley recalled 30 million pounds of hot  
dogs and luncheon meats produced at the same Arkansas plant. That 
recall was because of possible contamination with the listeria 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials said an investigation begun after the recall led  
them to halt the use of all of the remaining product. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorn Apple Valley, based in Southfield, Mich., has  
approximately 9 million pounds of meat and poultry products on hold 
in warehouses across the United States. More than 12 million pounds 
of products subject to recall were exported to Russia and South 
Korea, and Agriculture Department officials said appropriate 
international officials have been notified of the latest action. 
</P>
<P>
	``These products may contain physical, chemical and-or  
microbiological contaminants that render the product adulterated 
and not fit for human consumption,'' an agency release said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant has not produced hot dogs or luncheon meats since Dec.  
31, when USDA suspended inspection because the plant had not 
complied with sanitation requirements, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department said people should check their  
refrigerators for products bearing the codes ``EST 13529'' or ``EST 
P-13529.'' Any such products should be returned to the wherever it 
was bought. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall covered products produced between July and December  
1998.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Work Out Budget Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders plan to move  
a $1.7 trillion budget through Congress this week after working out 
a House-Senate compromise on the spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The two chambers' GOP leaders struck their agreement Monday  
night, putting them in the unusual position of being able to 
approve the measure by the usually ignored April 15 legal deadline. 
The deal had been expected since the two GOP-written measures had 
only minor differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few little technical changes, we resolved everything,'' said  
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending plan, designed to highlight the Republicans'  
political message, would pave the way for about $800 billion in tax 
cuts over the next decade while setting aside Social Security 
surpluses and heeding spending limits enacted two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has proposed far smaller tax reductions, and  
has said the Republican plan does not set aside enough money to 
buttress Medicare for the looming retirement of baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	The blueprint sets overall limits for spending and taxes for the  
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and does not require Clinton's 
signature. It leaves for later legislation details about which 
taxes to cut and how to trim spending to obey budget limits. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the bigger questions, the two chambers agreed not to  
decide until later this year what to do with any additional federal 
surpluses that are projected this summer. Many conservatives wanted 
the extra money set aside for a bigger tax cut, but others 
preferred that it be used to further reduce the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici and others say they now expect this summer's updated  
surplus estimate to show little change from current projections, 
which would mean the tax cut would not get much larger. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's agreement makes it likely Congress will be able to meet  
the deadline for passing its budget, following through on 
Republicans' promises to do their work on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a dispute between House and Senate Republicans over  
tax cuts prevented them from approving a budget for the first time 
since the current budget process began in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Quayle: Don't 'Trash' Our Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle,  
calling the 1990s ``the dishonest decade of Bill Clinton and Al 
Gore,'' is formally launching his presidential campaign today by 
pledging to restore integrity and responsibility to the White House 
in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come to reset the moral compass,'' Quayle said in  
a text of an address he was delivering at Huntington North High 
School. ``We must not stand by and let our values be trashed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first bid for elective office since President Clinton  
toppled the Bush-Quayle ticket six years ago, the former Indiana 
senator sought to both attack Gore -- the potential Democratic 
nominee who succeeded Quayle as vice president -- and acquit himself 
for casting a white-hot spotlight on the family values debate in 
the 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle was criticized by Democrats and mocked by late-night  
comics for questioning the morality of a TV sitcom character in May 
1992. ``Murphy Brown is gone,'' Quayle now says, ``and I'm still 
here fighting for the American family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He derided Gore for being the president's chief defender during  
the impeachment saga, accusing the pair of showing ``contempt for 
the values parents try to teach their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are coming to the end of the dishonest decade of Bill  
Clinton and Al Gore, and America needs a fresh start,'' Quayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle promoted his proposed 30 percent across-the-board tax  
cut, billing it as a boon to middle-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	And he portrayed himself as the best qualified potential  
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war 
councils and his service on foreign policy committees in the House 
and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't learn foreign policy from briefing books or crash  
courses,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused Clinton and Gore of compromising U.S. sovereignty,  
starving the armed forces' budgets and using the military ``as a 
laboratory for their social experiments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the sting of Quayle's remarks went beyond the  
administration. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the early favorite for 
the GOP nomination, is getting scores of private briefings to bone 
up on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	And aides would not say whether Quayle was targeting Bush or  
Gore when he declared: ``A presidential nomination is not something 
that is inherited. It must be earned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their silence suggested that the line was written with both in  
mind; Gore is Clinton's choice to win in 2000, and Bush is the son 
of the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, 52, is a longshot for the nomination despite his  
popularity among grassroots activists. 
</P>
<P>
	He joins a crowded field of social conservative candidates  
wrestling over the same votes. His campaign team has come together 
slowly. And he raised about $2 million in the first quarter of 1999 
-- $1 million less than projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's largest obstacle is what one supporter calls the  
``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day he misspelled the word 
in a classroom full of school children. That and other gaffes 
turned the vice president into a punchline for countless jokes, 
cementing for many Americans the perception that Quayle was 
ill-suited for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	His supporters argue that Quayle will easily exceed those low  
expectations to sneak up on Bush, who they say can't live up to his 
early billing. If the former vice president can emerge from Iowa 
and New Hampshire as the choice of social conservatives, his 
miscues would fade from memory in the showdown against Bush, 
supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Americans will begin to see a rejuvenated Dan Quayle  
with great campaign skills,'' said Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. 
``George Bush has done a good job of building interest, but now he 
has the tough job of rising to those expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle has lost key supporters to Bush, including former aides  
David Beckwith and Al Hubbard. Hubbard, how helping Bush recruit 
policy experts, subscribes to a widespread belief that Quayle would 
be in better position today if he had run for Indiana governor in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have been a great governor and could have shown  
people that he can be a great chief executive officer,'' Hubbard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard is not the only Indiana Republican with doubts about  
Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP chairman Mike McDaniel has yet to endorse a GOP  
presidential candidate, which is not a good sign for favorite son 
Quayle, a 1965 graduate of Huntington High School who now lives in 
Phoenix. Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith is a top Bush 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in our party are hungry to win this presidential  
election, and I think some of them, even though they probably agree 
with 98 percent of everything Dan Quayle says, wonder if he can win 
or not because of the image that he portrays,'' McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their recent retreat, some Republican state chairmen used the  
term ``Quayle-ized'' to describe the fate facing Gore if jokes 
persist about his political miscues. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle believes he has found a way to deal with the perception  
problem: Portray the ridicule as a trial by fire, an example of how 
he could withstand the pressures of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the term (the GOP chairmen) used,'' Quayle told  
The Associated Press before today's address. ``But my advice to 
Gore is to lighten up and enjoy it. If he shows this is really 
getting to him, if he can't handle this, he won't even come close 
to handling the presidency.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Panel Postpones Utah Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic organizers will postpone purchase  
of the Utah Winter Sports Park for 90 days so they and the U.S. 
Olympic Committee can contend with the 2002 Winter Games' 
scandal-reduced budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The park and a speed-skating oval could be shut down for a year  
under the cuts Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney 
proposes as a hedge against a shortfall in the last $300 million 
needed to finance the games' $1.45 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Operation of those Olympic facilities -- the ski jump, bobsled,  
luge and speed-skating venues -- would be cut by $5 million, which 
is part of $84 million in cuts Romney proposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts do not sit well with the USOC and athletes, who want  
the venues open for training during the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC vice president Sandy Baldwin appeared today before the  
SLOC's finance committee to argue for the delay in the purchase. 
The committee voted to put the purchase on hold for 90 days, 
something the SLOC management could have done without a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the magnitude of the cuts proposed is necessary  
at all,'' Baldwin said after the meeting. USOC is convinced it and 
the SLOC will be able to raise $300 million more from corporate 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You shouldn't cut it when it deals with athletes,'' Baldwin  
said. ``If U.S. athletes do not do well in the 2002 Games, it will 
reflect on the games and training is part of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC was supposed to close Thursday on the purchase of the  
park near Park City from the Utah Sports Authority, which built it 
with taxpayer money. The park was to be returned to state ownership 
after the games, along with $99 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Authority director Randy Dryer proposed the 90-day delay  
so the ramifications of the $5 million cut in SLOC's budget can be 
reconsidered. He will ask the executive board of the sports 
authority to endorse the delay on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dryer said it was not clear how long the park and the Oquirrh  
Skating Oval at Kearns would have to be closed. The $5 million 
amounts to about a third of the total the SLOC has budgeted for 
operating the park and the skating oval for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue for high performance athletes and the community  
as well,'' Dryer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that tens of thousands of youngsters use the skating  
oval, and thousands of citizens have used the ski jumps and luge 
track at the Utah Winter Sports Park. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Romney said the SLOC also does not plan to contribute  
cash for USOC's $9 million project to restore public trust in the 
wake of the Salt Lake bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	While Romney has ruled out a cash donation, he said he is still  
considering whether the SLOC can afford to give $1 million in goods 
and services. He said he informed USOC officials of his decision 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're behind in fund-raising, and everything can't be laid at  
Salt Lake's feet to solve,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our view is their role is to raise the money. They need to  
take any and all action necessary to do that,'' Romney said. ``If 
there's some costs, that's something they should bear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But John Krimsky, the USOC Secretary General and president of  
the joint marketing venture between the two committees, said Salt 
Lake has a responsibility to help convey to the world that the 
scandal is in the past.

<HEADLINE> Jenny Jones Defends Her Talk Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Jenny Jones denied Tuesday that her talk  
show tries to ``ambush'' guests to boost ratings, as alleged by the 
family of a gay man who was killed by another guest. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones testified for the second day in the trial of a $50 million  
wrongful death lawsuit by the family of Scott Amedure, who was 
killed by Jonathan Schmitz three days after they taped a March 1995 
episode of ``The Jenny Jones Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The segment -- about same-sex secret crushes -- never aired.  
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit against the show and its producer, Warner Bros.,  
contends the show humiliated Schmitz with Amedure's on-camera 
description of his sexual fantasy involving Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amedures say the show of negligently tricked an emotional  
unstable Schmitz into appearing on the program, leading him to 
believe his admirer was a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Under continued questioning from Amedure family attorney  
Geoffrey Fieger, Ms. Jones acknowledged her show taped the segment 
without having researched Schmitz's mental fitness. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger has said Schmitz attempted suicide four times since 1989  
and battled chronic depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to have Schmitz, on camera, watch a tape of Amedure  
describing the fantasy was unscripted, Ms. Jones testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if that amounted to an ``ambush'' of an unwitting guest,  
Ms. Jones told Fieger: ``If you're using the word `ambush,' I'm not 
going to agree with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, Schmitz shot Amedure to death. He was  
convicted in 1996 of second-degree murder. The conviction later was 
overturned because of an error in jury selection. His retrial is 
scheduled for Aug. 19.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Acquitted on One Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Prosecutors say they will decide soon  
whether to retry Whitewater figure Susan McDougal after a jury 
deadlocked on two criminal contempt charges while acquitting her of 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a little numb,'' Mrs. McDougal said after the  
verdicts Monday. ``I've been indicted since 1993, and this is the 
first day I haven't been indicted in years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he was ``pleased to learn'' that Mrs.  
McDougal, his former friend and business partner, had been 
acquitted of obstruction of justice, said White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart. ``He wishes all the best for her and her family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was indicted after she refused twice to answer  
questions before the grand jury about the Clintons business 
dealings. She said she believed independent counsel Kenneth Starr 
was out to ``get'' the Clintons and would charge her with perjury 
if he didn't like her answers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Barrett said Starr anticipated making a decision  
this week on whether to seek a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a notorious case of someone basically being warned  
time and again and simply not answering questions,'' said Barrett. 
``I make no apologies for bringing this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense criticized Starr's tactics during the trial, and  
McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos challenged prosecutors to try his 
client again. ``They don't have the guts to retry this case again 
because now we know where the bodies are buried,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said if there is a retrial on the two criminal contempt  
counts, it is unlikely Mrs. McDougal would be allowed to again 
inject her allegations that Starr wanted her to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors planned to ask the court for permission to speak to  
the jurors before deciding whether to retry the case. The jury 
deadlocked 7-5 in favor of acquittal on the contempt counts. A 
sticking point apparently was the defense argument that Mrs. 
McDougal feared Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge instructed the jurors that they could consider whether  
Mrs. McDougal believed Starr wanted her to lie only in deciding the 
obstruction charge. But his instruction on the contempt charges 
allowed them to consider whether Mrs. McDougal ``willfully'' 
violated a court order by refusing to answer the questions. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the jurors who wanted to acquit Mrs. McDougal on all  
three counts, Michael Nance, said he believed she refused to 
testify because ``She honestly believed that she could be held for 
a false statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After eight hours and 45 minutes of deliberations, spread over  
three days, the jurors sent out a note at midday Monday saying they 
were ``hopelessly deadlocked'' on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal took the witness stand in her own defense at one  
point during the five-week trial, answering some of the same 
questions she refused to address in front of the grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal already had served 18 months in jail for civil  
contempt based on her refusal to answer grand jury questions. She 
also served 3 1/2 months of a two-year term on four felony convictions 
in her 1996 trial. Howard released her from prison because of a 
back problem before she finished serving her time on the felony 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent so many months in jail thinking that someday I'll get  
to tell the people the truth,'' Mrs. McDougal said.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Starr Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's remarks to the  
Senate Government Affairs Committee on whether Congress should 
renew the 1978 act that put him in power: 

</P>
<P>
	``I respectfully recommend that the statute not be reenacted.  
... Jurisdiction and authority over these cases ought to be 
returned to the Justice Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics ultimately cannot be separated from accountability.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Returning the authority over these prosecutions to attorneys  
general and relying on them to appoint outside counsel when 
necessary, is the worst system -- except for all the others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Solutions are bound to be transitory. Twenty-five years after  
the Saturday Night Massacre, we are still searching for a 
reasonable, effective and constitutional approach. No matter what 
Congress decides, no matter what microsurgical precision is applied 
to fine-tune the statute, these problems will endure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Let the statute lapse ... and then reassess after the current  
intensities have passed and when -- in the words of 'Federalist 2' -- 
no one will be 'influenced by any passions except love of 
country.''' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The requirement (to report to Congress) may encourage  
Independent Counsels to continue turning stones after they have 
concluded that no prosecutable criminal case exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Independence can be misrepresented as antagonism.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We limited our report to matters that we had investigated, and  
we limited our investigation to possible crimes related to Jones v. 
Clinton. We omitted from the report certain information in our 
possession, including now-public, gravely serious allegations, 
because evaluating those matters was beyond the scope of our law 
enforcement investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On expanding his probe: ``The number of expansions is unique,  
and it may have fed the misconception that we were investigating 
individuals rather than outcomes. Let me make clear: That was not 
the case. Indeed, I am as proud of our decisions not to bring 
several indictments as I am of anything else we have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``An independent counsel who responds to criticism simply  
invites more of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have seen something more than the norm ... while  
the judges worked diligently inside the courthouse, a carnival-like 
atmosphere prevailed outside. Some grand jury witnesses cowered in 
anguish as they were aggressively pursued by TV cameras.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Meanwhile, the assaults took a toll. A duly authorized federal  
law-enforcement investigation came to be characterized as yet 
another political game. Law became politics by other means. The 
impact on public attitudes was unmistakable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The statutory mechanism intended to enhance confidence in law  
enforcement thus had the effect of weakening it.''

<HEADLINE> Duke Sophomore Star Brand To Go Pro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Elton Brand is set to become Duke's first  
underclassman to leave early for the NBA, and he might have company 
before too long. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, college basketball's player of the year, and Blue Devils  
associate head coach Johnny Dawkins will hold a news conference 
Wednesday, when the 6-foot-8 sophomore center is expected to 
announce he will bypass his last two years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The next question is whether Brand's teammates -- sophomore  
William Avery and freshman Corey Maggette -- will join him in 
leaving school. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawkins did not return a call to his office Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Avery's mother said she and her son met Friday with coach Mike  
Krzyzewski at his home, where he is recovering from hip surgery, to 
discuss Avery's pro prospects. Terry Simonton said her son is 
leaning toward staying in school next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we talked to him, we were staying,'' she told The News &AMP;  
Observer of Raleigh. ``But K said it wasn't a decision that has to 
be rushed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer Tuesday at an Augusta, Ga., telephone  
listing in Simonton's name. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was irked by a report in the Duke student newspaper  
Monday that Avery was considering leaving partly because of poor 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with Will's grades,'' Simonton said.  
</P>

	NBA scouting director Marty Blake is confounded by the notion of  
Maggette leaving Duke.

Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, Avery and Maggette all have unlisted phone numbers and  
could not be reached.

<P>
	He was the first sophomore to win the John R. Wooden Award,  
presented by the Los Angeles Athletic Club to college basketball's

<HEADLINE> Retailers Prepare for 'Star Wars' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With ``Star Wars'' mania heating up across the  
nation, retailers are gearing up for what's expected to be one of 
the biggest rollouts of licensed merchandise in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us is expected to announce on Wednesday that most of its  
1,500 stores will open at 12:01 a.m. on May 3, the first day that 
merchants are permitted to sell goods based on ``Star Wars: Episode 
I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Paramus, N.J.-based retailer also plans to dedicate a large  
area of its stores entirely to the ``Star Wars'' line. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's biggest retailer, told The  
Associated Press that it also plans to offer a vast selection of 
``Star Wars'' items beginning on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars''-related goods -- from snack foods to body lotion to  
skateboards -- will be found in 16 of the 36 different departments 
in Wal-Mart's stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wal-Mart is supporting this film with more movie-related  
merchandise than any other film in our history,'' said Les 
Copeland, spokesman for Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect sales of merchandise tied to the movie could top  
$2 billion this year alone, with an estimated $1 billion coming 
from toy sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie debuts May 19.  
</P>
<P>
	Merchants expect anxious ``Star Wars'' fans --both children and  
avid adult collectors -- to begin lining up well-before midnight on 
May 3, hoping to be one of the first to get a glimpse of the movie 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars'' director George Lucas signed strict licensing  
deals with manufacturers that prevented them from releasing 
virtually all information on their products to the general public, 
including the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas, who financed the $115 million movie himself, also chose  
the May 3 launch date for the merchandise to hit store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the huge demand for this merchandise, merchants will keep  
the ``Star Wars'' goods under lock-and-key until they can begin 
stocking store shelves late on May 2.

<HEADLINE>  The 'Great One' May Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With speculation growing about Wayne Gretzky's  
future, even he admits it's time to think about retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, Gretzky insisted he had not made up his mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have 1,000 different thoughts, to be honest,'' Gretzky said  
after the New York Rangers played their second-last game at Madison 
Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old hockey great is in the last year of a contract  
and has said he would decide sometime after the season. He 
acknowledged, however, retirement was under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to think about it. ... All of a sudden it's become a  
bigger issue than I imagined,'' he said. ``Let's see what happens 
over the next five or six days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post reported today that Gretzky will retire after  
the Rangers' season finale Sunday, citing what it described as 
``unimpeachable sources in whom The Great One has confided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has made up his mind, but he has had his reasons for not  
wanting to make an announcement,'' the Post quoted an unidentified 
person it described as having knowledge of the retirement decision 
as saying. ``But it's done. He is not coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto Sun also reported Gretzky would retire, saying the  
only way he would revise his decision to quit would be if his wife, 
Janet, and agent, Michael Barnett, urged him to step back and 
review his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out soon enough,'' Rangers coach John Muckler said  
following Monday night's 2-1 victory over Tampa Bay. ``Everybody is 
speculating, but only one person knows for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun and ESPN quoted unidentified sources as saying Gretzky  
asked for an unusually large number of tickets for Sunday's game. 
The Rangers, though, said today that Gretzky has asked for 10 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's at 10, nothing out of the ordinary,'' Rangers spokesman  
Rob Koch said, adding that player allotment is usually between four 
and eight tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest speculation was inspired by a TV report that said  
Gretzky's retirement was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	John Davidson, a color commentator for the Rangers, said Sunday  
on Fox TV that after speaking with Gretzky he believed the player 
was 80 percent sure he would retire after Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people very close to Wayne ... and I mean very close, feel  
there's a very strong possibility Sunday will be the last time he 
plays,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky responded to questions about Davidson's report by  
saying, ``There's been times where I've said things to friends that 
get blown way out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I will say is that I will not be one of those  
guys who says `I'm 90 percent sure' or `maybe I'm coming back.' The 
decision I make will be 100 percent. No ifs ands or buts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans at Madison Square Garden held up signs Monday night with  
slogans such as ``Wayne Don't Go.'' Gretzky said the fan reaction 
made it difficult to consider retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said it a hundred times that I've been here over the three  
years,'' Gretzky said. ``This is the greatest city to be an athlete 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as one old friend is concerned, the answer won't come  
easily, and certainly won't come soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing Wayne, he would weigh everything and talk to a lot of  
people before making that decision,'' said Bruce MacGregor, 
assistant general manager of the Edmonton Oilers. ``It's a very 
hard decision. When you retire, it's for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Tuele, another member of the Oilers' organization who also  
is a longtime friend of Gretzky, wasn't so sure he would retire 
after this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say this. Wayne has not shared any final decision with  
anyone,'' Tuele, the Oilers' vice president and public relations 
head, said in a telephone interview. ``Wayne's dad doesn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a February game in Calgary, Gretzky admitted it was his  
last game there because he knew the Rangers weren't visiting the 
Flames next season. He received an emotional response that night 
from the Calgary fans, and has received similar tributes in other 
arenas as the season drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been a typical season for Gretzky, who missed 11 games  
at one point with a neck injury. He had played in 223 straight 
games since signing with the Rangers as a free agent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was the second in Gretzky's career involving a disc.  
In 1992-93, he missed most of the season with a lower back injury 
before coming back to lead the Los Angeles Kings to the Stanley Cup 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no playoffs for the Rangers this season, however.  
They missed for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a frustrating year for him ... the way the club has  
played and the (neck injury). Those kind of injuries bother you a 
lot,'' MacGregor said in a telephone interview from Edmonton. 
``Maybe there's some speculation that he's not 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect (Gretzky's retirement) would have to do more with  
this than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998-99 season has included at least one milestone for the  
NHL's leading career scorer. His ninth goal of the year gave him 
1,072 as a professional, moving him past boyhood hero Gordie Howe.

<HEADLINE> Shock Vest May Aid in Heart Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Patients waiting for heart transplants are  
testing a vest that could automatically jump-start the heart 
anywhere at anytime, prolonging the lives of cardiac arrest 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liken it to an emergency room on your chest,'' said Douglas  
Zipes, vice president of the American College of Cardiology. ``It 
acts like an emergency room that monitors the heartbeat and 
responds appropriately, much like a doctor would in an ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the device, which looks much like a women's bra with  
small electric shock paddles inside the straps, can jolt a heart 
into beating again and eliminate the need for patients to have 
defibrillators implanted during open chest surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Drug Administration has approved the study at  
clinics around the country and 150 to 300 patients are expected to 
enroll over the next year or so, according to clinics sponsoring 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Eisen, principal investigator for the 6-month-old study  
at Temple University, said Monday that the vest is working well for 
his patients. 
</P>
<P>
	It operates by using sensing electrodes to continuously monitor  
a patient's heart beat. If a potentially fatal rapid heart beat is 
detected, the vest gives a sequence of warning alarms. If the 
patient fails to shut it off in 20 seconds, an electrically 
conductive gel is ejected onto the patient's chest and back, and a 
shock is delivered to restore normal heart rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	If the rhythm is not restored, it will repeat this process up to  
five times in 30-second intervals. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, 350,000 Americans collapse and die of cardiac arrest  
-- their hearts just suddenly stop beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Ricafort, who suffers from a virus that has weakened his  
heart, has been wearing the device about 23 hours a day for the 
last three weeks. The device is barely noticeable underneath his 
clothes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to know I can still have peace of mind of knowing  
that if something goes haywire with me, I have a security 
blanket,'' the 35-year-old former jewelry repairman said.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Retreats; Soybeans, Corn Rise / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures fell early today on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, while corn and soybeans rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures continued their slide on concerns that U.S. and  
Chinese farmers will harvest bumper crops, adding to a world supply 
glut at a time when demand remains weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans bounced higher in technical trading, but  
market participants said both remained under pressure from 
expectations for active early U.S. planting and harvesting of large 
crops from Argentina and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1 1/4 cents to $2.68 a bushel; May  
corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.15 1/2 a bushel; May oats rose 1 cent to 
$1.15 1/2 a bushel; May soybeans rose 2 cents to $4.81 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .40 cent to 64.60 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .37 cent to 73.35 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .80 cent to 55.02 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 1.50 
cents to 53.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Park Service Relocates D.C. Beavers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The last member of a beaver family that  
officials believe has been snacking on Japanese cherry trees near 
the Jefferson Memorial was successfully relocated Tuesday. But it's 
unlikely the National Park Service has found a permanent solution 
to the pesky problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to look at a preventative solution. We don't want to  
do this every spring,'' said Julia Long, a biological sciences 
technician with the National Park Service who had been tracking the 
movements of the male and female beavers and their yearling since 
April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Mother and child were trapped and relocated over the weekend.  
``Big Daddy,'' as he's affectionately been dubbed by trappers who 
snared him Monday night, was relocated early Tuesday. Park 
officials said a family reunion is imminent, as beavers track each 
other's odor. 
</P>
<P>
	Beavers have been spotted in the Tidal Basin near the memorial  
since 1982. The improved health of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers 
is the chief reason wildlife is moving into the city, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservation group American Rivers released its top 10 list  
of endangered rivers Monday, and for the first time in three years 
the Potomac River was not on it. The Anacostia has not been on the 
list since 1995, said American Rivers staff member Andrew Fahlund. 
</P>
<P>
	Other animals, including foxes, deer, heron, ospreys and bald  
eagles, are frequently spotted around the two waterways, officials 
said. Fish also are plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to have signs posted around the Potomac that said no  
swimming, wading and don't even think about eating the fish,'' said 
Earle Kittleman, a spokesman for the park service. ``It was a 
health hazard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the beavers, the famous family has moved to a secret  
spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've received a lot of attention, and they've gone through  
a lot of changes,'' Long said. ``They need some peace and quiet.''

<HEADLINE> Consumers Warned on Y2K Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers and regulators said Tuesday that the  
public should watch out for new investment scams that prey on fears 
that banks won't be able to handle the Year 2000 computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, heard testimony from  
business leaders and lawmakers warning of dire economic results if 
Congress does not pass legislation limiting what some experts 
predict could be $1 trillion in lawsuits arising from the computer 
glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress grappled with the Year 2000 problem on several  
fronts, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking 
Committee, said at another hearing that the banking industry 
appears well prepared, although some troubling questions remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach asked, for example, why companies assessing banks' Year  
2000 readiness have been less confident than banking regulators. He 
also noted that the inspectors general at some agencies, such as 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., have raised questions about 
the thoroughness and accuracy of the agencies' Year 2000 
examinations of banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's banks, thrifts and credit unions ``need to be  
prepared for a confidence deficit'' on the part of the public, 
Leach said. ``As in the case of fire, if there is a panic in the 
banking sector, and everyone rushes to the door, someone is likely 
to get hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some con artists have tried to persuade people to take their  
money out of banks to avoid computer foul-ups, then turn it over to 
be invested with them in gold, silver, small-company stocks or 
other assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Some unscrupulous promoters are sending unsolicited e-mail  
messages selling investment opportunities in companies or products 
that are touted as fixing the Year 2000 problem, according to state 
securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be cases of Y2K fraud or swindle,'' said Donna  
Tanoue, the FDIC chairwoman. ``If a deal seems too good to be true, 
it probably is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's bankers have promised that ATM machines, credit  
cards, checks and banking services will function normally through 
the millennial date change. They have warned that withdrawing 
massive amounts of cash could make consumers vulnerable to being 
robbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Federal Reserve has ordered an additional $50 billion  
of new currency to be put into circulation in the event people make 
a run on banks. By the end of the year, $200 billion in currency 
will be stored in government vaults, up from the $150 billion 
normally held in reserve. That's in addition to the $460 billion in 
notes circulating in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal debated by the Judiciary Committee seeks to head  
off a flood of lawsuits by giving companies that are potential 
defendants up to 90 days to fix Year 2000 problems before a suit 
goes to court, and by promoting mediation.

<HEADLINE> Retirement, Disability Cost $507B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal spending on retirement and disability  
topped a half-trillion dollars for the first time last year, 
totaling $507.2 billion, the Census Bureau reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Uncle Sam spent $1.5 trillion for domestic benefits,  
subsidies, grants, goods and services, and salaries and wages in 
fiscal year 1998, the Bureau said in two reports released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That total represents a 3.4 percent increase over 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	``The main reasons for the increase were payments for disability  
and retirement, grants and procurement contracts,'' said Gerard 
Keffer, chief of the Census Bureau's Federal Programs Branch. 
</P>
<P>
	The $507 billion in direct payments for disability and  
retirement was up from $489 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Of this amount, Social Security alone totaled $403 billion in  
1998, a 3.9 percent increase over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Other direct payments reached $328 billion in 1998. These were  
followed by grants, $269 billion; procurement contracts, $209 
billion; and federal government salaries and wages, $170 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the reports, California received the most federal  
funds of any state at $162 billion, followed by New York, $100 
billion; Texas, $92 billion, Florida $84 billion and Pennsylvania 
$67 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Among localities, New York City led the list at $43.1 billion,  
followed by Los Angeles County, Calif., $41.9 billion and Cook 
County, Ill., $24.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal spending in New York City and Los Angeles County topped  
that of 42 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Per capita federal spending topped $8,000 in two states:  
Virginia, $8,221, and Maryland, $8,094. Alaska, at $7,763, was 
third, followed by New Mexico, $7,446; and Hawaii, $7,076. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Department domestic spending, which includes payroll,  
defense contracts and grants and military pensions, totaled $226 
billion in 1998, a 3.8 percent increase over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The top five states in Defense Department spending in 1998 were  
California, $29 billion; Virginia, $23 billion; Texas, $16 billion; 
Florida, $12 billion, and Maryland, $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports -- Consolidated Federal Funds Report, Fiscal Year  
1998, State and County Areas, and Federal Aid to States for Fiscal 
Year 1998 -- cover most domestic spending by the federal government 
except for interest on the federal debt.

<HEADLINE> New Breast Cancer Drug Result Noted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- More follow-up research on the newly  
approved drug Herceptin has yielded convincing evidence that it 
modestly extends the lives of last-ditch victims of advanced breast 
cancer, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement in survival is small -- an average of about four  
months so far -- but experts say it is noteworthy in a disease that 
until now has eluded all efforts to slow the progression to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Herceptin, a tailor-made antibody that targets bad genes, was  
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September for use 
in breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. 
Doctors call that metastatic disease. 
</P>
<P>
	One of its key developers was Dr. Dennis J. Slamon of the  
University of California at Los Angeles. Slamon reported updated 
survival figures Tuesday when he received an award for his work at 
a meeting in Philadelphia of the American Association for Cancer 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was conducted between 1995 and 1997. Last year,  
doctors reported modestly improved survival with Herceptin after 
one year of follow-up. The risk of death was 16 percent lower in 
those getting the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they say the survival advantage of Herceptin patients seems  
to be increasing. The latest data show that two years after the 
study ended, this risk was 22 percent lower in the Herceptin women. 
Their survival averaged 24.8 months, compared with 20.4 months in 
women receiving standard treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Metastatic breast cancer is not a curable disease,'' Slamon  
said. ``That's the dogma. All we can do is fight a staying action. 
This is the first time that we have ever seen a survival impact of 
a treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted that further follow-up will show an even greater  
survival advantage among women getting the new drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors believe Herceptin is especially notable because it  
represents a new approach to cancer -- targeting the peculiarities 
of malignant cells without harming the rest of the body. In 
addition, Herceptin carries none of the usual cancer drug side 
effects, such as nausea and hair loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``These results are particularly landmark,'' said Dr. Drew M.  
Pardoll of Johns Hopkins University. ``This ushers in a new age of 
understanding cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is intended for the one-quarter or more of breast  
cancer patients whose tumors are driven by multiple copies of a 
gene called HER-2. It substantially boosts the power of ordinary 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers predict the results could be much more impressive  
when the drug is given at earlier stages of the disease, before it 
has moved beyond the breast and lymph nodes.

<TEXT>
<P>
	JARRATT, Va. (AP) -- A man was executed by injection Tuesday for  
shooting to death a pizza shop manager who failed to open a cash 
register during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Hamilton Chichester, 36, killed 30-year-old Timothy Rigney  
in a 1991 robbery. He was the fifth person executed in Virginia 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love my wife and my children,'' Chichester said when asked  
for a final statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chichester's accomplice, Sheldon McDowell, also was convicted of  
murder and sentenced to 71 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In Missouri, Roy Ramsey Jr. was executed by injection early  
Wednesday for killing a couple in a crime he claims was the work of 
one of his brothers. His fate was sealed when Gov. Mel Carnahan 
refused a clemency request. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey's last words were: ``Tell everybody I love them. Tell the  
governor that I understand, and that I am not mad at him. In the 
future, it ain't going to hurt him to spare some of the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey, 45, was convicted in the 1988 shooting deaths of Garnett  
and Betty Ledford during a robbery at their home in Grandview, near 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledford, 65, and his 63-year-old wife were killed in a back  
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey blamed the slayings on a younger brother and that man's  
former girlfriend. Ramsey claimed he was selling drugs the day of 
the murders, but his brother testified against him at trial.

<HEADLINE> Elton Brand To Leave Duke Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Two weeks ago Duke was on the brink of  
greatness. Now, the Blue Devils are on the verge of losing college 
basketball's consensus national player of the year early to the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Elton Brand will forgo his final two years at Duke and enter the  
NBA draft, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Brand, speaking on the condition of anonymity,  
confirmed Monday that the 6-foot-8, 270-pound sophomore center 
would become the first Duke player to leave school early for a 
chance to play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand will make the decision official at a Wednesday afternoon  
news conference at Duke, where players and coaches hope Brand's 
decision doesn't begin a chain reaction that could see sophomore 
Will Avery and freshman Corey Maggette also jump to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds last season,  
was the main cog in the team's 37-2 record and NCAA runner-up 
finish to Connecticut. He was also the first sophomore to win the 
John R. Wooden Award, presented by the Los Angeles Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Brand was honored this season by The AP, the  
Atlanta Tipoff Club and the United States Basketball Writers 
Association as national player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Krzyzewski said two weeks ago that players who come to Duke  
want to spend four years in college. But the coach, just days out 
of the hospital following hip surgery, was apparently unable to 
sway Brand to stay in school after a weekend meeting between the 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the student newspaper at Duke, The Chronicle, also  
reported that Avery, the team's point guard, will forgo the rest of 
his eligibility and apply for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there have been conflicting reports over Avery's future  
and no official word has come from Duke on any additional news 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette is apparently still weighing his options.  
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Brand, Avery and Maggette, all of whom have  
unlisted phone numbers, were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Brand and possibly Avery would normally leave a huge  
void, but the program has received national letters of intent from 
four high school seniors who were selected to the McDonald's 
All-America team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be five or six years ago you would have been  
talking about a dynasty with all the talent we have,'' said forward 
Shane Battier, who was recruited in the same class as Brand and 
Avery. ``Players leaving is a testament to our talent and to our 
team, but it's also a sign of the times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underclassmen have until May 15 to announce their intentions.

<HEADLINE> Starr To Oppose Counsel Act Renewal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, whose  
investigation of President Clinton revived a debate over special 
prosecutors, will tell Congress on Wednesday he opposes renewing 
the law that put him in power, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, scheduled to testify before the Senate Governmental  
Affairs Committee, submitted prepared remarks Tuesday laying out 
his rationale against renewing the Independent Counsel Act, said 
officials familiar his written testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said  
Starr opposes renewing the law on several grounds, including that 
it violates the constitutional separation of powers between the 
executive and judicial branches. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also raises concerns about the costs and length of many  
independent counsel investigations, and the relentless political 
attacks against the special prosecutors during their probes, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Whitewater investigation that Starr inherited in 1994  
expanded to include the Vincent Foster suicide, White House travel 
office firings, alleged misuses of FBI files and President 
Clinton's Oval Office affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation has cost taxpayers at least $46 million  
through the end of last year. The record for independent counsel 
investigations is $48.5 million for the Iran-Contra probe during 
the Reagan era, and Starr is on track to exceed that total. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's probe has produced more than a dozen convictions of  
Arkansas figures, including then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker in 1996 and 
both of the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, as well as the 
referral that prompted the president's historic impeachment in 
December by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's supporters have relentlessly attacked Starr, alleging  
that his staff used abusive and unfair tactics with witnesses and 
pressed the investigation into areas outside his jurisdiction. They 
also have questioned Starr's motives. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr is a former federal appeals court judge and Republican  
solicitor general who argued President George Bush's cases before 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Whitewater-Lewinsky saga has become a primary focus of  
Senate hearings into whether the independent counsel law should be 
renewed when it expires this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was acquitted at his impeachment trial in February and  
Whitewater figure Susan McDougal won acquittal on one charge and 
the jury deadlocked on two others in a trial that ended Monday. A 
federal judge also is investigating possible illegal leaks of 
information to the media from inside Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	With his testimony, Starr joins lawmakers of both parties who  
widely oppose renewing the law without at least major changes in 
it. Even those who believe the law is necessary to lend credibility 
to investigations of senior officials predict a consensus on how to 
fix it will not emerge before the law expires June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders in the two parties are reluctant to bring  
the matter to the floor this year, according to several officials. 
</P>
<P>
	If the statute expires, investigations such investigation of  
Cabinet officials and other senior presidential appointees would 
revert to the Justice Department and the system that existed prior 
to Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials submitted a proposal Tuesday to a  
House subcommittee suggesting how the agency would handle those 
investigations. According to the 16-page letter to the House 
Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on commercial and administrative 
Law, the department's Office of Public Integrity would handle many 
of the requests for a special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	But charges of private wrongdoing ``might best be'' handled by  
the agency's tax division, fraud section or a U.S. attorney, wrote 
acting Assistant Attorney General Dennis K. Burke.

<HEADLINE> Gores File Taxes, Show Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being criticized for their small  
donations last year, Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, 
opened their wallets wide to charity in 1998 -- giving more than 
$15,000 to various causes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to 1998 tax returns released Tuesday, the Gores paid  
$52,951 in federal taxes for 1998, or 23 percent of an adjusted 
gross income of $224,132. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gores reported giving $15,197 to charity in 1998. The White  
House did not specify which charities the Gores gave donations, but 
said they ranged from religious institutions and educational 
organizations to groups that aid the homeless and mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, the leading Democratic presidential contender, was roundly  
criticized last year when it was revealed he and his wife gave only 
$353 to charity in 1997 after giving $35,530 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, the White House said the 1996 donations were  
mostly proceeds from a photographic book by Mrs. Gore, ``Picture 
This,'' and the Gores had no similar source of income in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- This is turning out to be a tough year for  
caddies. 
</P>
<P>
	After his tie for 31st in the Masters, Mark O'Meara fired Jerry  
Higginbotham, who was on his bag when O'Meara won the Masters, 
British Open and player of the year in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It totally shocked me and I'm in major disbelief,''  
Higginbotham told Golfweek for a story on its web site. ``I like 
Mark very much, and in time, he and I will talk about this. Right 
now, it's pretty disappointing, but he's the boss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Ernie Els parted ways with Ricci Roberts, his  
caddie for both U.S. Open titles. And last month, Tiger Woods split 
with Mike (Fluff) Cowan after their 18-month run produced 10 
victories, including the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara and Higginbotham had been together the past five years.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to go forward,'' O'Meara told The Golf Channel. He  
said he would give Higginbotham a letter of recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing the news, the first person Higginbotham saw at  
Augusta was Cowan, who had since been rehired by Jim Furyk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fluff just looked at me, shook his head and said, `Must be  
something in the water at Isleworth,''' where Woods and O'Meara 
live. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FATHERLY ASSESSMENT:* While the father of Tiger Woods says  
David Duval is playing better than his son right now, he doesn't 
think that makes him the best player in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the best golfer in the world the one with the most talent  
or the one with the best results while at his peak?'' Earl Woods 
told the Times of London. ``I saw David Duval is better than anyone 
else at the moment, but his overall game needs to improve. It has 
been up and down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger is in the top 10 all the time, he makes cuts, he is in  
contention. It's only a matter of time before he regains his 
supremacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods spokes to the Times before the Masters, in which Tiger  
failed to break 70 at Augusta National for the eight consecutive 
round and finished tied for 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Duval, Justin Leonard, Lee Westwood and Ernie Els are  
part of ``one of the most talented groups ever.'' But he indicated 
Els was best suited as a rival to his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Els, for example, is a multitalented individual who has an  
inherent ability to shed pressure,'' Woods said. ``Michael Jordan 
had it, Tiger has it. No other golfer has it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BEAR TRACKS:* Jack Nicklaus' recovery from hip replacement  
surgery has been about as successful as his career. Now it looks 
like he could be playing in a PGA Tour event about four months 
after the operation -- and maybe even the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	During a ceremonial visit to Augusta National, Nicklaus said he  
plans to be playing golf ``pretty solidly'' by the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I think I'll make the Memorial Tournament,'' he said.  
``Matter of fact, I might even play the week before to get a little 
practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tune-up would take place two weeks earlier on the senior  
tour, the Bell Atlantic Classic outside Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would tell me how much I can walk and how much I could  
do,'' Nicklaus said. ``I might play there and I might find out I 
can't play at the Memorial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if he can't play Memorial?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll look to the next event, and the next event ... and play  
when I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ARNIE'S ARMY:* Arnold Palmer is still the most popular champion  
at Augusta National. Fans cheered his every shot as the four-time 
winner played in a record 45th consecutive Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most touching appreciation for Palmer last week came  
outside the exclusive club when he made a rare public appearance to 
endorse one of his products. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer agreed to spend one hour at Borders book store to sign  
copies of his newly released book, ``A Golfer's Life.'' Even though 
the appearance did not start until 4:30 p.m., one woman arrived at 
the store at 9 a.m. to be first in line. 
</P>
<P>
	She burst into tears when Palmer showed up and signed her book.  
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't personalize all of the books, but had a few words  
for everyone. The line had to be closed 20 minutes after it 
started. Even though Palmer stayed 30 minutes extra, about 800 
people were still in line when he left. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JANZEN CLUBS:* How does a guy miss three straight cuts and then  
contend in the Masters? Lee Janzen found the difference to be in 
his clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Janzen went to Taylor Made's new FireSole irons last month, and  
the sole was not the same as the Taylor Made irons he used to win 
the Open last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I noticed last week I kept sticking the club in the ground a  
little bit,'' Janzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the cut in the BellSouth Classic, he called home  
and asked that his old clubs be sent to Augusta. They arrived the 
next day in time for a practice round at Augusta, and Janzen 
decided to stick with them for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one stroke out of the lead until a double bogey at No. 12  
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't so much me, but that I was playing with a set of  
clubs I shouldn't have been playing with yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Earl Woods has been diagnosed with prostate cancer and  
will begin radiation treatment as early as this week. He likely 
will not be able to attend either the U.S. Open or British Open. 
.... The Masters will end the 1990s with the fewest number of 
playoffs among the major championships -- one, in 1990. ... David 
Duval will play the seventh annual Export A skins game in Canada 
from June 27-29 in Quebec. He'll be competing with Fred Couples, 
John Daly and Canadian rookie Mike Weir. ... Spalding is donating 
25,000 clubs to junior golf programs across the country. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* The Masters will end the 1990s with the  
fewest number of playoffs among the major championships -- one, in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	 *MONEY MATTERS:* Jack Nicklaus missed his first Masters in 40  
years and got $5,000 in honoraria. When Nicklaus played his first 
Masters as a professional in 1962, he tied for 15th and earned 
$1,160.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians May Delay Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Palestinian leadership will  
decide April 27 whether to declare a state in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip or heed the world's advice and wait, a senior official 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision will be up to the Palestinian Central  
Council, a 124-member body, said Salim Zanoun, a leading member of 
the panel. The council is stacked with loyalists of Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat 
</P>
<P>
	Hinting at postponing a statehood declaration, Zanoun told The  
Associated Press: ``It will be painful for us to delay the date, 
but the interest of the Palestinian people comes before 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat has been meeting with world leaders to learn whether they  
would support him if he declared statehood unilaterally on May 4, 
the end of the five-year interim period of autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, briefing reporters  
after a weekly Cabinet meeting Tuesday, said Arafat will continue 
his consultations, traveling to China tomorrow, and then to Islamic 
republics in the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Arafat returned from a trip that included stopovers  
in Pakistan, India, Turkey, Russia, Japan, China, Indonesia, 
Vietnam, Bangladesh and Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he was told during the trip, Arafat said: ``They are  
supporting any decision taken by the Palestinian leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the United States, the European Union, Egypt and  
Jordan, among others, are known to have urged Arafat to wait for a 
peace agreement with Israel, fearing that a unilateral move could 
lead to the collapse of the Mideast peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that he  
would annex parts of the West Bank in response to a unilateral 
declaration of statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Several months ago, Arafat said he would declare statehood on  
May 4, but has since softened his position. 
</P>
<P>
	It is now widely expected that Arafat will postpone a statehood  
declaration, in part because he fears a unilateral move could help 
Netanyahu, a hard-liner, win re-election May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Various Palestinian institutions will meet later this month to  
give such a delay broader backing and legitimacy. Among those 
expected to convene are the Palestinian Liberation Organization 
Executive Committee and the Palestinian legislative council.

<HEADLINE> Issues Increase Lobbyists' Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- MasterCard and Visa ran up some big bills of  
their own lobbying Congress last year, quadrupling their spending 
to $5.3 million as they urged lawmakers to make it harder for 
people to erase debts in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers, prodded by lobbyists, are grappling with that  
unresolved issue again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other businesses with hot issues before Congress, including  
airlines and high-tech companies, also dramatically increased their 
lobbying budgets, disclosure reports show. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry more than doubled its spending last year,  
to $56.4 million, as it successfully defeated legislation that 
would have raised cigarette taxes as part of a plan to discourage 
teen smoking, disclosure reports show. 
</P>
<P>
	``When issues spike in Washington, you see the money spike  
too,'' Syracuse University political science professor Rogan Kersh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the rising tide of bankruptcy filings, MasterCard and Visa  
are making a renewed push for tougher rules this session. Each 
house of Congress passed its own bankruptcy measure last year, but 
the Senate adjourned without voting on a compromise to reconcile 
the two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit card companies are leading the fight, joined by some  
retailers, banks and consumer finance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Visa increased its lobbying bill to $3.6 million from  
$900,000 in 1997. MasterCard International's lobbying expenses rose 
to $1.8 million from $430,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an effort directed at fixing the fundamental flaw that  
allows debtors to walk away from debts that they have the ability 
to repay,'' MasterCard spokesman William Binzel said. ``When debts 
are discharged, they don't simply disappear. Ultimately, they get 
passed on to consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups, unions and civil rights groups oppose the  
legislation, saying it favors corporate profits over the needs of 
families struggling with debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bankruptcy bill is very important to them so they're  
willing to pull out all the stops,'' Consumers Union legislative 
counsel Frank Torres said of the creditors. ``What you have is this 
major lobbying effort that's obviously working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The credit card companies also had other issues to lobby on last  
year, including legislation affecting Internet commerce and 
overhauling the financial service industry. In October, the Justice 
Department sued Visa and MasterCard, saying that the two companies, 
which account for 75 percent of all credit card purchases in the 
United States, had stifled competition. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express, which offers credit cards as well as travel  
and financial services, increased its lobbying bill only slightly, 
to $1.1 million, and didn't take a leading role on the bankruptcy 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	For the tobacco industry, the successful effort to kill  
anti-smoking legislation carried a price tag of almost $100 million 
-- $56.4 million on lobbying and at least $40 million more on 
television commercials opposing the bill, which was killed by 
Senate Republicans last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the opposition was Brown &AMP; Williamson, which spent $24.9  
million on lobbying, a big jump from $3.7 million in 1997, and 
Philip Morris, which increased its lobbying expenditures to $23 
million from $15.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the lobbyists weighing in on behalf of the tobacco  
industry were former Senate Majority Leaders George Mitchell of 
Maine and Howard Baker of Tennessee, former Texas Gov. Ann Richards 
and former Rep. Stanford Parris, of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies spent $26.2 million on lobbying in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	The airline industry scored a victory in the last Congress when  
lawmakers voted to require further study before the Transportation 
Department could impose new rules designed to encourage competition 
in smaller markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Expenses for the airlines' lobbying group, the Air Transport  
Association, increased almost 50 percent, from $2.6 million in 1997 
to $3.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing high-technology industry is also becoming a major  
presence on Capitol Hill. Microsoft Corp. spent $3.2 million last 
year, up from $1.9 million in 1997, and hired 
lawmakers-turned-lobbyists Thomas Downey of New York and Vin Weber 
of Minnesota, as well as former Republican National Chairman Haley 
Barbour. The company is in the midst of an antitrust lawsuit 
brought by the Justice Department and some state governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many interests lobbying, and power has become  
spread out throughout the Congress that many groups have to hire a 
number of lobbyists, literally a team, to work on their 
interests,'' said Wright Andrews, former president of the American 
League of Lobbyists. ``That dramatically increases the costs.''

<HEADLINE> Panel: TV Regressing on Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The bottom line could be at stake  
in the worsening treatment of minorities on television, an industry 
panel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Television depictions reinforce the social segregation that is  
an increasing national problem, said Geraldo Rivera, who 
participated in the Hollywood Radio and Television Society panel on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nely Galan, president of the Hispanic-oriented Telemundo  
Network, said television ignores the way race plays itself out in 
real life. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see shows on TV they're either black shows or white  
shows, and that's not how we live in America,'' Ms. Galan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoopi Goldberg, the panel's moderator, said TV is regressing in  
how and how much it depicts minorities. Of 115 shows on the six 
major broadcast networks, only 18 feature black casts or lead 
characters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	George Gerbner, a Temple University telecommunications professor  
and television researcher, said more minority characters were 
featured in shows canceled in 1998 than there were in series 
remaining on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Galan called multiracial images important to viewers,  
especially young ones: ``I think a lot of our children's 
self-esteem comes from seeing themselves depicted positively on the 
medium that is society's most important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But companies are missing out economically as well, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of money in the Hispanic market,'' Galan told  
the audience of several hundred at the Regent Beverly Wilshire 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several panelists said it was vital to get more minorities in  
positions of power as network executives and producers. One said 
her patience has worn thin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm becoming like Angela Davis,'' said producer Yvette Lee  
Bowser (``Living Single,'' ``For Your Love''). ``I'm militant now. 
I'm angry.''

<HEADLINE> Reviewing Latest Record Releases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Drive You Home Again'' (HighTone) -- Chris Smither  

</P>
<P>
	Think of a kind of wandering Zen troubadour with a blue guitar,  
a hot, bluesy finger-picking style and a gravely voice that could 
make almost any material sound not only deep but way cool. Chris 
Smither is all that and more as he shows on his latest release, 
``Drive You Home Again.'' Smither even throws in the occasional 
horn chart this time, which he and producer Stephen Bruton meld 
seamlessly into his style so that it sounds as though it always 
belonged there, rather than something that was grafted on. 
</P>
<P>
	As always, Smither writes like a man who has pondered life's big  
questions. ``C'mon, siddown, Let's talk about illusion, How 
everything is made of it, No wonder life's confusin', All this 
stuff we take for granted, So solid to the touch, Is just a 
concrete indication, That we love ourselves too much,'' he sings on 
``Hey, Hey, Hey.'' Even Smither's love songs are thoughtful, as a 
listen to the exuberant ``Tell Me Why'' will show. 
</P>
<P>
	This guy just keeps getting better, lyrically and musically,  
making ``Drive You Home Again'' an album that belongs on the shelf 
of anyone with a taste for grown-up singer-songwriters along the 
lines of Greg Brown, in whose company Smither definitely belongs. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Angels &AMP; Electricity'' (Compass) -- Eddi Reader  

</P>
<P>
	``Angels &AMP; Electricity'' is a giddily addictive album of  
intelligent, lovely folk-pop. Eddi Reader's lush, beautiful voice 
is an elegant instrument, as well suited to the soft tales of 
heartache and remembrance that make up much of her new album as it 
is to the infectious up-tempo numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The irresistible ``Prayer Wheel'' asserts her need for  
independence and is a plea to be remembered. ``I could live your 
life and dream of wires, Or I could live my life among the angels 
and electricity,'' she sings, leaving no doubt of her choice as she 
immediately urges, ``Don't forget about me.'' Reader doesn't need 
lyrics to work her vocal wonders: On the snare-and-steel-driven 
``California'' she infuses a short, soft moan with a sexy 
dreaminess as articulate as any words. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's ``Hummingbird,'' the most delightful song on this  
dazzling album. Her voice glides and soars along above the melody 
while guitars buzz and hum, making it clear that Reader is, if not 
a hummingbird, certainly a songbird to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Four Hands Sweet and Hot'' (Dancing Cat) -- Cyril Pahinui and  
Bob Brozman 

</P>
<P>
	You don't need to know anything about slack key guitar to fall  
in love with ``Four Hands Sweet and Hot.'' All you need is an 
appreciation of great music. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancing Cat Records showcases Hawaiian slack key guitarists as  
solo artists, asserting for them the same status the music world 
accords other finger-pickers such as Leo Kottke or John Fahey. The 
guitar style, named for its unusual ``slack'' tunings, was adapted 
by islanders after Mexican and Spanish cowboys brought the guitar 
to Hawaii, and that flavor is especially apparent here on 
``Wai`alae'' and ``LBC Slack Key.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Four Hands'' is a collaboration between slack-key master Cyril  
Pahinui, whose father was one of the major figures of the style, 
and Bob Brozman, one of today's greatest steel guitarists. While 
Brozman is from Brooklyn, he plays as if he grew up with this 
music. In fact, he and Pahinui sound as if they grew up making 
music together. Their empathy is apparent as they swing through the 
jazzy ``Coquette'' and slow things down on the soft and lovely ``E 
Mama Ea.''

<HEADLINE> Slaney Sues Over Testosterone Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mary Slaney wants the world's track and  
field authorities to stop using testosterone tests to determine 
whether female athletes are illegally bulking up. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug tests can show higher levels of testosterone, a natural  
hormone that increases muscle mass, even when there are other 
factors that might be involved, a lawyer for Slaney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The top distance runner in U.S. history and a former world  
champion, Slaney has filed suit in federal court against the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation and the U.S. Olympic 
Committee, which administered the test she failed during the 1996 
Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF assumes that when a woman has a  
testosterone-epitestosterone (T-E) ratio above 6-to-1, there has 
been a doping violation, unless the athlete can prove she is 
innocent, attorney Jim Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is inconsistent with every rule of every federation in  
the world, and they know it,'' he said. ``The reason they're doing 
this is because they know they can't prove she committed a doping 
violation, because they can't rule out her innocent explanation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ratio normally is about 1-to-1. A routine urine test at the  
Olympic Trials in 1996 showed Slaney had more than a 6-1 ratio, 
which she attributed to taking birth control pills. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney was suspended from competition in 1997, then later  
reinstated, although the IAAF referred the case to arbitration. A 
panel in Monte Carlo last week adjourned the arbitration hearing 
until April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF said regardless of the lawsuit filed Monday in  
Indianapolis the arbitration panel will reconvene in Monte Carlo. 
The international governing body of track and field should not have 
to answer to an Indiana court, an IAAF spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``IAAF rules are enforced in 209 countries and the rules are the  
same for everyone. Otherwise there would be confusion and chaos,'' 
spokesman Giorgio Reineri said. ``Sports rules must be enforced by 
the governing body of the particular sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC did not immediately respond to the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said the IAAF should have found a way to distinguish  
between athletes who were purposely increasing their testosterone 
and those whose higher ratio resulted from other factors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what they haven't done,'' he said. ``They have no way  
at all to do that, they don't know how to do that. As a result, 
what the IAAF is saying is that since they don't know how to do it, 
they'll assume it's doping unless Mary can convince its arbitration 
panel that it wasn't doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, which also seeks unspecified damages, was filed in  
U.S. District Court in Indianapolis, the home of USA Track &AMP; Field, 
the sport's national governing body. USATF was not named as a 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said he has asked the IAAF and USOC to suspend the use  
of the T-E ratio for women. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also seeks a permanent injunction against the two  
organizations to prevent them from using the ratio as proof of a 
drug violation by women. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USOC is being sued because this was the USOC test, and at  
the very outset they said an investigation had to be done to rule 
out the possibility that this could be explained by innocent 
factors,'' Coleman said. ``That was never done, and the USOC never 
assured that it was. It just simply ignored what the IAAF was 
doing. The only way to stop this was to bring a lawsuit.''

<HEADLINE> Sampras May Play in Queens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Pete Sampras has asked for a wild card to play in  
the Wimbledon warmup tournament at Queen's Club in June, organizers 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stella Artois tournament director Ian Wight said a wild card  
could be left open for Sampras until the day of the draw and would 
depend on his performance in the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he reaches the semis at the French Open, I doubt he'll take  
up the wild card,'' Wight said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, a five-time Wimbledon champion, was the Queen's winner  
in 1995. He was beaten by Australian Mark Woodforde in the third 
round last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wight said the 21st edition of the Queen's tournament, scheduled  
June 7-13, had already attracted five of the world's top 10 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, winner of this year's Australian  
Open, will play in the Queen's for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's $750,000 event will comprise a 56-player draw,  
including former champions Todd Martin and U.S. Open finalist Mark 
Philipoussis. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending titlist Scott Draper of Australia has confirmed his  
entry along with Britons Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski. 
</P>
<P>
	Goran Ivanisevic, beaten finalist at Wimbledon last year, also  
has entered, along with Michael Chang, Thomas Enqvist, Cedric 
Pioline and Jason Stoltenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending Wimbledon junior champion Roger Federer of Switzerland  
and 18-year-old Australian Lleyton Hewitt were among five budding 
juniors invited to play in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Boris Becker, who won the event at age 17 in 1985 before going  
on to win the first of his three Wimbledon crowns, has indicated 
he'll play but tournament organizers have not confirmed his place.

<HEADLINE> INS Moving Away From Worksite Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teams of agents swooping down on restaurants,  
construction sites and other businesses to round up illegal 
immigrant workers will become less common as the federal 
immigration service alters its enforcement strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service is moving away from  
its unpopular worksite enforcement raids, which have been a 
principal underpinning of the agency's enforcement in the nation's 
interior but haven't proven particularly effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, under a new interior enforcement strategy that INS is  
adopting over the next five years, the agency will emphasize 
combating criminal activities related to illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than going after the run-of-the-mill employer who has  
undocumented workers on the payroll, INS will target employers 
suspected of collaborating with smugglers and forgers of documents 
to bring illegal labor into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is going to be more emphasis on making criminal cases  
against exploitive employers,'' said Stephen Rapp, a U.S. attorney 
in Iowa who helped INS develop the new interior enforcement 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also calls for INS to work in closer cooperation with  
employers. Instead of descending on workplaces with agents, the 
agency will seek to audit company employment records. 
</P>
<P>
	The hope is that collaboration will foster ``a permanent  
relationship with employers that will result in a change in their 
hiring policies,'' said INS Denver district director Joe Greene. 
Doing so ``is going to have a greater impact on the overall number 
of settled (illegal) immigrants than just removing them and waiting 
for them to come back again,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some frequent INS critics find merit to the overall  
enforcement plan, saying it will allow the agency to use its 
resources more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good deal to recommend the change in strategy,''  
said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Washington-based 
Center for Immigration Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Krikorian contends INS is wrong to end worksite enforcement  
raids. ``There's a deterrent effect, in that if you're an employer 
of illegal aliens you never know if the INS is going to bust 
through the door. ... And that's an important fear that ought to 
always be present,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	INS and others, however, contend current worksite enforcement  
operations are ineffective. In 1997, the peak year for worksite 
removals, fewer than 19,000 illegal immigrants were removed as a 
result of worksite operations. The service estimates 5.5 million 
illegal immigrants are in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, in a report to Congress this  
month, concluded: ``The results from INS' worksite enforcement 
program have been modest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen years after Congress passed a law requiring that  
employers check would-be workers' identity or employment documents 
to verify their lawful status, ``significant numbers of 
unauthorized aliens can still obtain employment,'' GAO found. 
</P>
<P>
	While congressional auditors pin much of the blame on easy  
availability of counterfeit documents, GAO also said worksite 
enforcement has been given little priority or funding. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2 percent of INS' enforcement manpower is devoted to  
worksite enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Krikorian believes INS had little choice but to adopt the new  
strategy in light of Congress' long-standing unwillingness to fund 
interior enforcement at the same levels as border enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS has 1,750 field agents responsible for interior  
enforcement. The Border Patrol, which Congress doubled in size in 
recent years, has more than 8,000 agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Congress gave them the money, and then they still didn't do  
worksite raids, then the INS would have to be answerable for its 
decision,'' Krikorian said. ``But given that Congress is miserly 
with money for interior enforcement, this may well be a rational 
response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That criticism is rejected by the chairman of the House  
Judiciary immigration subcommittee, who views the new enforcement 
policy as a retrenchment by INS. 
</P>
<P>
	``For them to concede defeat in areas where they are not even  
bothering to request more funds is a self-defeating action on their 
part,'' Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said in a recent interview.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Coffee Exports Driven Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Thanks to the recent devaluation of  
Brazil's currency, Brazilian coffee exports soared 181 percent in 
March over the same month last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which beats Colombia as the world's largest producer of  
coffee, exported 2.08 million bags of coffee last month, up from 
739,100 last year and 22 percent more than in February, coffee 
exporting groups said Tuesday. Each bag contains 132 pounds of 
green coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Exporters said the gain was due to the devaluation of the  
currency, the real, which lost nearly 30 percent of its value since 
mid-January. The drop in the real's value allows Brazilian 
exporters to charge lower prices on world markets for their goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a 48 percent drop in prices, coffee export revenue in  
March totaled $226 million, well above the $154 million obtained in 
March of last year. The average price per bag was $108.90 in March, 
compared to $208.40 in the same month last year.

<HEADLINE> Payton Fatigued After Opening Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- NFL great Walter Payton, who has a rare liver  
disease, called off a personal appearance today because of fatigue 
after throwing out the first pitch on opening day at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton was scheduled to speak to the Machinery/Materials  
Conference and Exposition at Chicago's McCormick Place. He canceled 
at the last minute, convention spokesman Leo Nadolske said. 
</P>
<P>
	The game at Wrigley Field was the first public appearance in  
months for the 44-year-old former running back of the Chicago 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a very big day yesterday and part of the symptoms of  
(his disease) is fatigue,'' said Ginny Quirk, vice president of 
Walter Payton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Therefore, his feeling was that it was going to be too much to  
go all the way downtown and give a powerful keynote speech. He was 
too taxed to make the trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton lives in suburban South Barrington, about 40 miles from  
McCormick Place. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Cubs' home opener, he looked decidedly healthier than he  
did in early February when he announced that he needed a liver 
transplant because he had primary sclerosing cholangitis. He was 
placed on the transplant list at Mayo Clinic a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a ball yesterday,'' Quirk said. ``It was very uplifting  
for him.''

<HEADLINE> RealNetworks To Acquire Xing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- RealNetworks Inc., moving to strengthen its  
position in the delivery of music on the Internet, announced today 
it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Xing Technology 
Corp., a leading developer of MP3 audio compression software. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based RealNetworks said it will acquire the  
privately-held Xing, based in San Luis Obispo, Calif., in exchange 
for a maximum $75 million of RealNetworks common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks' software already is used by more than 55 million  
people to play music, listen to radio and watch video clips. Xing's 
MP3 encoding software, which converts music into computer files, 
allows musicians to market their songs directly to consumers by 
putting audio files on Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Xing has been at the core of the exploding MP3 revolution  
since its inception,'' said Rob Glaser, founder and CEO of 
RealNetworks. ``With the acquisition of Xing, RealNetworks can now 
better serve the huge market of new artists choosing to use MP3 to 
legally distribute their work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks yesterday announced it was joining with IBM Corp.  
to deliver CD-quality music over the Internet to computer users. 
IBM is testing a system that combines its technology with 
RealNetworks software. The system allows for the secure delivery of 
music files to computer users who get Internet access across 
telephone lines, the most common avenue to the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The RealNetworks-IBM effort challenges a rival product by  
Microsoft Corp., which is pushing a different format for delivering 
music files over the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Shootouts Under Fire in MLS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Concocted to make play more offensive, the  
shootout again is on the defensive in Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a round of games where five of six matches were  
decided by the shootout -- and with 11 of the 21 games this season 
determined by the post-match tiebreaker -- attention again is being 
focused on the American invention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The percentage is a consequence of an early-season aberration,  
and is not going to continue,'' MLS commissioner Doug Logan said 
Tuesday on the league's weekly conference call. ``Our competition 
committee in August will review the way we play our game. It's on 
their agenda this year, as has it has been for the last three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, a third of the first 21 games were decided by a  
shootout, in which a player starts 35 yards from the goalkeeper, 
approaches him one-on-one and has five seconds to get off a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure is like the penalty kick method used throughout  
the rest of the world: five tries per team and, if the score 
remains tied, one attempt each until the tie is broken. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, five of the first 18 (28 percent) were decided by  
shootout and in 1996 three of the first 18 (17 percent). However, 
Logan was quick to point out the number of shootouts for an entire 
season decreased from 21 percent in 1996 to 17 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS also has a smaller percentage of games ending in shootouts  
than all of the major European leagues have ending in ties. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootout, as practiced by MLS, is generally credited to the  
old North American Soccer League, which competed from 1968-1984. 
MLS revived it because, Logan says, there was -- and is -- a belief 
an American audience craves a winner and a loser. And that soccer 
generally is criticized by U.S. media for the number of draws it 
produces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most casual fans of the game, and sports fans in this society,  
favor those games in which there is an outcome. That is fact of 
life, it's not in our imagination, that is real,'' Logan said. 
``That is a balance we have to weigh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the complaints is that a team that loses the shootout  
gets no points, while the winner earns only the single point 
normally awarded to both teams from a draw. The MLS' stated purpose 
is to discourage teams from playing for the tie. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the renewed cry against the shootout this week  
was a reiterated proposal to award two points to the shootout 
winner and one to the shootout loser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with Mr. Logan,'' sdaid Walter Zenga, the New England  
Revolution's player-coach Walter Zenga. ``(The shootout) is a fun 
time, great for the people. The problem is in the standings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Logan says he doesn't like the two points-one point adjustment,  
calling it a ``gimmick'' and ``a doctrine of entitlement -- if you 
play hard, you are entitled to something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Logan said he favors the current system and can see a time when  
the shootout will be eliminated -- but at the very least not before 
the end of this season.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Rodriguez Gets Nine RBIs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Ivan Rodriguez drove in nine runs, setting a  
Texas Rangers record, in just the first three innings of Tuesday 
night's game against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez hit a three-run homer in the first, a two-run single  
in the second and his first career grand slam in the third as Texas 
took a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star catcher came up again with two runners on base in  
the fifth inning. But with a chance to tie the major league record 
for RBIs in a game, he flied out. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez singled with none on in the seventh.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Bottomley of the St. Louis Cardinals set the big league mark  
of 12 RBIs on Sept. 16, 1924. Mark Whiten of the Cardinals tied 
that record when he hit four home runs on Sept. 7, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL record is 11 by Tony Lazzeri of the New York Yankees on  
May 24, 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez broke the Texas record of eight RBIs set by Juan  
Gonzalez on June 17, 1993, and tied by Jose Canseco on June 13, 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez's previous RBI high was five, which he accomplished  
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first inning, Rodriguez capped a five-run burst with a  
425-foot drive to left field off Ken Cloude. Rodriguez became the 
12th player to hit a ball into the second deck at the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez's single in the second made it 7-0 and finished  
Cloude. In the third, he connected for a slam off Mac Suzuki to cap 
a six-run inning.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan, Ugandan Armies Prepare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KABALO, Congo (AP) -- Rwandan and Ugandan army chiefs toured the  
southern front line Tuesday where the rebels they back prepared for 
a major offensive against Congo's President Laurent Kabila. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels are driving towards Mbuji-Mayi, the center of Congo's  
diamond mining industry, which is Kabila's main source of revenue. 
They are pressing attacks from Kabalo, some 200 miles east of the 
town, and from the north. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels said they had captured Lodja and Lubefu, 125 miles  
north of Mbuji-Mayi, after days of heavy fighting against Congolese 
government troops and their allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ugandan Gen. Jeje Odongo and Rwandan chief of staff Brig. Gen.  
Kayumba Nyamwasa visited Kabalo, 875 miles southeast of the capital 
Kinshasa, to review the offensive and meet with senior Congolese 
rebel officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to inspect the troops and see how the war's  
going,'' Odongo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels, who have fought Kabila's government since August,  
rely heavily on thousands of Rwandan soldiers in south and the 
Ugandan army in the north to wage war in Congo, Africa's 
third-largest nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabila is receiving troops and equipment from Zimbabwe, Angola,  
Namibia and Chad, but this has so far has failed to stop the rebel 
advance from eastern to central Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels attacked government outposts Tuesday around their  
stronghold of Kabalo. Rebels besieged Katutu, a hilly stronghold of 
Zimbabwean troops and government soldiers, 55 miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabila has recently dropped his opposition to negotiating a  
cease-fire with the rebels. Rebel and government representatives 
are due to meet in Rome on Thursday under the auspices of a Roman 
Catholic peace group. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also seeking mediation from Kenya's President Daniel arap  
Moi. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabila came to power in May 1997 after toppling longtime  
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in the country formerly known as Zaire. 
He promised reform and democracy, but many critics say his regime 
has instead brought repressive policies.

<HEADLINE> Intel Profits Rise 57 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp. sent a reassuring signal that  
problems in the personal computer business may be mostly confined 
to its biggest chip customer, Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter profits at Intel, the world's largest maker of  
personal computer chips, rose 57 percent, beating Wall Street 
forecasts, while revenue jumped 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the news was good. Intel also said it expected  
second-quarter revenue to stay the same or fall slightly from its 
first-quarter revenue of $7.1 billion, citing ``seasonal factors'' 
in the microprocessor business. That disappointed some analysts who 
expected a slight increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The results announced Tuesday nevertheless helped allay concerns  
that a predicted financial shortfall this quarter at Compaq 
Computer Corp. would be reflected elsewhere in the technology 
business. By beating expectations, Intel -- a bellwether for the 
rest of the PC industry -- apparently suggested Compaq's woes were 
confined to its own business. 
</P>
<P>
	The results ``suggest to me the rest of the industry is fine,''  
said David Wu, an analyst with ABN Amro in San Francisco. ``The 
news here really is there is no news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it earned $2.0  
billion, or 57 cents a share, in the three months ended March 27. 
That was up from a profit of $1.27 billion, or 36 cents a share, in 
the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $7.1 billion from $6.0 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Intel's per-share profit handily beat the expectations of  
analysts surveyed by First Call, who had been projecting 55 cents a 
share after accounting for a 2-for-1 stock split this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also was helped by higher interest income and a lower tax  
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said first-quarter revenues were down 7 percent from the  
final quarter of 1998 due to a seasonal slowdown in PC sales. But 
year over year, the company was helped by strong demand for its 
range of new microprocessors, which supply the primary brainpower 
for computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel introduced its latest Pentium chips for personal computers  
and more powerful business machines this quarter. It also launched 
a faster Celeron chip for the fast-growing category of PCs costing 
less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel officials said the Celeron chips are starting to help the  
company take back some business from rival makers of chips for 
inexpensive PCs, such as Advanced Micro Devices. Reports show that 
consumers bought more computers at retail stores in the first two 
months of the year from AMD than Intel -- knocking the chip giant 
from the No. 1 spot for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Serb Forces Cross Into Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) -- Serb infantry troops crossed into  
Albania today, seized control of a border village, and fought a 
running battle with border police and Albanian soldiers, Albania's 
information minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslavs took Kamenica, a village in  
northern Albania that has been shelled by the Serbs for several 
days, Interior Minister Petro Koci said. There were no immediate 
reports of casualties -- most villagers had fled -- but houses were 
burning. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said he could not  
confirm the report. But he added: ``We would consider with utmost 
seriousness any Serb attempt to widen the war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 14-month Kosovo conflict, border clashes and  
small-scale incursions have taken place repeatedly. But this 
incident appeared far more serious and more highly charged because 
of the allied presence in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Information Minister Musa Ulqini said the initial Serb incursion  
was met by a small contingent of border police. Regular army units 
as a rule stay a few miles back from the border to avoid the 
appearance of any provocation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the border police fell back, the army pushed forward and  
joined the fighting, Ulqini said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, tensions have spiked along Albania's northern  
frontier, which has long been a prime staging ground for the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen the flames from the houses,'' said Pier  
Gonggrijp, an observer with the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Artan Jakupi, an OSCE translator, said he saw his own house in  
Kamenica burning, along with a cluster of others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was expecting this to happen. They have been firing at us,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has taken over Albania's airfields, airspace and military  
infrastructure for its campaign to force Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to pull his troops out of Kosovo, as well as to 
aid more than 300,000 Kosovo refugees in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia has been reinforcing positions along the borders with  
both Albania and Macedonia in apparent preparation for a possible 
ground assault by the allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakupi said observers first heard of the clash in Kamenica by  
monitoring the border police radio frequency. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (Serb forces) know, or they think, that all across the  
border and border villages are supporting the KLA,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulqini said between 3,000 and 4,000 Albanian villagers had fled  
the area being shelled, 70 miles north of the Albanian capital, 
Tirana, over the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia recently has taken an increasingly hard line toward  
Albania, suggesting it would hold it responsible for KLA action 
initiated from its soil. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA has been trying to regroup in the wake of a Serb and  
Yugoslav onslaught unleashed after NATO launched airstrikes March 
24. 
</P>
<P>
	After a border clash last week with the KLA, Yugoslavia said  
``terrorist groups and those who support them will have to take the 
consequences for the eventual flareup of the war in the Balkans and 
the responsibility for the bloodshed.''

<HEADLINE> Activist Criticizes U.S. Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Female prisoners in the United States suffer  
frequent sexual abuse from male guards and are often held in leg 
irons or shackles in violation of international standards, a U.N. 
human rights expert said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Radhika Coomaraswamy, a U.N. investigator, said both federal and  
state governments should do more to ensure minimum standards of 
treatment for female prisoners and better training for prison 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report presented to the U.N. Human Rights Commission,  
Coomaraswamy urged the Clinton administration to review drug laws, 
pointing out that many women were jailed because of drug-related 
offenses that could be better handled by community-based programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is criminalizing a large segment of its  
population; this segment is overwhelmingly composed of poor persons 
of color and is increasingly female,'' Coomaraswamy said in her 
report to the 53-nation commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of women in U.S. prisons rose to nearly 65,000 in  
1995, up from 12,300 in 1980, according to U.S. government figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Walsh, a spokesman for the U.S. diplomatic mission to the  
United Nations in Geneva, said most of the deficiencies cited in 
the report had already been highlighted by U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome this sort of scrutiny as it serves as an example to  
other countries that we provided the necessary access,'' Walsh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of U.N. human rights experts have visited the United  
States in the past year at the invitation of the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Abuse of women in U.S. prisons has also been highlighted by  
Amnesty International, which has mounted a campaign against human 
rights violations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Coomaraswamy's 55-page report documented individual cases of  
abuse -- such as rape of women prisoners in a California jail and 
the use of tear gas against a woman shackled to a bed in a Michigan 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	It also looked at the huge differences in state practices --  
praising Minnesota for high standards and forward-looking policies 
while singling out Michigan for most criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Coomaraswamy criticized the use of restraints such as leg irons  
and shackles in prisons throughout the country, saying that it was 
against international rules on the treatment of prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women in labor are also shackled during transport to hospital  
and after the baby is born,'' she wrote, citing one case in which 
the woman remained shackled during delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	Rape was fairly rare, Coomaraswamy wrote. Women frequently  
agreed to have sex with male guards, however, in return for favors 
and were subject to harassment when being frisked by men or 
monitored during showering. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that sexual misconduct by male corrections  
officers against women inmates is widespread,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also criticized the practice of keeping female asylum  
seekers in prisons for want of lack of space elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Homers Twice Against Bucs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- It's starting to look like 1998 all over again  
for Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	With flashbulbs popping on every at-bat just as a year ago,  
McGwire homered in two of his first three at-bats off Pirates 
starter Pete Schourek on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire jumped on left-hander Schourek's first pitch, a sinking  
fastball down around the knees, and lined it into the left-field 
seats in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	After being intentionally walked in the third, McGwire led off  
the fifth by hitting a 1-1 pitch over the 400-foot mark in center 
field and into the netting covering the hitters' background. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a hundred fans sprinted for the seats, hoping to come up  
with a souvenir, before a fan reached under one of the covered 
seats and pulled out McGwire's fourth homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 54th multiple-homer game of McGwire's career, tying him  
with Frank Robinson for fifth place all-time. 
</P>
<P>
	After homering only once in his first five games, McGwire has  
caught up to his pace of his 70-homer season. Last year, he homered 
four times in his first four games but didn't hit No. 5 until the 
St. Louis Cardinals' 13th game. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also seems to have found his stroke in Three Rivers  
Stadium, where he went homerless on his first two visits there 
after joining the Cardinals in 1997. He now has four homers in his 
last three starts in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit homers No. 52 (Francisco Cordova) and No. 53  
(Ricardo Rincon) on consecutive games Aug. 22-23 in Pittsburgh, 
then sat out the final game of the three-game series on Aug. 24. He 
later hit No. 63 off reliever Jason Christiansen during the 
Pirates' final visit to St. Louis in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in Pittsburgh, McGwire Power upstages Cowher Power.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire had a surprise visitor during batting practice:  
Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher. But with the left-field 
stands filled even during batting practice as fans gathered for the 
chance to grab a McGwire long ball, Cowher's presence almost seemed 
to be ignored by most fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher, wearing a Steelers windbreaker and coaching shorts,  
talked with Cardinals manager Tony La Russa for about 15 minutes. 
While they were talking, McGwire playfully sneaked up behind up 
Cowher and nearly put him into a bear hug. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire put on his usual power show during batting practice,  
though he did not repeatedly reach the upper deck as he did on his 
two visits to Three Rivers Stadium last year.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose sharply Tuesday after Wall  
Street rallied to another record close. The U.S. dollar edged 
higher against the yen in quiet trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 207.76 points,  
or 1.26 percent, to finish the day at 16,715.16. On Monday, the 
index shed 348.23 points, or 2.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.42 yen at midday, up 0.06 yen from late  
Monday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New York level of 
120.19 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices bounced back after the  
Dow Jones industrial average rose 165.67 points, or 1.6 percent, to 
close at 10,339.51 Monday. The previous high of 10,197.70 was set 
last Thursday. The average of 30 blue-chip stocks is now up 12.6 
percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Nikkei's rebound, traders said the average is  
unlikely to climb sharply higher in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market doesn't have enough energy,'' said Masatoshi Sato,  
manager of the investment information group at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Japanese stocks plunged amid worries that earnings at  
Japanese technology companies would be lower than forecast. Those 
fears were sparked after major computer manufacturer Compaq said 
Friday its first-quarter earnings would be less than half analysts' 
average estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 15.54 points, or 1.18 percent, to 
1,331.74. The TOPIX closed down 26.71 points, or 2.00 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar hardly reacted to monthly  
reports by the Economic Planning Agency and the Bank of Japan, 
which said that economic deterioration was coming to a halt in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as if fundamentals are going to depend on the monthly  
reports,'' said Koichi Udagawa, assistant manager of the treasury 
division at Daiwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.10 yen, down  
from 130.12 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.615 percent from Monday's finish of 1.565 percent, 
driving its price down to 101.61 yen from 102.06 yen.

<HEADLINE> 'ER' Tops Nielsen Ratings Again / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Is ``ER'' ailing?  
</P>
<P>
	The medical drama's 17.9 rating and 30 share last Thursday was  
its lowest rating for a first-run episode since November 1994, its 
premiere year, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was still the week's most-watched show, as it has been for  
all 18 weeks that first-run episodes have aired this year. But the 
season-to-date ratings for television's most popular show are down 
11 percent from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC suggests last week's ratings were down because many other  
prime-time programs aired reruns, and that some viewers may have 
assumed that ``ER'' was doing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The slump is bad timing for NBC, which under a new deal is  
paying a record $13 million per episode for the drama -- more than 
five times what it paid in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' has been hurt by softness in NBC's Thursday night lineup,  
the recent departure of George Clooney and the simple passage of 
time, said Marc Berman, a television analyst for the ad buying firm 
Seltel. It's rare for a show in its fifth season to continue to 
grow in ratings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the show is as compelling as it once was,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is also the first year old episodes of ``ER'' have aired in  
reruns on cable television and through syndication. The ability for 
fans to see the show several times a week generally hurts the 
ratings for first-run episodes, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS narrowly won the week's ratings race over NBC, mirroring the  
season-to-date competition. CBS had an 8.3 rating and 14 share, NBC 
had an 8.2 rating and 14 share, ABC was at 6.4 and 11 and Fox had a 
6.3 and 11. All four networks were lower than their season averages 
in a week dominated by reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	For the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.7 rating and 5 share,  
UPN had a 1.7 rating and 3 share, and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news race with a 7.5  
rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 7.1 rating 
and 16 share, and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 6.2 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of April 5-11, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 17.9; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.2; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 14.8; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 13.7; ``Touched By an

<HEADLINE> Logging in Tongass To Be Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is placing an  
additional 234,000 acres in the nation's largest national forest 
off limits to logging and other development. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum allowable timber harvest in the Tongass National  
Forest in Alaska will be cut by 30 percent a year, and land open to 
logging will be reduced by 15 percent to about 576,000 acres, 
according to changes in the forest's management plan that were to 
be announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the changes, nearly half of the land that may be used for  
logging can be harvested only once every 200 years, instead of once 
every 100 years as is currently allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are intended to increase protections for ancient  
trees in the 17 million-acre forest and help protect species such 
as the Sitka black-tailed deer and Alexander Archipelago wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes also will help sustain the forest industries, as the  
allowable timber harvest remains well within the projected demand 
for timber from the region in coming years, said Jim Lyons, an 
undersecretary at the Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do is strike a sustainable balance up  
there,'' Lyons said, ``both for the natural resources that are 
nationally significant as well as a sustainable source of timber 
for the forest products industry in southeast Alaska.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a timber industry representative said the new maximum  
allowable harvest is below real demand, and that the changes could 
put at least one sawmill in the region out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It confirms our worst fears that this administration is  
determined to drive the last nail in the coffin of southeast 
Alaska's timber-based economy,'' said Jack Phelps, executive direct 
of the Alaska Forest Association, which represents 300 companies 
forest products companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes will come in the form of an update to the 1997  
management plan for the Tongass. The plan will be in effect at 
least until 2007, Lyons said, adding that the decision is intended 
to end the 33 separate appeals that have been filed against the 
1997 plan. . 
</P>
<P>
	Bart Koehler, executive director of the Southeast Alaska  
Conservation Council, one of the organizations that filed a 
150-page appeal to the 1997 plan, said, ``We're relieved that we're 
finally getting a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will increase protected forest land in the Tongass  
to nearly 13.7 million acres, up from more than 13.4 million acres 
currently. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 234,000 additional acres being protected, 100,000 had  
been previously deemed as suitable for logging. The other 134,000 
was not considered suitable for logging, and the decision assures 
they won't be available for logging for the life of the management 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan changes would take effect Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Masters Winner Olazabal Is Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- From one two-time Masters champion to  
another, Seve Ballesteros was among the first to congratulate 
fellow Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal on Sunday's victory at Augusta 
National. 
</P>
<P>
	King Juan Carlos and Prime Minster Jose Maria Aznar also got in  
on the action by praising Olazabal's second Masters victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won with authority from beginning to the end,'' said  
Ballesteros in a statement released by his brother, Baldomero. 
``This triumph will compensate him, in part, for some of the bad 
moments that destiny wanted him to face with courage. I 
congratulate him with all my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal, who also won the Masters in 1994 and was subsequently  
sidelined for 18 months with a career-threatening back injury that 
made walking nearly impossible, was the toast of Spain on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After Olazabal's '94 victory, the king received the 33-year-old  
Basque in the royal Zarzuela palace, though it was not clear if the 
reception would be repeated.

<HEADLINE> Records Fall During Keeneland Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The Keeneland April 2-Year-Olds In  
Training Sale set a world record Tuesday for the highest priced 
juvenile filly and tied the record for the highest priced juvenile 
colt ever sold at public auction. 
</P>
<P>
	B. Wayne Hughes purchased the filly Lochlin Slew for a record  
$1.25 million to break the mark of $1 million, set last month at 
Barretts Equine Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Tuesday, Irish bloodstock agent Demi O'Byrne bought a colt  
by Not For Love and out of the Assert mare Three Grand for $2 
million to tie the world mark set last month at Barretts. The colt, 
selected by O'Byrne and trainer D. Wayne Lukas, was for Michael 
Tabor. Tabor won the Kentucky Derby in 1994 with another Keeneland 
April Sale colt, Thunder Gulch. 
</P>
<P>
	Narvick International purchased a colt by Deputy Minister for  
$1.1 million for 505 Farm, giving Keeneland three horses sold at 
more than $1 million. Going into Tuesday's auction, Keeneland had 
never sold a 2-year-old for $1 million or more at this sale. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 123 2-year-olds were sold for a record gross of  
$18,560,000. The average was $150,894, while the median was 
$85,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Keeneland sold 93 horses for $13,925,000, which was  
the previous high gross for the one-day sale. The average was 
$149,731, while the median was $95,000.

<HEADLINE> Banks Undergo 'Time Travel' for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some banks are holding ``Time Travel'' days on  
which they set their clocks and computers to Jan. 1 and invite 
customers to check their account balances. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are getting together to pool their cash, just in case. A  
California bank even has a ``Marching Moneybags'' precision drill 
team to get customers' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	These are just some of the ways banks, thrifts and credit unions  
are preparing for the Year 2000 date change and informing customers 
about it, in addition to the computer corrections they must make. 
They also are using newspaper and radio ads, town meetings and 
monthly statement ``stuffers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see the challenge we face: We walk a fine line between  
boring people and alarming them,'' John P. Burke, chairman of the 
Conference of State Bank Supervisors, testified Tuesday at a House 
Banking Committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke, who also is Connecticut's banking commissioner, said  
consumers need to protect themselves against fraud, particularly 
new investment scams playing on fears that banks won't be able to 
handle the Year 2000 change. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, heard testimony from  
business leaders and lawmakers warning of dire economic results if 
Congress does not pass legislation limiting what experts predict 
could be $1 trillion in lawsuits arising from the computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress grappled with the Year 2000 problem on several  
fronts, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the Banking Committee's chairman, 
said the banking industry appears well prepared but some troubling 
questions remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach asked, for example, why companies assessing banks' Year  
2000 readiness have been less confident than banking regulators. He 
also noted that the inspectors general at some agencies, such as 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., have raised questions about 
the thoroughness or accuracy of the agencies' Year 2000 
examinations of banks. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who oversees  
nationally chartered banks, acknowledged that a ``small number'' of 
them may not be able to meet the government's June 30 deadline for 
having their Year 2000 computer testing successfully completed and 
system corrections substantially in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's financial institutions ``need to be prepared for a  
confidence deficit'' on the part of the public, Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As in the case of fire, if there is a panic in the banking  
sector, and everyone rushes to the door, someone is likely to get 
hurt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	People should avoid panic and steer clear of the proliferating  
investment scams exploiting Year 2000 fears, Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some con artists have tried to persuade people to take their  
money out of banks to avoid computer foul-ups, then turn it over to 
be invested with them in gold, silver, small-company stocks or 
other assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Some unscrupulous promoters are sending unsolicited e-mail  
messages selling investment opportunities in companies or products 
that are touted as fixing the Year 2000 problem, according to state 
securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be cases of Y2K fraud or swindle,'' testified Donna  
Tanoue, the FDIC chairwoman. ``If a deal seems too good to be true, 
it probably is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's bankers have promised that ATM machines, credit  
cards, checks and banking services will function normally through 
the millennial date change. They have warned that withdrawing 
massive amounts of cash could make consumers vulnerable to being 
robbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawke, Ms. Tanoue and other regulators appearing at Tuesday's  
hearing reminded consumers that bank accounts are federally insured 
up to $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Federal Reserve has ordered an additional $50 billion  
of new currency to be put into circulation in the event people make 
a run on banks and automated teller machines late in the year. By 
the end of the year, $200 billion in currency will be stored in 
government vaults, up from the $150 billion normally held in 
reserve. That's in addition to the $460 billion in notes 
circulating in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal debated by the Judiciary Committee seeks to head  
off a flood of lawsuits by giving companies that are potential 
defendants up to 90 days to fix Year 2000 problems before a suit 
goes to court, and by promoting mediation. The legislation also 
would cap punitive damages, make it more difficult to file 
class-action suits and allow those sued to claim they are making 
``reasonable efforts'' to remedy problems.

</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Jim V. Blevins, the self-proclaimed  
``Popcorn King'' who marketed a corn that produced a fluffier, 
tastier popcorn to movie theaters and grocery stores, died Monday. 
He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Blevins was operating a Nashville food brokerage business in the  
1940s when he noticed the movie industry boom was boosting sales of 
popcorn, but suppliers hadn't caught up. 
</P>
<P>
	Blevins signed a contract to supply all the popcorn for a Middle  
Tennessee movie chain, marketing a hybrid corn that produced 
better-tasting, fluffier popcorn that allowed operators to get more 
volume per ounce of corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Blevins Popcorn Co. then helped introduce the Pops-Rite brand to  
the rest of the world, marketing the snack in jars of oil ready to 
pop, in sacks and with a low-fat buttery seasoning developed in his 
own kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	Blevins sold the company in 1961.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, he took popcorn to Japanese baseball stands, creating  
an entity he later sold to Frito Lay.

	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Charles ``Chuck'' Davis, a computer  
columnist and assistant news editor for The Daily Oklahoman, died 
Monday of cancer. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who had been with the newspaper since 1980, was also

American League baseball umpire, died April 1 after a lengthy 
illness. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Flaherty worked four World Series in his 21-year big league  
career that began in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1954 Flaherty found himself in the limelight again when he  
was officiating at a game between the Washington Senators and the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	He called a Senators' base runner ``out'' at home plate when he  
tried to score from second on a single. Attending the game was 
President Eisenhower, who yelled out, ``No!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the locker room, Flaherty was asked whether  
Eisenhower's displeasure made him rethink his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Flaherty said. ``It wasn't even close.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Levi Ben Levy, the head rabbi of the Israelite  
Board of Rabbis for the Western Hemisphere, died Friday of 
leukemia. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	The board serves black Hebrew Israelites, as those Jews prefer  
to be called. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy, who was born in Linden, N.C., moved to New York in 1950,  
where he met Rabbi Wentworth Matthew, one of the first ordained 
black rabbis in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy enrolled at the Ethiopian Hebrew Rabbinical College in 1959  
and was ordained in 1967, a year after his graduation. His first 
synagogue, the Beth Shalom Ethiopian Congregation, began with eight 
families meeting in the living room of his Queens home. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1970s, Levy was elected chief rabbi of the  
Israelite Board of Rabbis. At the time, the board's 
responsibilities were confined to the New York area. They later 
expanded to include new congregations in other countries.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Justo Rodriguez Santos, a poet who became  
disenchanted with Fidel Castro in the 1960s and exiled himself from 
his native Cuba before becoming an advertising executive in the 
United States, died April 7. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez Santos was a member of Origenes, a group of painters  
and writers founded in the 1930s and linked to U.S. poet Wallace 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, after the Cuban revolution, Rodriguez Santos wanted to  
stay in Cuba. His wife and children left in 1963, and he asked to 
leave four years later. Instead, he was sent to work on a tobacco 
farm and his books were removed from libraries. He was banned from 
the Cuban Writers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	He was allowed to leave in 1968. He settled in New York and was  
hired as director of advertising for Goya Foods in Secaucus, N.J., 
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez Santos' books of poetry include ``La Belleza Que el  
Cielo No Amortaja'' (``The Beauty the Sky Will Not Shroud,'' 1950) 
and ``Las Operas del Sueno'' (``Dream Operas,'' 1989). He also 
wrote ``The Moncada Epic: Poetry of History'' (1963), a nonfiction 
account of the Cuban revolution.

<P>
	``The Flintstones,'' a Hanna-Barbera cartoon that humorously

<HEADLINE> Jenny Jones Defends Her Talk Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Jenny Jones testified this morning that  
she doesn't ``ambush'' guests as claimed by the family of a gay man 
who revealed his crush on another guest and was shot dead days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my intent to embarrass anyone on the show,'' she said  
during her second day on the stand in the trial of a $50 million 
lawsuit by the family of Scott Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure, from Oakland County, was killed by an acquaintance,  
Jonathan Schmitz, three days after they taped an episode of Ms. 
Jones' show in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Under continued questioning from Geoffrey Fieger, the attorney  
for the Amedure family, Ms. Jones said the show wasn't responsible 
for Amedure's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said she cared about her guests and denied trying to  
embarrass Schmitz by getting Amedure to reveal a sexual fantasy 
about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware a person could be embarrassed by a sexual fantasy. I  
believe all people have them,'' Ms. Jones testified Monday. ``I'm 
sure you do, Mr. Fieger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Amedure family is suing ``The Jenny Jones Show'' and its  
producer, Warner Bros., accusing the show of tricking a mentally 
troubled Schmitz into appearing, then humiliating him by telling 
him during the taping that his secret admirer was Amedure. The 
segment never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz ``did not appear to be humiliated,'' Ms. Jones said.  
Asked by Fieger whether most people would feel humiliated under 
such circumstances, she said, ``I totally disagree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to have Schmitz, on camera, watch a tape of Amedure  
describing his sexual fantasy was made ``on the fly'' and was not 
scripted, Ms. Jones testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if that amounted to an ``ambush'' of an unwitting guest,  
Ms. Jones told Fieger: ``If you're using the word `ambush,' I'm not 
going to agree with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones appeared more confident and assertive than when she  
took the stand during Schmitz's 1996 murder trial, interrupting 
Fieger and asking her own questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger re-enacted parts of a deposition Ms. Jones gave two years  
ago, and claimed that she never asked any questions about the 
incident until writing her 1997 book, ``Jenny Jones: My Story.'' 
The book includes a chapter on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of writing a book and doing a national book  
tour -- that motivated you to find out what happened on your show,'' 
Fieger told her. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, it did not,'' Ms. Jones said. ``Have you read the book?''  
</P>
<P>
	She said Schmitz didn't seem embarrassed after hearing what  
Fieger termed Amedure's ``lascivious'' sexual fantasy involving 
Schmitz, a hammock, whipped cream and champagne. When asked by 
Fieger whether she would find such fantasies offensive, she 
countered that ``it could be exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky scandal was much  
more lurid than this sexual fantasy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger elicited Ms. Jones's testimony that she didn't offer her  
condolences to Amedure's mother until two years after the slaying 
while touting her book. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very first thing I wanted to do was write a note and send  
flowers, and I was asked not to,'' she testified without 
identifying who offered the advice. Eventually, she said, ``I 
decided to go against the bad advice and do what I wanted to in the 
first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones acknowledged her show had no post-taping contact with  
Schmitz. But she added that ``I actually do care about the guests 
and think that's one of the reasons the show is popular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Gene Schnelz ruled Monday that the defense could  
offer testimony from people who say Amedure told them he had a 
sexual relationship with Schmitz. Amedure's family denies the 
claims.

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky Thinking About Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Will 1999 be it for No. 99?  
</P>
<P>
	Only Wayne Gretzky knows for sure, and he isn't saying.  
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about the possible retirement of hockey's greatest  
player has given the final days of the regular season much more 
meaning than the playoff race could and it has hockey fans, the NHL 
and the New York Rangers waiting anxiously. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Gretzky said his son's mind was made up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would strongly suspect that Sunday will be his final game,''  
the elder Gretzky told radio station CKGL in Kitchener, Ontario. 
``I haven't talked to him personally. He's talked with his mom, but 
most likely he will announce a retirement. He's 38 now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he asked his son last summer when he would retire, and  
he replied, ``The day that I stop enjoying it is the day I'm 
finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Messier, who won four Stanley Cups with Gretzky while  
playing for Edmonton in the 1980s, reserved judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone else is insinuating that he's retiring -- but  
everybody except the most important person, and that's himself. So 
we'll just wait and see the way things turn out and what Wayne 
himself has to say,'' Messier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Tuesday via satellite from New York to a conference on  
the state of hockey in Canada, Gretzky reminisced about the sport 
and sounded much like a 38-year-old man ready to hang up his 
skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey has been a part of my life as long as I can remember,''  
said Gretzky, who holds virtually every important scoring record in 
hockey. ``I lived it and I breathed it as a kid and as an adult. 
It's the only job I've ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took no questions.  
</P>
<P>
	After the Rangers' 2-1 victory over Tampa Bay on Monday night,  
Gretzky admitted he was thinking about retirement but had not made 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have 1,000 different thoughts, to be honest,'' Gretzky said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to think about it. ... All of a sudden it's become a  
bigger issue than I imagined,'' he said. ``Let's see what happens 
over the next five or six days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers intend to pick up the option on Gretzky's contract  
later this week, general manager Neil Smith said Tuesday. He also 
acknowledged that he hasn't tried to sit down with Gretzky to see 
what he was thinking, more out of respect than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith insisted that Gretzky is an emotional player who has ups  
and downs and that missing the playoffs for a second straight year 
and being sidelined with a neck injury might have made him consider 
retirement a little more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is going to play,'' Smith said optimistically.  
</P>
<P>
	Reporters who cover the Rangers said that players like Brian  
Leetch and Adam Graves don't even know what Gretzky intends to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Rosen, the Rangers' play-by-play broadcaster, said there is  
no doubt in his mind that retirement would not have been an issue 
had New York made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this moment, he probably can't see or be optimistic that  
things will change next year,'' Rosen said. ``I don't think he just 
wants to have another productive year. He would love to have a shot 
at going deep in the playoffs but I don't think he sees that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers in Toronto and New York have reported that Gretzky  
will retire after the Rangers' season finale against Pittsburgh on 
Sunday. Others have reported that retirement is 50-50 at this 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Barnett, Gretzky's agent, did not immediately return a  
telephone call left at his Riverside, Calif., office by The 
Associated Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post cited what it described as ``unimpeachable  
sources in whom The Great One has confided'' in reporting on 
Tuesday that Gretzky will retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has made up his mind, but he has had his reasons for not  
wanting to make an announcement,'' the Post quoted an unidentified 
person it described as having knowledge of the retirement decision 
as saying. ``But it's done. He is not coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto Sun also reported Gretzky would retire, saying the  
only way he would revise his decision to quit would be if his wife, 
Janet, and Barnett urged him to step back and review his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out soon enough,'' Rangers coach John Muckler said  
Monday. ``Everybody is speculating, but only one person knows for 
sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun and ESPN quoted unidentified sources as saying Gretzky  
asked for an unusually large number of tickets for Sunday's game, 
although the Rangers said that he officially only asked for 10 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	John Davidson, a commentator for the Rangers, said Sunday on Fox  
TV that after speaking with Gretzky he believed the player was 80 
percent sure he would retire after Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people very close to Wayne ... and I mean very close, feel  
there's a very strong possibility Sunday will be the last time he 
plays,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky responded to questions about Davidson's report by  
saying, ``There's been times where I've said things to friends that 
get blown way out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I will say is that I will not be one of those  
guys who says `I'm 90 percent sure' or `Maybe I'm coming back.' The 
decision I make will be 100 percent. No ifs, ands or buts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans at Madison Square Garden held up signs Monday night with  
slogans such as ``Wayne Don't Go.'' Gretzky said the fan reaction 
made it difficult to consider retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said it a hundred times that I've been here over the three  
years,'' Gretzky said. ``This is the greatest city to be an athlete 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans at recent Rangers games in Chicago and Dallas have given  
Gretzky standing ovations when either his picture or statistics 
were flashed on the scoreboard. In other cities, the pregame 
stories hyped the contest with the Rangers as possibly being 
Gretzky's last game in that city. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been a typical season for Gretzky, who missed 11 games  
at one point with a neck injury. He had played in 223 straight 
games since signing with the Rangers as a free agent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was the second in Gretzky's career involving a disc.  
In 1992-93, he missed most of the season with a lower back injury 
before coming back to lead the Los Angeles Kings to the Stanley Cup 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998-99 season has included at least one milestone for the  
NHL's leading career scorer. His ninth goal of the year gave him 
1,072 as a professional, moving him past boyhood hero Gordie Howe.

<HEADLINE> Niger Political Activity Ban Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NIAMEY, Niger (AP) -- Niger's junta has lifted the ban on  
political activity in this West African nation, issuing the order 
hours after the country's opposition indicated it would work with 
the military government. 
</P>
<P>
	The junta, in a late Monday night announcement on state  
broadcasting, also said that Prime Minister Ibrahim Assane Mayaki 
would keep his job and that the country's new president, Commandant 
Daouda Malam Wanke, had been meeting with Western diplomats, 
apparently in an effort to improve his profile after the killing of 
his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wanke was named president Sunday night, two days after President  
Ibrahim Bare Mainassara was gunned down by members of his own 
Presidential Guard. Wanke leads that guard unit. 
</P>
<P>
	While decrying the circumstances of Bare's death, on Monday  
evening Niger's eleven opposition parties indicated they would work 
with the junta during its promised 9-month transition to civilian 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The transition could eventually ``open up a new phase of great  
hope'' in Niger, said Mohamane Ousmane, a former president of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being ousted himself in a military coup three years ago,  
Ousmane said he believed the junta would keep its promise to hand 
over power after democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be very difficult for soldiers to refuse  
systematically to go through the democratic process,'' he told 
reporters after an opposition announcement indicating their 
willingness to work with the junta. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, the opposition parties asked its ``militants  
to work for a successful transition to democratic rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The now-ruling soldiers, mostly junior military officers,  
quickly swept away nearly every element of Bare's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	It has, however, promised to set up a civilian authority for  
much of the day-to-day governing in Niger, a Western diplomat said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. The Monday night announcement 
appeared to pave the way for such an authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Bare, who ousted Ousmane in 1996 and set up a regime rife with  
mismanagement, nepotism and corruption, had lost nearly all support 
by the time of his death. During his tenure, teachers, bureaucrats 
and soldiers often went unpaid for months and opposition 
politicians were regularly locked up. Meanwhile, Bare's relatives 
were given profitable government jobs as the economy of the 
poverty-wracked nation slipped even further. 
</P>
<P>
	Over and over, Bare faced down brief military rebellions and  
strikes by government workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his failings, many people in this hot, dusty city on  
the banks of the Niger River welcomed the end of Bare's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bare was a catastrophe for this country,'' said Maman Abou,  
who runs the independent weekly Le Republicain. ``Three years for 
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But whether the new government will fare any better, or fulfill  
its promise of giving way to a civilian government in nine months, 
remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Wanke, Bare's successor, is a little-known figure in Niger  
outside the military. A career soldier in his mid-40s, he was an 
artillery officer before being named head of the Presidential Guard 
in early 1997.

<HEADLINE> Trappers Get Third Beaver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trappers have caught what they think is the  
last of the beavers that have been chowing down on Washington's 
famous Tidal Basin cherry trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Trapper John Adcock Jr. said the third beaver was trapped Monday  
night shortly before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Adcock said he thinks the male beaver -- nicknamed ``Big Daddy''  
-- is the mate of the female trapped Saturday and the father of the 
young beaver caught Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Adcock says all three appear in good health, although ``Big  
Daddy'' sustained a bloody nose when he was being moved from the 
trap to a transport cage early today. 
</P>
<P>
	As with Mommy Beaver and Baby Beaver, Big Daddy was relocated by  
Park Service rangers to a secret spot. Rangers hope the three will 
reunite and, once more, be a nuclear beaver family -- but not one 
that's destroying the Tidal Basin cherry trees.

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky Thinking About Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Will 1999 be it for No. 99?  
</P>
<P>
	Only Wayne Gretzky knows for sure, and he isn't saying.  
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about the possible retirement of hockey's greatest  
player has given the final days of the regular season much more 
meaning than the playoff race could and it has hockey fans, the NHL 
and the New York Rangers waiting anxiously. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Gretzky said his son's mind was made up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would strongly suspect that Sunday will be his final game,''  
the elder Gretzky told radio station CKGL in Kitchener, Ontario. 
``I haven't talked to him personally. He's talked with his mom, but 
most likely he will announce a retirement. He's 38 now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he asked his son last summer when he would retire, and  
he replied, ``The day that I stop enjoying it is the day I'm 
finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Messier, who won four Stanley Cups with Gretzky while  
playing for Edmonton in the 1980s, reserved judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone else is insinuating that he's retiring -- but  
everybody except the most important person, and that's himself. So 
we'll just wait and see the way things turn out and what Wayne 
himself has to say,'' Messier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Tuesday via satellite from New York to a conference on  
the state of hockey in Canada, Gretzky reminisced about the sport 
and sounded much like a 38-year-old man ready to hang up his 
skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey has been a part of my life as long as I can remember,''  
said Gretzky, who holds virtually every important scoring record in 
hockey. ``I lived it and I breathed it as a kid and as an adult. 
It's the only job I've ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took no questions.  
</P>
<P>
	After the Rangers' 2-1 victory over Tampa Bay on Monday night,  
Gretzky admitted he was thinking about retirement but had not made 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have 1,000 different thoughts, to be honest,'' Gretzky said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to think about it. ... All of a sudden it's become a  
bigger issue than I imagined,'' he said. ``Let's see what happens 
over the next five or six days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers intend to pick up the option on Gretzky's contract  
later this week, general manager Neil Smith said Tuesday. He also 
acknowledged that he hasn't tried to sit down with Gretzky to see 
what he was thinking, more out of respect than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith insisted that Gretzky is an emotional player who has ups  
and downs and that missing the playoffs for a second straight year 
and being sidelined with a neck injury might have made him consider 
retirement a little more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is going to play,'' Smith said optimistically.  
</P>
<P>
	Reporters who cover the Rangers said that players like Brian  
Leetch and Adam Graves don't even know what Gretzky intends to do.

Sunday. Others have reported that retirement is 50-50 at this

<HEADLINE> Fannie Mae Earnings Up 14 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fannie Mae on Monday reported a 12.2 percent  
increase in first-quarter earnings on strong growth in its 
portfolio of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, the nation's largest source of financing for home  
mortgages, reported earnings of $924.9 million, or 88 cents per 
share, compared with $824.2 million, or 77 cents per share, in the 
same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae attributed the gain to a 12 percent increase in net  
interest income and lower credit-related costs. The company's 
portfolio of mortages grew at an annual rate of 25 percent during 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were slightly above analyst expectations of 87 cents  
a share, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The company purchased $53 billion of mortgages in the first  
quarter of 1999, compared with $28.4 billion in the first quarter 
of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the company issued a record $106.5 billion of  
mortgage-backed securities in the first quarter of 1999, compared 
with $58.3 billion in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Fannie Mae fell $1.87 1/2 to $66.50 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Gets 10 to 25 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the eccentric champion  
of dying people's freedom to get help ending their lives, lost his 
freedom Tuesday. A judge sentenced him to 10 to 25 years in prison 
for the videotaped killing of a Lou Gehrig's disease patient who 
asked to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jessica Cooper sentenced the 70-year-old Kevorkian after  
harshly criticizing his methods in killing Thomas Youk, whose death 
by injection was videotaped and shown on CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' He 
was convicted of second-degree murder in that case. 
</P>
<P>
		   Kevorkian also was sentenced to three to seven years for  
delivery of a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have been sentenced to life in prison for the murder  
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``This trial was not about the political or moral correctness of  
euthanasia,'' Cooper told Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was about lawlessness. It was about disrespect for a  
society that exists because of the strength of the legal system. No 
one, sir, is above the law. No one. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had the audacity to go on national television, show the  
world what you did and dare the legal system to stop you. Well, 
sir, consider yourself stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian will be eligible for parole after serving two-thirds  
of his sentence.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Rise, but Inflation Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation remained restrained in March even as  
gasoline prices under $1 a gallon disappeared. And Easter shopping 
and fat tax-refund checks helped keep retail sales advancing for 
the eighth consecutive month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Price Index rose a modest 0.2 percent in March, the  
Labor Department said Tuesday. The inflation rate for the first 
three months of the year, at 1.5 percent, held just under the 
12-year low of 1.6 percent for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales, meanwhile, rose 0.2 percent, the Commerce  
Department said. That would be considered rather weak, except it 
came on top of a revised 1.7 percent gain in February, the 
strongest in five years and nearly double the original 0.9 percent 
estimate, and a 1.3 percent gain in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``The latest economic data tell the same stirring tale: strong  
growth with no inflation,'' said economist Gerald D. Cohen of 
Merrill Lynch. ``There is no inflation in the U.S. economy. ... 
Retail sales during the first quarter were incredibly strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combination nudged the stock market to another record. The  
Dow Jones average of industrial stocks rose 55.5 points to 10,395. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy prices in March jumped 1.6 percent, the biggest gain in  
more than two years. Gasoline costs rose 3.7 percent. However, food 
prices declined 0.2 percent, with beef and pork, fruit and 
vegetables all falling. 
</P>
<P>
	And the so-called core inflation rate rose just 0.1 percent for  
the third consecutive month, with decreases for new cars and 
trucks, clothing, computers and tobacco helping offset higher 
prescription drug prices and a 4.7 percent rise in airline fares, 
steepest in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said motorists could see even more expensive gasoline  
if the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries manages to 
stick with last month's agreement to limit oil production. That's a 
big if, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will OPEC hold these supply controls? I doubt it,'' said  
economist Sandra Shaber of the Wefa Group in Eddystone, Pa. ``It's 
going to be very, very hard to hold higher gasoline prices. I'd be 
surprised if they went up much further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fundamentally, inflation remains mild although it may drift up  
to about a 2 percent rate as ailing economies around the world 
recover, increasing demand for products and commodities, said 
economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West 
Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't benefit to the same degree this year as we did from  
falling import prices,'' he said. ``That was a major constraint on 
consumer prices last year.'' 
</P>

<P>
	However, sales jumped 1.6 percent at clothing and accessory  
shops and 0.7 percent at department and general merchandise stores. 
They rose, too, at furniture stores, drug stores and at service 
stations, reflecting higher gasoline prices.

<HEADLINE> Horse Trainer Placed into Mo. Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- His epitaph in the segregated black  
section of Elmwood Cemetery in Mexico, Mo., reads: ``One of the 
World's Greatest Saddle Horse Trainers and Riders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few who know Tom Bass' story would disagree.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a bronze bust of the former slave and horseman was  
unveiled in the Capitol as the 20th inductee into the Hall of 
Famous Missourians, joining busts of Mark Twain, Thomas Hart Benton 
and Harry Truman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's the recognition that he truly deserves with the  
talent he had,'' said Bass' great-great-niece Arluster Bass Haynes 
of Odessa. ``To us, as a family, we are emotional, elated and 
proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bass was selected for the Hall of Famous Missourians by House  
Speaker Steve Gaw, a horse enthusiast who raises saddlebred horses 
on his farm near Moberly. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass was born into slavery on a farm near Ashland in 1859 and  
moved to Mexico when he was 20 with a dream of starting his own 
stables. 
</P>
<P>
	He fought racial discrimination as he turned his Bass Barn from  
a local stable into a national success, gaining acclaim in an 
equestrian field long-dominated by wealthy white men. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Bass trained horses for Theodore Roosevelt, Will  
Rogers and Buffalo Bill Cody, and showed his stables off to William 
Jennings Bryan, William McKinley and P.T. Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
	``He reminds us that if we overlook the things that segregate  
us, incredible things can happen,'' Gaw said during the bust 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
	To celebrate Bass' induction, 160 of his descendants, local  
historians and horse enthusiasts began a 45-mile trail ride on 
horseback Saturday from The American Saddle Horse Museum in Mexico 
to the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	An entire wall at the museum is decorated with awards Bass won  
throughout his career. Cases of blue, red, yellow and white ribbons 
hang next to framed photos of the champion horses he trained. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass overcame obstacles in a time when African-Americans did not  
have equal rights and ``proved that he was better than anyone else 
in his profession,'' said Rep. Ted Farnen, D-Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass later moved to Kansas City and helped start a premier horse  
show that is now the American Royal, the grand finale of the 
saddlebred show season. 
</P>
<P>
	He also started the Tom Bass Riding Club and listed among his  
accomplishments the invention of the ``Bass bit,'' a bridle device 
to give riders maximum control with minimal discomfort to the 
horse. Bass never patented the device, which is still used in 
training horses. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bass died in 1934, he was eulogized in newspapers  
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Rise, but Inflation Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation remained restrained in March even as  
gasoline prices under $1 a gallon disappeared. And Easter shopping 
and fat tax-refund checks helped keep retail sales advancing for 
the eighth consecutive month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Price Index rose a modest 0.2 percent in March, the  
Labor Department said Tuesday. The inflation rate for the first 
three months of the year, at 1.5 percent, held just under the 
12-year low of 1.6 percent for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales, meanwhile, rose 0.2 percent, the Commerce  
Department said. That would be considered rather weak, except it 
came on top of a revised 1.7 percent gain in February, the 
strongest in five years and nearly double the original 0.9 percent 
estimate, and a 1.3 percent gain in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``The latest economic data tell the same stirring tale: strong  
growth with no inflation,'' said economist Gerald D. Cohen of 
Merrill Lynch. ``There is no inflation in the U.S. economy. ... 
Retail sales during the first quarter were incredibly strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combination nudged the stock market to another record. The  
Dow Jones average of industrial stocks rose 55.5 points to 10,395. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy prices in March jumped 1.6 percent, the biggest gain in  
more than two years. Gasoline costs rose 3.7 percent. However, food 
prices declined 0.2 percent, with beef and pork, fruit and 
vegetables all falling. 
</P>
<P>
	And the so-called core inflation rate rose just 0.1 percent for  
the third consecutive month, with decreases for new cars and 
trucks, clothing, computers and tobacco helping offset higher 
prescription drug prices and a 4.7 percent rise in airline fares, 
steepest in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said motorists could see even more expensive gasoline  
if the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries manages to 
stick with last month's agreement to limit oil production. That's a 
big if, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will OPEC hold these supply controls? I doubt it,'' said  
economist Sandra Shaber of the Wefa Group in Eddystone, Pa. ``It's 
going to be very, very hard to hold higher gasoline prices. I'd be 
surprised if they went up much further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fundamentally, inflation remains mild although it may drift up  
to about a 2 percent rate as ailing economies around the world 
recover, increasing demand for products and commodities, said 
economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West 
Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't benefit to the same degree this year as we did from  
falling import prices,'' he said. ``That was a major constraint on 
consumer prices last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the gain in retail sales pushed them to a seasonally  
adjusted $239.6 billion last month. 
</P>
<P>
	A nearly 20 percent increase in tax refunds over last year  
contributed to the March rise and, with Easter falling on April 4, 
the usual shopping spree for spring clothes came early. 
</P>
<P>
	Record stock prices, low interest rates and the lowest  
unemployment rate in 29 years, 4.2 percent in March, also are

percent at building supply and hardware stores, both after much 
larger gains the month before. Receipts also declined at food 
stores and restaurants and bars.

	However, sales jumped 1.6 percent at clothing and accessory

<HEADLINE> Mich. Riot Photos Must Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A judge ruled Tuesday that two  
newspapers and eight television stations must give unpublished 
photographs and video of a campus riot to prosecutors trying to 
identify the people involved. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge David Jordan's ruling was similar to one he made  
last week involving the Lansing State Journal. All of the news 
organizations plan to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III is seeking hundreds of  
unpublished photographs and video footage taken the night of March 
27, when more than 5,000 people rioted on the Michigan State 
University campus and in downtown East Lansing. The riots began in 
the final moments of the NCAA semifinal game in which Michigan 
State lost to Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continued delay by the news media in compliance with the  
law could further jeopardize our efforts,'' Dunnings said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is trying to prosecute as many alleged rioters as he  
can before Michigan State's summer vacation begins May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's ruling affected The Detroit Free Press and The State  
News -- Michigan State's student newspaper -- and television stations 
WJBK, WKBD and WXYZ in Detroit, WJRT in Flint, WILX in Onandaga 
outside Lansing, WLNS in Lansing, WWMT in Kalamazoo and WZZM in 
Grand Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	The media argued that it cannot be seen as working for  
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The news media should not be cast in the role as an agent of  
the police,'' Free Press attorney Herschel Fink said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordon ruled that Michigan law doesn't extend any media  
privileges to non-confidential information. Since the events the 
media photographed were in public areas, he said, media outlets 
cannot argue that their information is confidential.

<HEADLINE> Weyerhaeuser Profits Rise 20 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Weyerhaeuser Co. today reported its  
first-quarter earnings rose 20 percent before the effects of two 
one-time charges were included. 
</P>
<P>
	The forest products company said it earned $102 million, or 51  
cents per share, compared with $85 million, or 43 cents per share, 
for the first quarter of 1998 before the charges. When the charges 
are included, the company had a loss of $48 million, or 24 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	One charge, totaling $90 million after taxes, resulted from a  
new accounting standard. The second, totaling $60 million, was 
related to Weyerhaeuser's decision to sell its composite-products 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerhaeuser's results surpassed analyst expectations of 36  
cents a share, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Net sales for the quarter were $2.7 billion, compared with $2.6  
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was encouraged by the results, ``because they  
reflect the progress we're achieving through our focus on operating 
efficiencies and improving market conditions,'' president and chief 
executive officer Steven R. Rogel said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulp, paper and packaging prices have started to improve; wood  
products markets remained strong; a good U.S. housing market helped 
the company's real-estate business; and lumber prices have 
improved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some problem areas remain prices for raw logs, which are below  
year-ago levels in domestic markets and unchanged in export 
markets, and continuing low prices for pulp, paper and packaging 
products.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Titans Unveil New Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The oil derrick and any ties to Texas  
are gone forever for the Tennessee Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	The franchise, which officially changed its nickname from the  
Oilers in February, unveiled its new colors and uniforms Tuesday 
night in the parking lot of its new 67,000-seat stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the final step in a move that originally began in August  
1995 for a team that had called Houston home since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope people will embrace the Titans and the new logo and  
the new colors,'' said owner Bud Adams, who spent the past few 
months working with NFL Properties over the completely new look. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Eddie George and three teammates modeled the new  
uniforms, which switches the team's dominant colors from Columbia 
blue, red and white to navy blue, white and a shade officials call 
``Titans'' blue or a slightly darker shade of Columbia blue. 
</P>
<P>
	The navy blue home jersey features the lighter blue across the  
top of the shoulder pads to the edge of the arms. Numbers on the 
top of the shoulder pads are navy blue with white trim, and the 
numbers on the chest and back are white trimmed in the lighter 
blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Each arm has a T-shaped dagger behind a red, white and blue,  
three-starred shield. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans' helmets remain white with a T-shaped dagger in the  
middle of a flaming circle on each side. 
</P>
<P>
	The new look received good reviews from both the Titans and the  
approximately 1,000 fans who showed up for the first look. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Titans hadn't seen the new uniforms, and defensive  
back Anthony Dorsett was impressed. He said the team needed the new 
look to go with the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be different in the league. None of the other  
teams are going to look like us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The uniform change is the first in 24 years for the franchise,  
and the Titans are hoping for similar luck with the new look. The 
1975 Oilers went 10-4 after the change following a 7-7 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The last four NFL teams to redesign their uniforms responded by  
going to the playoffs in their first season with the new look. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Jets' retro uniform approach coincided with an AFC  
East title last season. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Denver Broncos won the Super Bowl and the Tampa Bay  
Buccaneers reached the playoffs for the first time in 15 years with 
completely revised looks. And in 1996, the Philadelphia Eagles 
reached the playoffs with a new wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1981 Cincinnati Bengals and the 1972 Washington Redskins  
also played their way into Super Bowls with different uniforms.

<HEADLINE> Payton Fatigued After Cubs' Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- NFL Hall of Famer Walter Payton canceled a  
personal appearance Tuesday because of fatigue after throwing out 
the first pitch at the Cubs' home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, who has a rare liver disease, was scheduled to speak to  
the Machinery/Materials Conference and Exposition at Chicago's 
McCormick Place. He canceled at the last minute, convention 
spokesman Leo Nadolske said. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball game at Wrigley Field was the first public  
appearance in months for the 44-year-old former running back of the 
Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a very big day yesterday and part of the symptoms of  
(his disease) is fatigue,'' said Ginny Quirk, vice president of 
Walter Payton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Therefore, his feeling was that it was going to be too much to  
go all the way downtown and give a powerful keynote speech. He was 
too taxed to make the trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton lives in suburban South Barrington, about 40 miles from  
McCormick Place. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Cubs' home opener, he looked decidedly healthier than he  
did in early February when he announced that he needed a liver 
transplant because he had primary sclerosing cholangitis. He was 
placed on the transplant list at Mayo Clinic a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrigley fans gave Payton a standing ovation after he threw Sammy  
Sosa a strike, then hugged the Cubs' slugger. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a ball yesterday,'' Quirk said. ``It was very uplifting  
for him.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Makes Hong Kong Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. is teaming up with SmarTone Mobile  
Communications Ltd. to provide content for the Hong Kong mobile 
phone operator's new Internet access site, the companies announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, the Internet's leading search and directory service, and  
SmarTone refused to put a value on the deal that will allow 
SmarTone mobile phone users to access iSmart, the Internet service 
to be launched next week. 
</P>
<P>
	iSmart will give SmarTone a means to compete with services  
offered by Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., the territory's 
largest telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in SmarTone rose 3.5 percent on Tuesday to close at 25.10  
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $3.21), following a 7.1 percent rise on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition in the mobile phone market is stiff, with some 3  
million of Hong Kong's 6.8 million residents owning mobile phones. 
SmarTone offers its users a variety of services including traffic 
speed trap updates, stock quotes and trading via mobile phone and 
news updates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal with Yahoo!, SmarTone users will eventually be able  
to access the service through their mobile phones, executives said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yahoo! partnership with SmarTone is not an exclusive  
deal, said Savio Chow, Asia managing director for Yahoo!. Yahoo!, 
based in Santa Clara, California, will be looking to cooperate with 
other companies in Hong Kong and Asia in the future, co-founder 
Jerry Yang said at a news conference without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet activities have been heating up recently in Hong Kong.  
</P>
<P>
	British Telecommunications PLC last week said that it was  
investing 3.02 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $387 million) to buy 
20 percent of SmarTone, adding that Asia, including China, was a 
priority market. Last month, Hongkong Telecom and Microsoft Corp. 
boss Bill Gates unveiled a new Internet venture here that focuses 
on providing online entertainment.

<HEADLINE> DeBartolo York Still 49ers Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) -- Denise DeBartolo York maintained control  
of the San Francisco 49ers and her brother's corporation after a 
private shareholders meeting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her brother, Eddie, remains under suspension from the NFL but  
appeared to gain greater influence when his daughter, Tiffanie 
DeBartolo, and his friend and business associate, Ed Muransky, were 
added to the DeBartolo Corp. board. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members of the board are DeBartolo York and her husband,  
John York, according to Cindy Miller, DeBartolo Corp.'s 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the board had three members -- DeBartolo York, John  
York and Lynn Davenport, the company's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	While Eddie DeBartolo is not on the board, he ``is a shareholder  
in the company,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said management structure of the 49ers, with DeBartolo  
York as chairwoman, was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a great step forward,'' said Rick Rice, a San  
Francisco-based spokesman for DeBartolo. ``It means for the first 
time in 15 months, Mr. DeBartolo has equal representation on the 
board of a company that he owns 50 percent of. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a positive step toward resolving those issues  
and his objective remains to return to managing the team when his 
suspension is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie DeBartolo could be reinstated by the NFL next year if he  
satisfies the terms of his suspension that forbids his involvement 
with 49ers management and decision making. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty in October to one felony charge of failing to  
report an alleged extortion attempt by former Louisiana Gov. Edwin 
Edwards in connection with DeBartolo's bid for a riverboat gambling 
license. The judge imposed $2 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit filed recently in San Francisco Superior Court accuses  
the suspended 49ers co-owner of owing $94 million and stalling a 
new stadium project. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers lawsuit is seeking repayment of the alleged debt,  
cutting DeBartolo's management ties to the team and ending a $10 
million financial interest claimed by DeBartolo in a $525 million 
stadium project that has been stalled because of soaring 
construction costs.

<HEADLINE> Reputed Mobster Gets Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Louis ``Baby Shacks'' Manocchio, the  
reputed boss of the New England mob, pleaded guilty Tuesday to 
receiving stolen property -- a dishwasher and refrigerator he gave 
to his elderly mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The 71-year-old dutiful son was placed on three years'  
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, John Cicilline, said Manocchio agreed to the plea  
bargain for his mother's sake. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a 90-year-old mother who reads the newspapers and  
watches TV,'' Cicilline said. ``He agreed to the plea in order to 
avoid that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manocchio could have gotten 10 years in prison if convicted of  
the original felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor William Ferland said it was a big win because the  
reputed mob boss now must watch his behavior or risk violating 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England mob has been greatly reduced over the years,  
resorting now to small-time operations such as theft rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Manocchio was one of 44 suspects arrested in 1996 in what police  
said was a mob-sanctioned burglary ring that pulled off more than 
900 heists in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and 
Connecticut between 1989 and 1996. The appliances were among $10 
million in goods stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was the first time Manocchio faced charges since 1985,  
when he was convicted of a 1968 gangland murder. The conviction was 
later overturned, but he served two years in prison for conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Manocchio became mob leader by default when  
others followed the boss Raymond J. ``Junior'' Patriarca to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He got his nickname because of a relative who was known as  
``Shacks'' for ``shacking up'' with many women.

<HEADLINE> Congress Returns; GOP Seeks Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During the winter, it was the impeachment  
trial of President Clinton. Now, the war in Yugoslavia threatens to 
drown out the Republican campaign for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans returning from Congress' spring break Monday  
were determined to highlight their tax relief agenda this week with 
Americans facing a midnight Thursday deadline for filing income tax 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``America also wants us to try and do the business of the  
country in a professional manner,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts of 
Oklahoma, the No. 4 House Republican leader. ``Part of that is 
doing what the American people want us to do, and part of that is 
cutting taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But numerous opinion polls indicate that the booming economy,  
coupled with several middle-class tax cuts that took effect in 
1998, has taken the steam out of public clamor for tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public is feeling pretty flush and successful,'' said  
Clint Stretch, director of tax policy at the Deloitte &AMP; Touche 
accounting firm. ``They don't identify tax cuts as a very high 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Republicans who control Congress believe this is  
the one week when most Americans are thinking about their taxes, 
and that deep down people want a big chunk of projected budget 
surpluses to go for tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it needs 290 votes and has no chance of passing, the  
House is scheduled to vote Thursday for the fifth year in a row on 
a proposed constitutional amendment that would require a two-thirds 
vote in Congress to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we do the vote on April 15th is that people's  
attention is focused on their taxes,'' said the main sponsor, Rep. 
Joe Barton, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have ironed out relatively minor differences between  
the House and Senate budget resolutions for fiscal 2000, which 
include $800 billion in unspecified tax cuts over the next decade. 
Votes on that compromise resolution, which sets overall spending 
and tax targets that are filled in later, are expected in the two 
houses as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the tax talk this week will come from Internal Revenue  
Service Commissioner Charles Rossotti, who testified Monday before 
the Senate Small Business Committee in the first of his four 
congressional hearings -- many of them looking at how the IRS is 
implementing sweeping agency reforms enacted last year and at the 
complexity of the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti told the small business panel that the IRS is committed  
to becoming a less belligerent, more service-oriented agency, but 
that it will take time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole objective is to make the whole thing work better for  
everybody,'' Rossotti said. ``We're making a lot of changes. We 
don't always get it right the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A parade of governors will appear before a House panel Wednesday  
and Thursday to describe how tax reform has worked in their states. 
</P>
<P>
	Several anti-tax rallies and events are also scheduled,  
including one planned for today by House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, R-Texas, in which a mock time capsule from 1964 was being 
opened to dramatize the bigger bite now taken by income taxes.

<HEADLINE> Forklift Philanthropist Keeps Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Matel ``Mat'' Dawson has worked for Ford Motor  
Co. for 59 years and could have retired long ago. But the 
78-year-old is still at it, driving a forklift, soaking up as much 
overtime as possible and pulling down around $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Just so he can give most of it away.  
</P>
<P>
	With a $200,000 donation to Wayne State University on Tuesday,  
Dawson has now donated more than $1 million to schools and 
charities since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get joy, happiness out of this,'' he said at a news  
conference, nattily dressed in a pinstriped suit with a pink 
boutonniere. ``I can go home and sleep good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson got as far as the seventh grade in Shreveport, La.,  
before coming to Detroit in 1940. He didn't become a philanthropist 
by winning a lawsuit, hitting the lottery or collecting an 
inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
	All he's done, he said, is work, work overtime, save and invest.  
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how much you make or how little you make, you've got  
to save a little of that,'' he said. ``I was raised like that, to 
help others. I have more than enough myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Dawson, who is divorced and has one daughter, ``more than  
enough'' doesn't include vacations -- he said making money is more 
enjoyable. He drives a 1985 Ford Escort and has a one-bedroom 
apartment in down-on-its-heels Highland Park, where Henry Ford 
built his Model T factory. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big house, a big car, that doesn't excite me,'' Dawson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dawson earns about $100,000 a year through his base salary of  
$23.47 an hour, plus overtime from working 12-hour days. He runs a 
forklift and is classified as a ``rigger'' -- a skilled tradesman 
available for a variety of jobs at the Rouge assembly complex in 
Dearborn. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, years after he could have retired, Dawson began giving  
his money away. The first recipient was the United Negro College 
Fund, which got $50,000 then and has received $180,000 more since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	He has given $200,000 to Louisiana State University at  
Shreveport; $112,000 to churches in Detroit and Louisiana; $20,000 
to the NAACP; and $10,000 to community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest beneficiary by far has been Wayne State, which with  
Tuesday's gift has received $431,500. The latest gift, like a 
$200,000 Dawson donation in 1996, will go toward scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson ``stands as an example to all others who thought they  
didn't have enough to give,'' Wayne State President Irvin Reid 
said. Turning to Dawson, Reid said, ``Your money is very important 
to us, but your example is even more important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson said he will remain at Ford and continue his blue-collar  
philanthropy as long as he stays healthy. Next year he plans to set 
up a $100,000 scholarship fund in Shreveport in honor of his 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't say I want to give it all away,'' Dawson said. ``But  
I'll give the bulk of it away.''

<HEADLINE> Cisco Buys GeoTel in Stock Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOWELL, Mass. (AP) -- Cisco Systems Inc., a leading maker of  
computer networking equipment, agreed today to buy 
telecommunications software maker GeoTel Communications Corp. in a 
$2 billion stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoTel's software helps send telephone calls from customers who  
are on hold to available operators, and is used mainly by financial 
and software support firms. Cisco plans to use GeoTel software to 
sell businesses a single system for transmitting data, voice and 
video that is based on Internet standards, an efficient 
transmission method. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco stock slipped on the news, dropping 31 1/4 cents to $117.43 3/4  
in midday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. GeoTel stock soared 
31 percent to $57.93 3/4 a share, a gain of $13.68 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., had revenues of about $8.5  
billion and profits of $1.3 billion last year. GeoTel, based in 
Lowell, had revenues of $45 million and profits of $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Cisco will exchange 0.5138 share of Cisco  
common stock for each share of GeoTel.

<HEADLINE> Sen. McCain Will Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who postponed the  
formal announcement of his bid for the presidency because of the 
conflict in Kosovo, said Tuesday he doesn't want to leave any room 
for doubt: He is a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``While now is not the time for the celebratory tour I had  
planned, I am a candidate for president and I will formally kick 
off my campaign at a more appropriate time,'' the Republican 
lawmaker said in a statement issued by his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has repeatedly said he is seeking the presidency and is  
actively campaigning but is still occasionally asked whether he is 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Tuesday at the Center for Strategic and  
International Studies, McCain stuck to the Kosovo crisis and did 
not mention his candidacy. He said NATO should ``commence today to 
mobilize infantry and armored divisions for a possible ground war 
in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Congress and the Clinton administration should show  
``the resolve of a superpower'' and do what is necessary to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``The costs of failure are infinitely greater than the price of  
victory,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who has chastised President Clinton for ruling out the  
possibility of ground troops in Kosovo, said in the campaign 
statement, ``As president, I hope to restore to the White House the 
kind of leadership Americans expect in crises like this one and to 
reform our institutions of government to make us proud again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a campaign procedural shift, former Sen. Warren Rudman,  
R-N.H., and Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., co-chairmen of the McCain for 
President Exploratory Committee, announced the formation of a new 
presidential campaign committee called McCain 2000.

<HEADLINE> Retirement, Disability Cost $507B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal spending neared $1.5 trillion last  
year, with the cost of retirement and disability benefits topping 
the half-trillion-dollar mark for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Total federal spending in fiscal year 1998 for domestic  
benefits, subsidies, grants, goods and services and salaries and 
wages totaled $1.48 trillion, the Census Bureau said in two reports 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
	That was up from $1.43 trillion a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	The spending included $507.2 billion for disability and  
retirement benefits, up from $489 billion the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Of this, Social Security totaled $403 billion in 1998, a 3.9  
percent increase over 1997's total. 
</P>
<P>
	Other direct payments reached $328 billion in 1998, down from  
$331 billion; followed by grants, $269 billion, up from $253 
billion; procurement contracts, $209 billion, up from $193 billion; 
and federal government salaries and wages, $170 billion, up from 
$166 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the reports, California received more federal money  
than any other state, $162 billion, followed by New York, $100 
billion; Texas, $92 billion; Florida, $84 billion; and 
Pennsylvania, $67 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Among localities, New York City led the list at $43.1 billion,  
followed by Los Angeles County, $41.9 billion, and Cook County, 
Ill., $24.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The government spent more money in either New York City or Los  
Angeles County than it did in 42 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Per capita federal spending topped $8,000 in two states:  
Virginia, $8,221, and Maryland, $8,094. Alaska, at $7,763, was 
third, followed by New Mexico, $7,446, and Hawaii, $7,076. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Department domestic spending, which includes payroll,  
defense contracts and grants and military pensions, totaled $226 
billion in 1998, a 3.8 percent increase over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The top five states in Pentagon spending in 1998 were  
California, $29 billion; Virginia, $23 billion; Texas, $16 billion; 
Florida, $12 billion; and Maryland, $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports -- Consolidated Federal Funds Report, Fiscal Year  
1998, State and County Areas and Federal Aid to States for Fiscal 
Year 1998 -- cover most domestic spending by the federal government 
except for interest on the federal debt.

<HEADLINE> World Team Beats U.S. Despite Kwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- The World team, led by a strong group of  
Russians, defeated the United States squad 14-13 in the Hershey's 
Kisses Pro-Am figure skating event Tuesday night, despite two 
perfect marks for Michelle Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, who defeated Russia's Maria Butyrskaya in the final  
matchup of the team competition, received her 6.0s for 
presentation. She easily won against Butyrskaya -- who unseated Kwan 
as world champion last month -- but the American team was too far 
behind for Kwan's victory to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely felt good about my performance. Knowing that you  
have to skate against the world's best, you have to skate well,'' 
said Kwan, who skated to a new program. She performed to Richard 
Marx's song ``One More Time'' from the film ``Message in a 
Bottle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This program was only set up a week and a half ago and I just  
kind of pulled it together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the competition, American Sarah Hughes, 13, defeated  
two-time Olympic champion Katarina Witt of Germany. Hughes wasn't 
born when Witt won her first gold medal, at the 1984 Sarajevo 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would be fun,'' Witt said of scheduling herself  
to face Hughes. Witt and Kristi Yamaguchi, as team captains, 
determined the skating order. ``She is the youngest and I am the 
oldest, so why not?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian winners included Olympic gold medalists Oksana  
Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev in pairs over Danielle and Steve 
Hartsell; world champions Alexei Yagudin (over U.S. champ Michael 
Weiss in men's singles), and Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton 
Sikharulidze (in pairs over Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman; and Maia 
Usova and Yevgeny Platov, who beat five-time U.S. champions 
Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow in ice dancing. 
</P>
<P>
	A near-sellout crowd of 4,107 also saw victories by Canada's  
Elvis Stojko over Rudy Galindo; five-time American champ Todd 
Eldredge over Viktor Petrenko; and 1992 Olympic gold medalist 
Yamaguchi against Yuka Sato of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we wanted to win,'' Yamaguchi said, ``but I think it  
was nice to have that team atmosphere and it made it fun for all of 
us.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Hits New York City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There was the joke about nuclear weapons -- and  
how exactly President Clinton knew how many China had. There was 
the wisecrack about campaign contributions and the reference to 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan as ``my old friend.'' And 
there was even -- get this -- a lawyer joke. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji visited New York City on Tuesday to  
talk trade. In the process, though, he also maintained what many 
say is a more collegial and open style that includes off-the-cuff 
remarks and humor that belies the tough image so important to China 
as it negotiates for membership in the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider his quip about Hong Kong newspapers, which he says have  
described economic concessions he has made in trade talks as ``a 
gift'' to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Could you please not put it that way? It might be  
construed as a political contribution,' '' Zhu said, deadpan. China 
has faced accusations in recent months that it tried to channel 
money to the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His apparent softer image notwithstanding -- even Zhu  
acknowledged in a speech to business leaders that he possesses a 
fiery temper -- the premier reiterated his confidence in his 
country's eventual WTO membership Tuesday. He characterized his 
U.S. visit as a crucial step toward opening Chinese markets to more 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Pronouncing himself undeterred by bumps in trade negotiations  
last week, he said both his government's willingness to bargain and 
Americans' affection for China will ensure an eventual resolution 
that benefits both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good relations are in the best interests of the whole world,''  
Zhu said in a dinner speech Tuesday night to the U.S.-China 
Business Council and The Economic Club of New York. ``Sometimes 
it's a bumpy relationship. But in the broad history of China-U.S. 
relations, these are small matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. and Chinese governments agreed to  
``move intensively'' toward resolving sticking points in the trade 
agreement that would lead to WTO membership for China. They 
scheduled additional negotiations for later this month, and both 
sides predicted an agreement by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar talks faltered last week, and Zhu has vowed during his  
visit that China would open ``wider and wider to the outside 
world'' after it joins the WTO. Membership in the WTO, which 
regulates world trade, would give China a say in global trade rules 
and help open the country to foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	China, whose doctrinaire communism kept its markets tightly  
state-controlled until the early 1980s, has been embracing 
capitalism guardedly while simultaneously trying to retain 
government control over its economy. It now has its own stock 
markets, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, which 
operates the Nasdaq stock market, announced Tuesday it would open 
an office in Shanghai by mid-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's nine-day, six-city visit comes at a time when tensions  
between China and the United States are high on other fronts as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, in addition to continual criticism of China's  
human-rights record and the campaign-finance charges, U.S. 
officials have accused Beijing of spying. Zhu said he doubted the 
espionage charges and had asked President Jiang Zemin and military 
leaders about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they knew nothing about this,'' he told CNN in an  
interview Tuesday afternoon. ``If you want to investigate, we will 
be willing to assist it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China has long denounced human-rights criticism as meddling in  
its internal affairs, but some of Zhu's comments Tuesday indicated 
a willingness to listen. He said improving rule of law is a 
pressing need in China, and insisted the leadership is committed to 
improving human rights -- in a way that best suits China. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not afraid of democracy. We are not afraid of rule of  
law. We are not against human rights,'' he said. ``China's senior 
leaders, when we were young, we were fighting for human rights and 
democracy and rule of law. How could we be against such things?''

<HEADLINE>  Judge Sentences Kevorkian to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian's crusade for assisted  
suicide began nine years ago in the back of his rusted Volkswagen 
van. There, an Alzheimer's patient from Oregon pushed a button on 
the retired pathologist's ``suicide machine'' and lethal drugs 
flowed into her veins. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian has skirted the law and taunted its enforcers ever  
since, helping 130 people take their own lives He left bodies in 
the middle of the night at motels, others at hospital emergency 
rooms. He burned state orders against him, showed up at court in 
costume and challenged authorities to do something about it. On 
Tuesday, they finally did. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had the audacity to go on national television, show the  
world what you did and dare the legal system to stop you,'' said 
Judge Jessica Cooper. ``Well, sir, consider yourself stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper sentenced the Kevorkian to 10 to 25 years in prison for  
the second-degree murder of Thomas Youk, a Lou Gehrig's patient 
whom Kevorkian videotaped as he injected him with a lethal cocktail 
of chemicals on Sept. 17. The videotape was later broadcast on 
CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband had come to the end of his life as he chose to,''  
Melody Youk said as she pleaded for a lenient sentence. ``He was 
not depressed. He was not a victim. He requested Dr. Kevorkian's 
help and was grateful for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper also sentenced Kevorkian to three to seven years for  
delivery of a controlled substance. The sentences will run 
concurrently, and Kevorkian will be eligible for parole after six 
years and eight months, a prosecutor said. Kevorkian, who turns 71 
next month, could have gotten life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's supporters said the sentence would intensify the  
debate over euthanasia and assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to spark more debate and discussion on the  
end of life issue,'' said Nicholle McClelland, spokeswoman for the 
Oregon-based Hemlock Society. ``This was not murder, this was a 
very compassionate act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McClelland said laws against assisted suicide should be on  
trial, not Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another example ... that the law needs to change to  
allow for physician-assisted dying,'' she said. ``Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian is one of those responsible for making the movement so 
strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said the sentence was long overdue. Members of Not  
Dead Yet, a disabled rights group, celebrated the end of what one 
called Kevorkian's ``killing spree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack Kevorkian has been killing members of the disabled  
community for years and has been getting away with it,'' said Cal 
Montgomery. ``I hope this is the end of the euthanasia movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Archdiocese of Detroit issued a statement, saying  
Kevorkian's ```final solution' approach to pain management has been 
an unconscionable exploitation of the natural ambivalence to death 
and suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence, said archdiocese spokesman Ned McGrath, leaves  
``no doubt that society will neither authorize physicians to kill 
nor look the other way if they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Judge Cooper offered her take on the impact of the  
sentence, telling Kevorkian the debate over assisted suicide will 
continue ``long after this trial and your activities fade from 
public memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Youk, 52, was confined to a  
wheelchair, had a feeding tube installed in his stomach and was 
afraid of choking on his own saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical examiners considered the death suspicious. But they had  
little to go on -- until Kevorkian sent the videotape to ``60 
Minutes.'' The tape and the show's interview with Kevorkian were 
the prosecution's main evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first murder trial for Kevorkian, who says he has  
been involved in 130 deaths since 1990, and the first time he was 
found guilty of taking part in a death. His previous trials, all on 
assisted-suicide charges, resulted in three acquittals and a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	In past cases, Kevorkian said his patients used his homemade  
devices to start the flow of carbon monoxide or intravenous 
chemicals that caused their death. In Youk's case, Kevorkian 
administered the injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's brash legal bulldog for much of the  
past nine years, refused to defend him, claiming Kevorkian had 
turned a corner to self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian insisted on representing himself at his short trial,  
where he gave an impassioned but ineffective defense interrupted 
often by prosecutors' objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly now, do you see a criminal? Do you see a murderer?''  
Kevorkian asked the jury. ``If you do, then you must convict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was taken to the state prison at Jackson, where  
officials will evaluate him and determine whether to send him to a 
minimum-, medium- or maximum-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ``60 Minutes'' interview, Kevorkian threatened a hunger  
strike if sent to prison, a claim he has not repeated. If he does 
start a hunger strike, prison policy calls for forced feeding. He 
has staged two hunger strikes in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth predicted the conviction  
will be reversed on appeal.

	``I think as far as he's concerned he thinks that what he did

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky Speculation Starting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY KEN RAPPOPORT   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Wayne Gretzky plays his final game of the  
season for the New York Rangers on Sunday, it's likely fans at 
Madison Square Garden will give him a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't even have to score a goal, or make one of his  
brilliant, highlight-reel passes to deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans, unsure whether Gretzky will be returning for another  
year, should be giving the Great One his due for what he has 
accomplished over an unparalleled hockey career. 
</P>
<P>
	With the end of the season in sight, speculation is already  
starting about Gretzky's future in hockey. The 38-year-old Gretzky 
is in the last year of a contract and has said he would make a 
decision about his future sometime after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out soon enough,'' said Rangers coach John Muckler  
following Monday night's 2-1 victory over Tampa Bay. ``Everybody is 
speculating, but only one person knows for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Monday night's game, Gretzky denied a television report  
that his retirement was imminent. However, after the game, he said: 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to think about it. ... all of a sudden it's become a  
bigger issue than I imagined. Let's see what happens over the next 
five or six days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans at Madison Square Garden held up signs with slogans such as  
``Wayne Don't Go.'' Gretzky said the fan reaction made it difficult 
to consider retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said it a hundred times that I've been here over the three  
years,'' Gretzky said. ``This is the greatest city to be an athlete 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers broadcaster John Davidson raised the issue of Gretzky's  
retirement on Sunday while broadcasting the Detroit-Pittsburgh game 
on Fox TV. ``The people very close to Wayne ... and I mean very 
close, feel there's a very strong possibility Sunday (when the 
Rangers host Pittsburgh) will be the last time he plays,'' Davidson 
said in part. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as one old friend is concerned, the answer won't come  
easily, and certainly won't come soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing Wayne, he would weigh everything and talk to a lot of  
people before making that decision,'' said Bruce MacGregor, 
assistant general manager of the Edmonton Oilers. ``It's a very 
hard decision. When you retire, it's for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Tuele, another member of the Oilers' organization who also  
is a longtime friend of Gretzky, wasn't so sure he would retire 
after this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say this. Wayne has not shared any final decision with  
anyone,'' Tuele, the Oilers' vice president and public relations 
head, said in a telephone interview. ``Wayne's dad doesn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a February game in Calgary, Gretzky admitted it was his  
last game there because he knew the Rangers weren't visiting the 
Flames next season. He received an emotional response that night 
from the Calgary fans, and has received similar tributes in other 
arenas as the season drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been a typical season for Gretzky, who missed 11 games  
at one point with a neck injury. He had played in 223 straight 
games since signing with the Rangers as a free agent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was the second in Gretzky's career involving a disc.  
In 1992-93, he missed most of the season with a lower back injury 
before coming back to lead the Los Angeles Kings to the Stanley Cup 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no playoffs for the Rangers this season, however.  
They missed for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a frustrating year for him ... the way the club has  
played and the (neck injury). Those kind of injuries bother you a 
lot,'' MacGregor said in a telephone interview from Edmonton. 
``Maybe there's some speculation that he's not 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect (Gretzky's retirement) would have to do more with  
this than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998-99 season has included at least one important milestone  
for the NHL's leading career scorer. His ninth goal of the year 
gave him 1,072 as a professional, moving him past boyhood hero 
Gordie Howe.

<HEADLINE>  Judge Sentences Kevorkian to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian's crusade for assisted  
suicide began nine years ago in the back of his rusted Volkswagen 
van. There, an Alzheimer's patient from Oregon pushed a button on 
the retired pathologist's ``suicide machine'' and lethal drugs 
flowed into her veins. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian has skirted the law and taunted its enforcers ever  
since, helping 130 people take their own lives He left bodies in 
the middle of the night at motels, others at hospital emergency 
rooms. He burned state orders against him, showed up at court in 
costume and challenged authorities to do something about it. On 
Tuesday, they finally did. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had the audacity to go on national television, show the  
world what you did and dare the legal system to stop you,'' said 
Judge Jessica Cooper. ``Well, sir, consider yourself stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper sentenced the Kevorkian to 10 to 25 years in prison for  
the second-degree murder of Thomas Youk, a Lou Gehrig's patient 
whom Kevorkian videotaped as he injected him with a lethal cocktail 
of chemicals on Sept. 17. The videotape was later broadcast on 
CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband had come to the end of his life as he chose to,''  
Melody Youk said as she pleaded for a lenient sentence. ``He was 
not depressed. He was not a victim. He requested Dr. Kevorkian's 
help and was grateful for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper also sentenced Kevorkian to three to seven years for  
delivery of a controlled substance. The sentences will run 
concurrently, and Kevorkian will be eligible for parole after six 
years and eight months, a prosecutor said. Kevorkian, who turns 71 
next month, could have gotten life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's supporters said the sentence would intensify the  
debate over euthanasia and assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to spark more debate and discussion on the  
end of life issue,'' said Nicholle McClelland, spokeswoman for the 
Oregon-based Hemlock Society. ``This was not murder, this was a 
very compassionate act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McClelland said laws against assisted suicide should be on  
trial, not Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another example ... that the law needs to change to  
allow for physician-assisted dying,'' she said. ``Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian is one of those responsible for making the movement so 
strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said the sentence was long overdue. Members of Not  
Dead Yet, a disabled rights group, celebrated the end of what one 
called Kevorkian's ``killing spree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack Kevorkian has been killing members of the disabled  
community for years and has been getting away with it,'' said Cal 
Montgomery. ``I hope this is the end of the euthanasia movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Archdiocese of Detroit issued a statement, saying  
Kevorkian's ```final solution' approach to pain management has been 
an unconscionable exploitation of the natural ambivalence to death 
and suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence, said archdiocese spokesman Ned McGrath, leaves  
``no doubt that society will neither authorize physicians to kill 
nor look the other way if they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Judge Cooper offered her take on the impact of the  
sentence, telling Kevorkian the debate over assisted suicide will 
continue ``long after this trial and your activities fade from 
public memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Youk, 52, was confined to a  
wheelchair, had a feeding tube installed in his stomach and was 
afraid of choking on his own saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical examiners considered the death suspicious. But they had  
little to go on -- until Kevorkian sent the videotape to ``60 
Minutes.'' The tape and the show's interview with Kevorkian were 
the prosecution's main evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first murder trial for Kevorkian, who says he has  
been involved in 130 deaths since 1990, and the first time he was 
found guilty of taking part in a death. His previous trials, all on 
assisted-suicide charges, resulted in three acquittals and a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	In past cases, Kevorkian said his patients used his homemade  
devices to start the flow of carbon monoxide or intravenous 
chemicals that caused their death. In Youk's case, Kevorkian 
administered the injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's brash legal bulldog for much of the  
past nine years, refused to defend him, claiming Kevorkian had 
turned a corner to self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian insisted on representing himself at his short trial,  
where he gave an impassioned but ineffective defense interrupted 
often by prosecutors' objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly now, do you see a criminal? Do you see a murderer?''  
Kevorkian asked the jury. ``If you do, then you must convict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was taken to the state prison at Jackson, where  
officials will evaluate him and determine whether to send him to a 
minimum-, medium- or maximum-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ``60 Minutes'' interview, Kevorkian threatened a hunger  
strike if sent to prison, a claim he has not repeated. If he does 
start a hunger strike, prison policy calls for forced feeding. He 
has staged two hunger strikes in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth predicted the conviction  
will be reversed on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think as far as he's concerned he thinks that what he did  
was proper,'' he said. ``He knew the risks, and in order to move 
the process he took the risks.''

<HEADLINE> Leukemia Claims BoxCar Willie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- He adopted a hobo persona and won a national  
following as he sang of life on the road. But BoxCar Willie found a 
home in Branson, where he died after a long battle with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old singer died Monday evening, surrounded by his  
wife, two daughters, two sisters and close friends, said Chisai 
Childs, a family spokeswoman and friend of 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
	BoxCar Willie was diagnosed with leukemia three years ago. After  
a brief remission, the disease returned last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Family friend Dick Ringler, who was with the entertainer when he  
died, said BoxCar Willie knew he was losing the battle since being 
hospitalized for two weeks in February, but never mentioned it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me how tired he was, and I had to help him get out of  
his chair, which embarrassed him,'' Ringler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until his health began to fail, he had performed as many as six  
shows a week at the BoxCar Willie Theatre in this Ozark mountain 
town that is home to dozens of music theaters and scores of 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was more than one of Branson's most famous performers. He  
was also one of its most beloved. As a member of the Taney County 
Child Welfare Board he raised thousands of dollars for needy 
children, Ms. Childs said, as well as $40,000 a year for police 
programs to fight crime and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``BoxCar Willie is a friend to many of us and a good citizen of  
Branson,'' Mayor Lou Schaefer said, breaking down as he announced 
the entertainer's death during a Board of Alderman meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Lecil Martin in Sterrett, Texas, in 1931, BoxCar Willie was  
the son of a railroad man who used to play his fiddle on the porch 
while his son played guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	By his teens he was performing in jamborees all over the state,  
but gave up show business to enlist in the Air Force. He spent 22 
years there, logging some 10,000 hours as a flier. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from the service he returned to performing, and  
by the 1970s had developed the singing hobo persona, complete with 
overalls, a battered old hat, worn suit jacket and two days growth 
of beard. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he took the BoxCar Willie look and name after seeing a  
freight train pass him by one day in Lincoln, Neb., as he was stuck 
in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``And there was an old boy sitting on a boxcar, dressed the way  
I dress today, and he looked just like a buddy of mine named Willie 
Wilson,'' he told The Associated Press in 1997. ``I said, `There's 
Willie in a boxcar,' and that's where it came from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was devoted to singing and promoting old-fashioned country  
music, including the sorrowful train songs for which he was best 
known. He never had a hit single, but his albums sold well and he 
built a loyal following that made him one of the most popular 
performers in Branson, where he operated a motel and train museum 
as well as his theater. 
</P>
<P>
	While Roy Clark became the first nationally known entertainer to  
put his name on a Branson theater in 1983, BoxCar Willie, who 
arrived three years later, liked to boast that he was the first big 
name to live and work there year-round. 
</P>
<P>
	He counseled newly arrived performers on what worked and what  
didn't in a conservative, heartland town visited by millions of 
tourists each year. He fumed from time to time about performers who 
left Branson, saying it wouldn't last. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been about 30, 35 artists that came into this town and  
then left since I've been here,'' he said in 1996. ``They don't pay 
their taxes here, they don't vote here. Doggone it, it just kind of 
bothers me. So when somebody says they're leaving, I don't get all 
teary-eyed and panicky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor has ordered flags throughout this tourist town of  
3,700 flown at half-staff until the funeral, which Ms. Childs said 
would be Saturday or Sunday.

<HEADLINE> New Barclays Chief Executive Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Michael O'Neill, the new American chief executive  
of Barclays Bank PLC, has quit because of heart problems, the bank 
announced Tuesday, a day after he was due to start work. 
</P>
<P>
	Barclays shares dropped 93 cents (58 pence), or 3.1 percent, to  
$29 on the news, the latest blow to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Barclays said 1998 operating profits plunged nearly  
20 percent to 1.99 billion pounds, partly as a result of exposure 
in emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment of O'Neill, 52, formerly responsible for  
investments at the Bank of America in San Francisco, was announced 
two months ago. It followed the shock resignation of Martin Taylor, 
the British former chief executive, who quit Nov. 27, reportedly 
over a boardroom disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Peter Middleton, the bank's chairman-designate, will act as  
Group Chief Executive until a replacement is found. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who would have made $3 million a year at Barclays, will  
get no payoff, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an announcement to the Stock Exchange, the bank said O'Neill  
passed a medical examination before being appointed, but was 
diagnosed with an irregular heart beat after a recent bout of 
influenza. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply disappointed to give up what was for me a dream  
appointment and the culmination of my whole career,'' O'Neill said 
in a statement. He was returning immediately to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday would have been O'Neill's first day in the job in London.  
</P>
<P>
	Middleton said the bank was searching for a replacement and  
predicted it would take less time to replace O'Neill than it had 
taken to fill the post after Taylor quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done a lot of research and seen a lot of people,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake, USOC Differ on Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake and U.S. Olympic officials are  
supposed to work together when it comes to fund raising, but lately 
there have been some disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the two groups have a chance to iron out  
their differences today at a Salt Lake Organizing Committee 
financial meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, SLOC's new head, has been identifying contingency  
cuts in the committee's $1.45 billion budget should revenues fall 
short, and he also has expressed concerns about the optimistic 
goals set in the two groups' joint marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's contingency cuts include $5 million to allow U.S.  
athletes training access at the Utah venues before the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said Monday that the SLOC does not plan to contribute for  
the USOC's $9 million project to restore public trust in the wake 
of the Salt Lake bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	While Romney has ruled out a cash donation, he said he is still  
considering whether the SLOC can afford to give $1 million in goods 
and services. He said he informed USOC officials of his decision 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're behind in fund-raising, and everything can't be laid at  
Salt Lake's feet to solve,'' Romney said. ``Our view is their role 
is to raise the money. They need to take any and all action 
necessary to do that. If there's some costs, that's something they 
should bear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Salt Lake does have a responsibility to participate with the  
(USOC) in conveying to sponsors and the nation as a whole ... that 
we've worked very hard to try and put this scandal behind us,'' 
USOC Secretary General John Krimsky told the Salt Lake Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that within the state of Utah much of this scandal  
has been effectively closed and concluded and people are moving 
on,'' he said. ``But that's not quite true in the rest of the 
United States. We cannot sit quietly and wait for the press to die 
down, and then expect the sponsors to come flooding back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign was announced Saturday by executive director Dick  
Schultz at the USOC meeting in New Orleans, the first since the 
Salt Lake scandal broke late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigations revealed that Salt Lake Olympic boosters gave  
more than $1 million in cash, scholarships, shopping sprees and 
free medical care to International Olympic Committee members who 
then voted on the city's bid to host the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the new program, to be launched on a national  
Olympic Day on June 23, would be aimed at restoring ``a trust 
between the people of the world and the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC Chairman Bob Garff had called the campaign a worthwhile  
investment for the organizing committee because it would help 
fund-raising for the Salt Lake games. But Romney called Garff's 
support a ``miscommunication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC-SLOC joint marketing venture , called the Olympic  
Properties of the United States -- OPUS -- has a goal of raising $859 
million in sponsorship cash, goods and services. About $300 million 
still remain to be raised. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pol Pot Remembered With Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANLONG VENG, Cambodia (AP) -- A year after Khmer Rouge leader Pol  
Pot's death, his legacy is treated with contempt by residents of 
his former jungle headquarters, many of whom were once the 
guerrilla leader's followers. 
</P>
<P>
	Boards from Pol Pot's former house have been used to build a  
karaoke bar that serves up liquor and popular Thai and Cambodian 
music -- activities his Khmer Rouge regime labeled decadent and 
punishable by death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the wood from his house to build this place,'' said Euv  
Vanthan, 50, a former government army officer. ``I want to show the 
former enemy how to live in peacetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cambodia is enjoying the most peaceful period it has known since  
the late 1960s, when the country was dragged into the Vietnam War. 
The Maoist-inspired Khmer Rouge defeated a pro-U.S. regime in 1975, 
emptying cities at gunpoint and turning Cambodia into a vast labor 
camp. Money was abolished. Monks, doctors, teachers and other 
educated people were put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 2 million people died of overwork, disease and  
systematic execution before an invading Vietnamese army toppled the 
Khmer Rouge in 1979. But the Khmer Rouge stubbornly fought from the 
jungles until key leaders started laying down arms in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Pol Pot died of a purported heart attack a year ago Thursday, in  
a shack 10 miles from Anlong Veng, where he had been kept under 
loose house arrest after being ousted by hard-liners loyal to Khmer 
Rouge army commander Ta Mok. 
</P>
<P>
	His body was placed atop old tires with his rattan chair and  
other belongings and unceremoniously cremated. His widow, Mea Som, 
remarried a former Khmer Rouge official. 
</P>
<P>
	Ta Mok, known as ``The Butcher,'' was captured last month and is  
the only Khmer Rouge guerrilla in detention, awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Other former guerrillas are living in the gem-rich town of  
Pailin under de facto pardons in exchange for making peace, fueling 
fears that most of Pol Pot's henchmen will never be brought to 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In Anlong Veng, former guerrillas pass their time aiming down  
pool cues, not guns. Residents can reach the outside world via two 
telephone booths. Owning a television set, a capital crime under 
Khmer Rouge rule, is now common. 
</P>
<P>
	Yim San, a former Khmer Rouge division commander recently  
appointed district leader, drives on the dirt roads in a new Toyota 
Camry. 
</P>
<P>
	His deputy has commissioned two Vietnamese carpenters to make  
furniture for his house. In the old days, the Khmer Rouge 
considered Vietnam their No. 1 enemy and murdered ethnic Vietnamese 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Huy Sophat, 32, a former guerrilla medic, recently found his  
younger brother. They were separated in different parts of the 
country by 20 years of war and did not initially recognize each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We compared our lives, and I was regretful for the years I  
spent in the Khmer Rouge,'' Sophat said. ``We had no choice. If I 
ran away alone from Ta Mok, my wife and kids would have been killed 
as a punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Pol Pot's cremation site, Chhorn Ny, 36, a government soldier  
assigned to look after the area, rummages with a stick through what 
remains of one of the century's bloodiest tyrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of you, lots of people died,'' he mumbles with scorn.  
They included nine of his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	No ceremonies marking the anniversary of Pol Pot's death were  
planned in Cambodia. The nation is instead celebrating the Buddhist 
New Year on Thursday, one of its most festive occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not expect anyone to come to celebrate the one-year  
anniversary of Pol Pot's death,'' Chhorn Ny said. ``No one wants to 
remember what happened.''

<HEADLINE> Pearl Arts Owner Faces Tax Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The owner of an art-supply chain  
with stores in six states has been indicted on charges of skimming 
millions of dollars used to build one of the most opulent homes in 
south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Perlmutter was charged Tuesday with filing false income  
tax returns between 1992 and 1995. He allegedly took up to $10,000 
a day of unreported income out of his stores. 
</P>
<P>
	A manager at Pearl's headquarters in Fort Lauderdale said there  
would be no comment from Perlmutter. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged skimming began in 1983 and netted Perlmutter $1.2  
million tax-free each year, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators started looking into Perlmutter three  
years ago after a package sent to him from a store manager 
implicated in the scheme broke open during delivery, spilling 
$25,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlmutter and the manager of the East Meadow, N.Y., store,  
Allan Jacobowitz, were charged with conspiring to impede the 
collection and assessment of federal income and employment taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum sentence for the charges is 17 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Perlmutter allegedly used the money to build one of the largest  
houses in Broward County, a 22,000-square-foot mansion with 19 
bathrooms and 12 bedrooms in suburban Weston. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearl Arts and Crafts operates several stores in Florida, New  
York and New Jersey and has outlets in Chicago, Houston, Atlanta 
and in the Washington, D.C., area.

<HEADLINE> China Expects 7 Million Jobs Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Seven million Chinese workers will lose their  
jobs in state factories as China pushes ahead with reforms of the 
debt-ridden government-run industrial sector, a Chinese newspaper 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Minister of Labor and Social Security Wang Jianlun said the  
government would limit layoffs to 7 million, or 1 million people 
fewer than last year, the China Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to reform its state factories, China needs to lay off  
even more workers. Government leaders, however, have warned the 
layoffs must be restricted to prevent unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The government expects to spend 24.5 billion yuan ($3 billion)  
to retrain and provide stipends for laid-off workers this year, 
Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers who lose jobs in China's state-owned factories get  
monthly allowances of 140 yuan to 380 yuan ($17 to $46) when they 
enroll at training centers, the report said. The allowances are 
paid by the government, an unemployment insurance fund and the 
state factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang acknowledged that some of the troubled factories had been  
failing to pay pensions. He said the government would ensure at 
least 50 percent of the pensions owed would be paid by the end of 
the year.

<HEADLINE>  Dolphins' Martin Faces Drug Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- New Miami Dolphins receiver Tony Martin stood  
at a podium and showed his best moves, deftly sidestepping concerns 
that legal trouble could curtail his 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt in my mind I'll be ready to go Sept. 13 in the  
opening game, where we need to kill the Broncos,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins introduced their controversial newcomer at a news  
conference Monday. Smiling and joking, Martin sounded cocky and 
carefree, despite a pending trial on federal charges of laundering 
drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in myself and I believe in the Lord,'' said Martin,  
33. ``He's not going to let anything happen to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A trial scheduled to begin Aug. 2 in Miami will determine  
whether Martin is able to play this season for the Dolphins, who 
signed him Friday to a four-year, $14.2 million contract. He'll 
receive only $100,000 if he's unavailable to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege that Martin wrote checks to lease luxury cars  
and pay legal fees for Rickey Brownlee, who served seven years in 
prison for 1980s drug convictions. Martin has said he's innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	After being indicted in February, Martin was released by the NFC  
champion Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed in a way, because I didn't understand  
why,'' he said. ``But I was happy because it gave me a chance to 
test the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Jimmy Johnson didn't attend the news conference but  
issued a statement supporting Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an outstanding player, and I've always been impressed  
with him personally,'' Johnson said. ``There's no question he 
answers a need and strengthens our receiving corps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins are counting on Martin to provide the deep threat  
they've been missing for several seasons. His average of 15.3 yards 
per catch ranks fifth among active receivers with at least 400 
receptions. Miami's O.J. McDuffie led the NFL last year with 90 
catches, but averaged only 11.7 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins figure the threat of Dan Marino throwing long to  
Martin will loosen defenses and help their dismal running game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to fulfill the need the Dolphins have,'' Martin  
said. ``I'm going to stretch the defense, and I'm going to make the 
big plays. That's why I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Miami native and a converted small-college quarterback, Martin  
also played for the Dolphins from 1990 to 1993, but averaged just 
27 catches and two touchdowns per season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was young and I didn't know what to expect,'' he said. ``I  
was a slow starter and I didn't pick up the system well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami traded him for a fourth-round draft pick to San Diego,  
where he blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin enjoyed one of his best seasons in 1998 for Atlanta,  
making 66 catches for 1,181 yards and six touchdowns. The federal 
investigation that led to the indictment didn't seem to affect his 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've got a profession, you can't let things distract  
you,'' he said. ``My job is to go out there and catch passes on 
Sunday, no matter what is going on around me.''

<HEADLINE>  Transplant Patient at Phillies Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After hurling the first pitch at the  
Philadelphia Phillies home opener with a left hand he didn't have 
11 weeks ago, Matthew Scott smiled and pumped his hands in the air 
like he had just won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the 25-foot throw was high and outside, and soft enough  
that Mark McGwire would have had no trouble slugging it into the 
upper deck for a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was perfect enough for Scott, who became the first person  
in the United States to receive a hand transplant during a 15-hour 
operation at Louisville Jewish Hospital in Kentucky on Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	With his 7-year-old son, Ian, looking on, Scott said afterward  
he was so nervous he was thankful he didn't throw the ball into the 
stands or bounce it past the Phillie who caught the pitch, reserve 
Rob Ducey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something that the whole world was seeing for the first  
time. I wanted the whole world to see that (the operation) works. 
To me it is unbelievable,'' a beaming Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott threw the ball with a protective glove he wears every day  
as part of his recovery process. He cannot detect texture, such as 
the seams of the baseball, with the new hand, but can feel the 
pressure he applies on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a thrill, an absolute thrill,'' the left-handed Scott  
said, donning a number 13 Phillies jersey and a bright red Phillies 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who had been using a prosthetic device since losing his  
hand in a 1985 fireworks accident, had said he wanted to play catch 
with his children after he recovered from the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials decided to give Scott the opportunity to throw  
out the first pitch after hearing about his surgery and learning 
the Absecon, N.J., man was a lifelong Phillies fan. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing for the game -- which the Phillies lost 8-6 to the  
Atlanta Braves -- became part of his physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of had to start from the beginning,'' said Scott, 37.  
``Every day for about 20 minutes to a half-hour a day, we practiced 
the motion of throwing and then the hand grip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott's ceremonial pitch capped a dizzying pregame opening day  
ceremony for the Phillies. Scott received the ball after a man with 
a jet-propelled backpack rocketed to the upper level of the 
stadium, handed the ball to a man who used a hang glider to fly 
down to the field, who finally gave the ball to Scott's son. 
</P>
<P>
	After throwing the pitch, Scott raised both his hands in triumph  
and pointed to the stands. He was greeted by hugs and handshakes in 
the Phillies dugout from family and team members, including star 
pitcher Curt Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say Scott is progressing right on schedule and that his  
ability to throw a ball is another milestone in his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked hard for this,'' said physical therapist Ann  
Hodges, who traveled with Scott. ``He's progressing well and has 
been looking forward to this day for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an entourage of hospital officials from Louisville nearby,  
Scott said throwing the first pitch went a long way towards his 
goal of teaching Ian how to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the transplant, ``actually showing how to field a ground  
ball with two hands was more of an abstract discussion,'' he said. 
``Now that I have the ability to do that, it will probably be a lot 
easier now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Scott said he had no idea he would be at the point where  
he is now. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you asked me a couple weeks ago, I would have been just as  
happy scratching my upper palm with it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Jesse Ventura Under Microscope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- For those who say Gov. Jesse Ventura is  
off to a slow start in his much-vaunted overhaul of state 
government, the rookie Reform Party leader has a typically blunt 
response. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here 100 days; I have four years,'' Ventura said  
Monday. ``How can you expect me to perform miracles in 100 days?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura took office 100 days ago today. Since then, the former  
professional wrestler and mouthy talk-radio host has been in 
intensive on-the-job training. 
</P>
<P>
	He has offered few policy proposals other than a tax rebate  
plan, worth about $1.3 billion, and a modest income tax cut. With 
about five weeks left in the Legislature, the rebate has been hung 
up in committee and major budget bills haven't been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	While plenty of people have criticized Ventura, others say he  
has done just fine -- especially for someone whose political 
experience extended only to a four-year term as Brooklyn Park 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Schier, a political science professor at Carleton  
College, said the public is ``remarkably indulgent'' of Ventura 
because they know he's learning on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jesse is very much a work in progress,'' Schier said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has included members of all three major parties in his  
administration and received credit for the quality of his choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Minorities, however, criticized the governor for not including  
any blacks. And he blundered when it came to appointing Alan Horner 
as Department of Natural Resources commissioner. Horner lasted less 
than a week after it was discovered he had two tickets and a 
warning for fish-and-game violations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a state where many are passionate about the environment and  
wilderness pursuits, Horner stepped down after two top department 
officials resigned to protest his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor acknowledged his transition would have been easier  
if he had an experienced party infrastructure to draw on like the 
Republicans or the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, as the Democrats 
here are called. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Minnesotans enjoy their colorful governor, and he gets  
500 pieces of mail a week and rock-star receptions wherever he 
goes. 
</P>
<P>
	His approval rating remains high. Among likely voters questioned  
last week, 57 percent rated his performance ``excellent'' or 
``good,'' according to a Saint Paul Pioneer Press-Minnesota Public 
Radio poll published today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, that is down from the 69 percent ``good'' or  
``excellent'' rating Ventura received in December. The telephone 
survey of 628 registered voters had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The main criticism of Ventura is that he has squandered his  
popularity by not proposing more -- and bolder -- bills. Ventura 
likes to remind such naysayers that one of his goals is a less 
intrusive government. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ventura directed 70 percent of the new spending in his  
budget toward primary and secondary education, recommending an 
increase of about $561 million to bring spending to $7.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite some slash-and-burn campaign rhetoric about greedy  
government, Ventura's two-year budget proposal was more than the 
GOP-controlled House is likely to approve and about the same as 
what the DFL-controlled Senate wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We keep hearing that the big changes are coming in the next  
budget,'' said Sen. Linda Runbeck, R-Circle Pines, who says 
Ventura's tax cut proposal is too small for a governor who 
campaigned on a ``give-it-all-back'' approach to the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, she says, ``talks Republican, but walks Democrat.''  
</P>
<P>
	The harshest assessment of Ventura's first days came from David  
Schultz, president of the campaign finance watchdog group Common 
Cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways he's living up to everything he criticized,''  
Schultz said. ``He's maybe not a career politician, but he looks 
like somebody who's out for himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To which Ventura responded: ``He expects that in one election,  
I'm going to come in here like Moses and part the seas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Substad, 37, a Lutheran minister from Eagle Lake who  
attended Ventura's inauguration, likes what he's seen so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's kept it fun, kept it interesting,'' he said. ``It's not  
dull. It gives us a different perspective and it puts Minnesota on 
the map and that's OK.''

	A trial scheduled to begin Aug. 2 in Miami will determine  
whether Martin is able to play this season for the Dolphins, who 
signed him Friday to a four-year, $14.2 million contract. He'll 
receive only $100,000 if he's unavailable to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege that Martin wrote checks to lease luxury cars  
and pay legal fees for Rickey Brownlee, who served seven years in 
prison for 1980s drug convictions. Martin has said he's innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	After being indicted in February, Martin was released by the NFC  
champion Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed in a way, because I didn't understand  
why,'' he said. ``But I was happy because it gave me a chance to 
test the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Jimmy Johnson didn't attend the news conference but  
issued a statement supporting Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an outstanding player, and I've always been impressed  
with him personally,'' Johnson said. ``There's no question he 
answers a need and strengthens our receiving corps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins are counting on Martin to provide the deep threat  
they've been missing for several seasons. His average of 15.3 yards 
per catch ranks fifth among active receivers with at least 400 
receptions. Miami's O.J. McDuffie led the NFL last year with 90 
catches, but averaged only 11.7 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins figure the threat of Dan Marino throwing long to  
Martin will loosen defenses and help their dismal running game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to fulfill the need the Dolphins have,'' Martin  
said. ``I'm going to stretch the defense, and I'm going to make the 
big plays. That's why I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Miami native and a converted small-college quarterback, Martin  
also played for the Dolphins from 1990 to 1993, but averaged just 
27 catches and two touchdowns per season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was young and I didn't know what to expect,'' he said. ``I  
was a slow starter and I didn't pick up the system well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami traded him for a fourth-round draft pick to San Diego,  
where he blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin enjoyed one of his best seasons in 1998 for Atlanta,  
making 66 catches for 1,181 yards and six touchdowns. The federal 
investigation that led to the indictment didn't seem to affect his 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've got a profession, you can't let things distract  
you,'' he said. ``My job is to go out there and catch passes on 
Sunday, no matter what is going on around me.''

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Stress-Illness Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Underscoring the connection between stress and  
illness, a study found that patients with arthritis or asthma often 
got better after writing about terrible experiences in their lives 
such as a car wreck or the death of a loved one. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 112 patients spent a total of just one hour writing.  
Four months later, nearly half of those who wrote about stressful 
events had improved significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is believed to be the first to examine how writing  
about stressful events affects specific illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	It was conducted at the State University of New York at Stony  
Brook and published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar studies have shown the health benefits for healthy  
people who write about stressful events. 
</P>
<P>
	``This indicates that a very minimal psychological social  
interaction can have very substantial medical effects,'' said Dr. 
David Spiegel, a Stanford University psychiatrist. ``And it 
indicates that stress may play a role in the progression of 
illnesses like arthritis and asthma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The participants were asked to write for 20 minutes for three  
days in a row. Two-thirds were asked to write about the most 
stressful events in their lives. Some wrote about being raped or 
fired and even cried while they were writing. The rest were told to 
write about their plans for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	They were tested for four months. Although some of the  
asthmatics' lung capacities increased within only two weeks, the 
arthritis patients didn't show any improvement until the end of the 
testing period. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 47.1 percent of the patients with either condition  
improved substantially after writing about their stressful 
experiences. About half as many -- 24.3 percent -- who wrote about 
their daily plans reported similar levels of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps as significant, 21.6 percent of the patients who wrote  
about their daily plans had worsened by the end of the four-month 
period, while similar deterioration was found in only 4.3 percent 
of those who wrote about stressful events. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from  
the study. Still unanswered, for example, is why it took four 
months for the arthritis patients to show improvement. Also, 
researchers don't know what happened to the participants after four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to know the effect of more writing, a booster shot  
if you will,'' said one of the researchers, Joshua M. Smyth, who is 
now a professor of psychiatry at North Dakota State University. 
</P>
<P>
	One asthma expert, Dr. Stephen Wasserman, a past president of  
the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, warned 
against making too much of one study. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical community has ``been burned before by studies that  
take information and go running down the track and make assertions 
that go way beyond what the data will support,'' said Wasserman, 
chairman of medicine at the University of California at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts said they hope the study encourages interest in  
the connection between the physical and the psychological. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Brady, a psychologist for the Arthritis Foundation, said  
she was impressed that the improvements came after patients wrote 
for just a brief time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the results of a study like this hold up, it is clear we  
need to pay attention to what's going on emotionally,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Brokerages Report Strong Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Paine Webber Group Inc.  
reaped the benefits of the Dow industrials' race past 10,000, with 
the brokerages on Tuesday reporting first-quarter profits that 
easily exceeded Wall Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results confirm that these companies, as well as the  
industry, have recovered from the turbulence that rocked the 
financial-services companies'' in late 1998, said Michael A. 
Flanagan, a brokerage industry analyst with Financial Service 
Analytics. 

</P>
<P>
                         *Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch reported its first-quarter profits rose 18.4  
percent on record trading commissions and renewed strength in the 
global bond business. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment firm earned $609 million, or $1.44 a share, in  
the first quarter, compared to $514 million, or $1.26 a share, a 
year earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected 
Merrill Lynch to earn $1.22 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 10.6 percent to $5.27 billion from $4.76 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch said record levels of commissions, asset  
management and portfolio service fees, and net interest contributed 
to the strong revenue growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissions rose 7 percent to $1.57 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch's global bond and stock businesses grew by 14  
percent and 15 percent respectively from the first quarter of 1998, 
providing further evidence of the company's recovery from the 
global financial crises that derailed profits last fall and 
prompted it to cut 3,400 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch said client assets reached a record $1.5 trillion  
at the end of the first quarter, an increase of $122 billion from 
the comparable period in 1998, and $36 billion higher than at the 
close of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from investment banking was the only real laggard in  
Merrill's first quarter, sliding 24 percent to $633 million. The 
company cited an industrywide slowdown in the issuing of new 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch remains the leading underwriter of debt and equity  
securities, with 16 percent of the U.S. market share, according to 
Securities Data Corp. But analysts said some rival investment banks 
have been more successful at securing deals from the high-flying 
technology firms that have driven the market's dramatic rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch increased its focus on the Internet in the first  
quarter, introducing online trading and acquiring the assets of 
D.E. Shaw Financial Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``This quarter's results show the full-service brokerage  
industry is not being overly impacted by the online trading 
businesses,'' said Flanagan, the analyst, adding that the online 
brokerages are expected to gain ground as more U.S. investors 
embrace the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Merrill Lynch slipped $2.56 1/4, or by 2.5 percent, to  
close at $97.37 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts suggested 
investors may have zeroed in on weaker investment banking revenue, 
and a trader said the stock may have fallen on rumors Merrill Lynch 
may be considering an acquisition of discount broker Charles 
Schwab. 
</P>
<P>
	A Merrill Lynch spokesman declined to comment on the takeover  
speculation. 

</P>
<P>
                       *Paine Webber Group Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber easily beat analysts' estimates as higher  
commission fees and asset management revenues boosted first-quarter 
profit 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage earned $160.6 million, or $1.01 a share, in the  
quarter that ended March 31, up from $120.7 million, or 77 cents a 
share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call expected Paine Webber to earn 73  
cents. Shares of Paine Webber shot up $3.68 3/4, more than 8 percent, 
to close at $47.25 a share on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber had net revenue of $1.31 billion, up 18 percent  
from $1.11 billion in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth was fueled by higher commissions from trading stocks  
and bonds as Americans continued pouring money into the market. 
Revenue from commissions totaled $478.9 million, an increase of 17 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber also profited from a 50 percent increase in net new  
client assets, which averaged $155 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Asset management revenue rose 30 percent in the quarter.  
</P>
<P>
	Like many of its rivals, including Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber  
has increased its efforts to attract Web-savvy investors. In the 
first quarter, the brokerage had 85,685 households signed on as 
members of its online client service, up from approximately 71,000 
in the previous quarter and 43,000 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clients may now access account information over the Internet,  
but Paine Webber won't introduce online trading until the third 
quarter.

<HEADLINE> PBA Holds Vote on NYC Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says the police  
commissioner will remain at the helm of a force whose rank-and-file 
officers have slapped their leader with a no-confidence vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir has been under attack for  
taking a trip to the Oscars, courtesy of a Revlon executive, and 
for using officers to chauffeur guests at his daughter's wedding. 
He also had officers track down the driver involved in a 
fender-bender with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association  
105-year history, its delegates issued a vote of no confidence in a 
commissioner on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Giuliani can remove Safir from office, a move the mayor  
rejected: ``He is not only a good police commissioner, he is a 
great one. He has the sense to stand up against people in extremes 
of both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Safir defended his record.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believed I acted appropriately,'' he said. ``I believe that  
you in the media are playing a game and a feeding frenzy and that's 
OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants Giuliani to suspend Safir until the commissioner  
can demonstrate his ability to lead a department with 40,000 
employees, said James Savage, the union's acting president. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ordinary officers would be suspended if they engaged in  
the same conduct as Safir. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous vote by the union delegates comes at a time when  
crime in the city is at a record low. However, there is increasing 
tension between police and the minority community, especially in 
the aftermath of the February slaying of an unarmed African 
immigrant who died in a hail of bullets fired by four white 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Savage also criticized current NYPD strategies -- implemented by  
Safir -- such as ticketing jaywalkers, owners of unleashed dogs and 
bicyclists riding on sidewalks or without helmets. He said the 
NYPD's ``zero-tolerance'' for crime has created quotas for how many 
arrests, summonses or tickets officers must make. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged PBA members to ``exercise the maximum degree of  
discretion'' before writing tickets or making ``zero-tolerance'' 
arrests.

<HEADLINE> Three Mile Island To Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has  
approved the first outright purchase of a commercial nuclear 
reactor in the United States -- one of the units at the notorious 
Three Mile Island station. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, approved Monday, also would bring about the first  
foreign ownership of a U.S. nuclear power plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC's approval puts owner GPU Nuclear Corp. past a major  
hurdle in the $100 million deal with AmerGen, a partnership between 
PECO Energy Co. of Philadelphia and British Energy, the largest 
electricity generator in the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as lock, stock and barrel, this is the first plant to  
change hands outright,'' said NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan said. 
Portions of ownership at nuclear plants have changed hands in the 
past, Sheehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale does not include Three Mile Island's dormant Unit 2  
reactor, which was mothballed after America's worst commercial 
nuclear accident, in March 1979. GPU will retain ownership of Unit 
2, which will be monitored by AmerGen employees under an agreement 
between the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC is requiring that at least half of AmerGen's management  
committee, the chief executive officer and the chief nuclear 
officer be U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still requires approvals from the Internal Revenue  
Service and state utility commissions in Pennsylvania, New York and 
New Jersey. GPU is based in New Jersey and operates in the other 
two states.

                           *BoxCar Willie    	
</P>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- Boxcar Willie, who adopted a hobo persona  
and won a national following as he sang of life on the road, died 
Monday after a long battle with leukemia. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	He had performed as many as six shows a week at the BoxCar  
Willie Theatre in this Ozark mountain town that is home to dozens 
of music theaters and scores of performers. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the Taney County Child Welfare Board he raised  
thousands of dollars for needy children, as well as $40,000 a year 
for police programs to fight crime and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Lecil Martin in Sterrett, Texas, in 1931, BoxCar Willie was  
the son of a railroad man who used to play his fiddle on the porch 
while his son played guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	By his teens he was performing in jamborees all over the state,  
but gave up show business to enlist in the Air Force. He spent 22 
years there, logging some 10,000 hours as a flier. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from the service he returned to performing, and  
by the 1970s had developed the singing hobo persona, complete with 
overalls, a battered old hat, worn suit jacket and two days growth 
of beard. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he took the BoxCar Willie look and name after seeing a  
freight train pass him by one day in Lincoln, Neb., as he was stuck 
in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	He was devoted to singing and promoting old-fashioned country  
music, including the sorrowful train songs for which he was best 
known. He never had a hit single, but his albums sold well and he 
built a loyal following that made him one of the most popular 
performers in Branson, where he operated a motel and train museum 
as well as his theater. 
</P>
<P>
	While Roy Clark became the first nationally known entertainer to  
put his name on a Branson theater in 1983, BoxCar Willie, who 
arrived three years later, liked to boast that he was the first big 
name to live and work there year-round.

	CHAMBERSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Robert V. Cox, who won a Pulitzer Prize  
in 1967 for his vivid deadline reporting of a mountain manhunt that 
ended with the killing of a deranged sniper, died Monday. He was 
72. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Cox graduated from high school in 1945 and went to work at The  
Public Opinion of Chambersburg, where he won the 1967 Pulitzer 
Prize in the category of local general spot news reporting. He 
retired in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He also published two books, ``Deadly Pursuit'' and ``Missing  
Person.''

	Survivors include his wife, five daughters, a son, 13  
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

and Cincinnati. He joined WDTN-TV in Dayton in 1956 and spent 26 
years at the station, serving as news director, news anchor and 
community services director. He retired in 1982.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Gary Hurford, who spent the past 13 years as  
president of Hunt Oil Co., died Monday of a heart attack. He was 
62. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurford, who also served as a member of the company's board of  
directors, was named president in 1986. He was the first non-Hunt 
family member to serve as president of the company founded by 
legendary oilman H.L. Hunt in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurford began his 37-year career at Hunt as an oil field worker  
and rose through the ranks. His time at the helm was characterized 
by aggressive international exploration, including oil and gas 
discoveries in Yemen and construction of a crude oil pipeline and 
marine export system there in the 1980s.

<P>
	Kiyokawa served as a vice president of the International Olympic

</P>
<P>
	He won the men's 100-meter backstroke in the 1932 Olympics,

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Levi Ben Levy, the head rabbi of the Israelite  
Board of Rabbis for the Western Hemisphere, died of leukemia 
Friday. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	The board serves black Hebrew Israelites, as those Jews prefer  
to be called. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy, who was born in Linden, N.C., moved in 1950 to New York,  
where he met Rabbi Wentworth Matthew, one of the first ordained 
black rabbis in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy enrolled at the Ethiopian Hebrew Rabbinical College in 1959  
after deciding to become a rabbi. He was ordained in 1967, a year 
after his graduation. His first synagogue, the Beth Shalom 
Ethiopian Congregation, began with eight families meeting in the 
living room of his Queens home. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1970s, Levy was elected chief rabbi of the  
Israelite Board of Rabbis. At the time, the board's 
responsibilities were confined to the New York area. They later 
expanded to include new congregations in other countries.

</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- ``Brownie Mary'' Rathbun, the grandmotherly  
activist whose arrests for distributing pot brownies to AIDS 
patients built momentum for the medicinal marijuana movement, died 
Saturday. She was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Mary Jane Rathbun became a fixture at San Francisco General  
Hospital in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, preparing and 
delivering marijuana-laced baked goods to sick people to relieve 
their nausea and pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she made 134 dozen a month during the heyday, 1984 to  
1990. All in her little old kitchen in her subsidized apartment. 
And you could smell it all through her building. The old ladies 
there were all cool about it. Hey, it's San Francisco,'' said 
Dennis Peron, a co-founder with Ms. Rathbun of the now-defunct San 
Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rathbun was arrested three times and twice agreed to perform  
hundreds of hours of community service, spending the time with AIDS 
patients, Peron said. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests helped build support for San Francisco's Proposition  
P and, later, the 1996 state initiative that made growing and using 
marijuana with a doctor's permission legal under California law.

                       *Justo Rodriguez Santos    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Justo Rodriguez Santos, a poet who became  
disenchanted with Fidel Castro in the 1960s and exiled himself from 
his native Cuba before becoming an advertising executive in the 
United States, died April 7. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez Santos was a member of Origenes, a group of painters  
and writers founded in the 1930s and linked to U.S. poet Wallace 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, after the Cuban revolution, Rodriguez Santos wanted to  
stay in Cuba. His wife and children left in 1963, and he asked to 
leave four years later. Instead, he was sent to work on a tobacco 
farm and his books were removed from libraries. He was banned from 
the Cuban Writers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	He was allowed to leave in 1968. He settled in New York. He was  
hired as director of advertising for Goya Foods in Secaucus, N.J., 
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Former Boeing chairman and chief executive  
officer Thornton Arnold ``T'' Wilson, credited with developing and 
producing the Boeing 757 and 767 jetliners, died Saturday. He was 
78. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson died in his sleep and was found by family members, Boeing  
spokesman Peter Conte said Monday. The cause of his death was not 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson joined Boeing in 1943 as an engineer. He became company  
president in 1968, chief executive officer in 1969 and chairman in 
1972. He retired as CEO until 1986 and as board chairman in 1987, 
though he served as board chairman emeritus until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wilson's leadership, Boeing introduced the 747 and  
subsequently developed and produced the 757 and 767, establishing 
the company as the world's leading supplier of commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson first made his mark with Boeing on the B-47 swept-wing  
bomber. He later was project engineer for the B-52 bomber program 
and then led the proposal team that won Boeing the Minuteman 
intercontinental ballistic missile program.

<HEADLINE> Court Overturns Bonds' Pre-Nup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- During nearly seven years of marriage, Sun  
Bonds saw her husband Barry rise from a young $106,000-a-year 
ballplayer to an $8 million superstar. Now she may get her share, 
despite a prenuptial agreement to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ruling that sets standards for challenges to premarital  
accords in California, a three-judge state appeals court declared 
the Bonds' agreement invalid Monday, finding that Mrs. Bonds' lack 
of access to a lawyer and other handicaps made her consent 
involuntary. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, if it survives further appeals, would give Sun Bonds  
the community property that she abandoned in the agreement: with 
some exceptions, generally half of the money and property her 
husband accumulated during the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 2-1. The dissenter on the 1st District Court of  
Appeal, Justice Ignazio Ruvolo, said the ruling ignored the trial 
judge's finding of voluntariness and threatened ``the continued 
viability of thousands of existing premarital agreements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds will appeal to the state Supreme Court, said attorney  
Robert Nachsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're creating new law and substituting their judgment for  
the trial court's,'' he said. ``I'm confident they will be 
reversed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the agreement was overturned, Nachsin said, the only  
community property left at the end of the marriage would come from 
proceeds of the sale of two houses. Bonds' earnings went ``to buy 
houses, pay taxes, pay agents and for living a very comfortable 
lifestyle,'' the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is ``very important because more people are doing  
premarital agreements and they should be fair and fairly 
procured,'' said Paige Wickland, a lawyer for Mrs. Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Bonds, a Swedish immigrant who lived in Canada, met Bonds in  
August 1987 when he played for the Pittsburgh Pirates. They married 
in February 1988, separated in May 1994 and divorced in December 
1994, after Bonds' second season with the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bonds was given custody of their two children, $20,000 a  
month in child support and $10,000 a month in alimony. Monday's 
ruling dismissed her argument that the child support was 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	The prenuptial ruling, treating each spouse's earnings as  
separate rather than community property, was signed the day before 
the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple had previously discussed plans to keep their earnings  
separate. When she arrived at the law office, Sun was told by 
Barry's agent that there would be no wedding unless she signed the 
agreement, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the written agreement was presented, Bonds was accompanied  
by two lawyers and a financial adviser, while his future wife, who 
spoke limited English, was accompanied only by a Swedish friend, 
the court said.

<HEADLINE> Sen. McCain Will Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who postponed the  
formal announcement of his bid for the presidency because of the 
conflict in Kosovo, said Tuesday he doesn't want to leave any room 
for doubt: He is a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``While now is not the time for the celebratory tour I had  
planned, I am a candidate for president and I will formally kick 
off my campaign at a more appropriate time,'' the Republican 
lawmaker said in a statement issued by his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has repeatedly said he is seeking the presidency and is  
actively campaigning but is still occasionally asked whether he is 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Tuesday at the Center for Strategic and  
International Studies, McCain stuck to the Kosovo crisis and did 
not mention his candidacy. He said NATO should ``commence today to 
mobilize infantry and armored divisions for a possible ground war 
in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Congress and the Clinton administration should show  
``the resolve of a superpower'' and do what is necessary to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``The costs of failure are infinitely greater than the price of  
victory,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who has chastised President Clinton for ruling out the  
possibility of ground troops in Kosovo, said in the campaign 
statement, ``As president, I hope to restore to the White House the 
kind of leadership Americans expect in crises like this one and to 
reform our institutions of government to make us proud again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a campaign procedural shift, former Sen. Warren Rudman,  
R-N.H., and Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., co-chairmen of the McCain for 
President Exploratory Committee, announced the formation of a new 
presidential campaign committee called McCain 2000.

<HEADLINE> 2 Convicted in TWA Evidence Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- A self-styled investigative reporter and  
his wife were convicted Tuesday of stealing scraps of upholstery 
from the wreckage of TWA Flight 800 in an effort to prove his 
theory that the airliner was shot down by a Navy missile. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury took two hours to convict James Sanders, 53, and  
his wife Elizabeth, 52, a former TWA training supervisor, of 
conspiracy and aiding and abetting the thefts. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple from Williamsburg, Va., could get up to 10 years in  
prison when sentenced July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked,'' Sanders said in a telephone interview after the  
verdict. ``I'm confident we will prevail. I'm more shocked for my 
wife, Liz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said he ``wouldn't have started down this road if I  
wasn't prepared to go to jail. It sends an incredible strong 
message to journalists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 230 people aboard Flight 800 were killed when the Boeing 747  
exploded over the Atlantic on July 17, 1996, just minutes after 
leaving New York's Kennedy Airport on a flight to Paris. The 
government has said the plane was destroyed by a fuel tank fire of 
as-yet unknown origin but has rejected sabotage, terrorism or 
``friendly fire'' from the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	In newspaper articles and a 1997 book, ``The Downing of TWA  
Flight 800,'' Sanders claimed stains on seat upholstery taken from 
the plane were formed by missile fuel, bolstering his theory. The 
FBI said the stains were glue. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's case relied heavily on the testimony of Terrell  
Stacey, a former TWA pilot who admitted helping Sanders by stealing 
crash-related documents and scraps of the seat covering from the 
hangar where investigators had reassembled the plane's wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey, who had flown the plane the day before the crash and was  
assigned by TWA to assist in the investigation, testified against 
the Sanderses in exchange for being allowed to plead guilty to a 
misdemeanor theft charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' attorney, Bruce Maffeo, said he will appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	He said Sanders was ``a journalist trying to get the truth out''  
and made no attempt to hide the fact that the evidence was passed 
to him.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed higher across the  
board Tuesday on the back of another record rally overnight on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 207.76  
points, or 1.26 percent, to close at 16,715.16. On Monday, the 
index shed 348.23 points, or 2.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese shares rebounded after the Dow Jones industrial average  
rose 165.67 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 10,339.51 Monday. 
The previous high of 10,197.70 was set Thursday. The average of 30 
blue-chip stocks is up 12.6 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate shares were the biggest gainers Tuesday. The  
property sector was supported by expectations that the Bank of 
Japan's policy of maintaining overnight interest rates at almost 
zero will help boost real estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Nikkei's rebound, traders said the average is  
unlikely to climb sharply higher in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.36 yen in the late  
afternoon, unchanged from late Monday in Tokyo, but higher than its 
late New York level of 120.19 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange also rebounded on the  
back of gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 154.95 points, or 1.3 percent, closing at 
11,899.69. On Monday, the index had slumped 169.36 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market was also boosted by Friday's cut in local  
interest rates, brokers said. Major banks have also cut their 
lending rate for their best customers to 8.50 percent from 8.75 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian share prices closed higher, with the main index  
surging 1.3 percent on gains in almost every sector to end at a 
record high for the third time in a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney market's All Ordinaries Index rose 38.1 points to  
3,076.3. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was closed in Thailand for a holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed sharply higher as foreign  
investors bought blue chips. The Composite Index rose 11.368 
points, or 2.7 cents, to 432.518. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher, with the main index rising  
to a 20-week high as an overnight rally in U.S. stock markets 
fueled sentiment. The Weighted Stock Price Index rose 95.45 points, 
or 1.31 percent, to 7,337.85, its highest close since Nov. 26, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher as foreign  
funds and local investors bought blue chip stocks, especially in 
the banking sector. The benchmark Composite Index rose 13.22 
points, or 2.31 percent, to 584.63. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly higher as a heavy inflow of  
institutional funds propelled the benchmark index to a new 18-month 
high. The Straits Times Index rose 1.1 percent, or 18.70 points, to 
1,679.98. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 6.93 points, or 0.3 percent, 
to 2,148.19. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares ended little changed Tuesday, with the  
main index posting a marginal gain on demand for bank stocks. The 
30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSE Index) edged up 
0.56 point to 2,157.64. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher for the 10th consecutive  
session as funds flowed back into the stock market due to low 
interest rates, analysts said. The Korea Composite Stock Price 
Index rose 0.16 point to 689.80.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Down Up 21.92 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Tuesday as traders  
collected some profits following Wall Street's big rally on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was up 21.92 at  
10,361.43 after moving in and out of positive territory throughout 
the day. The blue chip index rose as high as 10,418.87, a gain of 
nearly 80 points, in early trading before giving up ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 10.29 at 1,348.35, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was down 11.65 at 2,587.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co., said  
the market was in an expected pullback after Monday's strong 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's normal after a 165-point (gain in the Dow)  
yesterday,'' Rice said. ``I don't think it's out of the ordinary 
here, in fact, it's doing as I expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said the market had no particular reaction to talk of  
NATO's increasing its attacks on Kosovo. ``The air war was 
escalating yesterday,'' he said, ``and the Dow rose 165 points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury bond was down 5/8 point, pushing  
its yield up to 5.49 percent from 5.45 percent late Monday. Bond 
traders were bidding prices lower in anticipation of $10 billion in 
new corporate and government-agency debt to be issued soon. There 
was also concern that Japanese insurance companies, big buyers of 
U.S. bonds, might cut back their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell despite a Labor Department report that consumer  
prices edged up a manageable 0.2 percent in March, a sign that 
inflation is under control. Labor also reported that retail sales 
rose a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was anxiously awaiting the release of Intel's results  
after the close of trading today. The microchip maker is seen as a 
bellwether for other high-tech companies. Intel shares were down 
15/16 point at 60 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Positive earnings reports lifted some stocks today, particularly  
the financial services sector. But Merrill Lynch was down 2 13/16 
at 97 1/8, after earlier rising to 102 1/2 on a strong earnings report 
today. Art Hogan, senior trader at Jeffries &AMP; Co. in Boston, said 
Merrill might have fallen back on rumors it might be considering an 
acquisition of Charles Schwab, whose shares were up 14 1/2 at 149 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Broker PaineWebber was up 3 7/8 at 47 7/16, also after releasing a  
strong earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyman noted that market leadership has broadened beyond the  
technology sector and big-company stocks to smaller-company stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secondary market is starting to show some life,'' Hyman  
said. ``The secondary markets have to participate'' in order for 
the market to go higher. He noted that the Russell 2000 index of 
smaller companies was up 1.57 at 736.89, but was narrowing its 
early gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,589 to 1,422 on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 665.46 million shares, up from Monday's 
pace.

<HEADLINE> Promise for Pancreatic Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An immune-system booster derived from cow  
bile shows promise in early testing against pancreatic cancer, the 
deadliest of all malignancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Though it is probably no cure for most patients, the drug seems  
to work about as well as the standard medicine with far fewer side 
effects. The next step will be to try giving them together. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Changnian Liu of the University of Nebraska presented data  
on preliminary human testing of the new medicine, called Virulizin, 
in Philadelphia on Tuesday at a meeting of the American Association 
for Cancer Research. 
</P>
<P>
	About 29,000 cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed yearly in  
the United States. The outlook is grim because the disease spreads 
silently. In 90 percent of cases, the malignancy has already 
escaped the gland before it is detected. Only 2 percent of these 
patients survive a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, doctors have treated the disease with a standard  
chemotherapy drug called 5-FU with extremely poor results. 
Recently, treatment got a little better with the introduction of 
Eli Lilly's Gemzar, which doubles average survival to about six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors tested Virulizin on 26 patients who had failed to  
respond to Gemzar. Their average survival was just over six months. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the doctors reported some intriguing glimmers. One  
patient is still alive an unusually long 22 months later. 
</P>
<P>
	In another, a tumor that had spread to the liver completely went  
away. Even though the patient eventually died of cancer in the 
lung, doctors said the disappearance of cancer that had spread to 
the liver has never been reported before in pancreatic cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Daniel D. Von Hoff of the Cancer Therapy and Research Center  
in San Antonio said that if Virulizin holds up in further testing, 
it probably will be used with Gemzar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now to have something else to add onto treatment is pretty  
exciting, but we've got a long way to go on this,'' Von Hoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is being developed by Lorus Therapeutics Inc. of  
Toronto. Doctors said the primary side effect is mild fatigue. 
Typical chemotherapy side effects include nausea, hair loss and low 
blood counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Virulizin works by boosting the power of macrophages, scavenger  
cells that fight cancer directly and also rev up other parts of the 
immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first report that an immunotherapeutic agent has  
produced improved quality of life and overall survival in patients 
with advanced pancreatic cancer,'' Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Va. Gov. Allen in US Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Former Republican Gov. George F.  
Allen announced Tuesday that he will challenge Democratic Sen. 
Charles S. Robb in 2000, saying the nation's leaders lack the 
``moral authority'' to fight crime and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who often describes himself as a ``Jeffersonian  
conservative,'' chose Thomas Jefferson's hometown and the 256th 
anniversary of his birth birth to announce his bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, 47, abolished parole while governor from 1994 to 1998 and  
said he will focus on crime and the war against drugs during his 
Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we lack now in our current national leadership is the  
moral authority and courage to wage that war and fight it to win, 
and that must change,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen turned aside a reporter's question about which leaders he  
had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, Robb faced allegations, which he denied,  
that when he was governor he attended parties where cocaine was 
used. He acknowledged receiving a nude massage from a former Miss 
Virginia USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb barely survived a Republican challenge in 1994 from  
Iran-Contra figure Oliver North in a particularly nasty race. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb has not yet said whether he will seek re-election, and  
Allen never mentioned the two-term Democrat's name Tuesday. But 
Robb has been raising money for the race. No other Republican has 
expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb spokesman John Dibiase said the senator is focused on the  
war in Kosovo and had nothing to say about Allen's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dibiase said Allen should have delayed his Senate campaign  
announcement until after America is no longer bombing Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's amazing,'' Allen responded. ``If that's the worst thing  
they can say about me they really are stretching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said he started the campaign early because it will be an  
enormous task to unseat a senator. 
</P>
<P>
	A race between Allen and Robb would be closely watched  
nationwide as Republicans try to keep their majority in the Senate. 
Polls on an Allen-vs.-Robb race consistently showed the challenger 
with a lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans have a 55-45 majority. Thirty-three Senate  
seats are up for re-election in 2000, five of them without 
incumbents. Two of the five are being vacated by Republicans, three 
by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, the namesake son of the Washington Redskins and Los  
Angeles Rams football coach, led this decade's Republican 
resurgence in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb is the only Democrat holding statewide elected office in  
Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Two Die After Being Buried in Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNIATA, Neb. (AP) -- Two men died Tuesday after being buried in  
corn in a grain elevator bin. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were supposed to be cleaning corn out of a bin but were  
found buried inside another bin, Deputy Sheriff Mike Shada said. A 
safety harness normally used during cleaning was found outside the 
bin in which they were found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known why the men were in the wrong place at Juniata  
Feedyards. They were found by a feedlot manager checking on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers tried to free them and emergency workers cut a large  
hole in the bottom of the bin, allowing the corn to flow out, and

<HEADLINE> Slaney Sues Over Testosterone Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mary Slaney contends track and field  
authorities knew all along their testosterone tests on women were 
flawed. Now she is suing to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, the top distance runner in U.S. history and a former  
world champion, has filed suit against the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation and the U.S. Olympic Committee, which 
administered the test she failed during the 1996 Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally dishonest,'' Slaney lawyer Jim Coleman said.  
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF, the international governing body of track and field,  
insists it should not answer to an Indiana court. 
</P>
<P>
	``IAAF rules are enforced in 209 countries and the rules are the  
same for everyone. Otherwise there would be confusion and chaos,'' 
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said Tuesday. ``Sports rules must be 
enforced by the governing body of the particular sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC did not immediately respond to the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	A routine urine test showed Slaney had a  
testosterone-epitestosterone (T-E) ratio above the 6-to-1 limit, 
although she later said that was a result of taking birth control 
pills. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratio normally is about 1-to-1, and the IAAF maintained the  
test was an accurate method of detecting levels of the 
muscle-enhancing hormone in athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said the IAAF should have found a way to distinguish  
between athletes who were purposely increasing their testosterone 
and those whose higher ratio resulted from other factors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what they haven't done,'' he said. ``They have no way  
at all to do that, they don't know how to do that. As a result, 
what the IAAF is saying is that since they don't know how to do it, 
they'll assume it's doping unless Mary can convince its arbitration 
panel that it wasnt doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney was suspended from competition in 1997, then later  
reinstated, although the IAAF referred the case to arbitration. A 
panel in Monte Carlo last week adjourned the arbitration hearing 
until April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF said regardless of the lawsuit the arbitration panel  
will reconvene in Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, which also seeks unspecified damages, was filed Monday  
in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis, the home of USA Track &AMP; 
Field, the sport's national governing body. USATF was not named as 
a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said he has asked the IAAF and USOC to suspend the use  
of the T-E ratio for women. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also seeks a permanent injunction against the two  
organizations to prevent them from using the ratio as proof of a 
drug violation by women. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USOC is being sued because this was the USOC test, and at  
the very outset they said an investigation had to be done to rule 
out the possibility that this could be explained by innocent 
factors,'' Coleman said. ``That was never done, and the USOC never 
assured that it was. It just simply ignored what the IAAF was 
doing. The only way to stop this was to bring a lawsuit.''

<HEADLINE> Medicare HMO Information Lacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three days before 70-year-old Lois Watts was  
scheduled to have cancer surgery, the private health plan that gave 
her Medicare coverage changed its mind and would not pay for the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the insurer provided no clear information about how Watts  
could challenge the decision under Medicare rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt abandoned and helpless,'' the Orange County, Calif.,  
grandmother testified Tuesday at a hearing of the Senate Special 
Committee on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts eventually was able to navigate Medicare's rules and win  
payment for her surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	New audits by Congress's General Accounting Office -- released at  
the hearing -- found that Medicare has not made sure that private 
health plans that enroll elderly and disabled Americans provide 
accurate information about benefits and complaint policies, so that 
some may not be getting the care they're entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent ... was to give older Americans more health care  
options. We wanted to make their lives easier. Instead, inadequate 
plan information has caused headaches,'' said the committee's 
chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most of Medicare's 39 million elderly and disabled  
beneficiaries have their individual medical bills paid directly by 
the government, about 15 percent instead have chosen to enroll in 
private health plans -- mainly health maintenance organizations, or 
HMOs -- that get fixed monthly fees from Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers want to see private insurers play an even bigger  
role in Medicare, believing market competition could help the 
cash-strapped program save money. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Cronin, director of Medicare's Center for Beneficiary  
Services conceded that ``misinformation and abuses in marketing and 
of beneficiary appeal rights have not been adequately addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Cronin said Medicare already is taking several steps to  
improve the accuracy and clarity of health plan information, 
including a new standard summary of benefits insurers will be 
required to make available later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Cronin said Medicare will investigate the health plan  
violations found by the GAO. 
</P>
<P>
	Don White, a spokesman for the American Association of Health  
Plans, an HMO industry group, said insurers want their marketing 
information to be accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a problem with that we want to work with (Medicare)  
to correct it,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO reviewed marketing materials -- including brochures and  
handbooks -- used by 16 undisclosed health plans spread across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Every one of the plans had significant gaps or inaccuracies in  
their descriptions of benefits, the auditors found. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, five of the plans said women needed their doctor's  
referral to get an annual mammogram to check for breast cancer -- a 
practice Medicare prohibits. 
</P>
<P>
	One large health plan listed a $600 annual limit for  
prescription drug coverage, although its contract with Medicare 
called for unlimited benefits for generic drugs and up to 
$1,200-a-year coverage for brand names. Medicare does not normally 
cover prescriptions, but many private health plans offer the 
benefit as a perk to boost enrollment among the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors estimated that as many as 130,000 people may not  
have known they were entitled to the higher drug benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate audit of health plans' handling of complaints, the  
GAO found that beneficiaries who are denied coverage often do not 
get a written notice giving a specific reason, as required by 
Medicare. Others were not informed of their right to appeal their 
health plan's decisions to an independent Medicare board.

<HEADLINE> Bank Puts Its Money Behind Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- These days, sports and corporate sponsorship are  
as American as, well, baseball and hot dogs. Airlines, brewers, 
computer companies have all spent big bucks to get their names on 
stadiums and ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a bank is putting its money behind the most national of  
pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet Financial Group has become an official sponsor of Major  
League Baseball and the 1999 All-Star Game, to be played in Boston 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Announced at Fenway Park Monday, the sponsorship comes a month  
after Fleet detailed plans to merge with BankBoston, becoming the 
nation's eighth-largest bank and New England's dominant lender. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball agreement, however, does not mean the All-Star game  
will be named after the bank. The rights to that moniker belong to 
Major League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 other corporations have some form of sponsorship with  
Major League Baseball, but Fleet is the first bank among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the sponsorship were not disclosed, and bank officials  
declined to give even a ``ballpark'' figure. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsorship helps cement the bank's presence in New England  
and give it a broader advertising reach across the country -- one 
they plan to use to full marketing advantage, bank officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us a capacity that we didn't have before. It gives  
us a reach we certainly didn't have before,'' said Anne Finucane, 
Fleet's senior vice president for corporate marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsorship strengthens the bank's ties to baseball. Last  
year, Fleet arranged $425 million in financing for Major League 
Baseball. Fleet also has relationships with 12 major league teams, 
including the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing couldn't be better for Fleet, marketing specialists  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there's a lot of questionable press about the  
Fleet-BankBoston merger and what the effect is going to be on the 
New England economy,'' said Kathleen Brewer Doran, a professor of 
marketing at Babson College in Wellesley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really what they're going after here in my opinion is a chance  
to prove their roots in the Boston market,'' she said. ``If the 
All-Star game were going to be in San Diego, there's no way they 
would have done this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsorship also gives them some national clout, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bank plans an advertising blitz -- both inside and outside  
ballparks -- with the theme, ``Fleet keeps baseball going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who played a brief game of  
catch with Fleet Chairman Terrence Murray on Monday, will also 
serve as a bank spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Cos. To Test-Market Irradiated Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Gene W. Ray envisions a world where a child  
would no more eat meat that hadn't been decontaminated by low-grade 
electron beams than he would drink unpasteurized milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray is president and chief executive of Titan Corp., which is  
installing a system to electronically pasteurize meat at Cloverleaf 
Cold Storage Co. in Sioux City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego-based Titan will build and operate the so-called  
``E-beam system,'' the first in the country specifically designed 
to electronically irradiate ground beef for commercial purposes, 
Ray said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meatpacking giants IBP Inc. and Excel Corp. will subsequently  
test-market the beef later this year or in early 2000 to gauge 
consumer acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in irradiation has grown since recent contamination  
scares, including last summer's recall of 25 million pounds of 
ground beef feared contaminated with E. coli bacteria, industry 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had several major customers express interest in offering  
the product,'' said Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for IBP, the 
world's largest supplier of fresh beef and pork to stores and 
restaurants. ``So that's contributed to our interest. It's another 
layer of protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cloverleaf plant would become the first to electronically  
pasteurize meat for commercial purposes, Ray said. Iowa State 
University has an electronic pasteurization system that has been 
used on a smaller scale for research. 
</P>
<P>
	During irradiation, meat is subjected to low-level doses of  
gamma rays or electron beams. The U.S. Department of Agriculture in 
February approved irradiation of red meat as a way to curb 
food-borne illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists agree the process is safe in food. But antinuclear  
groups have opposed the procedure if it involves gamma rays, and 
some health advocates worry that using irradiation might reduce 
other safety techniques such as proper handling and plant 
sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even irradiated meat is subject to contamination if it is  
mishandled after treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	While it has been used for years on limited amounts of produce,  
spices, poultry and other foods, none of the major food companies 
has stepped forward to market irradiated products. Only a few small 
retailers offer irradiated foods. But on a space mission last year, 
John Glenn and his fellow astronauts ate irradiated food. 
</P>
<P>
	Excel spokesman Mark Klein said he feels confident the informed  
public will not have concerns about irradiated meat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a line of fully cooked microwaveable beef and pork  
items,'' he said Tuesday. ``Before launching the full-scale line, 
we did some test marketing of it, just to see, is this stuff as 
good as we think it is. It's the same thing. The consumer 
acceptance is from a standpoint just like microwaveable pot 
roast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klein said testing would have to be accompanied by educational  
material to ease people's fears about the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to let people know that the technology is safe and  
that if they're looking for that added measure of safety, they may 
very well want to try this,'' he said. He said irradiated beef 
could cost slightly more than untreated meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Past estimates have put the added cost of irradiation to a food  
processor at 3 cents to 7 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA has not yet approved rules for implementing the  
electronic irradiation technology, Ray said. Final USDA approval is 
expected by the end of the year, pending legal review, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ConAgra Inc. spokeswoman Lynn Phares said the company has not  
yet signed on to test the irradiated meat, but is exploring the 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray declined to say what other companies, or how many, planned  
to be involved in the commercial tests, but he said he hoped the 
process would catch on as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's something that we have to do,'' he said. ``There  
is a real public health problem, and in every case, it has been 
proved that (the process) is perfectly safe.''

<HEADLINE> Russia May Pull Bosnia Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia may send additional naval ships to the  
Mediterranean and withdraw its peacekeepers from Bosnia to show its 
opposition to NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia, Russia's defense 
minister said today. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Russia has limited itself to mostly symbolic actions in  
expressing its opposition to the NATO bombardment. But Defense 
Minister Igor Sergeyev said Russia was considering stronger 
responses. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has sent one intelligence-gathering ship into the  
Adriatic to monitor NATO warships in the region, and has said it 
may send several more warships to the Mediterranean or the 
Adriatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev did not say how many ships might be sent to the region  
or when they might go. Military officials have said the intent 
would be to monitor NATO forces, but Sergeyev said today the step 
was a pre-planned rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have planned to replace our floating dock near Syria. The  
new floating dock will naturally be escorted by other ships,'' he 
said, according to Russian news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian navy has launched several military exercises  
recently, including Baltic Fleet maneuvers that began today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia might also withdraw its peacekeepers from Bosnia, where  
they have served alongside NATO forces, Sergeyev said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has suspended all contacts with NATO and says it has  
removed its soldiers in Bosnia from NATO command. However, the 
action has little meaning because the Russian forces depend on NATO 
logistical support. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev said today that Russia could go a step further and pull  
out the peacekeepers altogether ``depending on the situation in 
Yugoslavia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he believed NATO may still launch a ground operation in  
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation in the region shows that such an operation is  
possible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin has condemned the NATO raids, but said  
that Russia won't get involved militarily or supply Yugoslavia with 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking help from Russia, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic  
has asked that his country be considered for admission into an 
alliance of Slavic nations that already includes Russia and 
Belarus. The Yugoslav parliament voted Monday in favor of joining. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia said the matter must be thoroughly studied and no  
decision could be made quickly.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Riot Photos Must Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A judge has ordered two newspapers  
and eight television stations to turn over unpublished photographs 
and video of a campus riot to prosecutors trying to identify people 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge David Jordan's ruling on Tuesday was similar to  
one he made last week involving the Lansing State Journal. All of 
the news organizations plan to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III is seeking hundreds of  
unpublished photographs and video footage taken the night of March 
27, when more than 5,000 people rioted on the Michigan State 
University campus and in downtown East Lansing. The riots began in 
the final moments of the NCAA semifinal game in which Michigan 
State lost to Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continued delay by the news media in compliance with the  
law could further jeopardize our efforts,'' Dunnings said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is trying to prosecute as many alleged rioters as he  
can before Michigan State's summer vacation begins May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling affected The Detroit Free Press and The State News --  
Michigan State's student newspaper -- and television stations WJBK, 
WKBD and WXYZ in Detroit, WJRT in Flint, WILX in Onandaga outside 
Lansing, WLNS in Lansing, WWMT in Kalamazoo and WZZM in Grand 
Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	The media argued that it cannot be seen as working for  
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The news media should not be cast in the role as an agent of  
the police,'' Free Press attorney Herschel Fink said.

<HEADLINE> Verdict in Anwar Trial Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's jailed former No. 2  
leader may be led away from a courthouse in handcuffs on Wednesday. 
But regardless of the judgment in his corruption trial, Anwar 
Ibrahim will still be a beacon of inspiration for many of his 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you jail him, Anwar will always be around,'' said  
Mohamad Ezam Mohd. Noor, political secretary to Anwar before he was 
sacked as deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	High Court Judge Augustine Paul will announce a verdict and  
sentence Wednesday on four corruption charges alleging that Anwar 
ordered police to illegally obtain retraction letters from two 
people who had accused him of unlawful acts of sodomy and adultery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's been a more important case arousing  
public interest,'' defense lawyer Gurbachan Singh told The 
Associated Press. ``This is the first time in Malaysia's history 
that a deputy prime minister has been charged in court. It's the 
first time a person is being charged for corruption ... without any 
money being involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each corruption count carries a possible 14-year jail term.  
Anwar could face 56 years, but most lawyers expect a concurrent 
sentence of two to six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Anwar is found innocent, he will likely be arrested  
again the moment he walks out of the courtroom because he still 
faces trial on one other corruption charge and five counts of 
illegal sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar was sacked last September after Prime Minister Mahathir  
Mohamad called him an immoral leader unfit to rule Malaysia. Anwar 
and many of his supporters contend he was really because he posed a 
challenge to Mahathir's 18-year leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Days after the sacking, Anwar launched a nationwide tour calling  
for Mahathir's resignation. From initial crowds of several hundred 
people who flocked to the backyard of his residence, Anwar 
mobilized tens of thousands of activists within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, normally placid Malaysians gathered more  
than 50,000-strong at the capital's National Mosque on Sept. 20. 
They later convened at Merdeka Square, issuing strident calls for 
an end to Mahathir's rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands surged toward Mahathir's official residence that  
evening and were repelled with tear gas and batons. Police arrested 
Anwar that night and brutally beat him. Anwar appeared in court 10 
days later with a badly bruised eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar's bizarre trial -- including accusations he kept sex slaves  
and the display of a semen-stained mattress as evidence -- has 
attracted international attention, and has drawn together 
previously disparate opposition and human rights groups in this 
Southeast Asian nation.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Graphics Changes Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- Silicon Graphics, Inc., the  
17-year-old high-tech company known for breakthrough graphics in 
movies such as Jurassic Park, is changing its name and image to 
avoid becoming a Silicon Valley dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will announce Tuesday that that its new trade name  
will be SGI. The initials are already in the company's World Wide 
Web address (www.sgi.com) and the corporation's symbol on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is part of a major branding shift, which also  
includes a new logo, national advertising and consolidation of 
hundreds of separate product brands. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the surface, sure, this looks like a ho-hum move, but in  
the long run it's really going to help this company become known 
for something other than workstations,'' said Jay Moore, a senior 
analyst with Aberdeen Group in Boston, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI decided to change its name after a branding consultant found  
that while the company's products were perceived as innovative and 
visionary, the company was viewed as a niche-oriented, 
high-performance 3D graphics workstation provider. In fact, company 
officials say their servers and supercomputers for small, medium 
and large businesses generate about half of their revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been struggling for several years, losing money  
in nine of the past ten quarters as competitors have come on strong 
and the supercomputer market has weakened. In late March, the 
company warned investors that third-quarter losses will much 
greater than expected, mostly because of production delays in its 
workstation computers. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI vice president of worldwide marketing and communications  
Kathi Kaplan said Monday that while the new computers are still not 
rolling out, the identity change is part of a much broader shift 
for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	And CEO Rick Belluzzo said the company has made significant  
progress in turning around this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The move to create a corporate identity that reflects our  
position is a logical next step in the company's turnaround,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't OK Bible-Based Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATUR, Ala. (AP) -- A judge Tuesday rejected a bid to form a  
town whose only laws would be the Ten Commandments and the 
teachings of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a brief hearing in which no one showed up to support  
the formation of the new city of Brooksville, Probate Judge Bobby 
Day ruled that the organizers failed to lay the groundwork required 
by state law for an incorporation vote. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not asked to address the question of whether a city could  
use the Bible for its laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The community of Brooksville, much of which already is in the  
city of Priceville, is little more than a few dozen houses and 
mobile homes situated around two intersections with gas stations. 
Dump trucks rumble along the main highway, a two-lane blacktop. 
</P>
<P>
	Evangelist James R. Henderson and others wanted to form a new  
town that would use the Ten Commandments and Jesus' teachings as 
laws, with citizens providing their own police protection through a 
community watch.

<HEADLINE> Suriname Gold Mine Plan Scrutinized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- U.S. and Canadian mining companies  
plan to meet with government officials in Suriname on May 1 to 
discuss stalled plans for a gold mine in the South American 
country, a company official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Cambior Inc. and Golden Star Resources of Denver will  
decide whether to revive plans to develop the Gross Rosebel Mine 
despite a slump in the worldwide gold market, said Norman McLean, 
human resources manager of Cambior's Guyana-based Omai Gold Mines 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of work to be done to make the whole thing  
feasible with gold prices what they are at the moment, but I 
believe a major decision will be taken at that meeting,'' McLean 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies put plans for the mine on hold when gold prices  
began to slide in 1998. Prices now hover around $280 per ounce 
compared to $385 per ounce one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have said they believe the site about 90 miles  
south of the Surinamese capital, Paramaribo, could produce more 
than 2.3 million ounces of gold over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambior and Golden Star jointly own the Omai Gold Mine in  
western Guyana, the third largest in the Americas, and are 
exploring several properties in French Guiana.

<HEADLINE> AP Sweeps Photography Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press won two Pulitzers in  
photography on Monday, sweeping both photo categories for the 
second time in the history of the prestigious journalism prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our photo team made AP and Pulitzer history today,'' said  
Louis D. Boccardi, AP president and chief executive officer. ``We 
couldn't be happier or more proud.' 
</P>
<P>
	The AP, the only news organization ever to sweep the photo  
categories, won the spot news photography award for a portfolio of 
20 pictures on the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. It won 
for feature photography for a collection of 20 photographs of the 
events surrounding President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 
and his impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, the AP won both photo Pulitzers, one for a picture by a  
staff member and the other by a free-lancer whose work the AP 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's overwhelming. It's just a tremendous tribute to the  
staff,'' said Vin Alabiso, AP vice president and executive photo 
editor. ``We are definitely getting out the champagne!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheers and applause rang out on the national photo desk in New  
York when Alabiso announced the news that 15 photographers won in 
the feature category and six for spot news. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Borea, the AP's Baltimore news photo editor, won in the  
feature category. His photo, shot from the back, captured Clinton, 
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, 
walking hand-in-hand across the South Lawn with their dog, Buddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached on his cell phone in Annapolis, Md., where he was  
covering the closing of the Legislature, Borea spoke about his 
colleagues. ``It's a great group of people,'' he said. ``I'm just 
happy to be a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Marquette, who also won in the feature category, said  
winning the Pulitzer was ``truly a team effort. I feel a very 
insignificant part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marquette was reached at the AP Washington photo desk where  
three winners celebrated with him: Scott Applewhite, Khue Bui and 
Pablo Martinez Monsivais. 
</P>
<P>
	Applewhite said he had just landed at Andrews Air Force Base  
after covering Clinton at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana 
when his office beeped him to tell him about the Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a humbling experience,'' said Applewhite, who was on a  
team of AP photographers who won a Pulitzer in 1993 for their 
portfolio of the 1992 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no greater, sweeter praise than from your peers,''  
Applewhite said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsivais, who joined the AP staff only four months ago, said he  
won for a photo he took on his second day on the job, that of 
former Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who was in line to become 
Speaker of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how it felt to win a Pulitzer, Monsivais said: ``The best  
things are unexpected. It's a great bunch of photographers here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Loh, a member of the AP Philadelphia staff whose photo of  
Ms. Lewinsky was included in the feature category, said: ``It's 
going to take a couple hours to sink in. It's all so shocking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Johnson, the bureau chief in Washington, said of the  
photographers who covered the Clinton scandal: ``These guys were 
there at 5 o'clock in the morning. They were there at midnight. 
They were at restaurants. They were at the courthouse. They were at 
Ken Starr's house every single day. And this is the payoff!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other feature category winners are: Robert Bukaty, Ruth  
Fremson, Ron Heflin, Greg Gibson, Charles Krupa, Wilfredo Lee, Doug 
Mills, Stephan Savoia and Susan Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners in the spot news category are Sayyid Azim, Jean-Marc  
Bouju, Dave Caulkin, Brennan Linsley, John McConnico and Khalil 
Senosi. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouju was a finalist last year for a sequence of an execution by  
rebels in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP has won nine Pulitzers in the last nine years -- eight of  
them for photos. Overall, the AP has won 45 Pulitzers, 27 of them 
in photography. It last won for photography in 1997, for a photo of 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin dancing during his re-election 
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Implant Finding Called Tainted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Attorneys for women with breast implants  
asked a judge Tuesday to throw out a court-appointed panel's report 
finding no link between implants and illnesses, citing a panel 
member's undisclosed financial relationship with an implant 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Peter Tugwell of the University of Ottawa, one of four  
members on the scientific panel whose December report affected 
thousands of implant cases, received and solicited money from 
implant-maker Bristol-Myers Squibb for matters not related to the 
implant litigation, according to a motion filed in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion asked U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. to  
invalidate the report and disband the entire panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing only Tugwell wouldn't be enough to cure the taint of  
his actions at this point, so the other panelists should also be 
removed, the motion said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's findings, used in courts nationwide, were a major  
blow to women seeking damages for illnesses they claimed were 
caused by defective silicon implants. According to women's 
attorneys, thousands already have settled or withdrawn their 
lawsuits, based on the panel's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a terrible breakdown of trust. I don't know where the  
women are going to go for answers now,'' said Sybil Niden Goldrich, 
a former implant recipient who founded an organization to provide 
information to women with implants. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's attorney, John Kobayashi, issued a statement later  
Tuesday through his Denver law office saying panel members will not 
comment to members of the news media because of the pending 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers' director of public policy, Jane Kramer, said  
Tuesday the contacts between Tugwell and the company were not 
significant enough to have influenced the panel's findings. She 
said Tugwell made appropriate disclosures of his contacts with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Robert Gordon of New York, who represents women with  
implants, said that Tugwell, the University of Ottawa's director of 
medicine, never disclosed to Pointer his receipt of a $750 
honorarium from Bristol-Myers for participating in a company 
seminar in November 1998. He also failed to reveal that he signed a 
letter asking the company for up to $10,000 in August 1997 to fund 
a professional meeting he co-chaired, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's attorneys also said Tugwell signed a confidentiality  
agreement with Bristol-Myers on Dec. 15, 1998, to conduct a 
clinical trial on a new arthritis therapy. Tugwell subsequently 
transferred the study to a colleague, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Tugwell himself, the attorneys also cited a  
conflict by one of his close associates, Dr. George A. Wells, who 
was a consultant to the court-appointed panel. Wells was paid to 
direct a research project financed by Zimmer Canada Ltd., a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four panel members had pledged to disclose any conflicts of  
interest involving themselves or their family members throughout 
the time they served, said Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Those filing the motion contend Tugwell's actions tainted the  
report because he had collaborated extensively in the collection 
and analysis of data and in preparing and reviewing the report and 
its summary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointer, who was presiding over thousands of consolidated  
implant cases, selected the panel in 1996 with the cooperation of 
attorneys for implant recipients and manufacturers. Its mission was 
to sort out conflicting scientific opinions regarding alleged links 
between implants and systemic diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the scientists told Pointer they found no definite  
links between implants and disease in four major areas -- 
toxicology, immunology, epidemiology and rheumatology -- with each 
panel member an expert in one of the fields. Tugwell is a 
rheumatologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of women have sued companies blaming implants for  
sicknesses including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, body aches, 
fatigue, memory loss and hardening of the breasts. Their lawyers 
claim science backs up the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers deny their products are dangerous and point to  
other studies that found no links between implants and health 
problems. They contend women's attorneys built their cases on 
flawed science.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Stress-Illness Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Patients with arthritis or asthma often got  
better after writing about such terrible experiences as a car wreck 
or the death of a loved one, researchers tracking the connection 
between illness and stress reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 112 patients spent a total of just one hour writing.  
Four months later, nearly half of those who wrote about stressful 
events had improved significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is believed to be the first to examine how writing  
about stressful events affects specific illnesses. It was conducted 
at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and published in 
today's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar studies have shown the health benefits for healthy  
people who write about stressful events. 
</P>
<P>
	``This indicates that a very minimal psychological social  
interaction can have very substantial medical effects,'' said Dr. 
David Spiegel, a Stanford University psychiatrist. ``And it 
indicates that stress may play a role in the progression of 
illnesses like arthritis and asthma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The participants were asked to write for 20 minutes for three  
days in a row. Two-thirds were asked to write about the most 
stressful events in their lives. Some wrote about being raped or 
fired and even cried while they were writing. The rest were told to 
write about their plans for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	They were tested for four months. Although some of the  
asthmatics' lung capacities increased within only two weeks, the 
arthritis patients didn't show any improvement until the end of the 
testing period. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 47.1 percent of the patients with either condition  
improved substantially after writing about their stressful 
experiences. About half as many -- 24.3 percent -- who wrote about 
their daily plans reported similar levels of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps as significant, 21.6 percent of the patients who wrote  
about their daily plans had worsened by the end of the four-month 
period, while similar deterioration was found in only 4.3 percent 
of those who wrote about stressful events. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from  
the study. Still unanswered, for example, is why it took four 
months for the arthritis patients to show improvement. Also, 
researchers don't know what happened to the participants after four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to know the effect of more writing, a booster shot  
if you will,'' said one of the researchers, Joshua Smyth, who is 
now a professor of psychiatry at North Dakota State University. 
</P>
<P>
	One asthma expert, Dr. Stephen Wasserman, a past president of  
the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, warned 
against making too much of one study. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical community has ``been burned before by studies that  
take information and go running down the track and make assertions 
that go way beyond what the data will support,'' said Wasserman, 
chairman of medicine at the University of California at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts said they hope the study encourages interest in  
the connection between the physical and the psychological. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Brady, a psychologist for the Arthritis Foundation, said  
she was impressed that the improvements came after patients wrote 
for just a brief time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the results of a study like this hold up, it is clear we  
need to pay attention to what's going on emotionally,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Starr To Oppose Counsel Act Renewal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, whose  
investigation of President Clinton revived a debate over special 
prosecutors, will tell Congress on Wednesday he opposes renewing 
the law that put him in power, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, scheduled to testify before the Senate Governmental  
Affairs Committee, submitted prepared remarks Tuesday laying out 
his rationale against renewing the Independent Counsel Act, said 
officials familiar his written testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said  
Starr opposes renewing the law on several grounds, including that 
it violates the constitutional separation of powers between the 
executive and judicial branches. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also raises concerns about the costs and length of many  
independent counsel investigations, and the relentless political 
attacks against the special prosecutors during their probes, the 
officials said.

<HEADLINE> NBC Cancels 'Another World' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Another World,'' the longest-running soap  
opera in NBC history, will end the drama come June. The network is 
killing it off at age 35. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the most dramatic of several changes NBC announced to its  
morning and daytime schedule on Monday. The network is adding a 
daytime talk show with ``Weekend Today'' anchor Jodi Applegate as 
host and a 4:30 a.m. EDT business news show for early risers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another World'' will be replaced by ``Passions,'' a serial  
created by the former head writer of ``Days of Our Lives,'' which 
is remaining on NBC's schedule. NBC is also renewing its 
two-year-old soap, ``Sunset Beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's daytime schedule has included ``Another World'' since its  
premiere on May 4, 1964. It was the first soap opera expanded to 
one hour, and was even briefly broadcast for 90 minutes. It was 
also the first daytime drama with spinoff series, the short-lived 
``Somerset'' and ``Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tonight Show'' is the only NBC entertainment show to be on  
the air longer than ``Another World,'' which will end with a final 
broadcast on June 25. CBS's ``Guiding Light,'' on the air since 
1952, is the longest-running serial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank all the people working on `Another World' for an  
incredible job at giving their audience an amazing 35-year run. It 
was a very tough decision,'' said Scott Sassa, NBC entertainment 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another World'' was hurt by the increasing desire of networks  
to own and control the profits of the shows they air. ``Another 
World'' is owned by Procter &AMP; Gamble,'' and the new ``Passions'' 
will be owned by NBC. The network also has a partial stake in 
``Sunset Beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC also said it wanted to air ``Days of Our Lives'' and  
``Passions'' back-to-back on its schedule. Currently, NBC 
affiliates choose when they want to air ``Another World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive editor of ``Soap Opera Digest'' said she was  
surprised by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``Sunset Beach'' is promising, ``I don't think viewers  
have as much an attachment to it as the viewers for `Another 
World,''' Carolyn Hinsey said. ``Soap fans, the reason they watch 
soaps is because they hate change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Applegate's new show, ``Later Today,'' will air directly after  
the ``Today'' show. It will replace ``Leeza'' starting in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is canceling its ``NBC News at Sunrise'' series and giving  
its affiliates the chance to program local news from 5 a.m. to 7 
a.m. EDT. These early morning news broadcasts are growing in 
popularity and profitability for local stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early Today,'' the new business-oriented network news show to  
air at 4:30 a.m., will be produced by the business cable network 
CNBC.

around the world with continuous updates 24 hours a day. The 
technology also makes it possible for all AP affiliates to brand 
the site as their own with local advertising and links to the 
affiliates' local Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Smithsonian honor is a special one for us,'' said Jim  
Kennedy, director of AP Multimedia Services. ``It underscores the 
important work the AP is doing to put all of its great news 
resources online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1848, The Associated Press is the world's oldest and  
largest newsgathering organization serving newspapers, broadcasters 
and other news outlets worldwide with news services in every media 
form -- print, radio, television and online services. 
</P>
<P>
	AP provided the Smithsonian with extensive background materials  
on the development of The WIRE, which will be included in the 
institution's permanent archive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The primary source material submitted by AP will enrich our  
collection on the history of information technology and contribute 
significantly to the museum's ongoing efforts to chronicle the 
information age,'' said Spencer R. Crew, director of the National 
Museum of American History at the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
	Background histories of the AP project and other winners are  
available on the official Web site of the awards program 
(http://innovate.si.edu/briefingroom99) for scholars, researchers 
and the general public. 
</P>
<P>

Computerworld magazine and the Smithsonian to recognize vision, 
leadership and innovation in information technology. This year's 
collection included winners from 42 states and 22 countries.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Attacked by Gunman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson wrestled and bit a gunman who  
tried to rob him Tuesday in the parking lot of a golf course, 
police said. Simpson was cut on the hand during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson chased the assailant in his car while calling police on  
his cellular phone, but gave up because the man was running red 
lights and police told Simpson to pull over. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody has been arrested, said Officer Jason Lee, a spokesman  
for the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, in a phone interview from home with The Associated  
Press, called the incident at Los Feliz Golf Course ``the weirdest 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I had finished playing golf and was walking to the car saying  
goodbye to my buddies,'' he said. ``I was taking my shoes off 
between cars and I sensed someone coming up behind me. I turned 
around and he was holding a gun on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Man, why do you want to screw up your life? Take my  
car. You don't want to do this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the man looked at him and called him by his name, saying  
``O.J., I hear you carry a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The assailant seemed intent on robbing him, Simpson said, but  
when he offered him money and his credit cards, he didn't take 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy looked like a regular solid citizen,'' he said. ``In  
his 40s, very clean cut. I might have taken him for an off-duty 
policeman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said he told him people would see him aiming the gun,  
but the man refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stepped toward me and we wrestled for the gun. I bit his  
hand so he would let go of the gun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson cut his hand with the barrel of the gun.  
</P>
<P>
	``My hand was bleeding and my first reaction wasn't to follow  
him, but I got in my van and followed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he got the license number, which he gave to police, then  
went to the police station. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought the incident was an attempted carjacking, he  
said, ``He didn't want the car, he wanted me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Simpson was acquitted of murdering ex-wife Nicole Brown  
Simpson and Ronald Goldman. However, he later was found liable for 
their deaths in a civil trial and was ordered to pay $33.5 million 
in damages.

<HEADLINE> Medicare HMO Coverage Info Lacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare has not made sure that private health  
plans that enroll elderly and disabled Americans provide accurate 
information about benefits and complaint policies, government 
auditors say. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, some Medicare beneficiaries may not be getting the  
care they're entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent ... was to give older Americans more health care  
options. We wanted to make their lives easier. Instead, inadequate 
plan information has caused headaches,'' said Sen. Chuck Grassley, 
D-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, who scheduled a 
hearing Tuesday on the findings of the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most of Medicare's 39 million elderly and disabled  
beneficiaries have their individual medical bills paid directly by 
the government, about 15 percent instead have chosen to enroll in 
private health plans -- mainly health maintenance organizations, or 
HMOs -- that get fixed monthly fees from Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers want to see private insurers play an even bigger  
role in Medicare, believing market competition could help the 
cash-strapped program save money. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO auditors said the lack of any standard format for health  
plan marketing materials makes it difficult for Medicare to keep 
tabs on what private insurers are telling beneficiaries. Also, the 
auditors said Medicare officials don't consistently ensure that the 
mistakes they do catch are corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Misinformation and abuses in marketing and of beneficiary  
appeal rights have not been adequately addressed,'' Carol Cronin, 
director of Medicare's Center for Beneficiary Services, said in 
prepared testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Cronin said Medicare already is taking several steps to  
improve the accuracy and clarity of health plan information, 
including a new standard summary of benefits insurers will be 
required to make available later this year. Medicare already posts 
some basic information on the Internet about the benefits competing 
HMOs offer, and that will be included in new Medicare handbooks 
scheduled to be mailed to beneficiaries this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Cronin said Medicare will investigate the health plan  
violations found by the GAO. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO reviewed marketing materials -- including brochures and  
handbooks -- used by 16 undisclosed health plans spread across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Every one of the plans had significant gaps or inaccuracies in  
their descriptions of benefits, the auditors found. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, five of the plans said women needed their doctor's  
referral to get an annual mammogram to check for breast cancer -- a 
requirement Medicare prohibits. 
</P>
<P>
	One large health plan listed a $600 annual dollar annual limit  
for prescription drug coverage, although its contract with Medicare 
called for unlimited benefits for generic drugs and up to 
$1,200-a-year coverage for brand names. Medicare does not normally 
cover prescriptions, but many private health plans offer the 
benefit as a perk to boost enrollment among the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors estimated that as many as 130,000 people may not  
have known they were entitled to the higher drug benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate audit of health plans' handling of complaints, the  
GAO found that beneficiaries who are denied coverage often do not 
get a written notice giving a specific reason, as required by 
Medicare. Others were not informed of their right to appeal their 
health plan's decisions to an independent Medicare board.

<HEADLINE> South Korea To Repay $3.7 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea will repay $3.7 billion  
more in maturing loans to the International Monetary Fund in 
several installments between April and June, government officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea was forced to accept an IMF bailout of its faltering  
economy in December 1997. It has received $19 billion of an 
authorized loan package of $58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	With the latest debt servicing, South Korea will have repaid a  
total of $8.5 billion. That will reduce the country's outstanding 
loan balance with the IMF to $10.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The repayment, which will be made slightly ahead of schedule,  
reflects the nation's increasing foreign currency reserves, 
officials at the Ministry of Finance and Economy said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's usable foreign currency reserves stood at $53.2  
billion as of mid-March, compared to a mere $6 billion at the peak 
of its currency crisis.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Named to Preseason NIT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Arizona, a two-time winner of the Preseason NIT,  
will go for No. 3 in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats, hoping to match a feat accomplished only by  
Kansas, are in the 16-team field for this year's tournament, which 
was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, which won the Preseason NIT in 1990 and 1995, is one of  
nine teams in the field that played in last month's NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, which capped one of college basketball's best  
turnarounds last season by reaching the Final Four, and Kentucky, 
which fell one win shy of a fourth straight Final Four appearance, 
are also in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The other NCAA tournament teams invited are Maryland, Utah, New  
Mexico State, Pennsylvania, Siena and Arkansas State. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the field includes Notre Dame, Kansas State,  
Fordham, Tulane, San Francisco, Davidson and Hofstra. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, which won in 1989, 1993 and 1997, and Indiana, which won  
in 1992 and 1996, are the only others to win the tournament more 
than once. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the teams in the field for the 15th Preseason NIT were  
ranked among the top 14 teams in the final AP poll of the season: 
No. 5 Maryland, No. 6 Utah, No. 8 Kentucky, No. 13 Arizona and No. 
14 Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State was 8-22 in 1997-98 and reached the Final Four last  
season, losing to eventual champion Connecticut in the semifinals. 
Kentucky, which won the national title in 1996 and 1998, lost to 
Michigan State in the Midwest Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	The Preseason NIT opening-round games will be held on campus  
sites on Nov. 15 and 16, while second-round games will be held on 
campus sites from Nov. 17-19. The semifinals and finals will be at 
Madison Square Garden on Nov. 24 and 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Bracketing for the Preseason NIT will be announced at a later  
date. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina beat Stanford in the Preseason NIT championship  
game last season.

<HEADLINE> Broadcasting Boosts Tribune Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Tribune Co., the parent company of the Chicago  
Tribune and the Chicago Cubs, reported higher first-quarter profits 
Tuesday thanks largely to strong gains in its broadcasting 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended March 28, the Chicago-based company  
reported profits from operations of $73 million, or 53 cents a 
share, which excluded several one-time gains. In the same period a 
year ago, the company earned $66 million, or 46 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations of 51 cents a  
share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. The 
company's stock rose $2.12 1/2 or 2.8 percent to $78.31 1/4 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased 7 percent to $719.9 million from $672.7  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribune had a pretax gain of $348 million, or $1.62 a share, for  
the exchange of the company's CBS-affiliated TV station, WGNX-TV in 
Atlanta, and cash for the Fox affiliate KCPQ-TV in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribune also sold 1 million shares of America Online Inc. stock  
for a pretax gain of $95 million, or 45 cents. The gains gave it 
net income of $343.3 million, or $2.61 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Tribune's gains on operating profit came from strong  
returns from its 25 percent interest in the WB network. The joint 
venture with Time Warner has seen significant gains this year in 
audience share with such shows as ``Felicity,'' ``Dawson's Creek'' 
and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' The company also said syndication 
of ``Friends'' has brought strong returns at television stations in 
Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	In the publishing division, operating profit increased 4 percent  
to $103 million from $99 million last year, mostly due to retail 
and classified advertising revenue and lower newsprint prices, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides WGN, Tribune Broadcasting operates 16 television  
stations and four radio stations. In addition to the Tribune, it 
also publishes the Sun-Sentinel in South Florida, The Orlando 
Sentinel and the Daily Press of Hampton Roads, Va.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Extend Aikman's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Troy Aikman signed a six-year contract  
extension that will keep him with the Dallas Cowboys through 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Jerry Jones disclosed the new deal for his star  
quarterback Tuesday during a news conference to announce the return 
of center Mark Stepnoski. The former Pro Bowler was given a 
five-year, $10.5 million contract plus a $3.5 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones refused to disclose details of Aikman's contract other  
than to say it is very salary-cap friendly. Neither Aikman nor his 
agent, Leigh Steinberg, attended the news conference. Steinberg did 
not immediately return a telephone call to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have extended the contract of Troy Aikman to the point  
where this franchise and our fans are sure to have him for the rest 
of his career,'' Jones said. ``We are very pleased this agreement 
has been completed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman, who had three years left on his previous deal, has  
restructured his contract several times before, but he usually 
added one year at a time. Now he's on the payroll until beyond his 
41st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not unusual for teams to sign their marquee quarterback  
past the likely end of his career. Denver has done it with John 
Elway and San Francisco has done it for Steve Young. The teams are 
gambling that the salary cap eventually will go up enough to absorb 
those deals, while giving them the immediate benefit of reducing 
the impact of the quarterback's signing bonus on the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Two seasons ago, Aikman was fed up with the Cowboys. He was  
tired of his teammates' off-field transgressions and felt the focus 
on winning had waned after three Super Bowl victories, something he 
mostly blamed on coach Barry Switzer. Aikman's patience was really 
thin after Dallas went 6-10 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Cowboys reversed their course by replacing Switzer with  
Can Gaily and Aikman's attitude did a 180-degree turn, too. He 
smiled much more often as Dallas won its sixth NFC East title in 
seven years last season, even though they were ousted from the 
playoffs in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``His talent and commitment will help us ultimately get back to  
the Super Bowl,'' Jones said. ``That's his goal, that's what he's 
all about. ... Any time you have ever seen him in any form of 
excitement or frustration it's because of the direction the team 
was going in his mind toward doing things to win the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman and Stepnoski broke into the NFL together in 1989 and  
were a formidable tandem for six years. But Stepnoski signed with 
Houston after the 1994 season when Dallas didn't make re-signing 
him a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepnoski said Tuesday it was the right decision at the time,  
but things didn't turn out as he hoped. The Oilers missed the 
playoffs all four seasons and the team moved to Tennessee halfway 
through his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole emphasis on winning is definitely one of the key  
features that motivated me to come back,'' Stepnoski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepnoski is a bit undersized for a lineman at 6-foot-2, 265  
pounds but he makes up for it with speed and technique. He made the 
Pro Bowl his last three years as a Cowboy and his first two as an 
Oiler. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepnoski's bonus will count $700,000 against the cap each  
season through 2003. His annual salaries are $400,000 in 1999, $1.7 
million in 2000, $1.9 million in 2001, $3 million in 2002 and $3.5 
million in 2003. There are hefty roster bonuses payable in February 
of 2000-2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones isn't done dealing, with several more signings likely  
before the draft begins Saturday. Topping his wish list are 
receiver Raghib Ismail and linebacker Quentin Coryatt. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' negotiations with Stepnoski, Ismail and Coryatt have led  
to an NFL investigation of possible salary cap violations. 
Whistleblowers say the Cowboys agreed to terms with all three 
players but couldn't finalize them until clearing room under the 
salary cap. The team reportedly had about $400,000 before reworking 
Aikman's contract.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Plane Hijacked; 46 Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Fearing abduction at guerrilla  
roadblocks, many Colombians have shunned highway travel and opted 
for airplanes. But the mid-air kidnapping of passengers and crew of 
a twin-engine plane shows even the skies aren't safe. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, 41 passengers and five crew members of an Avianca  
Fokker 50 were snared -- apparently by leftist rebels -- while en 
route from the northeastern provincial capital of Bucaramanga to 
Bogota, capital of Colombia, which has the world's highest 
kidnapping rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The turboprop was forced to land on a remote northern airstrip  
on the lower Magdalena River's flood plain, a sparsely inhabited 
region of fishing villages veined with rivers and dominated by 
Colombia's two main rebel groups, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching from the air, police and civilian pilots saw the Fokker  
50's occupants herded into wooden boats and spirited away by people 
dressed in green. 
</P>
<P>
	``To seize an airplane in order to kidnap its passengers and  
take them from the plane -- I don't think there's any precedent in 
the world for this,'' commented Rep. Antonio Navarro Wolff, a 
respected former rebel and two-time presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Security forces arrived at the crude airstrip in Vijagual, 220  
miles north of Bogota, to find the plane empty, its tires 
punctured, and no signs of a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the  
abductions and President Andres Pastrana's government did not blame 
any specific armed group. It said only that it would ``employ all 
means at its disposal to regain freedom for the plane's occupants 
and return them to their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana dispatched soldiers to the thick jungles and mountains  
rich with gold deposits where the passengers and crew disappeared. 
Used by rebels to hide victims of ransom kidnappings, the region 
has in recent months seen fierce combat between guerrillas and 
their paramilitary foes. 
</P>
<P>
	No senior government officials were aboard Flight 9463, whose  
last radio contact with controllers was a normal exchange two 
minutes after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	An Ecuadorean and an Italian were apparently the only foreigners  
aboard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also among the missing were Luis Florez and his wife, Lilia  
Davila, both 72 and in ill health, said their son German. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father suffered a heart attack three months ago and he  
needs drugs. He's a delicate person,'' he told RCN radio, asking 
they be freed and not made to endure the exhausting treks to which 
rebels often submit their captives. 
</P>
<P>
	Hijacking is not a common rebel practice in this land mired in a  
low-level conflict that has claimed more than 30,000 lives over 
nearly four decades, and where insurgents control about 40 percent 
of the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	If guerrillas of the rebel National Liberation Army were  
responsible, as some officials suspect, they might want to use the 
abducted passengers as bargaining chips to pressure the government 
into concessions in peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the National Liberation Army and the country's largest  
rebel band, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, have 
engaged the government in a peace dialogue with little success.

<HEADLINE> Pulitzer Prizes Are Awarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Journalists whose work shed light on financial  
crises in Asia and Russia, President Clinton's impeachment and 
voter fraud in Miami were among the winners of the 1999 Pulitzer 
Prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also receiving the prestigious honor Monday were authors of  
books on Earth's geology, New York City history and aviator Charles 
Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press swept both photo categories -- something no  
other news organization has done -- for the second time. Other 
double winners were The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the Monica Lewinsky scandal inspired three prize-winning  
entries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Portland, Ore., staffers of The Oregonian washed down  
McDonald's french fries with champagne to celebrate an award for 
explanatory reporting. Richard Read's series followed a load of 
frozen fries from their origin in a field in the Northwest to a 
McDonald's in Indonesia, chronicling along the way the causes and 
effects of Asia's economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times staff, notably Jeff Gerth, won the national reporting  
prize for a series on the sale of U.S. technology to China despite 
security risks. And Washington-based columnist Maureen Dowd won 
commentary for her acerbic work on the Clinton-Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so grateful to President Clinton that he never spoke  
the words, `Young lady, pull down that jacket and get back to the 
typing pool,''' quipped Ms. Dowd, who once wrote of Clinton's 
behavior, ``these are not grounds for impeachment. These are 
grounds for divorce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal staff won for international reporting, for  
``in-depth, analytical coverage'' of Russia's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit-based Journal staffer Angelo Henderson won the Pulitzer  
for feature writing for a piece about a druggist driven to violence 
by repeated holdups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened so quickly, he was just trying to protect himself  
and his co-worker,'' Henderson said. ``It was nothing about malice 
or hatred, but afterward realizing what you've done is tough. ... I 
tried to tell the story of how these two lives collided, and how 
their lives both changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AP won spot news photography with a portfolio of pictures on  
the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and the feature 
photography prize for a ``striking collection'' of pictures of key 
figures and events in President Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky 
and the impeachment crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our photo team made AP and Pulitzer history today. We couldn't  
be happier or more proud,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, AP president 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment provided ample material for another winner: the  
Seattle Post-Intelligencer's David Horsey, who won for editorial 
cartooning. One cartoon, ``Beltway Apocalypse,'' shows ``Mount 
Monica'' erupting in a chaotic capitol. Another had Clinton asking 
his beleaguered wife and daughter if it would be helpful for him to 
say he could feel their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The public service prize went to The Washington Post for a  
series on reckless gunplay by poorly trained police that showed 
that officers in the nation's capital had shot and killed more 
people per capita in the 1990s than any other large American police 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hartford Courant won the breaking news category for staff  
coverage of the murder of four state lottery officials by a 
disturbed worker who then committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Herald won for investigative reporting for exposing  
voter fraud in a mayoral election that was later overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Philips and Michael A. Hiltzik of the Los Angeles Times  
won for beat reporting on entertainment industry corruption and 
Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin was cited for 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Daily News won for editorial writing on financial  
mismanagement of Harlem's landmark Apollo Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke Ellington, who would have turned 100 this year, received a  
special posthumous citation for his ``musical genius, which evoked 
aesthetically the principles of democracy through the medium of 
jazz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For ``Lindbergh,'' winner of the biography prize, author A.  
Scott Berg gained access to some 2,000 boxes of personal papers and 
had unprecedented access to the controversial aviation pioneer's 
family and friends, according to publishers' notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most exciting day since Anne Morrow gave me  
permission to write the book,'' Berg, 49, said in Los Angeles. The 
author of two other biographies said he spent a year trying to 
persuade Lindbergh's widow to agree to the project, and nine years 
writing it. 
</P>
<P>
	John McPhee, a New Yorker magazine staffer since 1965, won his  
first Pulitzer in a long and distinguished career of writing on 
natural history, for ``Annals of the Former World,'' a geological 
history of Earth, the winner in the general non-fiction category. 
</P>
<P>
	McPhee said he was ``100 percent surprised'' by the award.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought my brother was fooling around,'' he said. ``Turns  
out there are a lot more people who are interested in geology than 
people who aren't can imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York professors Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace won the  
history prize for their collaboration, ``Gotham: A History of New 
York City to 1898.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Cunningham's book, ``The Hours,'' won the Pulitzer for  
fiction; ``Wit,'' Margaret Edson's play about a cancer patient won 
the drama prize; Mark Strand won for poetry with ``Blizzard of 
One,'' and Melinda Wagner won the music award for her composition, 
``Concerto for Flute, Strings and Percussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pulitzers, the most prestigious awards given for journalism,  
are presented annually by Columbia University. The awards carry a 
prize of $5,000, except for public service. The organization that 
wins in that category gets a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the 1999 awards, the AP has won a total of 45  
Pulitzers, including 27 for photos. The New York Times has won 79, 
The Washington Post 32, and the Los Angeles Times 24.

<HEADLINE> Widow Testifying in General's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) -- As the widow of the first Marine Corps  
flying ace, Edna Carl wrote thank-you notes to the hundreds of 
people who expressed sorrow at his death, all the time living in 
the house where he was killed in a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the star witness for the prosecution, she will confront  
the 19-year-old man accused of bursting into their home and gunning 
down World War II hero Maj. Gen. Marion Carl in front of her while 
demanding cash and a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements in the murder trial of Jesse Fanus were  
scheduled for today. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for 
the June 28 slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	An Oregon farm boy, Carl won the Navy Cross twice during World  
War II for flying against overwhelming odds in the battles of 
Guadalcanal and Midway. He finished the war with 18 aerial 
victories and met his wife on a war bond tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl went on to fly U-2 spy planes over China, command a  
helicopter squadron in Vietnam and head the Navy test flight 
program, briefly holding the air speed record before it was broken

	In the months leading up to the shooting, the charmed life that  
Carl had enjoyed began to wane. Though he was riding motorcycles 
just six months earlier, he was suffering blackouts and finding it 
tougher to remember things. Doctors told him it might be a series 
of small strokes or the beginnings of Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview last year, Mrs. Carl said the night of the  
shooting her 82-year-old husband went to bed about 9:30 p.m. and 
she stayed up reading. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 10 p.m. she was startled by a man with big sunglasses,  
a sawed-off shotgun and a German shepherd bursting through the side 
door and shouting at her to get her hands up. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearing the ruckus, Carl came out of the bedroom and leaped at  
the gunman as he fired a blast at Mrs. Carl, grazing her head. A 
second blast killed the general. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Carl said she gave the gunman about $400 in cash and the  
keys to her car. The car was abandoned down the road and Fanus was 
arrested a week later in Pasadena, Calif., after a call to friends 
in Roseburg was traced to a phone booth.

<HEADLINE> Slain Ky. Students' Parents To Sue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- At one point in the film ``The Basketball  
Diaries,'' the main character is in a drug-induced haze, imagining 
he is roaming the halls of his high school, firing shotgun blasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 film hit too close to home for the parents of three  
students killed in a shooting spree at Heath High School. They 
filed a $130 million federal lawsuit Monday against 25 
entertainment companies, including the film's producers and 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit says the companies associated with the film, along  
with those that created several popular, violent video games and 
sex-oriented Internet sites, influenced the 14-year-old gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to hurt Hollywood. We intend to hurt the video game  
industry. We intend to hurt the sex porn sites,'' said attorney 
Jack Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 1, 1997, freshman Michael Carneal opened fire with a  
stolen pistol on a group of students in the lobby as their prayer 
group was breaking up. Carneal pleaded guilty but mentally ill to 
murder and other charges and was sentenced to life in prison in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit says the Jim Carroll book on which ``The Basketball  
Diaries'' was based had no shooting episode. It was included in the 
film ``for the sole purpose of hyping the movie and increasing its 
appeal to young audiences. This had the effect of harmfully 
influencing impressionable minors such as Michael Carneal and 
causing the shootings,'' the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
	It also says Carneal honed his shooting skills by playing  
computer games such as ``Doom,'' ``Quake'' and ``Redneck Rampage,'' 
and looked at sexually violent material on at least two Internet 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants include Time Warner Inc., Polygram Film  
Entertainment Distribution Inc., Palm Pictures, Island Pictures and 
New Line Cinema, all of which were involved in ``The Basketball 
Diaries''; Meow Media Inc. and Network Authentication Systems Inc.; 
video game unit makers Nintendo, Sega and Sony; and software 
companies id software inc. and Interplay Entertainment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls seeking comment from most of the companies weren't  
returned Monday. An Interplay spokesman declined comment. There was 
no answer at Meow Media.

<HEADLINE> Defense Tries To Save Ng's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Ng's aunt wept on the witness  
stand while recalling her nephew as a shy and pleasant child who 
smiled when he posed for family photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just like any other kid,'' Alice Shum said Monday,  
speaking through a Cantonese interpreter. ``A regular kid. He was 
shy. He was quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, an emigre from Hong Kong and former U.S. Marine, was  
convicted Feb. 24 of killing six men, three women and two baby boys 
in a spree of kidnapping, bondage and sadism. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty phase began last month and resumed Monday. The jury  
must choose between a death sentence or life in prison without the 
chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng's lawyers began their bid to save his life by calling his  
aunt and a psychiatrist, who said Ng had a mental disorder that 
made him follow the dictates of co-conspirator Leonard Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stuart Grassian described Ng, 38, as a classic ``dependent  
personality'' -- an abused child and someone who would latch onto 
authority figures and do their bidding in order to gain acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles Ng was the type of person that would have ended up in  
South America drinking Kool-Aid,'' said Grassian, referring to a 
mass suicide by poison at Jonestown in Guyana. ``I don't think he 
was predestined in terms of violence or sadism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outline of Ng's life was offered to explain his drift into  
crime, first in the Marine Corps, where he joined others in 
stealing weapons, and then when he joined Lake in torture-murders 
at Lake's home in Wilseyville, 150 miles east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng's penchant for following a leader led him to become the  
lackey of Lake, a survivalist who directed the killing spree and 
committed suicide by swallowing cyanide when police closed in, the 
psychiatrist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassian and Shum both said that Ng's severe personality  
problems developed because of a strict upbringing in Hong Kong, 
particularly at the hands of his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was never encouraged as a child to be assertive,'' Grassian  
said. ``He was always morbidly shy as a child and when teachers 
would say that he didn't speak in class, his father would beat him 
with a cane. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt debased, devalued. He was told he was stupid.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jurors also were shown greeting cards that Ng created for his  
aunt in jail. On one he had drawn an angel and expressed profuse 
thanks for her love. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that it's really a pity,'' Shum said, as Ng watched  
impassively from his seat at the counsel table. ``Just because he 
knew some bad people he became what he is.''
