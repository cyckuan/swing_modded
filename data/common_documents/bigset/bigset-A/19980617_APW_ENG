No easing of curfews during Commonwealth Games: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Curfews in the Malaysian capital
city will not be relaxed to accommodate thousands of visitors
expected during the upcoming Commonwealth Games, a local newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The City Council had proposed extending operating hours of
nightspots, but Noordin Haji Abdul, director-general of the
Commonwealth Games, rejected the proposal, the Star Newspaper said.
	   Noordin explained his opposition by saying overseas fans are not
traveling to Malaysian for its nightlife, but to watch the Games,
the paper reported.
	   Discotheques, karaoke lounges and bars in Kuala Lumpur have to
shut by 1 a.m. on weekdays and 2 a.m. on weekends and public
holidays.
	   The Kuala Lumpur area is expected to swell with more than 4,000
athletes from 68 countries and hundreds of thousands of visitors
for the 16th Commonwealth Games, Sept. 11-21.

King urges Cambodians to overcome election fears and vote 
</HEADLINE>
By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk urged
Cambodians in a statement circulated Wednesday to overcome fears of
threats and intimidation and vote in national elections July 26.
	   The statement was released as Cambodian strongman Hun Sen, the
real power in the country, met a United Nations envoy who was
assessing whether the electoral climate was free and fair enough
for the U.N. to continue to support the planned polls.
	   The opposition has accused Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's
Party of killing and threatening opponents and intimidating voters
in the just-completed registration process.
	   ``As the day of the elections to choose the people's
representatives is approaching, I would like to solemnly appeal for
all my compatriots to not fear concerns about pressure,
intimidation or threats from any person or party,'' Sihanouk said.
	   The monarch said the vote would be ``conducted in a liberal
democracy. Therefore, I ask all of you to exercise your right by
voting freely according to your own conscience and confidence in
any candidate or party.''
	   Hun Sen has called the elections in an attempt to restore the
international aid and legitimacy Cambodia lost when he orchestrated
a bloody coup last year that toppled his co-prime minister, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, the king's son.
	   The United Nations has resisted Hun Sen's attempts to curb the
role U.N. observers will play. Meanwhile, the United States has cut
aid that had been planned for the process, saying the government
was rigging the result in advance.
	   Francese Vendrell, the regional director of the U.N.'s political
affairs department, met Hun Sen early Wednesday and was to hold
talks with opposition leaders.
	   He was to travel to Bangkok, Thailand, later in the week to
attend weekend meetings of the Friends of Cambodia, which groups
Western and Asian nations seeking a solution to the problems opened
by Hun Sen's coup.
	   Vendrell is to report to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who
is to decide by early July whether to continue U.N. endorsement for
the process.
	   Political violence tapered off during the month-long
registration process, which officials said resulted in 92 percent
of the eligible 5.6 million voters signing up.

Thai finance minister hopes to cut interest rates: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Finance Minister, Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda, has told the Cabinet he plans to cut interest
rates to as low as 11 percent, though probably not soon, a local
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   ``I'd be happy to see interest rates around 11 percent to 15
percent to ease liquidity, but that will not be easy,'' the Bangkok
Post quoted Tarrin as saying during Tuesday's regular Cabinet
meeting.
	   Tarrin has been under pressure from his Cabinet colleagues to
cut interest rates. But the government has promised the
International Monetary Fund, which is overseeing a $17.2 billion
bailout of the economy, to keep rates high to stabilize Thailand's
sinking currency.
	   Prime lending rates in Thailand currently are in a range of
15.25 percent to 18 percent. As a result, borrowing costs have
skyrocketed for many Thai businesses, leading to a sharp drop in
manufacturing and consumption.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Detroit Red Wings became the first team to
win consecutive Stanley Cups since 1992, completing a sweep of the
Washington Capitals with a 4-1 victory behind a two-goal
performance by Doug Brown.
	   The Red Wings' second straight sweep Tuesday night also gave
Scotty Bowman a record-tying eighth Stanley Cup as a coach and
capped an emotional and tumultuous season that followed the team's
first championship in 42 years.
	   Six days after the 1997 celebration started, it tragically ended
in a automobile accident that left defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov
and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov with severe head injuries.
	   ``Vlady's spirit was present in us all season long,'' winger
Igor Larionov said.
	   ``This is for this man, who will run and walk again,'' said
Vyacheslav Fetisov, his hand on the shoulder of Konstantinov, who
was wheeled onto the ice wearing a Red Wings jersey.
	   After the teams exchanged handshakes, the Stanley Cup was
presented to Konstantinov, who beamed as it teetered on his lap.
With the Cup still on his wheelchair, his teammates pushed him
around the ice in a victory lap.
	   Konstantinov, considered one of the NHL's top defenseman,
watched the game from the stands at the MCI Center. When the Red
Wings opened a 4-1 lead early in the third period, chants of
``Vlady! Vlady! Vlady!'' cascaded through the arena from the
thousands of Detroit fans who somehow got tickets.
	   When the chants reached a peak, Konstantinov's wife, Irina,
helped her husband to his feet. He waved his fist and the cheers
grew louder.
	   Even Washington fans seemed to join in as their team's first
trip to the NHL finals ended quickly. It was the fourth straight
sweep, the first time that has happened in major pro sports
history.
	   Martin Lapointe and Larry Murphy also scored for the Red Wings,
while goalie Chris Osgood completed a spectacular series by making
30 saves. He allow but seven goals in 99 shots in the series.
	   Brian Bellows, whose wife gave birth to a son between the first
two games of the series, got his second goal in as many games for
Washington. The Caps had the fourth-best record in the Eastern
Conference under new coach Ron Wilson and came into the finals as a
heavy underdog after New Jersey, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia were
eliminated in the first round.
	   ``Guys have different reasons why they want to win,'' Detroit
associate coach Dave Lewis said prior to Game 4. ``The biggest
reason now is for Sergei and Vlady. Not much has been said about
it, but that has been the driving force for this team since Day 1
of training camp.''
	   The accident wasn't the only obstacle in the way of the team's
bid to become the first repeat champion since the Pittsburgh
Penguins in 1991-92.
	   During the offseason, the Red Wings traded goaltender Mike
Vernon, the MVP of last year's playoffs, and decided to go with
Osgood, a younger goaltender.
	   There was further adversity with a contract holdout that caused
dynamic center Sergie Fedorov to miss the first 59 games of the
season. He didn't return until the Red Wings matched a six-year,
dlrs 38 million offer sheet from Carolina, that included a dlrs 14
million signing bonus and a dlrs 12 million incentive clause if
Fedorov's team made the conference final this year.
	   As they have done each game of the series, the Red Wings scored
the first goal. Brown got it on a power play at 10:30 following a
great play by Fedorov, who had the game winner late in Game 3.
	   This time the dlrs 38 million man took the puck from Murphy just
inside the Washington blue line, carried it to the faceoff circle,
turned completely around and finished at the top of the circle. He
made a cross-ice pass that found Brown in full stride and he beat
Kolzig with a wrist shot from the dot in the left faceoff circle.
	   Lapointe stretched the lead to two goals early in the second
period with a shot from just inside the blue line that beat Kolzig
to the right corner at 2:26. Igor Larionov set up the shot with a
pass from the sideboards.
	   They got back into the game with just over 12 minutes left in
the period when Brian Bellows got his second goal in two games by
capitalizing on one of the rare mistakes by the Red Wings' defense,
a turnover by Jamie Macoun.
	   Osgood made a shoulder save on a 20-footer (6-meter shot) by
Bellows a little more than two minutes late to kept Detroit ahead.
	   Murphy seemed to put the final nail in the Capitals with 8:14 to
play on a power play. Tomas Holmstrom controlled the puck behind
the net and eventually found Murphy sneaking in from the right
point for a shot from the faceoff circle that beat Kolzig up high.
	   Brown got his second goal early in the third period, capping a
2-on-1 break with Vyacheslav Kozlov.

Assailants gun down eight people in night of violence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A night of violence in the southern
port city of Karachi left eight people dead, including three
members of the same family, police said Wednesday.
	   Shortly after midnight Wednesday, a lone gunmen broke into a
house in Karachi's ethnically troubled eastern district and killed
a father and his two sons. A third son snuck away, found his gun
and killed the attacker, police said.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the killings and no one
has been arrested, but police suspect the slayings were linked to
the longstanding feud between rival factions of the Mohajir Qami
Movement.
	   The movement, which represents Indian Muslims who settled in
Pakistan after the British departed the subcontinent in 1947, split
apart several years ago and have been battling each other ever
since.
	   In the last two months nearly 100 people have been killed in
Karachi and police say they are all linked to the feud.
	   Also overnight, gunmen killed Khalid Mahmood, the brother of a
mohajir dissident. Mahmood was sitting outside his pharmacy in the
heart of Karachi when gunmen rode by and shot him, police said.
	   A drive-by shooting outside a restaurant, also in the central
district of Karachi, left three people dead and at least nine
others wounded, police said.

Mexican magazine to close after death of founder Octavio Paz 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ One of Latin America's most prestigious
literary magazines is closing, unable to survive without its
founder, the poet and essayist Octavio Paz, who died April 20.
	   Enrique Krauze, assistant director of the magazine Vuelta,
announced that the publication would end a 22-year print run in
August.
	   ``This kind of work ... is just not something which can be
inherited,'' Krauze said.
	   Paz founded Vuelta in 1976, and remained the magazine's director
until his death. He was never replaced in that post.
	   The magazine reflected Paz' increasingly conservative political
views.
	   Paz had frequent disagreements with the leftist movement,
equating Cuban President Fidel Castro with right-wing Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet and calling Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista revolution inconsequential.

Fetisov files suit against driver of limousine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Detroit Red Wings defenseman Vyacheslav Fetisov
has filed a lawsuit against the limousine company and driver who
were involved in last year's accident that injured him and two
teammates.
	   The lawsuit was filed Monday in Oakland County Court. It seeks
unspecified damages from John Gambino, Gambino Limousine and driver
Richard Gnida. It was filed by Fetisov and his wife, Ladlena.
	   Gnida was driving Fetisov, defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov and
team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov in a limousine on June 13, 1997,
six days after the Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup in 42
years.
	   Konstantinov, who attended Tuesday night's repeat Stanley Cup
victory in Washington, is still recovering from severe brain
injuries he received in the crash. Mnatsakanov also sustained head
injuries.
	   Fetisov, 40, had a bruised chest and lung, nerve damage and
severely cut his leg in the crash. Fetisov, the NHL's oldest
player, was able to return to the ice this season.
	   Gnida, 28, is scheduled to be released from jail Friday. He was
sentenced to nine months on a misdemeanor charge of driving with a
suspended license, but is being released two months early for good
behavior.
	   Attorney Richard Goodman declined to say why Fetisov is the only
one to file suit so far in the accident. He said the timing of the
lawsuit _ shortly after the anniversary of the crash and during the
Stanley Cup finals _ was coincidental.
	   ``He (Fetisov) may be playing hockey today, but who knows that
the future holds for him,'' Goodman told The Detroit News. ``We're
concerned for him and his wife.''
	   Cynthia Gillard, Gambino's attorney, said she was disappointed
that negotiations didn't solve issues in the crash.
	   Gambino's insurance company had offered all three players dlrs 2
million to divide. The company said that was the cap of its
liability.

Bill Gates announces launch-date for Japanese version of Windows 
</HEADLINE>
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Microsoft Corp. said on Wednesday it will begin
selling the Japanese version of Windows 98 on July 25, raising
hopes among Japan's computer makers that the product will save them
from another year of falling sales.
	   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates made the announcement at a glitzy
press conference in Tokyo attended by the presidents of giant
Japanese computer makers NEC Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co.
	   Computer manufacturers are hoping Microsoft's new version of its
popular operating system software will revitalize the PC market in
Japan, where sales fell last year for the first time in five years.
	   Windows 98 will go on sale in the United States June 25 even as
Microsoft fights antitrust lawsuits by the government and 20 states
alleging that the software giant illegally used its market might to
stifle competition. Windows software is used on 80 percent of the
world's desktop computers.
	   The government wants Microsoft to remove its browser from the
new version of Windows or include a copy of its chief competitor's
software.
	   But Gates seemed undeterred by the lawsuits, touting the closer
integration of Microsoft's browser into Windows 98 as one of its
key features.
	   ``Our interface innovation is taking the Internet and
integrating it in, making it so you don't have to think of
different ways of finding information that is local and information
that is out there on the Internet,'' Gates told a packed auditorium
of reporters and computer industry people.
	   Computer makers hope that other new features of Windows 98 will
convince many consumers to upgrade their old machines or buy new
ones.
	   Microsoft said Windows 98 will make attaching equipment such as
scanners and joysticks to computers easier by taking advantage of a
new kind of plug which is available only on newer machines.
	   The company also said that software, such as word-processing
programs, will start up 30 percent faster with Windows 98 than with
Windows 95.
	   ``With this announcement I think the PC market will be
revitalized and expand further,'' said Taizo Nishimuro, president
of Toshiba Corp., Japan's second-largest electronics company.
	   Computer sales in Japan dropped 5 percent last year compared to
the year before. Sales of everything from cars to clothing have
been weak as Japan struggles with its worst economic decline in
over 50 years.
	   Minoru Otsuka, the head of the Japan Computer Sellers
Association said he expected the introduction of Windows 98 to
contribute to a 5 percent rise in computer sales this year.
	   Microsoft said the Japanese version of Windows 98 will sell for
the same price as Windows 95 _ 13,800 yen (dlrs 95) for an upgrade
and 24,800 yen (dlrs 170) for those buying Windows for the first
time.

	   At San Diego, Ken Caminiti hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the

	   The Padres moved 20 games over .500 (45-25) for the first time

losing streak.
	   Mike Lansing's homer off Orel Hershiser in the top of the
seventh gave the Rockies a 3-2 lead, but the Giants rallied in the
bottom of the inning against Bobby Jones (1-2) and Dave Veres.
	   Julian Tavarez (3-3), who retired the only batter he faced on a
double play, got the victory. Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his
20th save in 21 chances.

Philippine stocks fall on continued Asian currency uncertainties 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ After a strong opening, Philippine
stocks ended lower Wednesday, bogged down by continuing uncertainty
in Asian currency markets, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 10.37 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 1,716.18 after dropping 20.31 points on Tuesday.
	   The index has lost ground since June 8, shedding a total of
241.58 points, or 12 percent, during the period. Traders blame the
market's weakness on currency travails in Asia sparked by the weak
Japanese yen.
	   The index gained as much as 27 points early in the session
before closing lower.
	   Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president of Diversified Securities
Inc., said the strong market opening was understandable following
the weakness displayed by Manila shares since June 8.
	   ``The peso was strong against the dollar early in the session
and so was the yen. But then profit-taking started setting in,'' he
said.
	   ``We saw a lot of tentativeness in the market. No one wants to
be long on the market right now, so at the first sign of a rally,
investors take profits,'' Garcia said.
	   He said fears of a continuing economic recession in Japan and
the possibility the dollar may eventually hit a high of 150 yen
remained the primary concerns of investors sidelined in Asian stock
markets.
	   Traders said the Philippine stock market was also catching up
with the losses of neighboring markets.
	   Edison Yap, analyst for Philippine Commercial International Bank
Trust, said the Philippines' stronger fundamentals initially
shielded the country from the worst effects of the Asian financial
crisis.
	   ``Investors should now be paying close attention to the
Philippine economy. The unemployment rate is high, the inflation
rate has risen and the gross domestic product is slowing down,''
said Yap.
	   In currency trading, the peso edged higher against the U.S.
dollar in morning trading, buoyed by overnight gains in the
Japanese yen. At midday the dollar averaged 41.713 pesos compared
to 41.876 pesos on Tuesday.
	   The market was relatively quiet compared with the hectic
activity of recent days that saw heavy speculative dollar buying.
	   Dealers said they expect the peso market will continue to
closely track the yen.

	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Scotland has retained virtually the
same team that Australia beat by a record 45-3 margin last Saturday
for the second rugby union test at Ballymore on Saturday night.
	   Backup hooker Kevin McKenzie has retained his place. McKenzie
took the field after only five minutes of the first test in Sydney

Rowen Shepherd, Shaun Longstaff; Gregor Townsend, Bryan Redpath;
Eric Peters, Gordon Simpson, Rob Wainwright (captain), Stuart

Yzerman grabs two trophies as Red Wings win Cup AP Hockey Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes
By KEN RAPPOPORT
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Steve Yzerman, once called a player who
couldn't win the big one, won two big trophies Tuesday night.
	   The Detroit Red Wings won the Stanley Cup for the second
straight year and Yzerman, their captain, was awarded the Conn
Smythe Trophy as most valuable player of the finals.
	   ``No one has ever deserved the Conn Smythe more,'' teammate
Brendan Shanahan said. ``He carried our team through the playoffs
just like a captain should.''
	   Yzerman was the Red Wings' best player in the postseason and it
had to do with more than just his playoff-leading statistics of 24
points on six goals and 18 assists.
	   Not only did Yzerman score, but also worked on the power play
and penalty killing and was a force on defense against whatever
Capitals line was on the ice.
	   Coming into the Cup-clinching fourth game of the finals, Yzerman
had posted the top face-off percentage of 68.2, winning 15 of 22.
	   Yzerman typically deflected the praise.
	   ``We're not a team of stars,'' he said. ``We play together and
have fun together. It's been quite a year and we've been through a
lot as a team. We're having the time of our lives.
	   ``I'm having a lot of fun right now. I once set a goal for
myself to play 20 years. I have five more to go.''
	   For the first 13 years of his career, Yzerman had the label of
not showing up for the big games. He could always score, posting
six 100-point seasons, but his teams never won championships _ that
is, until the Red Wings ended a 42-year Cup drought last season.
	   All the perceptions about Yzerman changed after that, from being
a loser to one of the great captains in the game.
	   Part of the credit went to coach Scotty Bowman, who convinced
Yzerman to become more of a two-way player. But even that took time
to change the image.
	   ``Stevie plays well at both ends of the ice and my understanding
is he's an outstanding leader,'' Capitals coach Ron Wilson said.
``He scored points, he kills penalties, he's on the power play.
	   ``He is obviously their most consistent and important player and
he deserves the award.''
	   Before Detroit swept Philadelphia last year, Yzerman joked that
people would not sit down next to him at a craps table in a casino.
	   But he started to get lucky after that. Yzerman scored in all
four games against the Flyers, and continued that scoring splurge
in the finals against the Capitals this year. He scored in seven
straight games before going scoreless in the clinching game Tuesday
night.
	   No player has had a longer streak since Edmonton's Wayne Gretzky
scored in 12 consecutive finals games in 1987 and 1988. The longest
such streak in Stanley Cup finals history is 15 by Bryan Trottier
of the New York Islanders in the early 1980s.

America's Cup challenge to stay in New Zealand: committee 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) - The America's Cup yachting
committee said Wednesday that 1999 challenger races will be sailed
off Auckland, dismissing calls by a Sydney syndicate to switch the
series to Australia.
	   Challenger committee president Dyer Jones said it was expected
that the challenger race series would be sailed at the same
location that the 2000 Cup races are held.
	   ``I think that it's unrealistic to expect a group of competing
teams, each of whom has a goal _ the idea of winning the America's
Cup _ to expect that they would wish to sail their selection
regatta anywhere but other than where the match itself will be
sailed,'' Jones told The Associated Press.
	   Australian syndicate leader Syd Fischer said this week that
proposals to move the challenger regatta were under serious
consideration and that the sponsor, the Louis Vuitton company, was
unhappy with the New Zealand event for its ``excessive charges and
excessive controls.''
	   One newspaper claimed only eight of the 16 registered challenger
syndicates might turn up to contest the challenger series.
	   But Jones said his committee's meeting with the Louis Vuitton
representatives meant the committee ``have an agreement in
principle and we expect to have a contract very shortly.''
	   Asked in a New Zealand National Radio interview whether the
company representatives were happy, he said: ``Yes, I think they
are ... I just finished two days of meetings with the
representatives of Louis Vuitton, and I think we will find at the
end of it we belong in Auckland.''
	   He dismissed grumbling over the venue and costs as ``normal for
every America's Cup. Everyone is not always happy about all the
details.
	   ``I think in the long run, we're going to find that this will be
a very good regatta held in New Zealand.''
	   America's Cup 2000 New Zealand spokesman Alan Sefton said the
talk of moving the series ``is part of the game, unfortunately _ or
fortunately, depending on how you look at it.''
	   ``It's part of the game to get played, certainly by a person
like Syd Fischer who's been around the America's Cup for a long,
long time.''
	   ``You know we are very used to this. It's what we call throwing
grenades over the wall. Syd doesn't know that we caught it and put
the pin back in.''
	   Sefton said 16 challengers from 10 countries, the biggest
challenger group ever, were still registered to sail off Auckland,
and had paid their deposit fees.
	   ``We now have to wait until the start gun for the challenger
elimination to see how many are going to make it.''
	   The fee levels being paid ``are in proportion to the rates that
we paid in 1995 in San Diego,'' said Sefton. (var/rl/djp)

Over 600 Chinese miners die in two months 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Accidents in China's ill-managed mines killed 634
miners in April and May, the official Legal Daily reported
Wednesday.
	   The deaths occurred in 76 separate accidents, mostly gas
explosions, flooding and shaft collapses, the newspaper said.
	   The debt-plagued mining industry has laid off large numbers of
workers and anxieties about the future have left the remaining
miners inattentive to safety precautions, the newspaper said.
	   Among other reasons cited for the accidents were chronic bad
management, insufficient regulations and the resumption of
production in some mines left idle over the winter.
	   The mining industry last year recorded 7,266 accidents that
killed a total of 11,265 miners, according to official statistics.

Alarm trouble on train delays 65,000 commuters in Tokyo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A malfunctioning alarm forced four trains to cancel
runs and delayed 16 others on Tokyo's key loop line Wednesday,
affecting 65,000 morning rush-hour passengers.
	   The trouble was the second this week on the main 34.5 kilometer
(21.39-mile) Yamanote line circling the heart of Tokyo, said
Hirohiko Ikeda, a spokesman for East Japan Railway Co.
	   On Wednesday, the driver of a Yamanote line train discovered
that an alarm telling the train to stop had come on just as it was
about to enter Shibuya station during the peak of rush hour, Ikeda
said.
	   Because he was so close, the driver drove the train into the
station without stopping. Subsequent service was suspended for
about 20 minutes while officials checked the source of the trouble,
Ikeda said.
	   On Monday morning, a driver on the Yamanote line noticed smoke
coming from under the front car of a train on a parallel track
after both had arrived at Yurakucho station.
	   That caused service on the key artery to stop for about 30
minutes, inconveniencing 165,000 passengers, Ikeda said.
	   Railway officials were still investigating the cause of both
incidents. No injuries were reported in either incident.

Handcrafted pewter medals to be awarded at Commonwealth Games

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Winners at the Kuala Lumpur
Commonwealth Games will be rewarded with medals made of pewter, the
traditional Malaysian alloy, and plated with gold, silver and
bronze, organizers said Wednesday.
	   Each of the 1,340 handcrafted medals weighs 120 grams (4.3
ounces), is 60 millimeters (2.4 inches) in diameter and 6
millimeters in thickness, said the manufacturers, the Royal
Selangor Pewter Factory.
	   Sculptured on the medals are Kuala Lumpur's five main landmarks
_ the colonial High Court building, Parliament House, the National
Monument, the television tower and the 88-story Petronas twin
towers, the world's tallest building.
	   On the reverse is the British crown, once the stamp of authority
in the former British colonies that form the Commonwealth. It is
enclosed by a pentagon-shaped chain symbolizing the Commonwealth's
presence in the five continents.
	   ``The medals are an excellent creative reflection of our
country,'' said Hashim Ali, the chief of the 1998 games organizing
committee.
	   The medals had been handcrafted by a group of artisans chosen
from among the factory's 500 workers.
	   Apart from the medals for winners, Royal Selangor has made
40,000 medals in natural pewter color that will be presented to
participants and officials and also sold as souvenirs. The area of
Kuala Lumpur and its suburbs was once the ancient kingdom of
Selangor.
	   Pewter, an alloy of tin, copper and antimony, is widely used in
crafting expensive vases, tankards, decorative tumblers and
jewelry.
	   More than 4,000 athletes from 68 nations are participating in
the 10-day games that begin Sept. 11.

Report: Estrada would welcome Taiwan's premier 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Philippine President-elect Joseph Estrada
would welcome Taiwan's Premier Vincent Siew to visit the
Philippines, despite likely objections from China, a Taiwanese
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   ``Why not? You must know the Philippines is an extremely
hospitable country,'' Estrada was quoted saying in an interview
with the mass-circulation United Daily News.
	   The Philippines maintains only unofficial relations with Taiwan
in deference to China, which claims Taiwan as a breakaway province.
China objects to any trips by Taiwanese officials to countries that
recognize it, and protested strongly over a rare visit by Siew to
Manila in January.
	   The paper quoted Estrada as saying that he visited Taiwan
frequently during his terms as Manila mayor and senator and had
``many friends,'' here.
	   Though Estrada said he would not visit Taiwan as president in
keeping with government policy, he wants to strengthen economic and
cultural ties, the paper said. Estrada recently invited Taiwanese
shipping magnate Chang Jung-fa to serve as an economic consultant,
the paper said.
	   Chang is chairman of the Evergreen Group, one of Taiwan's
biggest conglomerates and a major investor in the Philippines.
	   Taiwanese are the fifth largest foreign investors in the
Philippines, having poured in more than U.S. dlrs 762 billion into
about 800 projects, according to Taiwan's Economics Ministry.

Asian stocks open higher, thanks to a stronger yen 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets and currencies opened
higher Wednesday, reacting to a stronger yen and speculation that
Washington will step in to prop it up further.
	   Stocks in Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and Jakarta rallied on
bargain hunting and the firmer yen and other local currencies.
	   Only Indonesia's currency slipped, with the rupiah falling
through the key 16,000-per-U.S.-dollar support level.
	   After hovering at eight-year lows of about 145 yen to the U.S.
dollar in recent days, the yen rose Wednesday to as high as 142.38,
on a Japanese newspaper report that a top U.S. Treasury official
was planning to visit Japan, rising hopes that the United States
may intervene to stop the yen's recent slide.
	   But Japanese investment trusts and life insurers later bought
the dollar, sending it to a high of 144.09 in midafternoon trading,
down 2.35 yen from 145.14 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below
its late New York rate of 143.47 yen overnight.
	   Japanese stocks rose, with the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average gaining 8.14 points, or 0.06 percent, to 14,728.52 points
in the morning session. On Tuesday, the Nikkei fell 0.71 percent.
	   ``The stock market is completely focused on where foreign
exchange rates settle,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of
the stock division at Tokyo Securities.
	   Share prices in Seoul soared, with the key Korea Composite Stock
Index rising 7.2 percent at 300.11 points midday, breaking the key
300-point support level for the first time this week.
	   Hong Kong shares also staged a strong comeback on hopes that
Washington support for the yen would soften local interest rates
and pressures on the banking system. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index
closed the morning session up 3.8 percent at 7,814.42.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Strait Times Industrial Index was up
0.8 percent at 1,057.68 on Wednesday morning, after sinking to
another 9 1/2-year low on Tuesday.
	   In Jakarta, the benchmark JSX Composite Index soared above the
key 400-point support level, opening 2.8 percent higher at 410.790.
Dealers said the sharp fall of the rupiah against the U.S dollar
spurred buying in the telecommunication shares.
	   The rupiah fell to 16,150 to the dollar Wednesday morning from a
close of 15,150 the day before, thanks to dollar demand from local
banks, dealers said.
	   Other regional currencies rose sharply as trading opened, but
edged lower as the U.S. dollar rose against the yen later.
	   The U.S. currency rallied to 1.7283 Singapore dollars, up from
an early low of 1.7215. The day before the dollar was at 1.7410.
	   Against Malaysia's ringgit, the U.S. dollar was at 4.0450, up
from 4.0150 earlier and flat compared with its level late Tuesday.
	   Against the Thai baht, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 43.1950, up
from an early low of 43.000, but down from 43.2550 Tuesday.
	   The U.S. Treasury Department said Tuesday it was considering
dispatching Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to Tokyo for
emergency talks over Japan's stagnant economy and sagging yen.
	   Details of the possible trip were undecided, but Japan's Nihon
Keizai financial daily reported on Wednesday morning that Summers
would visit Japan on Thursday.
	   Market participants expect Summers will prod Japan to step up
efforts to boost economic growth and accelerate the write-off of
problem loans at Japanese banks.
	   Some traders also speculate that U.S. and Japanese officials may
be considering some kind of joint action, such as yen-buying
intervention in currency markets, to boost the ailing currency.
	   In other Asian stock markets, Taiwanese shares closed lower on
the back of overnight Wall Street gains. The benchmark Weighted
Price Index ended 0.83 percent higher at 7,466.38.
	   Shares in Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia also rebounded.
	   But Manila's key Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed 0.6
percent lower at 1,716.18, following Tuesday's 1.2-percent decline,
bogged down by uncertainty in the region's currencies.

Howard moves to reassure foreign investors over anti-Asian sentiment 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Australia-Taiwan-One Nation-Investment
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard assured
foreign investors their money was welcome in Australia and warned
that an apparent rise in economic isolationism could cost the
country jobs and economic stability.
	   ``Foreign investment is always welcome,'' Howard said Wednesday
during a tour of Victoria state.
	   He dismissed protectionist policies such as those espoused by
One Nation party leader Pauline Hanson as simplistic.
	   ``Investment is footloose. If it's not welcome in one part of
the world it will go somewhere else and it will take jobs with
it,'' he said.
	   As the first signs emerged Wednesday that the success of
anti-immigration, protectionist One Nation at a recent state
election was affecting the economy, the government took on the
maverick party on several fronts, reaffirming its strategy of tax
reform for an early national election.
	   One Nation has sent shockwaves through Australian politics after
winning around 23 percent of the vote in last Saturday's Queensland
election, much of it taken from Howard's conservative coalition
parties. Recent opinion polls have placed the party's support
nationally in low double figures.
	   Hanson has been criticized as racist for claiming Australia is
in danger of being ``swamped by Asians'' and opposing immigration.
She also opposes special welfare benefits for Aborigines and
advocates protectionist economics.
	   The Taiwan-Australia Business Association said Wednesday it had
fielded inquiries from at least 10 Taiwanese companies which were
reassessing investment plans because they fear One Nation's success
represents a rise in anti-Asian sentiment.
	   The association advised firms to wait until after the federal
election, when the level of national support for One Nation would
be better known, spokesman Jim Sheu said.
	   Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Mark
Paterson said Hanson's views threatened all foreign investment in
Australia.
	   Howard must call an election by March 1999, although Deputy
Prime Minister Tim Fischer suggested strongly Tuesday a poll will
be called before October.
	   After the Queensland result, Howard said the government would
continue with its election strategy of taxation reform _ including
a broad based consumption tax _ and possibly using Aborignal native
title reform as an election trigger.
	   Hanson opposes these and other key election policies, and the
government fears a similar backlash as that suffered by its
colleagues in Queensland.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello Wednesday joined the fight to dissuade
support for One Nation by ridiculing a party official's comments
that low-interest loans to farmers could be funded by printing more
money.
	   ``You can run with pretty slogans about how we're going to make
everybody's life better by printing money, but a moment's thought
about a policy like that will tell you ... it will damage Australia
for generations,'' Costello said in a television interview.

Eds: UPDATES with two bombs explode in eastern neighborhood, one
By ZAHID HUSSAIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Two car bombs rattled the southern port
city of Karachi early Wednesday, injuring one person and sending
dozens of panicked residents running for cover, said police and
eyewitnesses.
	   The bombings followed a night of violence that left eight people
dead, including three members of the same family. A policeman was
also killed.
	   No one took responsibility the attacks and no arrests have been
made, but police suspect they were linked to the relentless
bloodletting between rival factions of the Mohajir Qami Movement.
	   The movement, which represents Indian Muslims who settled in
Pakistan after the British departed the subcontinent in 1947, split
apart several years ago and have been battling each other ever
since.
	   In the last two months nearly 100 people have been killed.
	   The first bomb, hidden in the trunk of a car, went off early
Wednesday outside a small restaurant in the city's ethnically
troubled eastern neighborhood, injuring one person, police said.
The bomb shattered windows and sent debris flying, eyewitnesses
said.
	   Within minutes and barley three kilometers (one mile), away a
second car bomb exploded on a narrow road crowded with shops and
homes. No one was injured, but shaky residents scrambled for cover,
eyewitnesses said.
	   Also Wednesday morning, gunmen broke through the door of a
police officer's home, killed him and fled, police said.
	   Just after midnight Wednesday, a gunmen broke into a house in
Karachi's eastern district and killed a father and his two sons. A
third son snuck away, found his gun and killed the attacker, police
said.
	   Also overnight, gunmen killed Khalid Mahmood, the brother of a
mohajir dissident. Mahmood was sitting outside his pharmacy in the
heart of Karachi when gunmen rode by and shot him, police said.
	   A drive-by shooting outside a restaurant, also in the central
district of Karachi, left three people dead and at least nine
others wounded.

Foreign investment in Vietnam losing attractiveness 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Foreigners are finding Vietnam's
investment environment unattractive because laws encouraging
investment are not properly implemented, officials believe.
	   Authorities meeting last weekend in the first conference to
review investment performance over the past 10 years commented that
the central government is open, but agencies and local officials
obstruct and harass foreign investors.
	   A report on the conference, organized by the Communist Party
central committee's economic commission, was reported Tuesday by
the Liberated Saigon newspaper.
	   The officials concluded that the unstable and changing legal
framework, lack of transparency and loose implementation of laws
have frustrated foreign investors.
	   A report read by Vice Minister of Planning and Investment Do
Ngoc Trinh said as of April the ministry has licensed 2,379
projects with investment capital of dlrs 33.3 billion since Vietnam
opened up to foreign investment 10 years ago.
	   Forty percent of the pledged investment capital of dlrs 12.9
billion has been disbursed over the past 10 years while 374
projects capitalized at dlrs 2.87 billion have been withdrawn.
	   The report said the foreign investment has created 270,000 jobs
and about 200,000 indirect jobs, contributing 8.6 percent of gross
domestic product in 1997, up from 2 percent in 1992.
	   Foreign investment's share of the total investment of the
country has increased to 33 percent since 1995, up from 22 percent
during 1991-1995.
	   However, newly pledged foreign investment dropped almost 50
percent last year and was down 20 percent in the first five months
of 1998. Much of this was because 70 percent of such investment
comes from Asian neighbors hard-hit by the regional crisis.
	   The government's hopes to fill the gap by investors from the
United States and Europe have not been realized, partly because the
government is slow to issue approval.

Communist rebels to continue peace talks under Estrada government 
</HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Communist rebels said Wednesday they
will continue peace negotiations with the administration of
incoming President Joseph Estrada, but rejected any prior
cease-fire agreement.
	   President Fidel Ramos, whose six-year term ends June 30, began
talks with the National Democratic Front, the left-wing umbrella
organization, a few months after he took office in June 1992.
	   ``The NDF is committed to continue the talks under the Estrada
administration,'' said Luis Jalandoni, the chief rebel peace
negotiator.
	   Jalandoni, however, said the rebels were ``seriously concerned''
about reports that the outgoing Ramos government and the incoming
Estrada administration have agreed to demand a cease-fire for the
duration of the talks.
	   Jalandoni said a cease-fire before substantial agreements are
reached would be a ``framework of capitulation'' for the rebels.
	   ``Once the NDF gives up its armed struggle, the (government)
will be completely free to violate human rights and would not be
compelled to continue the talks,'' Jalandoni said. ``Without the
armed strength ... the revolutionary movement would be stripped of
its capacity to negotiate in behalf of the people.''
	   NDF and government negotiators have reached an accord on respect
for human rights and international humanitarian laws, the first of
four major agreements envisioned before a final political
settlement, but Ramos has hesitated in approving the accord. He
gave his endorsement ``in principle'' on the condition of a
cease-fire.
	   The government says all four agreements should be formally
approved by the president at the same time. The three other
agreements are to cover social and economic reforms, political
reforms and disposition of forces.
	   The government and the rebels have accused each other of
violating temporary cease-fires in the past.
	   The insurgency began in 1969 and expanded rapidly under the
dictatorship of the late President Ferdinand Marcos. It peaked in
the mid-1980s but has since weakened because of battle casualties,
surrenders and factionalism.

Six Russians in Far East die of tick-borne encephalitis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Six people in Russia's Far East have died of
tick-borne encephalitis this summer, a news agency reported
Wednesday.
	   More than 80 people in the Primorye territory, including 17
children, are being treated for the illness, the Interfax news
agency said, citing the local epidemic station in the Krasnoarmeysk
district, near the Far East port of Vladivostok.
	   It said that six people had died of encephalitis so far this
summer, although doctors have ``all the necessary drugs at their
disposal.''
	   The epidemic station warned that people can contract the illness
from unboiled goat's milk as well as from ticks, Interfax said.

Economic Adviser: Banks not being coerced to lower interest rates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's top economic adviser
Wednesday dismissed talk that banks were being coerced to lower
interest rates.
	   ``We can persuade them, that's all. They run their banks. They
should know their customers,'' said Daim Zainuddin, a former
finance minister and confidante of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   But he admitted backing Mahathir's calls for loans to be granted
more freely at lower rates.
	   ``If they have money, banks should lend to the private sector,
to let them carry on with their activities,'' Daim said.
	   Daim and Mahathir have been at odds with the position taken by
Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the central bank that interest
rates should remain high to stabilize the shrinking economy.
	   Mahathir lashed out at commercial banks Tuesday for tightening
conditions on new loans. Many banks, already burdened with bad
debts, have cut back lending fearing that loans will not be repaid.
	   ``We are having too many problems with banks,'' Mahathir said.
``They won't lend money, they keep their money, they pull back
credit lines, all kinds of things they are doing which are stifling
the economy.
	   ``If the economy goes into contraction, it's the banks that will
also fail,'' the premier added.
	   Over the weekend, Mahathir said a new ``formula'' was being
considered to calculate new interest rates. Daim would not reveal
details of the plan, which was clearly designed to lower interest
rates, currently ranging from 12 to 20 percent.
	   ``We've been doing well all this while because interest rates
are reasonable. If interest rates are too high, which private
sector can succeed?'' Daim asked. ``If the private sector does well
it is good for the country. Now the private sector is not doing
well.''
	   Malaysia's economy shrank 1.8 percent in the first three months
of 1998, compared with 6.9 percent growth the previous quarter.
	   Many private economists predict it could contract 3 percent this
year, with non-performing loan levels reaching more than 30
percent.
	   Daim also shrugged off suggestions that Malaysia was in denial
over its economic problems, saying that ``we are attending to these
problems.''
	   He added that if Malaysia was in denial, its government would
not have created the National Economic Action Council last year as
a task force to tackle the economic situation.
	   So far, though, the body has done little except act as a
sounding board for disgruntled business leaders.

Six Russian military satellites go into wrong orbit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Six military satellites launched by Russia's
Strategic Missile Forces have gone into the wrong orbit but can
still be used as planned, officials said Wednesday.
	   The six Kosmos satellites were launched from the Plesetsk
cosmodrome by a Tsiklon-3 booster at 2:58 a.m. Tuesday (2258 Monday
GMT). By Tuesday evening, some of the satellites were reported to
have trouble finding their proper orbits. On Wednesday, officials
said all six had gone astray.
	   The military still planned to use the satellites, but some
settings for working with them will have to be adjusted, Interfax
news agency quoted an unidentified military official as saying.
	   The problem was caused by an incorrect command sent by the
booster's accelerating block, the official was quoted as saying.
	   The military communication satellites are to be used by the Main
Intelligence Department of the Russian Defense Ministry, the report
said.
	   The Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 500 kilometers (312 miles) below
the Arctic Circle in northwestern Russia, is used mostly for
military satellite launches.
	   Russia also uses the Baikonur cosmodrome, leased from Kazakstan,
for international satellite launches and manned space flights.
Baikonur is closer to the equator, allowing launches of satellites
to higher orbits using less powerful boosters.
	   Russia's cash-starved space agency has pinned its hopes for
survival on commercial satellite launches and other international
satellite programs.

Crippled Ethiopian veterans sign up to fight former Eritrean allies

<TEXT>
	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ Using his one good arm, Weldeslase
Hailu pulled an assault rifle off the stump of his left shoulder,
propped it up against his chest and took aim. His one good eye
sparkled.
	   Weldeslase lost his left arm and eye to heavy artillery during
the 17-year war his people fought alongside Eritrean rebels to
overthrow Ethiopia's Marxist dictatorship.
	   Many members of local militias kept their weapons after the war
and Weldeslase and fellow wounded veterans are ready to go back to
war, this time to fight Eritrean troops massed along their common
border.
	   ``I want to go to the war front to fight but the government
won't let us because we are already wounded,'' the disappointed
veteran said, scars along the right side of his face and mouth
twisting with his bitter smile.
	   ``We fought against the (former regime) not only to end the war
but to bring a better life to our people and recover the economy. I
lost parts of my body for this. But the Eritreans have attacked us
and brought us war.''
	   Since border clashes erupted May 6, Ethiopia and Eritrea have
been locked in a battle that has shocked and disappointed the
people of both countries. Sporadic fighting on three fronts has
left hundreds dead, with each side blaming the other for the
violence.
	   The United States announced Sunday that it had secured an
agreement from both governments to halt all air attacks, but ground
battles are expected to continue.
	   Drawn by patriotic spirit and fury at Eritrea's bombing of
civilian targets that killed 48 people, hundreds of aging and
wounded Ethiopian veterans of the last war have signed up to fight
again.
	   Of the 500 disabled veterans who have come forward in the
northern Tigray region _ home of the majority of the Ethiopian
rebel force that brought Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to power in
1991 _ 200 have been accepted back, according to an Adigrat
official who gave his name only as Allem.
	   Men with head wounds and others in wheelchairs have come forward
hoping to help defend their country.
	   For some, it is little more than a wish.
	   ``If I was able to walk as I did when I was fighting the (former
regime), I would volunteer to go to the front,'' said Tadele
Gebrekiros, 31, who lost both legs and partial use of his arms when
he stepped on a land mine in 1988.
	   Mehare Gebre Abezgi spent a year learning to walk again after
enemy guns shattered his left calf in 1990. Now 34, the limping
veteran performed his rifle drills Sunday, struggling to get up
from a defensive spread-eagle position.
	   ``I know that I am a handicapped soldier, but the Eritreans are
forcing me to rejoin the war effort because they have overrun my
country,'' Mehare said. ``Their actions made me angry because we
fought together and made great history together and then we
expected peace and development and to work together.''
	   Mehare, whose wife is also a wounded former fighter, said his
family has encouraged him to fight again.
	   ``I may not be as strong physically, but my national spirit is
strong,'' he said.
	   Two years after assisting Ethiopian rebels to take control,
Eritrea achieved its 30-year struggle for independence from
Ethiopia. But close relations quickly strained over border and
economic issues that worsened when Eritrea introduced its own
currency last year.
	   Trade between the two countries waned as Ethiopia began moving
goods through the port of Djibouti instead of Eritrea's Assab and
Massawa ports, and tensions then spiraled into battle.
	   In Tigray, the fight is personal, with many saying they feel
friends have turned on them. Nationalistic pride is running strong
and officials say thousands of former fighters have volunteered and
been retrained to move to the front lines.
	   ``I never expected to fight again,'' said Gebre Amlak, who lost
his left foot and calf in battle in 1988. ``But now this has
happened and I will fight. ... I am ready to give up not just my
leg but also my life.''

Tokyo stocks mixed, dollar falls against yen 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES thruout closing stocks, midafternoon dollar bonds
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar declined against the yen Wednesday
amid speculation the United States may try to help stem the yen's
recent slide. Tokyo stock prices closed mixed.
	   The dollar bought 143.26 yen at midafternoon, down 1.88 yen from
145.14 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
rate of 143.47 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 5.00 points, or 0.03 percent, closing at 14,715.38. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei average had fallen 104.79 points, or 0.71
percent.
	   Traders locked in profits on the dollar following reports that
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers would make an
emergency trip to Tokyo on Thursday to discuss Japan's stagnant
economy and sagging yen.
	   But the dollar rebounded slightly compared to its levels earlier
Wednesday as Japanese institutional investors bought the U.S.
currency on dips, traders said.
	   In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the
United States continues to worry about the weak yen.
	   ``It's been of enormous concern to us,'' Rubin said. ``We have
been very actively involved in talking to Japan for the past 18
months, publicly and privately, about weakness in the economy.''
	   Concern that the falling yen could throw other Asian countries
into further economic turmoil has also led Asian officials to urge
Japan to stabilize its economy.
	   Market participants expect Summers will prod Japan to step up
efforts to boost economic growth and accelerate the write-off of
problem loans at Japanese banks.
	   Some traders also speculated that U.S. and Japanese officials
may be considering some kind of joint action, such as yen-buying
intervention in currency markets, to boost the ailing currency.
	   On the stock market, prices started sharply higher on the yen's
rise against the dollar and higher futures prices. But most of the
early gains were wiped out as the dollar began to regain ground
against the yen.
	   ``The stock market is completely focused on where foreign
exchange rates settle,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of
the stock division at Tokyo Securities.
	   Stocks were also dragged down by weakness in banking shares,
especially those of Japan's Long-Term Credit Bank, which is fending
off rumors that it is in financial difficulty.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 0.37 points, insignificant in percentage
terms, to 1,156.84. It had declined 10.74 points, or 0.92 percent,
the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 192 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.225 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.210 percent, driving its price down to 111.81 yen from 111.93
yen.

Joy in Woodward's hometown after court ruling, but press reserved With US-Au Pair 
</HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Louise Woodward's delighted supporters are
preparing to welcome her home. But for her parents, the campaign to
have her declared innocent goes on, a family friend says.
	   ``I'm sure the Woodwards will want to clear their daughter's
name,'' said Sandra McCabe, a leading campaigner for the release of
the former British au pair convicted of the manslaughter of a baby
in her care.
	   She said many campaigners now feel they have done enough. ``I
always said that when Louise was on her way home our job was
done,'' she said. ``We'll leave it up to the scientists now.''
	   Louise Woodward's mother said Tuesday it was ``absolutely
fantastic'' that her daughter would be coming home at last after
being convicted of killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen.
	   But Susan Woodward had nothing more to say to reporters, and the
reaction in the family's hometown was notably subdued after the
appeals court in Massachusetts cleared the way for Ms. Woodward,
20, to leave the United States.
	   The court upheld a ruling by the trial judge, Superior Court
Judge Hiller B. Zobel, that Ms. Woodward's sentence for
second-degree murder should be reduced to manslaughter and the
length of sentence to the time in prison she had already served.
	   ``I'm really pleased with the news, but I'm surprised. I thought
people would have been here in the thousands,'' said Thomas
Maddocks, 78, who on Tuesday found just a few drinkers at the
Rigger pub, which has served as headquarters for local supporters.
	   The pub had been packed on the October day when Ms. Woodward was
convicted of killing Matthew Eappen, and again on Nov. 10 when her
sentence was reduced.
	   Gareth Jones, a supporter of Woodward's appeal fund, said people
in Elton had learned from the negative reaction to their jubilation
when Zobel reduced the sentence.
	   Julie Smith, the Rigger landlady, said locals have ``not
forgotten that a baby was killed. We've all got children or
grandchildren.''
	   ``I'm scared to say anything in case it might get
misconstrued,'' she added.
	   In a statement he read to reporters, Woodward attorney Paul
Barrow said Ms. Woodward ``will continue to maintain her innocence
and a statement in fact has already been made by her American
lawyers a short time ago, stating the injustice that they consider
she has suffered.''
	   There was speculation that Britain's voracious tabloids are
secretly competing to buy Ms. Woodward's story, despite an
agreement among newspaper editors not to pay convicted felons. The
Guardian reported she was being offered six-figure sums.
	   Most of Britain's 10 national daily newspapers reported the
ruling with caution, shying away from celebratory headlines.
	   The tabloid Daily Mail commented that ``justice has been done''
through the checks and balances of the American legal process,
while the newspaper's columnist Lynda Lee-Potter urged readers to
remember that ``two families had their lives torn asunder'' when
Matthew Eappen died.
	   ``This is not a time for victory salutes, triumphant punches in
the air, or bonfires and parties in the street. A child died, so
how can anyone celebrate?'' she wrote.
	   An editorial in the Independent echoed that sentiment and
suggested the overriding emotion at the conclusion of the case was
relief, not exultation.
	   The Daily Telegraph warned against hailing Ms. Woodward as a
heroine on her return.
	   ``Not all of our passport holders deserve unquestioning national
support whenever they fall foul of foreign jurisdictions,'' the
newspaper said. ``The British lion is making a mistake if it roars
for Woodward. The death of a child is immensely sad, not a matter
for popping champagne corks.''

Scientists see hope for cervical cancer vaccine AP Medical Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Katherin in 4th graf is correct
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have begun human testing of a
possible vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, the first step in what
it is hoped will prove a way to protect girls from ever catching a
virus that causes this cancer.
	   It's far too soon to know if Merck and Co.'s experimental
vaccine, unveiled at a biotechnology meeting here this week, will
work. The company is in the first stage of testing, to make sure
the vaccine is safe enough to study in large numbers of women.
	   But it's a long-awaited step.
	   ``We have an exciting opportunity,'' said Dr. Katherin Jansen,
Merck's lead scientist, as she reported that the vaccine seemed
highly effective in animals.
	   At issue is human papilloma virus, or HPV, one of the most
common sexually transmitted disease.
	   Up to 40 million Americans are infected with one of 80 strains
of HPV, and untold millions worldwide are infected too. The virus
is harmless to the vast majority _ but a tiny percentage of women,
perhaps 1 percent, get one of a few dangerous strains that actually
cause cervical cancer.
	   The dilemma: Nobody knows in advance which women will get sick.
	   But every year, half a million women worldwide get cervical
cancer. That includes almost 16,000 Americans, 5,000 of whom die,
says the American Cancer Society.
	   Pap smears are simple, lifesaving tests that detect the very
beginnings of cervical cancer so doctors can remove the lesions
before women ever get sick. Such surgery is performed on tens of
thousands of U.S. women annually.
	   But persistent HPV infection increases a woman's risk of
cervical cancer 40-fold, Jansen said. So whenever a woman is
diagnosed, usually because she complains of virus-caused genital
warts or has an abnormal Pap, she needs extra testing.
	   That's why doctors would prefer a vaccine.
	   One strain linked to half of all cancer cases is called HPV-16,
and that is Merck's target. The idea is to one day vaccinate girls
around age 10, before they have sexual contact that puts them at
risk of catching HPV, and also give a booster dose during college.
	   The field is heating up: MedImmune Inc., a small Maryland
biotechnology company, is working on a similar vaccine against
HPV-16. In January, the company signed a deal worth dlrs 85 million
giving SmithKline Beecham rights to market the vaccine if the work
pans out.
	   Experts note that this early research isn't aimed at complete
protection. HPV-16 plus three other strains are responsible for 85
percent of all cervical cancers, so a four-pronged vaccine would be
ideal.
	   Still, ``people have been looking for an HPV vaccine for a long
time,'' said Gregory Milman of the National Institutes of Health.
``It's been very hard to (manufacture) HPV proteins,'' an important
vaccine ingredient. That Merck found a possible solution is
intriguing, he said.
	   Merck genetically engineered ``virus-like particles,'' or VLPs,
to use in making the experimental vaccine. VLPs can induce the
immune system to produce potent antibodies, immune cells that
target and kill the virus, Jansen explained. These antibodies
proved protective in animal studies, persuading Merck to begin
Phase I testing of the vaccine's safety in women, she said.
	   Phase II tests to see if the vaccine is protective in women
might begin by the end of this year, she said.

Detroit ecstatic as the Wings capture Game 4 and Stanley Cup 
</HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ The streets of Detroit ran red and white early
Wednesday as hundreds of fans celebrated the Red Wings' second
consecutive Stanley Cup win by chanting, dancing and waving brooms
in the air.
	   After the roar died down from a sold-out Joe Louis Arena, where
people watched the 4-1 win over the Washington Capitals on
television, fans streamed into the streets of downtown Detroit to
congratulate any and every passerby and chant, ``Sweep! Sweep!
Sweep!''
	   ``Hopefully, we'll be back for a three-peat,'' said Mark Davis,
25, of Detroit, who came to the city's Spirit of Detroit statue
clutching two brooms.
	   The dancing in the street wasn't just confined to the Motor
City. In Washington, Wings fan Michael Sullivan, 23, danced a jig
in the middle of the street outside the MCI Center arena.
	   ``I think they won this one for the city,'' said Sullivan, one
of the thousands of Detroit fans to make the trip. ``You don't see
that kind of loyalty in pro sports anymore. Hockey is definitely a
passion in Detroit. I don't think that people realize how much
Detroit loves the sport.''
	   When the Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup in 42 years last
June, their celebration was cut short by a limousine accident just
six days later that injured three team members.
	   The celebration began again on Tuesday and will continue
Thursday, when a parade and rally are planned.
	   ``It's just great for the city all around,'' said Joe Marion,
27, of Newport, who was watching the game with his buddies and
puffing on a victory cigar at Nemo's Bar. ``Every time a Detroit
team wins a championship, it just brings everyone together.''
	   ``For the second year, the Red Wings' teamwork and masterful
play have helped them capture one of the greatest trophies in
professional sports,'' said Mayor Dennis Archer. ``I congratulate
them on keeping Lord Stanley's cup in Hockeytown.''
	   Fans in suburban Detroit also took to the streets. In Roseville,
police were forced to shut down Gratiot Avenue, while in Royal Oak
police closed Main Street because of gridlock.
	   In Detroit, highway exits leading to downtown were shut down
just before midnight as the city became gridlocked with revelers,
Detroit police public information officer Ricardo Moore said. He
said he knew of no arrests late Tuesday night.
	   Police Chief Isaiah McKinnon kept an eye on the crowd at the
Spirit of Detroit statue, which had been adorned with a huge Red
Wings jersey all week. The jersey was removed Tuesday night as a
precaution.

Taiwan investors fear anti-Asian sentiment in Australia investment decisions 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Taiwan Sugar saying One Nation hasn't influenced
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Taiwanese companies are reassessing
plans to invest in Australia because of the rise of the
anti-immigration, protectionist political party One Nation, a
Taiwanese business leader said Wednesday.
	   In the first sign that the party's success in a state election
last weekend was affecting the Australian economy, the
Taiwan-Australia Business Association said potential business
investors feared anti-Asian sentiment.
	   ``Quite a big number of companies called to this office to ask
our opinion,'' association spokesman Jim Sheu said on Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio from Brisbane.
	   ``They are really concerned because Taiwanese newspapers and TV
put the headlines that say One Nation is anti-Asian,'' he said.
	   One Nation has sent shockwaves through Australian politics after
winning around 23 percent of the vote in last Saturday's Queensland
election. Recent opinion polls have placed the party's support
nationally in low double figures.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has been criticized as racist
for claiming Australia is in danger of being ``swamped by Asians''
and opposing immigration. She also opposes special welfare benefits
for Aborigines and advocates protectionist economic policies.
	   Sheu said he had told about 10 businesses that he did not
believe One Nation voters were anti-Asian, but advised them to hold
off investing until after the federal election.
	   Prime Minister John Howard is expected to call an election this
year, possibly as early as August.
	   Jim Soorley, mayor of the Queensland capital Brisbane, said
Tuesday the Taiwan Sugar company had canceled plans to invest U.S.
dlrs 12 million (20 million Australian dollars) in the state
because of One Nation's rise and would set up its planned sugar
development in New South Wales instead.
	   A Taiwan Sugar spokesman said later One Nation had not
influenced its investment decisions, and that the company intended
to proceed with a development in Queensland and one in New South
Wales.

Report: Dissidents banned from Beijing because of Clinton's visit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Beijing police have been ordered to stop
out-of-town dissidents from visiting the Chinese capital ahead of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit, a human rights group said
Wednesday.
	   News of the ban came from Mou Chuanheng, a democracy activist
from northeastern China who traveled to Beijing to visit a friend
only to be detained and sent home, the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Mou, who took part in China's seminal Democracy Wall movement of
the late 1970s, said police told him they had received instructions
that because of Clinton's visit starting next week, ``sensitive
people'' like him could not visit Beijing, the Hong Kong-based
group added.
	   The group said police nationwide have warned dissidents that
Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an _ three of the five cities on Clinton's
nine-day itinerary _ were out of bounds for the duration of his
visit, the first by a U.S. president in nine years.
	   Yu Zhihong, a Ministry of Public Security spokeswoman, denied
that police had issued such warnings, saying: ``This information is
incorrect.''
	   The Information Center said Mou arrived in Beijing last week
from the seaside city of Qingdao and was taken away by police from
his guest house on Monday. He was held for a day and then escorted
back to Qingdao, reaching home Wednesday morning, the group said.

Sri Lankan air force attacks Tamil rebel bases 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: Sri Lankan military censors made minor changes in
the following story.
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan defense ministry said
Wednesday its air force planes attacked Tamil rebel positions near
the northern town of Mankulam.
	   A ministry statement said casualties among the rebels in
Tuesday's fighting were heavy, but did not give any figures. The
statement made no mention of casualties among government soldiers.
	   As Israeli made KaFir jets attacked rebel positions, Sri Lankan
ground troops in adjoining areas of Mankulam killed nine rebels in
two attacks.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the reports, as the
government bars reporters from traveling to the war zone. Mankulam
is 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Colombo.
	   For the last 15 years, Sri Lankan troops have been fighting
Tamil rebels who want an independent homeland for the country's
Tamil minority. The Tamils that they can prosper only in an
independent homeland, away from the majority Sinhalese who dominate
this Indian Ocean island nation's government and military. The
government denies it discriminates against Tamils.
	   The troops are now engaged in clearing a strategic road from
rebel-controlled areas, and Mankulam is the last major rebel-held
town along the 77-kilometer (48-mile) road the army has been trying
to capture since last May in the war's longest and bloodiest
offensive.
	   So far, government troops have captured about two thirds of the
highway, with another 27 kilometers (17 miles) to go. The military
admits having lost nearly 1,000 soldiers, and claims to have killed
3,200 guerrillas. The rebels have not given their total casualty
figures.
	   The road would link Jaffna, a former rebel stronghold captured
by the army two years ago, with the rest of the country. Since the
army takeover, Jaffna's half million people have had to rely on air
and sea deliveries for food and other supplies.

More sentences against English, German hooligans 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French courts pursued a crackdown on World Cup
violence by dealing out more jail sentences, convicting two Germans
and three more English fans.
	   Meanwhile, authorities hoping to prevent more hooliganism during
the Cup prepared security clampdowns Wednesday for other high-risk
matches involving the English in Toulouse and Lens over the next
week.
	   Judges ordered two- and four-month jail terms for the three
English fans, after three others were convicted Monday. The two
Germans received three-month sentences, France Info radio reported.
	   Six more Germans were to be judged Wednesday, the radio said.
	   The crackdown followed three nights and two days of violence
around Monday's match in Marseille between England and Tunisia.
More than 50 people were injured and 80 arrested in clashes that
damaged the Old Port district.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement signed an order
Tuesday to immediately expel five English fans and a Tunisian. He
threatened more expulsions if soccer violence recurs.
	   ``It's a message of firmness toward the troublemakers,'' said
Chevenement, who defended how police handled the violence. ``No
excesses will be tolerated.''
	   In addition to the expulsions, five English and three French
suspects in Marseille faced trial July 17. Twenty-five others _ 18
French, six English and a Tunisian _ remained under detention for
questioning Tuesday.
	   Authorities worried about rowdiness at other matches in the 10
French cities hosting the Cup.
	   The southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for England's next
match, with Romania on Monday. About 1,000 English fans were
already reported in France's fourth-largest city, prompting
officials to postpone a weekend music festival until July 11.
	   Officials also considered closing bars early and forgoing large
TV screens like the one on a Marseille beach where ticketless
English fans and local youths fought Monday afternoon.
	   Police Tuesday rounded up 58 ticketless Scottish fans in
Bordeaux before an afternoon Norway-Scotland match, authorities
said. They were kept in a hall to watch the match on TV, then were
to be loaded on their bus and escorted out of town.

Israelis arrested in killing of Palestinian farmer 
</HEADLINE>
By DANNA HARMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli police on Wednesday arrested three
Jewish settlers, two of them minors, in the beating death of a
Palestinian farmer in the West Bank.
	   Police did not give a motive, but one of the suspects reportedly
told investigators he was ``playing a prank'' when he hit the
victim, Abdel Majid Turki, 45, in the head with a wooden bat.
	   Turki was killed near the Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai just
south of Hebron, one of the tensest areas in the West Bank, and
there was concern that the killing would spark new violence.
	   A number of Palestinians and Jewish settlers have been killed in
random political violence in the Hebron area in recent years. The
bloodiest incident was the 1995 Hebron mosque massacre in which a
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshippers.
	   Turki was walking back from his fields along a main road near
Beit Hagai on Tuesday afternoon when he was attacked.
	   Israel army radio said one of the suspects, a minor, told police
he had leaned out of the car he was riding in and struck Turki in
the head with a wooden bat. Turki was taken to a Hebron hospital
with a fractured skull and later died.
	   Army radio quoted one of the settlers as saying they did not
mean to commit a murder, but were simply ``playing a prank.''
	   The three Beit Hagai residents, whose names where not released,
were to be brought before a Jerusalem magistrate Wednesday for a
hearing on the extension of their detention.
	   Efraim Hibsh, a spokesman for Beit Hagai, condemned the killing,
saying the three men ``did not represent the settlement.''
	   ``We participate in the sorrow of the Turki family _ a
neighboring family whose members we all know _ and we strongly
condemn this action,'' Hibsh told Israel radio.
	   Turki was to have been buried Wednesday, but Israeli police took
the body for an autopsy in Tel Aviv.

Japanese and Australian joint venture will create new travel company 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ The hotel divisions of two of the
Asia-Pacific region's largest travel companies announced Wednesday
they will merge to create a new force in hotel management.
	   Australia's Harvey World Travel and Japan's HIS Travel said they
will create a new company, Aurum Hotels and Resorts, to operate and
manage the former's Escape Resorts and the latter's Watermark Hotel
Group.
	   Aurum managing director Peter Nair, who was the regional head of
the Watermark Hotel Group, said the new company would manage 600
rooms in Cairns and the Gold Coast in Queensland state and the Blue
Mountains in New South Wales state.
	   He said the company also plans large-scale development within
the next 18 months to secure another 2,000 rooms in Australia, Asia
and the Pacific for the company.
	   ``What the merger is creating is something that currently
doesn't exist in the hotel industry in the region, which is a hotel
company that not only provides hotel management expertise but is
serviced by the region's major travel organizations,'' Nair said.
	   ``The strength that it gives us in the current economic climate
in the hotel industry is something that can't be underestimated.''
	   Projects under development include hotels in Fiji, Bali, China,
New Zealand and Vanuatu as well as in Cairns, Townsville,
Queensland's Sunshine Coast and the Whitsunday region.
	   Harvey World Travel operates 400 offices throughout Australia,
29 offices in New Zealand and one in South Africa.
	   HIS Travel has 180 offices in 15 countries and handles more than
1.6 million travelers a year.

China passes controls on nuclear technology 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to
arrive for a summit with Chinese leaders, China announced new
regulations Wednesday to more strictly control exports of nuclear
technology.
	   In a brief announcement, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported that the State Council, headed by Premier Zhu Rongji,
passed the regulations at a Cabinet meeting on June 1.
	   Details were not immediately available. But diplomats expected
the controls to match international guidelines governing so-called
dual-use nuclear goods, items that could be used for either
military or civilian purposes.
	   If so, the regulations could blunt persisting U.S. criticisms of
suspected Chinese nuclear technology transfers and improve the
atmosphere for Clinton's meeting in Beijing June 27 with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
	   U.S. suspicions that China has aided programs by Pakistan and
Iran to develop nuclear weapons have been a constant drag on ties.
Beijing's desire for better relations with Washington and fears
that nuclear proliferation could end up hurting Chinese security
have spurred more cooperation.
	   In the past two years, China has worked with U.S. experts to
develop better controls of nuclear exports, and last September
passed rules prohibiting technology transfers to nuclear facilities
not operating under international safeguards.
	   At their summit in Washington last October, Jiang promised
Clinton to draft more stringent regulations. India's and Pakistan's
nuclear tensions and efforts to prevent proliferation are expected
to be on the agenda for the leaders' upcoming summit.
	   Despite the cooperation, U.S. Ambassador to Beijing James Sasser
told reporters last week that Washington routinely uncovers signs
that suspect Chinese technology is leaking out. He added that once
the transfers have been brought to Beijing's attentions, Chinese
leaders have taken steps to halt them.

Suspected suicide attempt sets off apartment blast, killing two 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ An explosion in a Geneva residential block killed
two people when a 60-year-old man's apparent suicide attempt
destroyed his neighbor's apartment, Geneva police said Wednesday.
	   The detonation of around a dozen gasoline-filled bottles in a
third-floor apartment late Tuesday night had the ``effect of a
tornado,'' according to police spokesman Pascal di Camillo.
	   It tore down the apartment's brick walls and set off a fire, he
added.
	   The man living in the apartment where the explosion took place
was known to social services as a depressive, di Camillo said.
	   Fire services also found the body of his 50-year-old neighbor,
who had apparently died in her sleep. Neither victim was
identified.

Consultant arrested with cash and hoarded tickets 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities have arrested a consultant for a
ticket agency in a probe of World Cup ticket fraud that froze out
thousands of Japanese soccer fans, French radio reported Wednesday.
	   The consultant was arrested at his home in the upscale western
Paris suburb of Rueuil-Malmaison, where investigators found ``a
large amount of cash'' and about 100 World Cup tickets, France Info
radio said.
	   The consultant, who was not identified, worked for ISL France,
an official ticket distributor for the World Cup. He was held for
questioning in a jail in nearby Nanterre, the radio said. It did
not specify when he was arrested.
	   Judicial authorities and World Cup officials were not
immediately available for comment.
	   The World Cup organizing committee said Sunday it was
aggressively working to track down anyone involved in ticket fraud.
	   A day earlier, French prosecutors said they would investigate
criminal charges against businesses and individuals involved in the
scams.
	   The fraud is the latest in a more than a year of controversy
surrounding the World Cup ticket sales.
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.7 million tickets
printed, almost 1.5 million were earmarked for interests in the
host country.
	   Soccer federations worldwide and commercial sponsors of the
World Cup received almost 1.2 million tickets to distribute through
their own channels, leaving only 138,000 for the general public.
	   Fans were told to deal with 17 approved agencies worldwide to
get those tickets. But officials said many fans arrived in France
to discover tickets they thought would be waiting for them came
from unlicensed brokers and tour operators, especially in Japan,
where some 12,000 fans were left ticketless.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.

Six Russian military satellites go into wrong orbit mailboxes,'' other details, in new grafs 3-5, minor edits.

Eds: UPDATES with satellites reported to be actually ``spies'
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Six military satellites launched by Russia's
Strategic Missile Forces have gone into the wrong orbit but can
still be used as planned, officials said Wednesday.
	   The six Kosmos satellites were launched from the Plesetsk
cosmodrome by a Tsiklon-3 booster at 2:58 a.m. Tuesday (2258 Monday
GMT). By Tuesday evening, some of the satellites were reported to
have trouble finding their proper orbits. On Wednesday, officials
said all six had gone astray.
	   The satellites, which the military earlier identified by the
generic Kosmos name, were actually of the Strela-3 type _ a
communications system also dubbed ``space mailboxes for Russian
spies,'' the daily Russky Telegraf reported Wednesday, citing army
sources.
	   Strela-3 satellites are used to record radio messages
transmitted by Russian intelligence agents throughout the world.
When the satellites fly over Moscow, they send the messages down to
the intelligence headquarters, the report said.
	   The system was highly classified until Russia's former military
intelligence chief, Gen. Col. Fyodor Ladygin, divulged the secret.
Russia intends to start producing a commercial version of the
satellite to earn some cash for the underfunded space and military
programs, the report said.
	   The Main Intelligence Department of the Russian Defense Ministry
(GRU) still intends to use the six satellites that have gone into
the wrong orbit, but would have to adjust some settings for working
with them, the Interfax news agency quoted an unidentified military
official as saying.
	   The problem was caused by an incorrect command sent by the
booster's accelerating block, the official was quoted as saying.
	   The Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 500 kilometers (312 miles) below
the Arctic Circle in northwestern Russia, is used mostly for
military satellite launches.
	   Russia also uses the Baikonur cosmodrome, leased from Kazakstan,
for international satellite launches and manned space flights.
Baikonur is closer to the equator, allowing launches of satellites
to higher orbits using less powerful boosters.
	   Russia's cash-starved space agency has pinned its hopes for
survival on commercial satellite launches and other international
satellite programs.

Students protesting against Indonesia occupy East Timor's parliament 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of student protesters in
disputed East Timor occupied the local parliament Wednesday to
demand that Indonesia pull troops out of the former Portuguese
colony.
	   Another group of demonstrators marched earlier to the nearby
governor's office with a coffin carrying the body of a man who they
said had been shot by security forces Tuesday evening.
	   Officers killed 21-year-old Herman dos Reis in the town of
Manatuto, 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of Dili, the capital of
East Timor, local reporters said. Officials at military
headquarters in Dili did not comment on the shooting.
	   At the Justice Ministry in Jakarta, meanwhile, about 200 East
Timorese students gathered to urge a referendum on independence and
the release of a jailed rebel leader.
	   East Timorese activists have been stepping up their campaign for
independence in the wake of the resignation of President Suharto,
who ordered the invasion of the half-island territory in 1975.
	   His successor, B.J. Habibie, has pledged democratic reform but
has ruled out a referendum in East Timor, saying it must remain
Indonesia's 27th province.
	   In Dili, students who marched to the two-story parliament
building carried banners, including one that read ``Cease-fire in
East Timor.'' Security forces did not intervene.
	   The students said they planned to stay in the building until the
weekend.
	   Protesters in Dili and Jakarta demanded the release of Xanana
Gusmao, a separatist rebel leader who was arrested in 1992. Habibie
has said he is considering the release of Xanana, although many in
the military would disapprove of such a move.

Taiwan urges U.S. to safeguard regional peace 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's foreign minister urged the United
States Wednesday to honor its commitments to Taiwan as it nudges
closer to Beijing, saying Taiwan is essential for regional
security.
	   ``If (Washington) gave the Chinese Communists the impression
that an improvement of ties between them would allow it to exert
more pressure on us, this would affect the peace that the U.S. side
has been concerned about,'' Jason Hu told a news conference.
	   Hu also said, however, that Washington has made ``assurances and
reassurances'' to Taiwan that it will not sacrifice Taiwan's
interests at the June 27-28 summit between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing.
	   ``I can't promise this will be the case,'' Hu said. ``I'd rather
believe the U.S. side will keep its promises. I hope it will.''
	   Taiwanese are worried over whether the United States will bow to
Chinese pressure to reduce arms sale to Taiwan and push Taiwan
toward talks with China over reunification.
	   Washington has not put the Taiwan issue on the summit's agenda,
but Hu said he believed the issue would be raised.
	   China may play up the Taiwan issue because it can't defend its
positions on other agenda items, including human rights, nuclear
proliferation and trade, he said.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government driven out of
China's mainland by Communist forces in 1949. China still claims
Taiwan as a renegade province to be reunited with the mainland, by
force if necessary.
	   Washington cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 to
recognize Beijing. But the United States retains strong unofficial
ties with Taiwan, and remains its main weapons supplier.
	   China has accused Washington of selling weapons to Taiwan to
help it resist demands for reunification.
	   Hu said Taiwan does not object to Washington's attempt to engage
Beijing and include China in the international order.
	   ``After all, we also want to see changes in China,'' Hu said.
``But we have demanded that the United States not ignore or harm
our interests in the process.''
	   Hu said Taiwan has U.S. popular support and that he did not
foresee Washington backing down on its commitments to the island
after the summit or within the remaining two years of Clinton's
term.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Six people in Russia's Far East have died of
tick-borne encephalitis this spring, a news agency reported
Wednesday.
	   More than 80 people in the Primorye territory, including 17
children, are being treated for the illness, the Interfax news
agency said, citing the local epidemic station in the Krasnoarmeysk
district, near the Far East port of Vladivostok.
	   It said that six people had died of encephalitis so far during
the tick season, although doctors have ``all the necessary drugs at
their disposal.''
	   The epidemic station warned that people can contract the illness
from raw goat's milk as well as from ticks, Interfax said.

Swiss, U.S. firms sign agreement on prostate cancer treatment 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche said
Wednesday it has signed an agreement with Praecis Pharmaceuticals
Inc. of the U.S. giving Roche marketing rights for a new drug to
treat prostate cancer in the U.S. and other markets.
	   The new drug, Abarelix, is being developed jointly by Roche and
Praecis, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
	   ``Abarelix promises a highly effective and less toxic effect
than currently available drugs'' to treat the disease, Roche said
in a statement. The drug is entering the final phase of clinical
development, it added.
	   The new treatment should allow patients to treat prostate cancer
with one drug, rather than a combination of two drugs, Roche
spokesman Daniel Piller said.
	   Abarelix is a hormonal therapy designed to reduce testosterone
levels, thus impeding tumor growth.
	   Roche believes it ``may significantly reduce'' side effects of
current hormonal treatments, such as hot flushes and bone pain.
	   Nearly 50 percent of the worldwide hormonal treatments against
prostate cancer are prescribed in the United States, Roche said.
Praecis will have the option to co-promote in the U.S. depending on
the sales performance of the drug.
	   Roche will market the compound in Canada, Asia, Japan and
Australia, while France's Synthelabo has marketing rights in Europe
and elsewhere, the company said.
	   Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among U.S.
men and the second deadliest, behind lung cancer. The American
Cancer Society estimates that 184,500 U.S. men will be diagnosed
with the disease this year; 39,200 will die.

King urges Cambodians to overcome election fears and vote Vendrell-Hun Sen meeting in grafs 9-13; edits to conform

By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk urged
Cambodians in a statement circulated Wednesday to overcome fears of
threats and intimidation and vote in national elections July 26.
	   The statement was released as strongman Hun Sen, the real power
in the country, met a U.N. envoy who was assessing whether the
electoral climate was free and fair enough for the United Nations
to go on supporting the polls.
	   The opposition has accused Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's
Party of killing and threatening opponents and intimidating voters
in the just-completed registration process to coerce their support.
	   Political violence tapered off during the monthlong registration
process, in which officials said 5.33 million of the 5.6 million
estimated to be eligible signed up.
	   ``As the day of the elections to choose the people's
representatives is approaching, I would like to solemnly appeal for
all my compatriots to not fear concerns about pressure,
intimidation or threats from any person or party,'' Sihanouk said.
	   The monarch said the vote would be ``conducted in a liberal
democracy. Therefore, I ask all of you to exercise your right by
voting freely according to your own conscience and confidence in
any candidate or party.''
	   Hun Sen has called the elections in an attempt to restore the
international aid and legitimacy Cambodia lost when he orchestrated
a bloody coup last year that toppled his co-prime minister, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, the king's son.
	   The United Nations has resisted Hun Sen's attempts to curb the
role U.N. observers will play. Meanwhile, the United States has cut
aid that had been planned for the process, saying the government
was rigging the result in advance.
	   Francese Vendrell, the regional director of the United Nations'
political affairs department, met Hun Sen for more than two hours
early Wednesday and was to hold talks with opposition leaders
later.
	   Vendrell described the meeting as very frank and open. He said
he was satisfied that Hun Sen ``has been willing to take into
account the suggestions and issues I've brought up with him,
largely regarding the elections.''
	   Chum Bun Rong, an adviser to Hun Sen, said the co-premier gave
Vendrell a guarantee that the elections will be conducted in a
free, fair and completely neutral atmosphere.
	   He said Hun Sen told Vendrell that a ban on demonstrations was
meant just to curb ``anarchic'' demonstrations in unapproved sites
where adequate security could not be arranged.
	   He said Hun Sen also informed the U.N. envoy that the recent
integration of Khmer Rouge defectors and the collapse of key
military bases of the guerrilla group have created favorable
conditions for the elections.
	   Vendrell was to travel to Bangkok, Thailand, later in the week
to attend weekend meetings of the Friends of Cambodia, which groups
Western and Asian nations seeking a solution to the problems opened
by Hun Sen's coup.
	   Vendrell is to report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
is to decide by early July whether to continue U.N. endorsement for
the process.

Israelis arrested in killing of Palestinian farmer home for troubled youths in the settlement 
</HEADLINE>

By DANNA HARMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli police on Wednesday arrested three
Jewish settlers, two of them minors, in the beating death of a
Palestinian farmer in the West Bank.
	   Police did not give a motive, but one of the suspects reportedly
told investigators he was ``playing a prank'' when he hit the
victim, Abdel Majid Turki, 45, in the head with a wooden bat.
	   Turki was killed near the Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai just
south of Hebron, one of the tensest areas in the West Bank, and
there was concern that the killing would spark new violence.
	   A number of Palestinians and Jewish settlers have been killed in
random political violence in the Hebron area in recent years. The
bloodiest incident was the 1995 Hebron mosque massacre in which a
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshippers.
	   Turki was walking back from his fields along a main road near
Beit Hagai on Tuesday afternoon when he was attacked.
	   Israel army radio said one of the suspects, a minor, told police
he had leaned out of the car he was riding in and struck Turki in
the head with a wooden bat. Turki was taken to a Hebron hospital
with a fractured skull and later died.
	   Army radio quoted one of the settlers as saying they did not
mean to commit a murder, but were simply ``playing a prank.''
	   The radio said the two minors lived in a home for troubled
youths in Beit Hagai, and that the adult was a resident of the
settlement who worked as a driver for the youth home.
	   The three, whose names were not released, were to be brought
before a Jerusalem magistrate Wednesday for a hearing on the
extension of their detention.
	   Efraim Hibsh, a spokesman for Beit Hagai, condemned the killing,
saying the three men ``did not represent the settlement.''
	   ``We participate in the sorrow of the Turki family _ a
neighboring family whose members we all know _ and we strongly
condemn this action,'' Hibsh told Israel radio.
	   Turki was to have been buried Wednesday, but Israeli police took
the body for an autopsy in Tel Aviv.

Cricket coach praises Indian captain for recent wins 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ India is winning now because its
captain Mohammed Azharuddin understands his players better, the
Indian cricket coach said in a newspaper interview published
Wednesday.
	   ``The boys are enjoying it now. There is a lot more fun in the
team and a lot more jokes,'' the Daily News quoted coach Anshuman
Gaekward as saying.
	   Azharuddin captained the Indian cricket team for four years in
early 1990s, but he was replaced by Sachin Tendulkar after the
team's performance deteriorated. Cricket officials said Azharuddin
was unable to lead the team the way he should.
	   But he was handed back the job earlier this year after the
officials felt that the burden of captaincy had affected
Tendulkar's performance as a batsman.
	   ``I think Azharuddin is better off now because he has seen both
sides as a player and as a captain. He knows the sentiments of the
boys and their feelings toward the captain,'' Gaekward, a former
opening batsman, said.
	   Azharuddin has led India to victories against Pakistan and
Australia in recent months.
	   The Indians are in Sri Lanka to compete in a 3-nation
Independence Cup tournament to celebrate the island nation's 50th
anniversary of independence from the British, who introduced the
game during the colonial rule.
	   India will face a tough challenge from host Sri Lanka and New
Zealand in the tournament which begins Friday. The final is
scheduled for July seven.

Emergency program, Chubais' possible appointment to fight financial crisis 
</HEADLINE>

By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government will need all its ``courage
and political will'' to implement a strict emergency program
intended to overcome the nation's financial crisis, Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko said Wednesday.
	   In another move to help boost confidence in Russia's crumbling
markets, President Boris Yeltsin may appoint former deputy premier
and leading reformer Anatoly Chubais as his envoy to the
international lending organizations.
	   The emergency program will be presented Tuesday at a special
Cabinet meeting chaired by Yeltsin and attended by members of both
houses of parliament.
	   ``Some of the program's provisions are going to be unpopular,''
Kiriyenko said, addressing an economic conference of former Soviet
republics in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city.
	   The cave-in of Russia's financial markets late last month
prompted fears of a devaluation of the national currency, the
ruble, which would lead to a sharp rise in prices. Combined with
the government's continuing inability to pay state workers their
wages on time, that could lead to mass protests.
	   Apart from the Asian financial crisis and the decline of prices
for oil and natural gas _ the nation's main export items _ the
recent Russian market collapse has been caused by the government's
free spending, Kiriyenko said.
	   ``The world financial crisis has fallen on fertile ground in
Russia _ that is the crisis of confidence in the system that lives
beyond its means,'' Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   ``Austere budget stabilization,'' will be needed to overcome the
crisis, he said.
	   Last month, the fall in the stock market was slowed slightly by
rumors of an emergency bailout package from the International
Monetary Fund. The IMF confirmed Tuesday that it would send a team
to Moscow next week to discuss new loans to help Russia stabilize
its shaky financial markets.
	   In an apparent bid to boost ties with the IMF and other lenders,
Yeltsin may appoint Anatoly Chubais, former architect of Russia's
economic reforms, as presidential liaison with international
financial institutions. Chubais is ``one of the most likely
candidates'' for the job, Kiriyenko said Wednesday.
	   Yeltsin has twice fired Chubais from his Cabinet, most recently
in the government shakeup in March. He was recently appointed head
of Russia's huge state-owned electricity monopoly, Unified Energy
Systems.
	   Boris Jordan, chief executive of MFK Renaissance, a leading
Russian investment bank, welcomed Chubais' possible appointment,
saying it would stabilize the financial markets in just two months,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Financial secretary: medium-term economic growth forecast not attainable 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's financial secretary said Wednesday
the government's earlier economic growth forecast for the next few
years is not attainable as the region's economic troubles show no
signs of abating.
	   ``Because of the economic downturn, and because of the
performance, for instance, in the fast quarter of this year, I
believe it will be unlikely that we will be able to sustain growth
of 5 percent in real terms in the coming few years,'' Donald Tsang
told reporters.
	   The economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter this year, the
first contraction in 14 years. Officials have hinted the economy
may shrink further in the coming months.
	   Tsang had said earlier that the forecast annual economic growth
of 3.5 percent is unlikely, and he would revise the forecast before
the fourth quarter.
	   Hong Kong has weathered Asia's financial turmoil better than
most countries, but has been suffering from high interest rates and
slumping property and share prices.
	   On Wednesday, about 100 homeowners protested in downtown Hong
Kong, asking for property developers to help them secure bank
loans. They paid down payments on their apartments when the
property market peaked last year, and now have trouble obtaining
loans to cover the balance as property prices have slumped and
banks have been hit by a credit crunch.
	   Property prices have fallen about 40 percent since the market
peaked last summer.
	   Pressure is mounting on the government to adopt more aggressive
measures to revive the sagging economy, such as deeper tax cuts and
more public spending. A coalition of political parties has said
they would back a deficit budget if necessary.
	   But Tsang reiterated Wednesday it is against the government's
policy of fiscal prudence to adopt a deficit budget, meaning the
growth in government spending cannot exceed economic growth.
	   Tsang said he will balance the citizens' pleas for tax cuts and
``the international expectation of investors who want to see Hong
Kong continuing its prudent financial management principles.''
	   Tsang also ruled out a budget cut, saying, ``It is rather a
question of growth, of how much growth we would allow. ... Should
it be 5 percent, or should it be less than 5 percent?''
	   On Wednesday, the benchmark Hang Seng stock index rebounded 6.3
percent to 8,004.35 points, the first time it has closed above the
8,000-point support level since last Tuesday.

When is a Kewpie not a Kewpie? Japan food firm going to court TOK107 
</HEADLINE>
By CHESTER DAWSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The battle has begun. The gloves are off. The cute
little wings are all aflutter.
	   Kewpie, that iconic cherub with the wide-eyed stare, is at the
center of a lawsuit pitting a major Japanese food maker against the
head of a Kewpie fan club who claims to have exclusive rights to
the doll.
	   Kazuo Kitagawa, who acquired the Kewpie doll's Japanese
copyright in May from the Missouri-based Rose O'Neill Foundation,
is demanding 1 billion yen (dlrs 7 million) in damages from _ who
else? _ the Q.P. Corp.
	   Q.P., by the way, is no babe in the woods.
	   It's Japan's biggest producer of mayonnaise and salad dressings,
and has used the doll as its mascot and namesake since well before
Kitagawa was born.
	   Even so, Kitagawa, who runs a doll museum and toy shop in Japan,
says he is only trying to do right by Kewpie.
	   ``Our aim is to promote the true Kewpie,'' Takashi Yamamoto,
Kitagawa's lawyer, told The Associated Press Wednesday.
	   Yamamoto said the suit was filed with the Tokyo District Court
on Tuesday. The damages sought are the equivalent to 100 million
yen (dlrs 698,000) per year in royalties over the past decade _ the
maximum allowed under the statue of limitations in Japan, he said.
	   Rose O'Neill, who died in 1944, created the original Kewpie
doll, which debuted in the December 1909 edition of the Woman's
Home Companion magazine before becoming an international hit.
	   Q.P. is standing by its chubby mascot.
	   Company spokesman Masafumi Taga said Q.P. has the legal right to
the Kewpie figure that adorns bottles of its best-selling
mayonnaise, and cites a 73-year old trademark granted in Japan.
	   ``All Kewpies are not the same. There are many Kewpies,'' said
Taga. ``Kewpies are in the public domain.''
	   That remains a matter for the courts to decide.
	   Japan has long been a haven for outlaw T-shirts, lunch boxes and
coffee cups featuring copyright protected characters.
	   Lawsuits are rare, but not unknown.
	   Bandai Co., the Japanese company that makes the ``Tamagotchi''
electronic pet has recently brought legal action against firms
selling cheap imitations of its toy.
	   Last year, Japan's Supreme Court ruled against a company which
improperly used ``Popeye'' on its neckties in a complicated case
filed more than a decade beforehand by King Features Syndicate Inc.
	   The O'Neill Foundation filed a suit against the Industrial Bank
of Japan Ltd., which also uses a Kewpie doll symbol, in February,
and a ruling is pending.
	   Yamamoto, the lawyer, said that case will be transferred to
Kitagawa's name soon, since the fan club head has acquired the
Japanese copyright from the foundation in the United States.
	   Kitagawa's lawyers have also threatened suits against four
manufacturers of plastic Kewpie dolls in Japan unless royalties are
paid.
	   They may only have a little while longer to collect, however.
	   Lawsuits often take years to wind their way through Japan's
notoriously slow court system, and the original patent on the
Kewpie doll that Kitagawa acquired expires in 2005.

Israelis arrested in killing of Palestinian farmer home for troubled youths 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with radio report saying minors are residents of a
By DANNA HARMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli police on Wednesday arrested three
Jewish settlers, two of them minors, in the beating death of a
Palestinian farmer in the West Bank.
	   Police didn't give a motive, but one of the suspects reportedly
told investigators he was ``playing a prank'' when he hit the
victim, Abdel Majid Turki, 45, in the head with a wooden bat.
	   Turki was attacked near the Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai just
south of Hebron, one of the tensest areas in the West Bank, and
there was concern that the killing would spark new violence.
	   A number of Palestinians and Jewish settlers have been killed in
random political violence in the Hebron area in recent years. The
bloodiest incident was the 1995 Hebron mosque massacre in which a
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshippers.
	   Israel army radio said one of the suspects, a minor, told police
he had leaned out of the car he was riding in and struck Turki in
the head with a wooden bat. Turki was taken to a Hebron hospital
with a fractured skull and later died.
	   Army radio quoted one of the suspects as saying they didn't mean
to kill anyone, but were simply ``playing a prank.''
	   The radio said the two minors lived in a home for troubled
youths in Beit Hagai, and that the adult was a resident of the
settlement who worked as a driver for the youth home.
	   The three, whose names where not released, were to be brought
before a Jerusalem magistrate Wednesday for a hearing on the
extension of their detention.

An overnight summary of Caribbean news ST. VINCENT: Election losers accuse prime minister of fraud, bribery 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Crying foul, the opposition Unity
Labor Party of St. Vincent and the Grenadines called Tuesday for
new elections.
	   The Laborites narrowly lost to Prime Minister James Mitchell's
National Democratic Party on Monday, winning seven of 15 Parliament
seats.
	   Opposition party officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they were discussing protests and possibly strikes to force a
re-election within six months.
	   ``In spite of glaring electoral irregularities, fraud, bribery
and intimidation, the Unity Labor Party received over 4,000 votes
more than the NDP,'' said a statement from Labor leader Vincent
Beache.
	   Labor won 27,506 votes to the Democrats' 23,219 but got fewer
seats because of the proportional representation system inherited
from British colonizers.
 &UR; NEW YORK: Man strikes plea deal in 1969 Cuba hijacking
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Even the judge agreed that a Canadian man
accused in a three-decade-old hijacking was no ordinary defendant.
	   U.S. District Judge Deborah A. Batts said Monday she will let
Felix Rolando Peterson-Coplin plead guilty on June 26 and be
immediately sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison.
	   She called the case ``rather unusual.''
	   Peterson-Coplin, 63, was living an everyday life as a school
caretaker in Kingston, Ontario, when his past caught up with him on
Dec. 7. He was arrested as he entered the United States at
Alexandria Bay, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Syracuse,
on his way to visit friends and get a part repaired on his car.
 &UR; GRENADA: Prime minister hints at elections
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Grenadian Prime Minister Keith
Mitchell hinted he might call early elections and denied reports
that his party planned an alliance with an opposition party.
	   Mitchell said his New National Party was ``preparing itself in
all aspects'' for a political campaign, although elections are not
required by Grenada's constitution until 2000.
	   ``We do not believe that you have to wait until the hour is near
to start to do what you have to do in convincing the nation that
you do deserve a second term,'' he said in a Monday night
television interview.
	   Mitchell also denied reports that his party might strike an
alliance with the opposition Grenada United Labor Party, founded by
the late Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy.
 &UR; CANADA: Minister to investigate deportation
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Canada's immigration minister is investigating
whether or not officials bungled the case of a man who was deported
to Jamaica and has since been ordered back to Canada by a judge.
	   In a court order sealed because the man is part of a witness
protection program, a judge last week slammed the Immigration
Department for deporting a man who had been summoned to testify
later in family court, the Toronto Star reported Tuesday.
	   ``It seems to me a very complex case, I will look at it,'' said
Lucienne Robillard, who conceded that her officials have no choice
but to comply with the court order.
	   But as of Monday, the man had still not been returned to Canada.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Caricom plans cultural festivities to mark 25th
anniversary
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The Caribbean Community is planning a
series of cultural ``theme nights'' to celebrate the trade group's
25th anniversary during a summit this month, organizers said
Tuesday.
	   The summit, which will feature a visit from South African
President Nelson Mandela, will commemorate the 1973 treaty that
called for a common market between English-speaking countries of
the Caribbean.
	   Literary, musical, sports and media theme nights will feature
celebrities from those fields. Concerts will feature Trinidadian
calypso singers The Mighty Sparrow and Lord Kitchener, and Jamaican
reggae artists Culture, Marcia Griffiths and Beres Hammond will
also perform.
 &UR; TRINIDAD: Government hopes production cuts, U.S. vacations boost
oil prices
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Officials in Trinidad and Tobago
say they are hoping for a cut in petroleum production this summer
and a booming U.S. vacation season to stop a slide in oil prices.
	   ``With the price of Brent crude reaching dlrs 12.17 per barrel,
things look pretty grim for us,'' Energy Minister Finbar Gangar
said during an interview on Monday.
	   Oil sales account for 60 percent of Trinidad and Tobago's
foreign exchange earnings, and the government was forced to rewrite
its budget earlier this year after oil prices dropped from dlrs 17
to dlrs 15 a barrel.
	   Officials are hoping the robust U.S. economy will prompt
vacationers to hit the highways this summer, burning gasoline, and
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will decide
at a meeting June 24 to rein in production by at least 1 million
barrels per day.
 &UR; GUYANA: Two U.S. and one British firm bidding for power company
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Two U.S. firms and one British company
are the only bidders for the Guyana Electricity Corp., government
officials announced Tuesday.
	   The bidders are Leucadia National Corp. of Salt Lake City, Utah;
Eldorado Energy and Industrial Development Inc. of Silver Spring,
Maryland; and the London-based Commonwealth Development Corporation
in partnership with ESB International Ltd. of Ireland.
	   Monday was the deadline for bids. The winner will be announced
June 26, said Winston Brassington, head of the government's
privatization agency.
	   The state-owned electric corporation is on the block a second
time after Canadian firm Saskatchewan Power Commercial cancelled
its purchase of the company in January. Saskatchewan Power
officials cited political violence following Guyana's Dec. 15
elections.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico sells controlling stake
	   TOA BAJA, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico Bottling Co.
said Tuesday it agreed to sell a controlling stake to a venture of
Pohlad Cos. and Pepsico Inc.
	   Pohlad Cos. is a large independent Pepsi bottler with interests
in the southeastern United States.
	   Under the pact, Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico's chief executive, Rafael
Nin, will grant the venture an option to buy all of Pepsi-Cola
Puerto Rico's issued Class A shares for dlrs 23.75 million, or dlrs
4.75 a share. That money would go to the company, while a
additional dlrs 1 required to exercise the shares would go to their
current holders.
	   At the same time, the venture will acquire 6.2 million Class B
common shares for dlrs 3.62 a share from Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico
stockholders.

Tokyo stocks mixed, dollar falls against yen 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: WRAPS UP with late dollar, bond, other details
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Speculation that the United States might join in
efforts to prevent a free fall by Japan's currency sent the U.S.
dollar sharply lower against the yen Wednesday. Tokyo stock prices
closed mixed.
	   The dollar bought 142.00 yen in late afternoon, down 3.14 yen
from 145.14 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 143.47 yen overnight.
	   Traders locked in profits on the dollar following reports that
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers would make an
emergency trip to Tokyo on Thursday to discuss Japan's stagnant
economy and sagging yen.
	   The dollar rebounded slightly at midday on buying by Japanese
funds, before falling again in late afternoon as investors rushed
to dump overbought dollar positions ahead of Summers' anticipated
visit.
	   In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the
United States continues to worry about the weak yen.
	   ``It's been of enormous concern to us,'' Rubin said. ``We have
been very actively involved in talking to Japan for the past 18
months, publicly and privately, about weakness in the economy.''
	   Concern that the falling yen could throw other Asian countries
into further economic turmoil has also led Asian officials to urge
Japan to stabilize its economy.
	   Market participants expect Summers will prod Japan to step up
efforts to boost economic growth and accelerate the write-off of
problem loans at Japanese banks.
	   Some traders also speculated that U.S. and Japanese officials
may be considering some kind of joint action, such as yen-buying
intervention in currency markets, to boost the ailing currency.
	   The dollar ranged between 141.65 yen and 144.10 yen in
Wednesday's trading.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices started sharply higher on
the yen's rise against the dollar and higher futures prices. But
most of the early gains were wiped out as the dollar began to
regain ground against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 5.00 points, or 0.03
percent, closing at 14,715.38. On Tuesday, the Nikkei average had
fallen 104.79 points, or 0.71 percent.
	   ``The stock market is completely focused on where foreign
exchange rates settle,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of
the stock division at Tokyo Securities.
	   Stocks were also dragged down by weakness in banking shares,
especially those of Japan's Long-Term Credit Bank, which is fending
off rumors that it is in financial difficulty.
	   LTCB's shares, the most actively traded in the session, lost 20
percent of their value, closing at 123 yen. At one point, they had
plunged to 105 yen.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 0.37 points, insignificant in percentage
terms, to 1,156.84. It had declined 10.74 points, or 0.92 percent,
the previous day.
	   An estimated 404 million shares changed hands on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 425.81 million
Tuesday. Advances outnumbered retreats 689 to 392, while 182 issues
were unchanged.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 192 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.240 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.210 percent, driving its price down to 111.70 yen from 111.93
yen.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities have arrested a consultant for a
ticket distributor in a probe of World Cup ticket fraud that froze
out thousands of Japanese soccer fans, a company spokesman
confirmed Wednesday.
	   The consultant was arrested Monday afternoon at his home in the
upscale western Paris suburb of Rueuil-Malmaison, where
investigators found ``a large amount of cash'' and about 100 World
Cup tickets, French media reported.
	   The independent consultant, who was not identified, worked for
ISL France, an official ticket distributor for the World Cup. He
was held for questioning in a jail in nearby Nanterre, France Info
radio said.
	   The consultant's sister and a friend were also being
investigated for allegedly helping him in the scam, LCI television
reported.
	   ISL France officials were not immediately available for comment.
But a spokesman for the parent company, Swiss-based ISL Worldwide,
confirmed the consultant's arrest.
	   The consultant, who worked for an ISL France magazine, used ISL
letterhead to con ticket agencies or buyers into paying him for
tickets he never delivered, said ISL Worldwide spokesman Philip
Margraff in Paris.
	   ``He used the name and stationery of ISL France, pretending to
be the director of development, which he wasn't, to convince
clients to buy tickets,'' Margraff said in a telephone interview.
	   ``He used the reputation of ISL to get clients,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``The money was given directly to that
person.''
	   ISL France and a Japanese agency have filed complaints in the
case. ISL Worldwide denounced the fraud in a letter to French
prosecutors last week, Margraff said.
	   Judicial authorities and World Cup officials were not
immediately available for comment.
	   The World Cup organizing committee said Sunday it was
aggressively working to track down anyone involved in ticket fraud.
	   A day earlier, French prosecutors said they would investigate
criminal charges against businesses and individuals involved in the
scams.
	   The arrest is the latest development in a more than a year of
controversy surrounding the World Cup ticket sales.
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.7 million tickets
printed, almost 1.5 million were earmarked for interests in the
host country.
	   Soccer federations worldwide and commercial sponsors of the
World Cup received almost 1.2 million tickets to distribute through
their own channels, leaving only 138,000 for the general public.
	   Fans were told to deal with 17 approved agencies worldwide to
get those tickets. But officials said many fans arrived in France
to discover tickets they thought would be waiting for them came
from unlicensed brokers and tour operators, especially in Japan,
where some 12,000 fans were left ticketless.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's finance minister, Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda, has told the Cabinet he plans to cut interest
rates to as low as 11 percent, though probably not soon, a local
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   ``I'd be happy to see interest rates around 11 percent to 15
percent to ease liquidity, but that will not be easy,'' the Bangkok
Post quoted Tarrin as saying during Tuesday's regular Cabinet
meeting.
	   Tarrin has been under pressure from his Cabinet colleagues to
cut interest rates. But the government has promised the
International Monetary Fund, which is overseeing a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout of the economy, to keep rates high to stabilize
Thailand's sinking currency.
	   Prime lending rates in Thailand currently are in a range of
15.25 to 18 percent. As a result, borrowing costs have skyrocketed
for many Thai businesses, leading to a sharp drop in manufacturing
and consumption.

	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ The hotel divisions of two of the
Asia-Pacific region's largest travel companies announced Wednesday
they will merge to create a new force in hotel management.
	   Australia's Harvey World Travel and Japan's HIS Travel said they
will create a new company, Aurum Hotels and Resorts, to operate and
manage the former's Escape Resorts and the latter's Watermark Hotel
Group.
	   Aurum managing director Peter Nair, who was the regional head of
the Watermark Hotel Group, said the new company would manage 600
rooms in Cairns and the Gold Coast in Queensland state and the Blue
Mountains in New South Wales state.
	   He said the company also plans large-scale development within
the next 18 months to secure another 2,000 rooms in Australia, Asia
and the Pacific for the company.
	   Projects under development include hotels in Fiji, Bali, China,
New Zealand and Vanuatu as well as in Cairns, Townsville,
Queensland's Sunshine Coast and the Whitsunday region.
	   Harvey World Travel operates 400 offices throughout Australia,
29 offices in New Zealand and one in South Africa.
	   HIS Travel has 180 offices in 15 countries and handles more than
1.6 million travelers a year.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Microsoft Corp. said Wednesday it will begin
selling the Japanese version of Windows 98 on July 25, raising
hopes among Japan's computer makers that the product will save them
from another year of falling sales.
	   Computer manufacturers are hoping Microsoft's new version of its
popular operating system software will revitalize the PC market in
Japan, where sales fell last year for the first time in five years.
	   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said Windows 98 will make
attaching equipment such as scanners and joysticks to computers
easier by taking advantage of a new kind of plug available only on
newer machines.
	   The company also said that software, such as word-processing
programs, will start up 30 percent faster with Windows 98 than with
Windows 95.
	   Computer sales in Japan dropped 5 percent last year from the
previous year. Sales of everything from cars to clothing have been
weak as Japan struggles with its worst economic decline in more
than 50 years.
	   Microsoft said the Japanese version of Windows 98 will sell for
the same price as Windows 95 _ 13,800 yen (dlrs 95) for an upgrade
and 24,800 yen (dlrs 170) for those buying Windows for the first
time.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese electronics giant Toshiba Corp. plans take
a stake in a new Taiwanese company that will assemble 64-megabit
dynamic random access memory chips and other memory devices.
	   The new company, Walton Advanced Electronics Ltd., will be set
up July 1, with paid-in capital of dlrs 80 million. The investors
will be Walsin Advanced Electronics Ltd. and Winbond Electronics
Corp. with a 75 percent stake, Toshiba, with a 19.9 percent stake,
and Japanese trading house Mitsui and Co. with a 5.1 percent share.
	   Construction of the plant in Kaoshiung is to begin next month,
and assembly of 64-megabit DRAMs is scheduled to start in July
1999. Total investment in the plant is seen rising to 20 billion
yen (dlrs 140 million) by 2000, when total DRAM production is
expected to reach around 6.6 million a month.
	   Toshiba will be able to receive more than half of the plant's
output as a result of its investment, the company said.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's actually utilized foreign investment in
the first five months of the year fell 1.5 percent from the
year-earlier period to dlrs 14.89 billion, local media reported
Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, contracted, or pledged, foreign investment rose 3.5
percent to dlrs 17.51 billion in January to May, the International
Business Daily said.
	   Actually utilized foreign investment in May dropped 6.9 percent
and contracted foreign investment fell 18.4 percent from the
year-ago month, the newspaper said without providing figures.
	   The number of foreign investment companies approved during
January to May slid 7.3 percent from the year-ago period to 7,308
and fell by 9 percent in May from the year-ago month, the report
said.
	   May's amounts of actually utilized foreign investment and
contracted foreign investment are at their lowest levels in 10
years, the report added.

Prominent Egyptian cleric Sheik Sharawi dies 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ One of the Muslim world's leading clerics,
Sheik Mohammed Mutwali Sharawi of Egypt, died Wednesday at the age
of 86, his family said.
	   Egypt's leading Islamic authority, the Grand Sheik of Al-Azhar,
Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, described Sharawi's death as a great loss
not only to Egypt, but to the whole Islamic world.
	   ``Time rarely gives birth to such a glorious imam who devoted
his life to making the word of God esteemed,'' Tantawi said in a
statement.
	   Sharawi, who served minister of religious endowments under the
late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, died at his home near the
pyramids of Giza at dawn, his family said.
	   The cause of his death was not immediately known. Last week
Sharawi was admitted to hospital after suffering a sever bout of
asthma.
	   Sharawi's teachings and rulings won him wide acclaim in the
Muslim world, but they were also controversial. Moderate Muslims
considered them outdated.
	   He angered feminists and human rights activists by supporting
female circumcision and by ruling that women should not be
appointed to top government positions or become judges. He also
condemned organ transplants and the paying of interest on bank
deposits as un-Islamic.
	   But such rulings went down well in Saudi Arabia and Gulf
countries where governments enforce a strict interpretation of
Islam.
	   Egypt's Endowment Minister Hadi Zaqzouq said Sharawi would
receive an official funeral. He is to be buried in his home village
of Daqadous, the Daqahlliya province, some 12O kilometers (75
miles) north of Cairo.
	   He is survived by three sons and two daughters. His son, Sheik
Sami, is a cleric at Al-Azhar Institute, Cairo.

Israelis arrested in killing of Palestinian farmer mosque massacre to 1994, sted 1995

By DANNA HARMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli police on Wednesday arrested three
Jewish settlers, two of them minors, in the beating death of a
Palestinian farmer in the West Bank.
	   Police did not give a motive, but one of the suspects reportedly
told investigators he was ``playing a prank'' when he hit the
victim, Abdel Majid Turki, 45, in the head with a wooden bat.
	   Turki was killed near the Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai just
south of Hebron, one of the tensest areas in the West Bank, and
there was concern that the killing would spark new violence.
	   A number of Palestinians and Jewish settlers have been killed in
random political violence in the Hebron area in recent years. The
bloodiest incident was the 1994 Hebron mosque massacre in which a
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshippers.
	   Turki was walking back from his fields along a main road near
Beit Hagai on Tuesday afternoon when he was attacked.
	   Israel army radio said one of the suspects, a minor, told police
he had leaned out of the car he was riding in and struck Turki in
the head with a wooden bat. Turki was taken to a Hebron hospital
with a fractured skull and later died.
	   Army radio quoted one of the settlers as saying they did not
mean to commit a murder, but were simply ``playing a prank.''
	   The radio said the two minors lived in a home for troubled
youths in Beit Hagai, and that the adult was a resident of the
settlement who worked as a driver for the youth home.
	   The three, whose names were not released, were brought before a
Jerusalem magistrate Wednesday for a hearing on the extension of
their detention. The suspects covered their faces with towels and
prayer shawls as they walked into the courtroom.
	   Efraim Hibsh, a spokesman for Beit Hagai, condemned the killing,
saying the three men ``did not represent the settlement.''
	   ``We participate in the sorrow of the Turki family _ a
neighboring family whose members we all know _ and we strongly
condemn this action,'' Hibsh told Israel radio.
	   Turki was to have been buried Wednesday, but Israeli police took
the body for an autopsy in Tel Aviv.

Singapore paper chides Australia over Hanson victory 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The largest newspaper in Singapore, in an
editorial considered to reflect the views of the government,
severely chided Australia Wednesday for the surge of the
anti-immigrant One Nation Party.
	   The Straits Times' editorial hinted that Australia's economy
will suffer if the party is left unchecked. Singapore and other
Southeast Asian nations are major markets for Australian products.
	   Under the direction of Pauline Hanson, the One Nation Party took
25 percent of the vote in the Queensland state elections June 13.
	   The Straits Times called it a ``racist vote'' and said that
``Australia's Asian neighbors cannot but be dismayed'' by the
results.
	   Editorials in Singapore's newspapers, especially those on
foreign affairs topics, generally reflect the views of the
government.
	   Echoing points made in an editorial in The Business Times of
Singapore a day earlier, The Straits Times noted that more than
800,000 Japanese tourists visited Australia last year. Japan has
been Australia's largest trading partner for three decades.
	   The Straits Times said Prime Minister John Howard's reaction to
the vote ``demonstrates indecent eagerness to bestow respectability
on the egregious Ms. Hanson.''
	   ``Other straws in the unhealthy wind are his (Howard's) anxiety
to find excuses for Queensland voters ..., '' The Straits Times
said. ``No government leader seems ready to grasp the racist
nettle.''
	   The Straits Times' editorial commended Australia's opposition
Labor Party leader, Kim Beazley, for saying that One Nation is ``in
reality about race and it's about guns.''
	   If Howard ``prefers the politics of opportunism instead, and to
make common cause with One Nation, ... he should be under no
illusion regarding the reaction of Australia's neighbors or the
price that the Australian economy might have to pay,'' The Straits
Times said.

Bloomsday in Dublin: Readings from Joyce, platefuls of offal 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Surveying the commotion from on top of
the round stone tower, Robert Nicholson gave a wry chuckle.
	   ``I'm sure Joyce would have had a good laugh,'' said Nicholson,
curator of the tower, now a James Joyce museum, ``but whether it
would have been a sardonic one or not, I'm not certain.''
	   All around were flights of Joycean fancy, people bustling about
in candy-striped blazers and flowing skirts, wearing bowlers and
boaters, carrying watch-chains and parasols. Some arrived on
bicycles, others in horse-drawn carriages.
	   Clutching copies of ``Ulysses,'' they climbed the narrow spiral
stairway to the top of the tower, where bewildered children watched
while adults solemnly quoted passages from one of the century's
most complicated _ and controversial _ novels.
	   ``Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beast and
fowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast
heart, liver slices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencod's roes.''
	   Tuesday was Bloomsday for devotees of Joyce around the world.
And for the truly impassioned, Dublin was the only place to be.
	   Bloomsday celebrates that famous day in literary history, June
16, 1904, when a Jewish cuckold named Leopold Bloom went wandering
around his native city. The epic, in which Joyce ranges from
religion and adultery to literature and nationalism, also
immortalizes the day the author first ``went walking'' with his
future wife, Nora Barnacle.
	   The explicit language and stream of consciousness prose resulted
in the book's ban in many countries, including Ireland and the
United States, when it was published in 1922. Joyce was denounced
as obscene and mad.
	   All was forgotten _ and forgiven _ in the wanderings of
modern-day Blooms. Even those who freely admitted they couldn't
understand a word of it hurled themselves into recreating
``Ulysses'' with gusto.
	   They gobbled plates of those innards of beasts and fowl for
breakfast, plunged into the once-famous gentlemen-only bathing spot
known as the ``forty foot,'' and repaired to Davy Byrnes' ``moral
pub'' for that famous literary lunch: a gorgonzola sandwich and
glass of Burgundy.
	   ``Sometimes,'' observed Nicholson, doing a roaring trade in
Bloomsday T-shirts and literary posters at the tower, ``you wish he
had chosen something else to eat.''
	   The tower, about eight miles (13 kilometers) south of the city,
was built in 1804 to guard against a threatened Napoleonic
invasion. This is where Joyce once lived, where ``Ulysses'' begins,
and where Bloomsday celebrations got under way at 8 a.m.
	   Dublin Bay glistened in the background, ``warm sunshine merrying
over the sea,'' as hundreds of tourists and natives arrived on this
annual pilgrimage.
	   Tina Robinson was married in period costume here in 1987 and
hasn't missed an anniversary since.
	   ``We were definitely very Joycean on our wedding day,'' she
said, as her husband, Des, guided their two children along the
stairway. ``We kept church and state separate.''
	   Down the road a bit, at the South Bank restaurant, inner organs
were selling briskly for about dlrs 12 a plate and washed down with
pints of Guinness.
	   ``It's a fabulous day,'' exclaimed Breda Carroll, swirling
through the restaurant in a brown velvet dress, exotic floral hat
and yellow parasol. ``It's like a wedding, a birthday and Christmas
all rolled into one. You meet friends you don't see from one year
to another.''
	   Outside with his horse and carriage, her driver Hughie O'Connor
rolled his eyes in mock disgust.
	   ``I haven't met a single person yet who has actually read the
book, I mean the whole book,'' he said. ``It's all just a big party
for the tourists.''
	   Still, O'Connor was playing his part, decked out in dress coat
and bowler hat.
	   Bloomsday was apparently first celebrated in 1954, the 50th
anniversary of the events of ``Ulysses.'' It was loosely organized
by poets and writers, including Brian O'Nolan, Patrick Kavanagh and
Anthony Cronin.
	   They gathered at the tower at the appointed hour and, after a
liquid breakfast provided by a sympathetic neighbor, embarked on a
horse-drawn trek into the city. After various adventures in pubs
along the way, their odyssey got shipwrecked in the back bar of the
Old Bailey, just a stone's throw from Davy Byrnes'.
	   Now, decades later, the celebrations are much more organized,
and more elaborate. Festivities include musical and literary
tributes, art exhibitions, bike rallies and vintage car shows.
	   ``As an outsider,'' said Sandy Johnston, who had traveled from
South Africa, ``it is almost as if there is a conscious desire on
the part of the country to make recompense to Joyce for the way he
was treated.''
	   ``And,'' he added, ``to keep a cute eye on the tourist trade.''

Philippines to sell TV, radio stations, newspaper chain 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada plans
to sell three government-held television stations, four radio
stations and a newspaper chain in his first six months in office,
an official said Wednesday.
	   The privatization binge is aimed at raising funds for the
government, which faces a budget deficit, press secretary-designate
Rod Reyes said.
	   Ownership questions regarding two of the TV stations,
Intercontinental Broadcasting Corp. and Radio Philippines Network,
must be settled before the government can proceed with the sale,
Reyes said.
	   The government seized the stations from associates of the late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos after his 1986 ouster. Some previous
owners have sought to regain control of the stations.
	   Last December, the Supreme Court blocked a scheduled auction of
IBC after a petition was filed questioning the government's right
to sell it.
	   Reyes said the charter of another government-run station, the
People's Television Network, was being studied to determine whether
it can also be privatized.
	   Four radio stations and the Journal group of Companies, which
manages a popular chain of tabloids and a broadsheet, will also be
auctioned, he said.
	   Estrada, a former Marcos supporter whose inauguration is June
30, has announced plans to sell major government corporate assets,
including many that were seized from Marcos associates, to raise
revenues.
	   The Philippine government posted a budget deficit of 15.4
billion pesos (dlrs 375 million) in the first five months of 1998,
far exceeding its target of 75 million pesos (dlrs 1.8 million) for
the period because of revenue collection shortfalls.

EU ministers approve two laws to curb pollution 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) - The European Union approved two laws to
improve the quality of air, part of an overall drive to fight
respiratory diseases and acid rain in the 15-nation bloc.
	   EU environment ministers said in a statement they agreed to cuts
on four major pollutants - sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, lead,
and particulates, or soot.
	   The measure, approved Tuesday, is ``designed to avoid, prevent
or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment,''
the statement said. The reductions will increase protection
particularly for asthmatic people and the elderly.
	   Ministers also agreed on a law to cut the amount of sulphur in
heavy fuel and gas oils used by power stations, oil refineries,
industrial boilers and furnaces, as part of a wider strategy to
fight acid rain.
	   The new limits on pollutants, based on standards issued by the
World Health Organization, will apply from 2005 for three of the
pollutants and from 2010 for soot.
	   Under the fuels law, refineries will have to reduce sulphur in
heavy fuel oils to 1 percent by 2003. Sulphur in gas oils must be
cut to 0.2 percent by 2003 and 0.1 percent by 2008. The law must be
approved by the European parliament.
	   Ministers were still debating how much each country should cut
greenhouse gas emissions as part of an international accord signed
last year in Kyoto, Japan to limit emissions of gases thought to
cause global warming.
	   The treaty, approved last December, would require 38
industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to
1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.
	   The 15 EU countries signed the Kyoto Protocol on April 29, one
day after Japan became the first major industrial power to do so.
The United States has not signed yet.

Indonesian president urges student protesters to show restraint 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Indonesia-East Timor
By HARIS SYAMAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Targeted by angry students since he
was sworn in last month, President B.J. Habibie urged campus
protesters Wednesday to show restraint and not to threaten national
unity.
	   Habibie said students are allowed to protest on campus.
	   ``But we must always respect rules to prevent national
disunity,'' Habibie said.
	   Student protests were a major part of the push to oust former
President Suharto last month. Suharto ended his 32-year grip on
power and was replaced by Habibie, his longtime friend and ally, on
May 21.
	   Since then, smaller numbers of students have turned on Habibie,
calling on him to step down and hold elections immediately.
	   Habibie has rejected the calls and instead has outlined a slower
timetable for political reform culminating in elections in 1999.
	   In his address Wednesday to a group of officials and student
leaders from one university, Habibie said students and other
Indonesians wanting change should remain patient.
	   ``Reform is like the birth of a child. It takes time and you
have to take care,'' he said.
	   He guaranteed that campus freedom would continue, saying it was
a good way for the government to monitor public opinion.
	   In recent weeks, the powerful military has also called on
students to show restraint. Senior army officers have warned them
to stop occupying government buildings and blocking roads.
	   A few days prior to Suharto's resignation, security forces shot
dead four students at a rally at Trisakti University. The deaths
were followed by a wave of riots that shook the capital and left
almost 1,200 dead.
	   In the East Timor capital, Dili, Wednesday, hundreds of student
protesters occupied the local parliament to demand that Indonesia
pull troops out of the former Portuguese colony.
	   Another group of demonstrators marched to the nearby governor's
office with the body of a man who they said had been shot by
security forces Tuesday evening.
	   At the Justice Ministry in Jakarta, meanwhile, about 200 East
Timorese students gathered to urge a referendum on independence and
the release of a jailed rebel leader.
	   Habibie, has ruled out a referendum for independence in East
Timor, saying it must remain Indonesia's 27th province.
	   Indonesia invaded the disputed territory in 1975 and annexed it
a year later.

Kohl's Cabinet OKs extension for German peacekeepers in Bosnia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Cabinet endorsed
plans Wednesday to keep 3,000 German peacekeepers in Bosnia for an
additional year as part of the NATO-led peace force there.
	   Germany's parliament is expected to approve the extension
Friday.
	   The U.N. Security council on Monday extended through June 21,
1999 its mandate for the 34,000-member force, which helps enforce
terms of Bosnia's 1995 peace accord.
	   Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said the Bosnian peace remains
fragile. ``Outside help is still necessary,'' he said.

Workers prepare site for Marcos' burial in Heroes' Cemetery

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Workers poured cement Wednesday for
the foundation of a tomb in Manila's Heroes' Cemetery where the
late strongman Ferdinand Marcos is to be finally buried next month.
	   Human rights groups are holding daily protests this week against
a decision by President-elect Joseph Estrada to allow Marcos'
burial in the military cemetery nearly nine years after his death.
	   Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, has approved plans by the
Marcos family for a burial on July 11, a source close to the family
said.
	   Estrada, who takes office June 30, said no state honors will be
given.
	   Marcos, a former soldier, died in exile in Hawaii in September
1989, three years after he was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt
that ended his 20-year rule.
	   His body was not allowed back in the Philippines until 1993,
when it was flown to his hometown of Batac in northern Ilocos Norte
province and placed in a glass casket inside an air-conditioned
crypt.
	   President Fidel Ramos and his predecessor, Corazon Aquino,
refused to allow Marcos to be buried at Heroes' Cemetery, fearing
possible clashes between Marcos loyalists and opponents.
	   The grave site in the cemetery is a 10 by 10-meter (33 by
33-foot) area beside the white marble tomb of former President
Carlos Garcia, who died in 1971.
	   Beside Garcia's tomb is the grave of former President Diosdado
Macapagal, who was defeated by Marcos in 1965 and died earlier this
year.
	   Marcos' grave site will be covered with black granite. On one
side will be a granite slab that will be engraved with a prayer
Marcos wrote in 1939, the family source said.
	   Marcos' body will be brought to Manila aboard a military
transport plane on the morning of July 11, accompanied by his
daughter Maria Imelda and son Ferdinand Jr., the source said. It is
to be buried at noon according to military tradition.
	   Marcos' friends and relatives have donated 200,000 pesos (dlrs
5,000) for the construction of the burial site, which was designed
by an architect who is a Marcos family friend.
	   Last week, Marcos' widow, Imelda, said she has agreed to a
burial without state honors.
	   Mrs. Marcos had previously insisted on full state honors for her
husband. But many Filipinos, including those who suffered human
rights abuses during Marcos' rule, opposed the plan.
	   A coalition of 28 organizations demonstrated for a third day
Wednesday against Marcos' burial at the Heroes' Cemetery.
	   Cecille Guidote-Alvarez, an organizer of the protests, said
Estrada's decision showed he was ``suffering from amnesia about
some vivid portions of history,'' referring to Marcos' strongman
rule.

Cambodian opposition party to ignore demonstration ban 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS; trims; new thruout
By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A leading Cambodian opposition party
announced Wednesday it would ignore a government ban on
demonstrations during the run-up to July's election.
	   ``As far as we're concerned, the ban is illegal and
unconstitutional. There's no need to pay attention to it,'' said a
spokesman for the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   Mann Chhoeun, a high-ranking Phnom Penh city official, said
earlier Wednesday he was drafting a letter to inform political
parties that all demonstrations are banned until after the July 26
polls.
	   He said, however, authorities were unlikely to take any action
to prevent Sam Rainsy from proceeding with a rally this Sunday.
	   ``If he is still stubborn in proceeding with his plan, the
municipality will not touch or obstruct him to avoid being accused
of abusing his rights or aggravating the situation,'' Mann Chhoeun
said. ``But we still hope he will cooperate with us in good faith
in order to avoid any eventual violence.''
	   The ban was discussed at a two-hour meeting Wednesday between
Co-Premier Hun Sen and a U.N. envoy who was assessing whether the
electoral climate was free and fair enough for the United Nations
to go on supporting the polls.
	   Francese Vendrell, regional director of the United Nations'
political affairs department, described their talks as very frank
and open. He was to meet opposition leaders later.
	   The opposition has accused Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's
Party of killing and threatening opponents and intimidating voters
in the just-completed registration process to coerce their support.
Some 5.33 million people of the 5.6 million estimated to be
eligible to vote signed up
	   Chum Bun Rong, an adviser to Hun Sen, said the co-premier gave
Vendrell a guarantee that the elections will be conducted in a
free, fair and completely neutral atmosphere.
	   He said Hun Sen told Vendrell that the demonstration ban was
meant just to curb ``anarchic'' demonstrations in unapproved sites
where adequate security could not be arranged.
	   Vendrell was to travel to Bangkok, Thailand, later in the week
to attend weekend meetings of the Friends of Cambodia, which groups
Western and Asian nations seeking a solution to the problems opened
by Hun Sen's coup against his co-premier last year.
	   Vendrell is to report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
is to decide by early July whether to continue U.N. endorsement for
the process.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk urged Cambodians in a statement circulated
Wednesday to overcome fears of threats and intimidation and vote in
the elections.
	   The monarch said the vote would be ``conducted in a liberal
democracy. Therefore, I ask all of you to exercise your right by
voting freely according to your own conscience and confidence in
any candidate or party.''

Pope appeals to sides to put down arms 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Guinea-Bissau
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Wednesday called on all
sides in the Guinea-Bissau violence to put down their arms and
urged continued efforts to work out a peaceful end.
	   ``I appeal with insistence to the sides in the conflict to put
down their arms and end the violence and consequent exodus of the
populations,'' the pope said during his weekly general audience.
	   ``I fervently hope that the international community will
continue its work on behalf of peace and can contribute with
non-violent means toward the reconciliation of all,'' the pope
added.
	   Rebels and loyalists forces in the African country have been
waging battles, and the violent aftermath of a failed coup attempt
in Guinea-Bissau spread to the country's northern border Tuesday as
neighboring Senegal launched an artillery barrage across the
frontier into rebel territory.

Hong Kong share prices surge on stronger yen, lower interest rates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed sharply higher
Wednesday, with the key index surging 6.3 percent.
	   Dealers said the stronger yen and lower domestic interbank
interest rates encouraged buying.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
climbed 477.90 points, closing at 8,004.35. It moved above 8,000
points for the first time since last Tuesday. The index had gained
0.9 percent Tuesday, after slumping 5.7 percent Monday on the
ailing yen.
	   Turnover was 6.14 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 787
million), down from Tuesday's 7.57 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 970 million).
	   Traders called Wednesday's gains ``a technical rebound'' as the
Japanese yen strengthened to 142.38 against the U.S. dollar at
midday from a low of 144.09 in the morning.
	   The yen rebounded as news of U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers' imminent trip to Japan triggered speculation
about joint intervention to halt the currency's recent slide,
traders said.
	   ``The yen's rebound to around the 143-yen level was a positive
sign for Hong Kong and other regional markets in Asia,'' said Alan
Shum, research manager at New Century Securities Ltd.
	   As the yen strengthened, Hong Kong's interbank rates also fell
Wednesday. The volatile overnight rate was quoted at 9.0 percent,
down from 10.5 percent late Tuesday. The benchmark three-month rate
eased to 11.0 percent from 12.5 percent.
	   Shares in the London-based banking giant HSBC Holdings staged
the biggest rally, surging 11.50 Hong Kong dollars to 181.00.
	   Property stocks also rose sharply. Cheung Kong Holdings rose
3.00 to 34.00, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 2.65 to 31.40.
	   Among others, conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa rose 2.80 to 34.20,
and China Light rose 1.30 to 32.30.

Annual report: Human rights declaration widely ignored 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Pierre Sane has accent on E in surname
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains
all but meaningless for most of the world's people half a century
after it was proclaimed by the U.N. General Assembly, Amnesty
International said in its annual report released Wednesday.
	   The international human rights organization said it had
documented cases of summary executions in at least 55 nations, the
detention of ``prisoners of conscience'' in 87 nations and torture
in 117 countries.
	   The Universal Declaration of Human RIghts ``has been called 'the
world's best-kept secret,' despite government agreeing in 1948 to
actively promote it wherever possible,'' said Pierre Sane,
secretary-general of Amnesty International.
	   ``Our current campaign to promote the UDHR in the run-up to the
10 December anniversary hopes to change that.''
	   Amnesty International said that many governments have challenged
the notion of human rights which apply equally in all nations. Some
Asian and African nations, for instance, have argued that
international human rights standards reflect Western ideas.
	   The United States also has been reluctant to embrace
international standards, it said.
	   ``It stands virtually alone in not signing up to the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child,'' the report said of the
United States. ``It is one of the few countries which has not
ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women. Even when it has ratified
international human rights conventions, it has often entered
extensive reservations, refusing to be bound by many of the
provisions within them.''
	   The report said that economic rights and the rights of women
continued to be neglected.
	   ``Addressing the imbalance between economic rights and other
human rights is vital at a time when the debate over human rights
is increasingly played out in the economic sphere,'' the report
said.
	   ``When governments fail to protect their citizens from the
negative consequences of globalization, the need to protect and
enhance economic rights becomes evident.
	   ``The parallel imperative of ensuring that economic rights are
not divorced from other human rights is shown each time that people
are harassed, tortured and killed in the name of economic
progress.''
	   Turning to women's rights, the report said: ``The 'gender
blindness' of the international human rights framework has meant in
practice that gross violations of women's rights have often been
ignored and structural discrimination against women has not been
challenged.''
	   Sane said the University Declaration remains ``little more than
a paper promise'' for most of the world's people.
	   ``A promise which has not been fulfilled for the 1.3 billion
people who struggle to survive on less than U.S. dlrs 1 a day; for
the 35,000 people who die of malnutrition and preventable diseases
every day; for the billion adults, most of them women, who cannot
read or write; for the prisoners of conscience jailed in nearly
half the world's countries, and for the victims of torture in close
to two-thirds of the world's countries,'' Sane said.

No foreign leaders invited to Estrada inauguration to save money 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada, who
will inherit a large projected budget deficit, has decided not to
invite foreign leaders to his June 30 inauguration to save money,
his spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Press secretary-designate Rodolfo Reyes said officials are also
concerned about security preparations that would be needed if heads
of state were to attend.
	   Estrada, the current vice president, is a former movie star and
senator who defeated nine other candidates in the May 11 balloting
on a pro-poor platform.
	   President Fidel Ramos completes his six-year term at noon June
30, when Estrada is to take his oath as president.
	   The government posted a budget deficit of 15.4 billion pesos
(dlrs 375 million) in the first five months of 1998, far exceeding
its target of 75 million pesos (dlrs 1.8 million) for the period.

World Cup: French heavily favored against desperate Saudis 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ For France, it is just another
step that will hopefully lead to the World Cup final. For Saudi
Arabia, Thursday's match against the hosts at the Stade de France
might seal its elimination from the tournament.
	   France keeps reminding itself not to be too optimistic after a
confident 3-0 win over South Africa, while the Saudis are facing
such pressure after a 1-0 loss to Denmark that coach Carlos Alberto
Parreira has issued a media blackout ahead of the game.
	   Les Bleus will seek to keep the home crowd on its feet with a
show of sparkling, offensive play.
	   France is without center forward Stephane Guivarc'h because of a
knee injury, but is unlikely to field fellow-striker David
Trezeguet, who is recovering from an ankle strain.
	   Instead, it will probably start with the team that finished off
the drubbing of South Africa, which means a place for striker
Christophe Dugarry.
	   Saudi Arabia has a fully fit team, but hardly has confidence
going for it.
	   ``France had a good start and that puts us under a lot of
pressure,'' said Parreira ahead of his blackout.
	   His counterpart Aime Jacquet doesn't want this to be a fun
outing in industrial Saint-Denis either. Another three points might
already qualify them for the second round, if Denmark does the
expected and beats South Africa.
	   And another couple of goals would likely leave France with
enough of an edge in the goal difference standings to need only a
draw in its last match against Denmark to win Group C.
	   ``A match like this is a trap. We will need our utmost
concentration,'' said Jacquet. France is especially worried about
the Saudi's sudden bursts of speed and their intricate skills that
earned them the nickname ``the Brazilians of the Desert.''
	   ``The top players will make the difference,'' said Jacquet.
	   Saed Al-Owairan knows this well. Brazil may have won the World
Cup with Parreira as coach four years ago, but Al-Owairan scored
the best goal of the 1994 edition, weaving through the Belgian
defense for a spectacular strike that saved his nation from
elimination.
	   And after a disappointing first match, it will be his best
chance to create another World Cup moment. Otherwise, the Saudis
could be down and out by Thursday night.
	   Parreira will also have to send his players more out of their
defensive shell if he wants to make the World Cup experience last
longer than the opening three matches.
	   The French connection between defense and offense has been
smooth so far with none of the dreaded ineptness in front of goal.
	   Guivarc'h may be missing, and Trezeguet unfit to play, but
Jacquet has used the much-maligned Dugarry like wonder, seeing him
score the opener and set up another against South Africa.
	   On the right, 20-year-old Thierry Henry has been a revelation,
faking, jumping and speeding his way through on the wing and
capping it with a great goal.
	   It has swung the home crowds, usually very fickle, firmly behind
the team.
	   ``The crowd has seen their desire and their quality. The support
can only increase,'' said Jacquet.

First non-stop New York-Hong Kong flight to mark airport opening 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Flights landing on the opening day of Hong
Kong's new airport next month will include the first non-stop
passenger flight between New York and the territory, Cathay Pacific
Airways said Wednesday.
	   The trial flight, Polar 1, will depart from New York July 5 and
arrive in Hong Kong July 6, when the new Chek Lap Kok airport opens
for commercial use, a statement from the Hong Kong-based airline
said.
	   Katherine Wang, a Cathay Pacific spokeswoman, said there have
been no previous non-stop passenger-carrying between the two
cities.
	   Five hours will be saved by flying non-stop and over a northern
polar route crossing Mongolia, China and Russia, Wang said. The new
route is to take 15 1/2 hours.
	   The statement said the airline wants to operate regular non-stop
flights between the two cities next year.
	   On July 2, Chinese President Jiang Zemin will officiate at the
opening ceremony for the U.S. dlrs 20.1 billion airport, built on
an outlying island. More than 3,000 guests have been invited to the
ceremony.
	   The new airport, built to operate round the clock, will be able
to handle 35 million passengers a year. Eventually, capacity will
rise to 87 million passengers a year.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities have arrested three people,
including a consultant for the World Cup's marketing agency, in a
probe of ticket fraud that froze out thousands of Japanese soccer
fans, a police source said Wednesday.
	   More arrests could follow, officials said, after police arrested
the consultant for ISL France at his home Monday in the upscale
western Paris suburb of Rueil-Malmaison, the source said.
	   Investigators found a large amount of cash and about 100 World
Cup tickets at the home of the consultant, identified as Gilles
Favard, the source said on condition of anonymity.
	   The arrests came after more than 12,000 Japanese fans were left
ticketless for the World Cup, among a number of cases that have
plagued the handling of tickets for the five-week championship that
began last week.
	   Two other people were arrested, the source said. LCI television
identified them as Favard's sister and a friend believed to have
helped the consultant sell by fax, tickets that Japanese travel
agencies never received.
	   Sources close to the investigation said other arrests could
follow as early as Wednesday.
	   ISL France officials were not immediately available for comment.
But a spokesman for the parent company Swiss-based ISL Worldwide,
said the consultant worked for an ISL France trade magazine.
	   Favard used ISL letterhead to con ticket agencies or buyers into
paying him for tickets, said Philippe Margraff, ISL Worldwide
senior vice president.

Russian truck driver tries to put out fuel fire by himself 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fuel truck driver who tried to put out a fire in
his 13,700-gallon (45-ton) fuel tank suffered burns to 90 percent
of his body and was hospitalized Wednesday in a Moscow hospital, a
news agency reported.
	   The fire was sparked by a short-circuit while the truck was in
the Mil helicopter-assembly plant, located near Moscow, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The driver tried to douse the flames all by himself. But the
fire spread to five other fuel tanks, each holding 13,700 gallons
(45 tons) of fuel, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Ten firefighting brigades worked for 25 minutes to put out the
fire later, it said. The truck driver was hospitalized in
``extremely serious condition,'' ITAR-Tass said.

Mayor of Uganda's capital arrested in the United States 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A U.S. court has ordered Hajji Nasser
Ssebagala, the mayor of the Ugandan capital, to remain in the
country after he was charged with making false customs declaration
and being in possession of stolen travelers' checks, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   Ssebagala was en route from Chicago to London when he has taken
off the plane Saturday by customs officials at New York's John F.
Kennedy International Airport.
	   He appeared before the Eastern District of New York Court on
Monday and was granted bail, the newspaper New Vision reported.
	   The newspaper quoted Amy Rindshopf of federal prosecutor's
office as saying a hearing is scheduled for June 23 when the court
will decide whether Ssebagala is to be detained pending trial in
Boston, where the offenses allegedly were committed.
	   If found guilty, Ssebagala would face a maximum of five years
imprisonment plus a dlrs 250,000 fine, New Vision said.
	   It quoted Ugandan diplomats as saying the mayor and wife Sarah
Nabagesera, who is also a parliamentary deputy, were staying with
friends in New York City area.
	   They reportedly were returning from a garbage-management seminar
in Chicago.
	   Ssebagala, who owns a foreign-exchange house in Kampala, was
elected mayor by a a landslide in April. He campaigned in Luganda,
the dominant language in the Kampala area, after New Vision wrote a
story about his problems with English.
	   He later said he had decided to turn his lack of mastery of the
language to his advantage.

Indonesian currency plunges, jeopardizing bailout package because of fears of violence, dealers predicting more demand for dollars 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with close of Jakarta trading, some stores closed
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's fragile currency plunged
more than 9 percent Wednesday, jeopardizing efforts by the
International Monetary Fund to haul the Southeast Asian nation's
shattered economy out of a yearlong crisis.
	   The drop came as a big blow to the government of President B.J.
Habibie, which has pushed an agenda of democratic reform since the
ouster last month of the authoritarian leader Suharto.
	   A drastic weakening of the currency could also worsen rising
inflation and mass unemployment, problems that helped spark riots
and protests leading to Suharto's downfall after 32 years in power.
	   Some shopkeepers in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, shuttered
their stores, fearing that the rupiah's fall could spur more price
increases and ensuing street violence.
	   The Indonesian currency closed in Jakarta trading at 16,700
rupiah against the U.S. dollar, down from 15,150 rupiah the
previous day.
	   Dealers said local banks were rushing to snap up dollars to pay
off debt arrears. They predicted more demand for dollars to finance
Indonesian imports of basic commodities, including medicine.
	   ``With such a thin market and one-way trading, the only
direction for the dollar is upward,'' said Pardi Kendy, chief of
the treasury department of Bank Buana Indonesia, a private bank.
	   Dragged down earlier this week by the weakening Japanese yen,
the rupiah failed to strengthen even as the yen rose against the
dollar in early trading Wednesday.
	   The economic crisis plaguing much of Asia was triggered last
year by the sudden devaluation of the Thai baht.
	   Financial turmoil has undermined stability in Indonesia, which
has suffered social unrest over price increases in Jakarta and
other cities. In the capital, as many as 1,190 people died last
month during mob rampages, many of them killed in shopping mall
fires set by looters.
	   The slide in the value of the rupiah was likely to undermine a
deal to resolve a key obstacle to economic recovery, Indonesia's
estimated dlrs 80 billion in private foreign debt. Many Indonesian
companies are technically insolvent.
	   In talks earlier this month in Frankfurt, Germany, Indonesian
officials and foreign bankers agreed to ease some of the repayment
burden on debt-ridden businesses and help creditors recover some
assets.
	   With the rupiah weakening, however, debtors will be less willing
to fulfill terms of the deal, even though they are designed to give
some breathing room to Indonesian companies.
	   IMF officials, meanwhile, are assessing how to revive a dlrs 43
billion bailout package that was suspended because of the recent
political turmoil. A top IMF official visiting Jakarta, Hubert
Neiss, said Monday he hoped the rupiah would eventually stabilize
below the 10,000 level.
	   The rupiah fell to an all-time low of 17,000 in January after
Habibie, then research and technology minister, emerged as a
candidate for the presidency.
	   Habibie is viewed with suspicion by market traders because of
his taste for costly, government-funded projects, but as president
he has pledged to streamline the economy and battle corruption.

Albanian negotiator dismisses Milosevic's pledge to talk Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in
Kosovo on Wednesday dismissed President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge
to negotiate, saying his powerful forces must halt all actions and
leave the province before any talks can start.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the four-member Kosovo Albanian team named
to negotiate with the Serbs, spoke after Milosevic promised Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to continue talks with the
moderate leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   ``What was announced in Moscow is no news, because the problem
is not whether there will be any talks with the Albanians, but the
conditions in which talks should be held,'' chief negotiator Fehmi
Agani told the Associated Press.
	   ``Two important conditions set by the international community
... have not been fulfilled. And meaningful talks depend on them,''
Agani added. ``Therefore, at this moment, we cannot say whether
there will be any talks.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen stressed Tuesday that while some progress was made in
Moscow, Milosevic failed to meet the key condition _ withdrawal of
his forces from Kosovo.
	   Milosevic promised free access for international monitors and
aid groups to western Kosovo. He said no repressive actions would
be carried out against civilians, but ruled out the withdrawal of
the Yugoslav army _ which guards the border with Albania _ and said
police presence would be reduced only when attacks by Albanian
militants cease.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March.
	   On Monday, NATO, in a show of force, sent warplanes over the
Adriatic Sea and Albania and Macedonia to reinforce the demand that
Milosevic pull back in Kosovo.
	   The Clinton administration said it will keep warships and jets
ready, should NATO decide on military action.
	   Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova met in May,
following U.S. mediation, but the Albanians canceled further talks
until Serb government troops halted their reported attacks.
	   The Serbs say they are battling the militant Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army, which wants to secede Kosovo from Serbia and
Yugoslavia by force. The clashes have driven some 60,000 people
from their homes, most within Kosovo. Others have fled to Albania
or the neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   On Tuesday, some refugees said that Serb police had attacked
makeshift refugee camps near the border with Albania, targeting
them from helicopters and killing two refugees. The reports could
not be independently confirmed.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported Wednesday an
attack by Albanian militants on a police patrol south of the
capital Pristina. No injuries were reported.
	   Serbs also said a 55-year-old Serb from central Kosovo has been
kidnapped by the KLA. Serbs have reported kidnappings before,
claiming the KLA have set up camps for Serbs. Albanians say about
200 of their kin are missing and held by the Serbs.
	   The KLA are responsible for dozens of killings of Serb policemen
and pro-Serb ethnic Albanians since 1996.
	   Most Kosovo Albanians, who make up over 90 percent of the
province's population, are seeking independence from Serbia which
rules it with heavy hand. Rugova, an advocate of peaceful
resistance, has recently been losing ground to the militant KLA.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Workers poured cement Wednesday for
the foundation of a tomb in Manila's Heroes' Cemetery where the
late strongman Ferdinand Marcos is to be finally buried next month.
	   Human rights groups are holding daily protests this week against
a decision by President-elect Joseph Estrada to allow Marcos'
burial in the military cemetery nearly nine years after his death.
	   Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, has approved plans by the
Marcos family for a burial on July 11, a source close to the family
said.
	   Estrada, who takes office June 30, said no state honors will be
given.
	   Marcos, a former soldier, died in exile in Hawaii in September
1989, three years after he was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt
that ended his 20-year rule.
	   His body was not allowed back in the Philippines until 1993,
when it was flown to his hometown of Batac in northern Ilocos Norte
province and placed in a glass casket inside an air-conditioned
crypt.
	   President Fidel Ramos and his predecessor, Corazon Aquino,
refused to allow Marcos to be buried at Heroes' Cemetery, fearing
possible clashes between Marcos loyalists and opponents.
	   The grave site in the cemetery is a 10 by 10-meter (33 by
33-foot) area beside the white marble tomb of former President
Carlos Garcia, who died in 1971.
	   Beside Garcia's tomb is the grave of former President Diosdado
Macapagal, who was defeated by Marcos in 1965 and died last year.
	   Marcos' grave site will be covered with black granite. On one
side will be a granite slab that will be engraved with a prayer
Marcos wrote in 1939, the family source said.
	   Marcos' body will be brought to Manila aboard a military
transport plane on the morning of July 11, accompanied by his
daughter Maria Imelda and son Ferdinand Jr., the source said. It is
to be buried at noon according to military tradition.
	   Marcos' friends and relatives have donated 200,000 pesos (dlrs
5,000) for the construction of the burial site, which was designed
by an architect who is a Marcos family friend.
	   Last week, Marcos' widow, Imelda, said she has agreed to a
burial without state honors.
	   Mrs. Marcos had previously insisted on full state honors for her
husband. But many Filipinos, including those who suffered human
rights abuses during Marcos' rule, opposed the plan.
	   A coalition of 28 organizations demonstrated for a third day
Wednesday against Marcos' burial at the Heroes' Cemetery.
	   Cecille Guidote-Alvarez, an organizer of the protests, said
Estrada's decision showed he was ``suffering from amnesia about
some vivid portions of history,'' referring to Marcos' strongman
rule.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ One of the Muslim world's leading clerics,
Sheik Mohammed Mutwali Sharawi of Egypt, died Wednesday, his family
said. He was 87.
	   Egypt's leading Islamic authority, the Grand Sheik of Al-Azhar,
Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, described Sharawi's death as a great loss
not only to Egypt, but to the whole Islamic world.
	   ``Time rarely gives birth to such a glorious imam who devoted
his life to making the word of God esteemed,'' Tantawi said in a
statement.
	   Sharawi's ``fingerprints on Islamic teaching were matchless,''
said Moustafa Mashhour, the leader of Egypt's largest
fundamentalist group, the Muslim Brotherhood.
	   Sharawi, who served as minister of religious endowments under
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1976-78, died at his home near
the pyramids of Giza at dawn, his family said.
	   The cause of his death was not immediately known. Last week
Sharawi was admitted to hospital after a severe bout of asthma.
	   Sharawi's teachings and rulings won him wide acclaim in the
Muslim world, but they were also controversial. Moderate Muslims
considered them outdated.
	   He angered feminists and human rights activists by supporting
female circumcision and by ruling that women should not be
appointed to top government positions or become judges. He also
condemned organ transplants and the paying of interest on bank
deposits as un-Islamic.
	   But such rulings went down well in Saudi Arabia and Gulf
countries where governments enforce a strict interpretation of
Islam.
	   Egypt's Endowment Minister Hadi Zaqzouq said state officials
would attend Sharawi's funeral and the government would provide
facilities. The ceremony was scheduled to be held before sundown
Wednesday in his home village of Daqadous, Daqahlliya province,
some 12O kilometers (75 miles) north of Cairo.
	   He is survived by three sons and two daughters. His son, Sheik
Sami, is a cleric at Al-Azhar Institute, Cairo.

United Nations calls for emergency meeting over school closures 
</HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The United Nations called for an
emergency meeting Wednesday with Afghanistan's Taliban religious
army following its decision to shut down more than 100 private
schools, many of them educating girls.
	   The closures ''will have a devastating impact on the welfare of
many of the city's neediest people _ particularly women and
children,'' the United Nations said in a statement released in
neighboring Pakistan.
	   In addition to closing the private schools Tuesday, the Taliban
announced it was closing scores of small home-based vocational
training programs.
	   Many of those programs are run by international aid groups that
teach girls and young women to weave carpets and sew. The classes
are vital to rebuilding the country from years of civil war.
	   Under the new rules, the Taliban will issue licenses to schools,
but only after scrutinizing their objectives. Schools will not be
allowed to instruct girls older than the age of eight but will be
limited to teaching the Koran, the Muslim holy book. The schools on
the closure list violated those rules, the government said Tuesday.
	   ``These schools weren't just for children. They also included
14- and 15-year-old girls,'' Religious Affairs Minister Haji
Khulimuddin said at a news conference Tuesday.
	   The home-based schools have been run by thousands of women
teachers who were forced out of work by the Taliban after it took
control of Kabul in 1996 and imposed a harsh brand of Islamic law,
banning women from the workplace and girls from schools.
	   Without officially recognizing the home-based programs, the
Taliban has allowed them to operate until now. It wasn't
immediately clear why they chose to announce the crackdown now.
	   ``Right now, we have no control over these schools,''
Khulimuddin said. ``If they get permission then we can control
them.''
	   A survey conducted in January by international aid workers
showed that at least 107 home schools were operating in Kabul,
teaching 6,500 students, half of whom were girls. They were
teaching religion, language and math.
	   In its statement, the United Nations warned the Taliban that the
decision to close the schools violates an agreement signed last
month promising to discuss ''problem areas,'' specifically access
to education and health care for women and girls.
	   The May 13 agreement also promised to establish a joint
committee with the mandate ''to discuss a range of humanitarian and
development issues including problem areas such as access to
education and health,'' said the U.N. statement.
	   The committee has not met ``despite the U.N.'s numerous requests
to arrange a date, time and agenda,'' the statement said.
	   The Taliban's opponents, led by former president Burhanuddin
Rabbani and his military chief Ahmed Shah Massood, say the
Taliban's brand of Islamic interpretation is rooted more in tribal
tradition than the Koran.
	   The Taliban army, which is waging battles on at least three
different fronts, says its opposition has retain remnants of
Afghanistan's communist regime.
	   The Taliban also has banned music and forced men to grow beards,
wear a head covering and pray in the mosque.

World Cup: South Africa needs victory over favored Danes 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ South Africa needs a lot of firsts to
advance to the second round of its inaugural World Cup, starting
with a first victory over a European side when it faces favored
Denmark on Thursday.
	   The Africans were humbled 3-0 by France in their World Cup debut
while Denmark eased past Saudi Arabia 1-0 to join France atop Group
C. That means Denmark virtually ensures itself a second-round berth
if it beats South Africa, which must win to retain any hope of
advancing.
	   ``Even if we drew with France, we'd have a point and Denmark has
three. All along we knew this was a crucial match,'' South African
coach Philippe Troussier said. ``I think the World Cup for us is
starting now.''
	   Denmark has a solid pedigree as winner of the 1992 European Cup
and a nation that made the second round in its only previous World
Cup, in 1986. The Danes are led by Manchester United's Peter
Schmeichel, considered one of the world's best goalkeepers, and
brothers Michael and Brian Laudrup.
	   Michael Laudrup, 34, played his 100th international against
Saudi Arabia and is the only survivor of the 1986 World Cup side.
	   ``It will be an incredibly difficult match against South
Africa,'' the team captain said of the first soccer encounter
between the two nations.
	   Brother Brian, 29, said he expected South Africa to be
``physical and aggressive.''
	   ``It's do or die for them,'' he said. ``They will have to come
out and play, which suits us perfectly because I think we are one
of the best sides in the world on the counterattack. If they come
forward they will leave themselves exposed.''
	   South Africa is still looking for its first World Cup goal, let
alone a victory. Banned from international soccer for 28 years
until 1992 because of apartheid, it has since been unable to defeat
any European nation.
	   In particular, the tight, physical European defenses give South
African attackers trouble, while the taller European players
regularly outperform South Africans in set pieces and aerial
battles.
	   Striker Phil Masinga of Bari, South Africa's tallest attacker,
may miss the match with a bad ankle, leaving the scoring onus on
young Benni McCarthy of Ajax Amsterdam.
	   Against France, South Africa fell back into a defensive shell
and never challenged offensively. Players and coaches say that must
change against the Danes.
	   ``As players, we sat down and talked about it among ourselves,''
defender Mark Fish of Bolton Wanderers said. ``We said we've got to
play our own style, what got us here.''
	   That means regaining the confidence to go forward and carry play
to Denmark.
	   ``This is a turning point for us. If we can beat the Danish
side, then things will be different,'' said midfielder John Moshoeu
of Fenerbahce. ``You have to go out there and attack.''

Philippine stocks fall on Asian currency uncertainties; peso rises 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with peso closing higher
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ After a strong opening, Philippine
stocks ended lower Wednesday, bogged down by continuing uncertainty
in Asian currency markets, traders said.
	   The peso, however, edged higher against the dollar for the first
time in 10 sessions following a slight rise in the Japanese yen.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 10.37 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 1,716.18 after dropping 20.31 points Tuesday.
	   Since June 8, the index has shed a total of 241.58 points, or 12
percent. Traders blame the market's weakness on currency travails
in Asia caused by the weak Japanese yen.
	   The index gained as much as 27 points early in the session
before closing lower.
	   Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president of Diversified Securities
Inc., said the strong market opening was understandable following
the weakness displayed by Manila shares since June 8.
	   ``The peso was strong against the dollar early in the session
and so was the yen. But then profit-taking started setting in,'' he
said.
	   ``We saw a lot of tentativeness in the market. No one wants to
be long on the market right now, so at the first sign of a rally,
investors take profits,'' Garcia said.
	   He said fears of a continuing economic recession in Japan and
the possibility the dollar may eventually hit a high of 150 yen
remained the primary concerns of investors sidelined in Asian stock
markets.
	   Traders said the Philippine stock market was also catching up
with the losses of neighboring markets.
	   Edison Yap, analyst for Philippine Commercial International Bank
Trust, said the Philippines' stronger fundamentals initially
shielded the country from the worst effects of the Asian financial
crisis.
	   ``Investors should now be paying close attention to the
Philippine economy. The unemployment rate is high, the inflation
rate has risen and the gross domestic product is slowing down,''
said Yap.
	   In currency trading, the peso tracked the yen's overnight gains,
dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.717 pesos for the day, down slightly from
Tuesday's 41.772 pesos. It was last traded at 41.680 pesos.
	   News that U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is set
to meet with Japanese finance officials buoyed the yen and eased
fears of another round of Asian currency devaluations.
	   Traders said the peso is expected to trade within a thin range
Thursday barring any unexpected development with the yen.

U.S. opposes independent world court prosecutor 
</HEADLINE>
By DANIEL J. WAKIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) - The United States Wednesday staked out a tough
position at the U.N. global court conference, demanding that the
Security Council be the trigger to set in motion prosecutions by
such a tribunal.
	   The court also should steer clear of prosecuting individuals
accused of waging national aggression, Bill Richardson, the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations told the delegates.
	   He laid out a position that puts the United States at odds with
key allies like Britain, Canada and most of the European nations,
who want the court to remain independent from the Security Council.
	   Critics say that without such independence, the court would be a
toothless pawn subject to the veto of the council's five permanent
members, the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain.
	   ``We must carefully distinguish between what looks good on paper
and what works in the real world,'' Richardson said.
	   The Security Council should play a key role because of its
``legal responsibilities for maintaining international peace and
security,'' Richardson added. Giving it the authority to refer
cases provides the prosecutor with the political muscle needed, he
said.
	   Giving the prosecutor unlimited scope is ``unrealistic and
unwise'' and will weaken the court by overloading it, Richardson
told the delegates.
	   ``This court cannot and should not address every crime that goes
unpunished, no matter how horrific or atrocious it may be.''
	   The crux of the U.S. objections is the desire to protect its
soldiers serving abroad in peacekeeping operations. They ``need to
do their jobs without exposure to policiticized proceedings,'' he
said.
	   Negotiators have submitted a proposal to overcome the obstacle,
calling for an exemption from prosecution for military prosecution
acting under orders -- unless they knew the order was illegal, or
if the order in fact was ``manifestly unlawful.''
	   The United States voiced its support to including rape under
crimes of humanity, a measure it proposed in the draft statute. A
growing number of countries have agreed.
	   Richardson noted that the United States has long backed war
crimes trials, from Nuremberg after World War II to the current
tribunals judging the perpetrators of atrocities in Rwanda and
Bosnia.
	   Negotiators hope to agree on a statute creating the court, which
would prosecute individuals and not nations, during the five-week
conference, which began Monday. It would still need ratification by
individual nations.

Photo album of President Jiang's U.S. trip hitting bookstores
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In another carefully timed move designed to
highlight the importance of the upcoming U.S.-China summit in
Beijing, a photo album about Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
American trip last fall is about to hit the bookstores.
	   ``History in Focus,'' a collection of 90 photos from Jiang's
eight-day visit due out on Saturday, ``depicts historic events
which opened a new chapter of Sino-U.S. relations,'' the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Chinese officials and state-run media credit Jiang with giving
improving China-U.S. relations a boost by visiting the United
States. President Clinton will visit China June 25 to July 3.

Albanian negotiator dismisses Milosevic's pledge to talk Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in
Kosovo dismissed President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge to
negotiate, saying Wednesday his powerful forces must halt all
actions and leave the province before any talks can start.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the four-member Kosovo Albanian team named
to negotiate with the Serbs, spoke after Milosevic promised Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to continue talks with the
moderate leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   ``What was announced in Moscow is no news, because the problem
is not whether there will be any talks with the Albanians, but the
conditions in which talks should be held,'' chief negotiator Fehmi
Agani told The Associated Press.
	   ``Two important conditions set by the international community
... have not been fulfilled. And meaningful talks depend on them,''
Agani added. ``Therefore, at this moment, we cannot say whether
there will be any talks.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen stressed Tuesday that while some progress was made in
Moscow, Milosevic failed to meet the key condition _ withdrawal of
his forces from Kosovo.
	   Milosevic promised free access for international monitors and
aid groups to western Kosovo. He said no repressive actions would
be carried out against civilians, but ruled out the withdrawal of
the Yugoslav army _ which guards the border with Albania _ and said
police presence would be reduced only when attacks by Albanian
militants cease.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March.
	   On Monday, NATO, in a show of force, sent warplanes over the
Adriatic Sea and Albania and Macedonia to reinforce the demand that
Milosevic pull back in Kosovo.
	   The Clinton administration said it will keep warships and jets
ready, should NATO decide on military action.
	   Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova met in May,
following U.S. mediation, but the Albanians canceled further talks
until Serb government troops halted their reported attacks.
	   The Serbs say they are battling the militant Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army, which wants to secede Kosovo from Serbia and
Yugoslavia by force. The clashes have driven some 60,000 people
from their homes, most within Kosovo. Others have fled to Albania
or the neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   On Tuesday, some refugees said that Serb police had attacked
makeshift refugee camps near the border with Albania, targeting
them from helicopters and killing two refugees. The reports could
not be independently confirmed.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported Wednesday an
attack by Albanian militants on a police patrol south of the
capital Pristina. No injuries were reported.
	   Serbs also said a 55-year-old Serb from central Kosovo has been
kidnapped by the KLA. Serbs have reported kidnappings before,
claiming the KLA have set up camps for Serbs. Albanians say about
200 of their kin are missing and held by the Serbs.
	   The KLA are responsible for dozens of killings of Serb policemen
and pro-Serb ethnic Albanians since 1996.
	   Most Kosovo Albanians, who make up over 90 percent of the
province's population, are seeking independence from Serbia which
rules it with heavy hand. Rugova, an advocate of peaceful
resistance, has recently been losing ground to the militant KLA.

Malaysian PM: No one likely to challenge him for top post 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad is unfazed by talk of a looming challenge from his deputy,
Anwar Ibrahim, according to news reports.
	   In an interview with the Far Eastern Economic Review, due to be
published Thursday, on the eve of the annual meeting of Malaysia's
dominant party, Mahathir said he doesn't think he'll be challenged
by Anwar _ or anyone for that matter.
	   Mahathir, who has led the Southeast Asian country for 17 years,
ruled out a no-contest motion at the United Malays National
Organization that would safeguard his and Anwar's top party posts
in polls at next year's general assembly.
	   There has been talk that a no-contest resolution might be passed
at this week's meeting to assure their positions until general
elections scheduled in 2000. That would, in effect, assure
Mahathir's position as prime minister once again, unless he chose
next year not to stand as UMNO president.
	   ``I don't want them to pass such a resolution because it means
I'm trying to perpetuate myself,'' said Mahathir. ``If anyone wants
to challenge me, he can ... but I don't think anyone will ... much
to the disappointment of a lot of people.''
	   Far from being embattled, the 72-year-old Mahathir told the
Review he's ready to take on all comers.
	   Meanwhile, the absence of a no-contest motion means Anwar, his
deputy in both party and government, could also be challenged,
particularly by former Finance Minister Razaleigh Hamzah.
	   Mahathir doesn't think that will happen, but he seemed to
distance himself from Anwar by saying he wouldn't take sides if it
occurred.
	   ``To give views like that would mean I'm siding with one or the
other,'' he said. The combative premier promised to turn up the
heat against Anwar allies who have obliquely accused him of
``corruption, cronyism and nepotism.''
	   Mahathir said: ``I'm going to publish a list of people who have
been given (privatization) awards and don't be surprised if the
people who got those things are the very same people who talk about
cronyism.''

Army general sworn in as Indonesia's new attorney general 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An army general was sworn in as
Indonesia's new attorney general Wednesday and promised to carry on
with an investigation into corruption under the rule of former
President Suharto.
	   Lt. Gen. Andi Muhammad Ghalib was appointed as the nation's top
legal officer by President B.J. Habibie, who replaced Suharto as
head of state last month.
	   Since the ex-autocrat quit after 32 years in power, a growing
number of critics and protesters have demanded that the government
investigate the extent of Suharto's wealth.
	   Suharto, through his legal adviser, has denied accusations that
he amassed a fortune worth billions of dollars.
	   Ghalib replaces former Attorney General Soedjono Atmonegoro, who
earlier this month launched a broad inquiry into state corruption
under Suharto's rule.
	   Habibie has not said why he made the replacement. But Soedjono
was a staunch Suharto loyalist, while Ghalib is viewed as more
independent from the former president's family.
	   Some government opponents say a specific investigation targeting
Suharto and his family should be set up.
	   Habibie has indicated that he will not stand in the way of any
lawful investigation into corruption involving Suharto.
	   However, the president has stressed that inquiries must be made
according to Indonesian law and be based on respect for human
rights, including the presumption of innocence.
	   ``I will follow up what has been pioneered by the former
attorney general, but I have to start working first,'' Ghalib told
reporters.
	   ``This is my commitment. I will work with all sincerity in
fulfilling my job and responsibility for the sake of nation and the
people as soon as possible,'' he said.
	   The military plays a constitutionally sanctioned role in
Indonesian politics. Although Habibie himself is a civilian, many
of his Cabinet ministers are serving or retired generals.

Prominent Egyptian cleric Sheik Sharawi dies 
</HEADLINE>
By SALAH NASRAWI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ One of the Muslim world's leading clerics,
Sheik Mohammed Mutwali Sharawi of Egypt, died Wednesday, his family
said. He was 87.
	   Sharawi, who served minister of religious endowments under the
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 19767-78, died at his home near
the pyramids of Giza at dawn, his family said.
	   The cause was not immediately known. Last week Sharawi was
admitted to a hospital after suffering a sever bout of asthma.
	   Egypt's leading Islamic authority, the Grand Sheik of Al-Azhar,
Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, described Sharawi's death as a great loss
not only to Egypt, but to the whole Islamic world.
	   ``Time rarely gives birth to such a glorious imam who devoted
his life to making the word of God esteemed,'' Tantawi said in a
statement.
	   Sharawi's teachings and rulings won him wide acclaim in the
Muslim world, but they were also controversial. Moderate Muslims
considered them outdated.
	   He angered feminists and human rights activists by supporting
female circumcision and by ruling that women should not be
appointed to top government positions or become judges. He also
condemned organ transplants and the paying of interest on bank
deposits as un-Islamic.
	   But such rulings were well received in Saudi Arabia and Gulf
countries where governments enforce a strict interpretation of
Islam.
	   Moustafa Mashhour, the leader of Egypt's most powerful Islamic
group, the Muslim Brotherhood, said Sharawi's ``fingerprints on
Islamic teaching were matchless.''
	   Egyptian Endowment Minister Hadi Zaqzouq said state officials
would attend Sharawi's funeral and the government would provide
facilities. The ceremony was scheduled to be held before sundown
Wednesday in Sharawi's home village of Daqadous, Daqahlliya
province, some 12O kilometers (75 miles) north of Cairo.
	   He is survived by three sons and two daughters. His son, Sheik
Sami, is a cleric at Al-Azhar Institute in Cairo.

Thai premier rules out elections before economy improves 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on
Wednesday ruled out calling early elections before Thailand's
stricken economy is more solidly on the road to recovery.
	   The declaration in a speech to the Foreign Chambers of Commerce
was aimed at reassuring nervous investors as a second wave of the
Asian crisis triggered by the weak Japanese yen threatened to knock
the Thai economy down again.
	   Chuan was also countering pressure from the parliamentary
opposition and some pressure groups for him to call new polls by
the end of the year.
	   Chuan said that holding elections ``when the economic crisis is
still being tackled may affect investor confidence in the
continuity of our economic policies and in the government's ability
to manage our economic recovery.''
	   ``Therefore, when all these issues have been properly addressed,
general elections will be held,'' Chuan said.
	   Chuan said elections would be held before the full term of
Parliament ends in November 2000, but not before new electoral laws
are fine-tuned and economic recovery is further along.
	   The government and International Monetary Fund predict the
current recession will end early next year, but private economists
say the crisis could last three to five years.
	   Chuan came to office last November when the government of his
predecessor, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, collapsed because of discontent
over the crisis Chavalit was seen as triggering by floating the
Thai baht in July after an unsuccessful defense against currency
speculators.
	   Widely considered Thailand's most honest political leader, Chuan
lifted confidence at home and abroad when he took over and stuck to
the tight fiscal reforms laid down by the IMF in a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout for Thailand.
	   But the premier is facing increasing criticism as the high
interest rates demanded by the IMF to achieve currency stability
are crippling businesses, many of which are on the verge of
bankruptcy.
	   Chuan said the problem needed to be addressed quickly or the
closure of businesses and worsening unemployment ``may lead to
other political and social consequences in the future.''
	   The prime minister noted that the government was revising the
Alien Business Law, which restricts foreign ownership of property,
and that a slew of state enterprises will be privatized, but the
details are taking time to work out.

Emergency program, Chubais' possible appointment to fight crisis economic program to include spending cuts and aggressive tax collection. Trims. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Central Bank stressing ruble won't be devalued,
AP Photos
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government will need all its ``courage
and political will'' to implement a strict emergency program
intended to overcome the nation's financial crisis, Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko said Wednesday.
	   In another move to help boost confidence in Russia's crumbling
markets, President Boris Yeltsin may appoint former deputy premier
and leading reformer Anatoly Chubais as his envoy to the
international lending organizations.
	   Details of the economic program, which is said to involve deep
spending cuts and aggressive tax collections, will be revealed at a
special Cabinet meeting chaired by Yeltsin on Tuesday, Kiriyenko
said.
	   ``Some of the program's provisions are going to be unpopular,''
Kiriyenko said, addressing an economic conference of former Soviet
republics in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city.
	   The cave-in of Russia's financial markets late last month
prompted fears of a devaluation of the national currency, the
ruble, which would lead to a sharp rise in prices. Combined with
the government's continuing inability to pay state workers their
wages on time, that could lead to mass protests.
	   Sergei Dubinin, the head of the Central Bank, reiterated to
reporters at the conference that the ruble would not be devalued,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. He said that the Central Bank's
gross reserves had held steady during the past week, and totaled
dlrs 15 billion on Monday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Apart from the Asian financial crisis and the decline of prices
for oil and natural gas _ the nation's main export items _ the
recent Russian market collapse has been caused by the government's
free spending, Kiriyenko said.
	   ``The world financial crisis has fallen on fertile ground in
Russia _ that is the crisis of confidence in the system that lives
beyond its means,'' Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   ``Austere budget stabilization,'' will be needed to overcome the
crisis, he said.
	   In an apparent bid to boost ties with the International Monetary
Fund and other lenders, Yeltsin may appoint Anatoly Chubais, former
architect of Russia's economic reforms, as presidential liaison
with international financial institutions. Chubais is ``one of the
most likely candidates'' for the job, Kiriyenko said Wednesday.
	   The IMF is considering boosting its lending to Russia to
stabilize financial markets. The fund is imposing strict conditions
on any further lending, however, and has so far made it clear it is
in no hurry to make loans to Russia.
	   Yeltsin has twice fired Chubais from his Cabinet, most recently
in the government shakeup in March. He was recently appointed head
of Russia's huge state-owned electricity monopoly, Unified Energy
Systems.
	   Boris Jordan, chief executive of MFK Renaissance, a leading
Russian investment bank, welcomed Chubais' possible appointment,
saying it would stabilize the financial markets in just two months,
ITAR-Tass reported.

World Cup: Soccer chief says he's received Iranian threats to disrupt U.S. match AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Iranian exile groups have threatened to disrupt the
politically charged World Cup match between Iran and the United
States, the head of international soccer said Wednesday.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said his office had been contacted
by exile groups that pledged to take action at Sunday's match in
Lyon.
	   ``We have received more-or-less anonymous letters from groups of
exiled Iranians who say they will do something to disrupt the match
to show what is going on in their country,'' Blatter said.
	   He declined to identify the groups or say if any specific type
of action was threatened.
	   But a spokesman for Mujahedeen el-Khalq, an Iraqi-based
opposition force, denied the exiles were threatening to disrupt the
match and accused Tehran of trying to smear the group.
	   Blatter also said he was certain police and security forces
would be able to deal with any problems.
	   ``I'm sure the local organizing committee and the public
authorities are going to take specific measures,'' Blatter said.
``I'm sure things will be fine at the match.''
	   Organizing committee and security forces reportedly were told to
keep an eye out at Iran's opening match against Yugoslavia last
Sunday for banners or posters denouncing the Tehran regime.
	   The comments by the newly elected FIFA president were the latest
elements in the buildup for what is one of the most politically and
culturally complex soccer match ever staged.
	   U.S. and Iranian governments have not had diplomatic relations
since the Islamic revolution in Tehran and the taking of hostages
at the U.S. Embassy in 1979. The United States, which supported the
previous regime of the Shah of Iran, overnight became the ``Great
Satan'' and Iran became the world's top public enemy to many
Americans.
	   In recent months, however, there has been a slight thaw in
relations between Washington and Tehran, as well as movement in
sports.
	   A U.S. wrestling team went to the Iranian capital for a
tournament earlier this year and received a warm welcome. Iranians,
in turn, later wrestled in a tournament in Oklahoma.
	   And at the World Cup draw in December, the ultimate meeting was
made, when both the United States and Iran were placed in Group F
with Germany and Yugoslavia.
	   The situation became even more muddled this week when Iranian
officials denounced a French television network for Monday night's
broadcast of an American film, ``Not Without My Daughter,'' that
paints an unflattering portrait of Iran and its religious
leadership.
	   There were reports in the French media early Wednesday that Iran
was ready to pull out of the World Cup because of the film, but the
press section of the Iranian Embassy here vehemently denied that
any such action was planned.
	   Despite all these flashpoints, Blatter said he hoped the soccer
match would prove the power of sports to overcome political
differences.
	   ``We will, I am sure, see that people can go out on the field of
play and shake hands, even if their governments do not get along,''
he said.

Philip Morris to boost investments in Ukraine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The Philip Morris Co. plans to boost
investments in Ukraine and is considering opening a cigarette plant
in the former Soviet nation, officials said Wednesday.
	   Philip Morris' managing director in Kiev, George Farah, met on
Wednesday with Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko to discuss the
plans.
	   Pustovoitenko welcomed the Richmond-based company's intention to
invest directly in his country's struggling economy, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The premier offered Philip Morris a base for the prospective
plant in one of the future free-trade zones being created in the
eastern region of Donetsk and on the Crimean Peninsula, it said.
	   Farah said the plant under consideration, whose estimated cost
is around dlrs 200 million, would be able to produce some 12 to 15
billion cigarettes a year, including the Marlboro, L&AMP;M and
Parliament brands, according to the report.
	   Philip Morris is a shareholder in the Kharkiv Tobacco Factory
and already has invested dlrs 28 million into its modernization,
Interfax noted. Farah said Philip Morris plans to bring the
investments in the plant to dlrs 48 million by the end of 1998, it
added.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ German chancellor candidate Gerhard
Schroeder arrived here Wednesday to assure Polish leaders that he
considers Poland an important ally and foresees no major change in
relations with Warsaw should he win Septmember elections.
	   Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democrat challenging Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, is expected to confirm his party's support for
Poland's aspirations to join the European Union.
	   This is Schroeder's third trip abroad since he won the Social
Democrats' nomination to challenge Kohl. He earlier visited Israel
and Lebanon, then France.
	   In Warsaw, Schroeder was meeting Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz as well as Solidarity chairman
Marina Krzaklewski and opposition leader, Leszek Miller, the head
of Poland's ex-communist Social Democracy party.
	   He also was scheduled to have lunch with President Aleksander
Kwasniewski.
	   Although Schroeder has indicated foreign policy would not play
an important role in his election campaign, his aides say that good
relations with Warsaw is key to Germany's support for European
integration.
	   Germany, Poland's largest trading partner, is seen here as a
major advocate of Poland's EU membership.
	   But besides words of support, Polish leaders are expected to
hear that a Social Democratic government would seek to limit the
number of Polish workers in Germany.
	   Schroeder has indicated that immediately opening the German
labor market to Poland and other eastern European nations would
diminish support in Germany for European Union expansion. He has
said that these countries will have to improve pay and living
standards before they can count on free access to German labor
market.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ One of the Muslim world's leading clerics,
Sheik Mohammed Mutwali Sharawi of Egypt, died early Wednesday, his
family said. He was 87.
	   Sharawi, who served as minister of religious endowments under
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1976-78, died at his home near
the pyramids of Giza, his family said.
	   The cause of death was not immediately known. Last week, Sharawi
was admitted to hospital after a severe bout of asthma.
	   ``Time rarely gives birth to such a glorious imam who devoted
his life to making the word of God esteemed,'' Egypt's leading
Islamic authority, the Grand Sheik of Al-Azhar, Mohammed Sayed
Tantawi, said in a statement.
	   Sharawi's ``fingerprints on Islamic teaching were matchless,''
said Moustafa Mashhour, the leader of Egypt's largest
fundamentalist group, the Muslim Brotherhood.
	   Sharawi's teachings and rulings won him wide acclaim in the
Muslim world, but they were also controversial. Moderate Muslims
considered them outdated.
	   He angered feminists and human rights activists by supporting
female circumcision and by ruling that women should not be
appointed to top government positions or become judges. He also
condemned organ transplants and the paying of interest on bank
deposits as un-Islamic.
	   But such rulings went down well in Saudi Arabia and Gulf
countries where governments enforce a strict interpretation of
Islam.
	   Egypt's Endowment Minister Hadi Zaqzouq said state officials
would attend Sharawi's funeral. The ceremony was scheduled to be
held before sundown Wednesday in his home village of Daqadous,
Daqahlliya province, some 12O kilometers (75 miles) north of Cairo.
	   He is survived by three sons and two daughters. His son, Sheik
Sami, is a cleric at Al-Azhar Institute, Cairo.

North Korea calls for reconciliation festival with South 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea has proposed that citizens from both
halves of the divided Korean Peninsula gather in the border truce
village of Panmunjom Aug. 14-15 for a ``grand festival for national
reconciliation, unity and reunification.''
	   In a Korean-language broadcast monitored in Tokyo, Pyongyang
Radio said Wednesday the festival would mark the 53rd anniversary
of Korea's liberation from 35 years of Japanese colonial rule.
	   Soon after liberation, the peninsula was divided into the
communist North and capitalist South. The two sides fought a bloody
war in 1950-53 and never made a formal peace.
	   Recent four-party talks aimed at a peace treaty have bogged
down. The talks also include the United States, which led U.N.
forces on South Korea's side in the war, and China, which fought on
North Korea's side.
	   The broadcast said the proposal was contained in letters sent
Monday through Panmunjom to South Korean President Kim Dae-jung,
political party leaders and various sector leaders.

Newspaper: Chances for redemption of Odessa bonds diminish 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Chances for investors to receive redemption
payments for Odessa municipal bonds have sharply diminished and
foreign investors may lose millions of dollars in the deal,
according to a report Wednesday.
	   Porto-Franco, the bank that managed last year's dlrs 32.9
million bond issue in the Black Sea port, said this week that city
authorities have failed to transfer money for redemption payments,
the newspaper Kievskiye Vedomosti reported.
	   Finance Minister Ihor Mytyukov also has refused to finance the
payments, saying that ``such local bond issues should be brought to
an end,'' the paper said.
	   ``So far, I see no reasons whatsoever to serve this bond issue
from the state budget. Formally, the budget has no funds allocated
for that. Under the conditions of the issue, the emissary bears
full responsibility,'' it quoted the minister as saying.
	   Mytyukov said a final decision would be made after the
completion of an audit of the city books ordered by the national
government.
	   Payments for the bond issue, which has an annual return of 50
percent, began in late May but were soon stopped as President
Leonid Kuchma ordered a probe into Odessa's financial dealings,
alleging abuse of funds and corruption in the city government.
	   Total redemption payments amount to dlrs 44 million, and 70
percent of investors who subscribed to the bond issue were
foreigners, according to Porto-Franco officials.
	   The suspension of payments was seen as part of a political
battle in Odessa that started after Kuchma's ally, Ruslan Bodelan,
lost the March mayoral election to incumbent Eduard Hurvits
following an often violent campaign.
	   Ukraine's Supreme Court invalidated the election results, and
Kuchma has fired both rivals, sending his representative to head
the city government until a new election is held in August.
	   Control over Odessa, one of Ukraine's major business centers and
the site of a key oil export terminal, is vital for the central
government, which wants to use the port to transport Caspian Sea
oil to Europe.

Two Israelis soldiers wounded in southern Lebanon bombing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas wounded two Israeli soldiers in
an overnight roadside bombing in southern Lebanon, Lebanese
security officials said Wednesday.
	   The bomb was detonated by remote control about midnight (21:00
GMT) Tuesday as an Israeli army patrol was driving along a road
near the village of Hadatha on the edge of an Israeli-occupied
zone, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army statement said two soldiers were
injured ``very lightly'' and were taken to hospital in Israel.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing,
which bore the hallmarks of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla
group.
	   Hezbollah frequently uses roadside bombs in its war of attrition
against some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of an
Israeli-allied Lebanese militia in the occupied zone.
	   The bombing came hours after Israeli warplanes twice attacked
suspected guerrilla positions in south Lebanon.
	   There were no casualties in the air raids on Iqlim al-Tuffah, a
Hezbollah stronghold that faces the occupied zone.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, a frequent target of Israeli warplanes, is used
by Hezbollah as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and
their allied militiamen in the zone. Israel has maintained the zone
since 1985 in a bid to prevent guerrilla attacks on its northern
territory.

Local banks lent 11 percent of PAL's dlrs 2 billion debt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Strike-ravaged Philippine Airlines
said Wednesday that local banks hold just over 11 percent of its
dlrs 2 billion debt burden, on which it hopes to delay payments.
	   PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said nine local banks
lent dlrs 230 million to the airline, mainly to help finance an
ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program.
	   PAL officials said they plan to petition Manila's Securities and
Exchange Commission to allow them to suspend payments on the debt
because of crippling financial losses worsened by a pilots' strike.
	   The 13-day strike by more than 600 pilots has cost the company
more than 2 billion pesos (dlrs 50 million) in lost revenue, PAL
said.
	   The airline announced Monday it will lay off 5,000 workers _
nearly 40 percent of its 13,000-member work force _ in an effort to
survive.
	   Aquino did not give a breakdown of the local banks' loan
exposure to PAL, but a securities company said a payment suspension
by PAL would be particularly damaging to Philippine National Bank,
which is believed to be saddled by bad debts.
	   PNB also has equity exposure in PAL through a 752 million peso
(dlrs 18.8 million) investment in PR Holdings, which owns 67
percent of PAL. The Philippine government has a large equity in
PNB.
	   PAL was already in serious financial shape before the strike
began because of a long history of losses and its new airplane
purchase program. The program was launched shortly before Asia's
currency crisis, which sharply reduced passenger numbers and
inflated operating and loan costs.
	   About 20 aircraft of the 36 jets ordered from Boeing Co. and
Airbus Industrie have already been delivered. A PAL official said
Tuesday it now has decided to dispose of all but 14 of its 54
planes and suspend all plane orders.
	   The airline met Monday with banks that together have a loan
exposure of about dlrs 1.5 billion to PAL and warned them of
possible delays in repayments, Senior Vice President Avelino
Zapanta said.
	   Zapanta said the 14 remaining planes would be appropriate for
about 50 pilots. The airline now has only 25 senior management
pilots after firing the 600 striking pilots for ignoring a
government return-to-work order.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada, who takes office on June 30, has
said he plans to sell the government's stake in the airline.
	   The Philippine government fully owned PAL, Asia's first airline,
until 1992.
	   The pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest a new
management policy of ordering the retirement of certain pilots who
have reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless
of age.
	   The company says it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 202 million) in
the fiscal year that ended March 31 _ the most in its 57-year
history.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) - The United States Wednesday staked out a tough
position at the U.N. global court conference, demanding that the
Security Council be a trigger to set in motion prosecutions by such
a tribunal.
	   The court also should steer clear of prosecuting individuals
accused of waging national aggression, Bill Richardson, the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told the delegates.
	   He laid out a position that puts the United States at odds with
key allies like Britain, Canada and most of the European nations,
which want the court to remain independent from the Security
Council.
	   Critics say that without such independence, the court would be a
toothless pawn subject to the veto of the council's five permanent
members, the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain.
	   ``We must carefully distinguish between what looks good on paper
and what works in the real world,'' Richardson said.
	   The Security Council should play a key role because of its
``legal responsibilities for maintaining international peace and
security,'' Richardson added. Giving it the authority to refer
cases provides the prosecutor with the political muscle needed, he
said.
	   Individual states also should have the power to refer matters
for investigation, he said.
	   Human Rights Watch, a critic of the U.S. position, noted that
Richardson did not insist that individual Security Council members
be allowed to veto specific cases -- which shows the United States
may be open to compromise.
	   However, it was ``shameful'' that the United States did not take
a stand that individual states should not be allowed to block
investigations, said the group's Richard Dicker.
	   ``Any tyrant accused of war crimes can block his prosecution,''
he said.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's leading opposition party
on Wednesday condemned the killings of two supporters and said the
rise of politically motivated slayings would have a serious impact
on elections scheduled July 26.
	   The royalist FUNCINPEC party led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
deposed as co-prime minister last year in a bloody coup by
strongman Hun Sen, called the killings a ``deliberate intimidation
of its grassroots supporters during the electoral process.''
	   The party statement said activist Phun Pheoun, 32, was dragged
from his home and executed by three unidentified armed men and that
Neang Mom Yang, 39-year-old wife of a party activist, was shot to
death while she was weaving at her house.
	   Police said both incidents occurred Sunday at different villages
in Prey Veng province of eastern Cambodia. Mao Chandara, a
high-ranking police official, suggested the killings could have
been motivated by robbery, jealousy or revenge.
	   FUNCINPEC warned that an atmosphere of impunity _ no one has
been prosecuted for some 100 killings of Hun Sen's opponents since
the coup _ would affect the election results.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to restore international aid
and legitimacy lost since the coup, but the opposition has accused
him of using violence and coercion to stack the process in his
favor.

World Cup: French heavily favored against desperate Saudis to conform 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with fresh French quotes, Saudi plan for match, edits

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ For France, it is just another
step that will hopefully lead to the World Cup final. For Saudi
Arabia, Thursday's match at the Stade de France might as well be
the final.
	   France keeps reminding itself not to be too optimistic after a
confident 3-0 win over South Africa, while the Saudis have their
back against the wall. Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has said he
will be seeking to stymie playmaker Zinedine Zidane.
	   ``If Zidane is OK, you can put anyone against him. And such
tactics always frees somebody up,'' said French defender Marcel
Desailly.
	   Les Bleus will seek to keep the home crowd on its hands with a
new show of sparkling, offensive play, something that has been
missing from the Saudi's performances so far.
	   France will miss starting forward Stephane Guivarc'h with a knee
injury and is unlikely to field fellow-striker David Trezeguet,
still recovering from a minor ankle strain. It will likely start
the team that finished off the drubbing of South Africa.
	   Saudi Arabia has a fully fit team, but hardly has confidence
going for it.
	   ``They had a good start and that puts us under a lot of
pressure,'' said Parreira ahead of his blackout.
	   His counterpart Aime Jacquet doesn't expect this to be a fun
outing in industrial Saint-Denis either.
	   ``Our opponent will play for its survival so don't expect a
pleasure trip out there,'' said Jacquet.
	   Another three points might already qualify them for the second
round, if Denmark does the expected and beats South Africa.

Belarus' president claims ownership of ambassadors' residence

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The diplomatic compound at the center of a
dispute between Belarusian authorities and a number of countries,
including the United States, France, Germany and Russia, was
decorated with a new sign on Wednesday.
	   ``The residence of the President of the Republic of Belarus,''
the sign said, in Russian and Belarusian.
	   Diplomats and their families living in the compound are
resisting the government's efforts to evict them from their homes
in Drozdy, a pleasant pine woods on the outskirts of capital Minsk.
	   This spring, the Belarusian authorities decided that the sewage
and plumbing system that serves the 1940s-era compound is badly
antiquated and requires urgent repairs. They told the diplomats to
move out.
	   Ambassadors protested, saying that under the Vienna Convention,
diplomatic residences are considered the sovereign territory of the
diplomats' country.
	   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has a residence
down the road from the Drozdy residences, responded that the
diplomatic compound belongs to him.
	   On Wednesday, he had a sign to support the claim.
	   Ann Speckhard, the wife of U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard, who
went outside the compound to walk her dog, told reporters on
Wednesday that her family intended to stay. All sewage and plumbing
systems and telephone lines at the compound were working fine, and
her family was feeling ``OK,'' Mrs. Speckhard said.
	   Later, the head of Lukashenko's personal guard service, Col.
Mikhail Tesovets, arrived at the compound to tell reporters that
the Belarusian Foreign Ministry was holding a briefing for
ambassadors, where ``everything is being explained to them.''
	   ``Nobody is evicting anyone, not today or tomorrow,'' Tesovets
said.
	   ``Living in the president's residence is allowed under a pass
system,'' Tesovets added. He did not elaborate.
	   Belarusian police were checking papers at the entrance to the
complex, and diplomatic cars were being allowed through.
	   A group of workers could be seen dismantling the roof of one
building in the compound.
	   Ambassadors from Bulgaria and some former Soviet republics have
left the compound, but the U.S. ambassador and others want to stay
during the repairs.
	   The Foreign Ministry has offered the ambassadors apartments in
downtown Minsk, cottages 30 kilometers (18 miles) outside Minsk or
plots on which to build new residences.
	   Speckhard has said that envoys would prefer to remain in the
complex during the repairs. He noted that he has had no problems
with either his water or sewage systems in the year his family has
lived in the complex.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities have arrested three people,
including a consultant for the World Cup's marketing agency, in a
probe of a ticket fraud that froze out thousands of Japanese soccer
fans, police officials said Wednesday.
	   More arrests could follow, the officials said on customary
anonymity.
	   Police arrested Gilles Favard, 46, the consultant for ISL
France, at his home Monday in the upscale western Paris suburb of
Rueil-Malmaison, where they found a large amount of cash and about
100 World Cup tickets, the sources said.
	   The arrests came after more than 12,000 Japanese fans were left
ticketless for the World Cup, among a number of cases that have
plagued the five-week championship that began last week.
	   Two other people were detained, police said, including Favard's
sister, Stella, believed not to have known of the fraud, and a
friend believed to have helped the consultant sell tickets by fax.
	   ISL France officials were not immediately available for comment.
But a spokesman for the parent company, Swiss-based ISL Worldwide,
said the consultant worked for an ISL France trade magazine.
	   Favard used ISL letterhead to con ticket agencies or buyers into
paying him for tickets, said Philippe Margraff, ISL Worldwide
senior vice president.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NEMA MILITARY SECTOR II, Senegal (AP) _ Violence in the
aftermath of a failed coup in Guinea-Bissau has spread to the West
African country's northern border, with neighboring Senegal
launching an artillery barrage across the frontier into rebel
territory. The attack Tuesday, aimed at dislodging Senegal's own
separatist rebels with suspected links to coup leader Brig.
Ansumane Mane, came while heavy fighting in Guinea-Bissau continued
to rock the capital of Bissau. Tens of thousands of refugees were
fleeing Bissau in hopes of finding shelter in Senegal, but the
cross-border clash about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of
Bissau cut one of their main escape routes. Mane's soldiers have
been holed up since June 7 at a military garrison in suburban
Bissau.(GUINEA-BISSAU)
	   PARIS (AP) _ French courts pursued a crackdown on World Cup
violence by dealing out more jail sentences, convicting two Germans
and three more English fans. Meanwhile, authorities hoping to
prevent more hooliganism during the Cup prepared security
clampdowns Wednesday for other high-risk matches involving the
English in Toulouse and Lens over the next week. Judges ordered
two- and four-month jail terms for the three English fans, after
three others were convicted Monday. The two Germans received
three-month sentences, France Info radio reported. Six more Germans
were to be judged Wednesday, the radio said. The crackdown followed
three nights and two days of violence around Monday's match in
Marseille between England and Tunisia. More than 50 people were
injured and 80 arrested in clashes that damaged the Old Port
district. (FRANCE-WORLD CUP-VIOLENCE)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli police on Wednesday arrested three
Jewish settlers, two of them juveniles, in the beating death of a
Palestinian farmer that one of the suspects reportedly described as
a prank gone wrong. The three, whose names and ages were not
released, hid their faces behind towels and prayer shawls for the
walk into a Jerusalem courtroom, where a magistrate was to consider
extending their detention. Abdel Majid Turki, 45, was killed
Tuesday afternoon near the Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai just
south of the volatile West Bank town of Hebron. There was concern
his killing would spark new violence. Turki was walking from his
fields along a main road near Beit Hagai when he was attacked.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Maintaining intense pressure on President Bill
Clinton ahead of his upcoming China visit, Congress is examining an
export policy that may have helped improve the accuracy of Chinese
missiles. The Clinton administration has come under fire over the
possibility that guidance technology may have been revealed to
China in a case under investigation by the Justice Department and
Congress. The sensitive information was contained in a report
investigating the failure of a 1996 launch of a Loral Space and
Communications satellite by a Chinese missile. Several critics of
the administration's export policy were set to testify Wednesday
before a joint hearing of the International Relations and National
Security committees, including former Pentagon official Henry
Sokolski. (US-CHINA)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains
all but meaningless for most of the world's people half a century
after it was proclaimed by the U.N. General Assembly, Amnesty
International said in its annual report released Wednesday. The
international human rights organization said it had documented
cases of summary executions in at least 55 nations, the detention
of ``prisoners of conscience'' in 87 nations and torture in 117
countries. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights ``has been
called 'the world's best-kept secret,' despite government agreeing
in 1948 to actively promote it wherever possible,'' said Pierre
Sane, secretary-general of Amnesty International. (AMNESTY REPORT)

Donald will spearhead bowling attack 
</HEADLINE>
By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Four years ago, South Africa's fast bowler Allan
Donald terrorized the English batsmen in a test at Lord's. An
injury-plagued Donald will attempt to repeat the feat Thursday.
	   Donald took a match haul of 7-103 against England as South
Africa celebrated its first tour to England in 29 years with a 356
run victory at Lord's in 1994.
	   A more seasoned Donald will again spearhead the bowling attack
but he will be playing with an ankle injury.
	   The injury hampered Donald in the first test against England at
Edgbaston recently and, as a result, the South African attack
lacked the ferocity it generated four years earlier.
	   But his availability came as reassuring news for the visitors,
whose tour has been dogged by bad weather, a lack of match practice
and injury worries.
	   Donald, one of the fastest bowlers in international cricket,
needed a cortisone injection on his troubled ankle during the drawn
first test.
	   South African team physiotherapist Craig Smith said the injury
was repetitive stress syndrome or inflammation.
	   ``He's had the problem for some time and we want to keep our
eyes on it,'' coach Bob Woolmer said after Donald underwent a
precautionary scan of the injury.
	   Donald has played with the injury since South Africa's tour of
Australia in January but plans to undergo corrective surgery after
the current five-test series.
	   Donald and his understudy Shaun Pollock were well short of
rhythm in the first test and will go to Lord's short of match
bowling.
	   Pollock, a fledging all rounder, is nursing a groin strain.
	   The tourists are also concerned about the lack of quality time
their batsmen have spent at the wicket, with the team facing just
36 first-class overs between the tests.
	   Daryll Cullinan has not played since the first test.
	   To compound the problem, skipper Hansie Cronje has batted once
since scoring one in the first test. He scored 15 in a one-day
match against Nottinghamshire.
	   South Africa selectors have kept their options open for the
second test line-up to bolster the batting strength.
	   Opener Gehardus Liebenberg could make way for Adam Bacher, or
selectors could bring in all rounder Brian McMillan, drop
Liebenberg and promote No. 3 batsman Jacques Kallis to open with
Gary Kirsten.
	   McMillan has not played since February when he pulled out of the
first test against Pakistan at Johannesburg with a muscle injury.
	   England was hit by injury concerns Wednesday and selectors
called up Glamorgan's Steve James, plus Graeme Hick and veteran
wicketkeeper Jack Russell to its squad.
	   The players were called up to bolster the England squad, with
opener Mark Butcher in extreme doubt due to a thumb injury and
skipper Alec Stewart experiencing back problems and food poisoning
Wednesday.
	   The experienced Dean Headley is expected to get the nod over
Chris Silverwood to replace the injured Darren Gough in England's
starting 11.
	   Headley will form a medium pace-quartet with Cork, Angus Fraser
and Mark Ealham, while off spinner Robert Croft remains the only
specialist slow bowler.
	   Captains past and present _ Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart _
together with Fraser are the only survivors from 1994 Lord's-test
loss to South Africa.
	   The squads:
	   England (from) _ Mike Atherton, Mark Butcher, Alec Stewart
(captain), Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe, Mark Ramprakash, Mark
Ealham, Dominic Cork, Robert Croft, Dean Headley, Angus Fraser and
Chris Silverwood.
	   South Africa (from) _ Gary Kirsten, Gehardus Liebenberg, Jacques
Kallis, Daryll Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Brian McMillan,
Jonty Rhodes, Mark Boucher, Shaun Pollock, Lance Klusener, Allan
Donald and Paul Adams.

Hamas: Egypt refusing transit visa to Sheik Yassin 
</HEADLINE>
By SALAH NASRAWI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt is refusing a transit visa to Hamas
leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin until Israel announces officially that he
will be let into the Gaza Strip, a Hamas spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Yassin and two aides have been waiting more than two weeks in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, for visas to enter Egypt.
	   ``Our brothers in Egypt are only telling us to wait until
arrangements have been made,'' Jamal Issa, the Sudan representative
of Hamas, said in a telephone interview from Khartoum. ``But we do
not know for how long we should wait.''
	   An Israeli official said Monday that the government will allow
Yassin to return to the Gaza Strip. But Egypt appears to be waiting
for a formal statement to that effect.
	   Yassin can go to the Strip only through road border crossings in
Egypt.
	   Jordan, which borders the Palestinian-administered West Bank,
also has refused to allow Yassin in.
	   Egypt fears that if Yassin gets stuck at its border with Gaza,
he would be an embarrassment to the government, which has close
ties with Yasser Arafat and his Palestinian Authority. Hamas'
popularity in the Palestinian territories, especially in the Strip,
is seen as a growing threat to Arafat's authority.
	   Yassin came to Sudan on May 29 after a 14-week fund raising tour
of the Arab world and Iran. During his trip he repeatedly issued
statements supporting the armed struggle against Israel.
	   Some Israeli legislators are known to oppose his return, but the
government appears to have decided that Yassin poses more of a
threat abroad than in Gaza, where his activities can be monitored
by the Palestinian Authority.
	   ``Any Israeli decision to ban the sheik from entering will be a
catastrophe for Israel. It will face dire consequences,'' Issa
said.
	   Hamas opposes the Palestinian Authority and rejects Arafat's
peace agreements with Israel. It has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings since 1994 with the aim of wrecking the accords.
About 80 people were killed in its bombings in Israel in 1996-97.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last year in exchange for
the freedom of two Israeli spies captured in Jordan during a
bungled assassination attempt against another Hamas leader.

Bodies of four of five missing Scottish fishermen found 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Rescuers have recovered the bodies of
four Scottish fishermen who were missing after their boat collided
with a German freighter and sank off Denmark, a news report said
Wednesday. A fifth Scottish crewman was still missing.
	   The fishing boat Silvery Sea and the German freighter Merkur
collided in clear weather early Sunday. The Scottish vessel sank,
while the Merkur made it to the Danish port of Esbjerg for repairs.
A rescue effort by helicopters and seven ships failed to find to
find any survivors.
	   On Tuesday, searchers located the wreck of the Silvery Sea about
50 kilometers (30 miles) off Esbjerg on Denmark's west coast, and
divers recovered the bodies of four victims, the regional newspaper
Jydske Vestkysten reported.
	   Police told the newspaper that the victims had not immediately
been identified and that relatives would probably be flown from
Scotland to Esbjerg, 310 kilometers (192 miles) west of Copenhagen,
to identify them.
	   The Silvery Sea had been bound for Esbjerg to deliver a catch of
sea eels.

Railway company orders safety check after train derailed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A rail operator removed its 31 high-speed,
electric trains from service for safety checks Wednesday after a
train carriage derailed outside London.
	   No one was seriously injured when the carriage derailed Tuesday
evening, but one person required treatment for shock, British
Transport Police said. Great North Eastern Railways blamed the
derailment on a cracked carriage wheel.
	   The railway said passengers on its main line from London to
northeast England and Scotland would experience long delays until
the trains were back in service. That line regularly carries about
30,000 passengers a day.
	   British lawyer Richard Knaggs was traveling in the train when
the carriage bumped off the track about 20 minutes outside London,
near Sandy in Bedfordshire.
	   ``We bumped along for a few hundred yards, but actually it was
quite a smooth stop,'' he said.
	   Christopher Garnett, the railways' chief executive, sought to
reassure passengers.
	   ``Safety of our passengers is our No. 1 priority,'' he said.
``As a prudent, precautionary measure we have withdrawn all
electric trains for immediate checks.''
	   A broken wheel is suspected as the cause of a June 3 train
derailment in Eschede, Germany, that killed 100 people.

Political killings condemned; opposition party to defy ban 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with political killings. Trims
By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's leading opposition party
on Wednesday condemned the killings of two supporters, while
another vowed to defy a ban on campaign demonstrations ahead of
elections July 26.
	   The royalist FUNCINPEC party led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
deposed as co-prime minister last year in a bloody coup by
strongman Hun Sen, called the killings a ``deliberate
intimidation'' of its supporters and said violence would affect the
polls.
	   The party statement said activist Phun Pheoun, 32, was dragged
from his home and executed by three unidentified armed men and that
Neang Mom Yang, 39-year-old wife of a party activist, was shot to
death while she was weaving at her house.
	   Police said both incidents occurred Sunday at different villages
in Prey Veng province of eastern Cambodia. Mao Chandara, a
high-ranking police official, suggested the killings could have
been motivated by robbery, jealousy or revenge.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to restore international aid
and legitimacy lost since the coup, but the opposition has accused
him of using violence and coercion to rig the process in his favor.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party, another opposition group, announced
Wednesday that it viewed a ban on political demonstrations issued
by Hun Sen's government as illegal. Sam Rainsy, a leading
dissident, has vowed to go ahead with a planned rally Sunday.
	   Mann Chhoeun, a high-ranking Phnom Penh city official, said
earlier Wednesday he was drafting a letter to inform parties that
all demonstrations are banned until after the polls. But he said
that authorities were unlikely to move against Sam Rainsy.
	   ``The municipality will not touch or obstruct him to avoid being
accused of abusing his rights or aggravating the situation,'' Mann
Chhoeun said. ``But we still hope he will cooperate with us in good
faith in order to avoid any eventual violence.''
	   The ban was discussed in a two-hour meeting between Hun Sen and
a U.N. envoy who is assessing whether the electoral climate was
free and fair enough for the United Nations to go on supporting the
polls.
	   Francese Vendrell, regional director of the United Nations'
political affairs department, described their talks as very frank
and open. He was to meet opposition leaders later.
	   Chum Bun Rong, an adviser to Hun Sen, said Hun Sen told Vendrell
that the ban was meant only to curb ``anarchic'' protests in
unapproved sites where security could not be arranged.
	   Prum Sokha, an Interior Ministry official, said it wasn't really
a ban but a ``temporary suspension'' of all demonstrations in the
capital before the official campaign period begins June 25.
	   ``Some politicians try to take advantage by campaigning ahead of
time through demonstrations,'' Prum Sokha said.
	   Vendrell is to report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
is to decide by early July whether to continue U.N. endorsement for
the election process.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk, the prince's father, meanwhile urged
Cambodians in a statement circulated Wednesday to overcome threats
and intimidation and vote.

Ukrainian newspaper loses second suit in two weeks 
</HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Just two weeks after losing a libel battle
against Ukraine's interior minister, an opposition-minded newspaper
was ordered to pay damages for an article criticizing the Kiev city
administration.
	   A district court in the Ukrainian capital ordered Kievskiye
Vedomosti to pay 2,000 hryvna (dlrs 1,000) for harming the honor,
dignity and professional reputation of city authorities in a
February 1997 article, the paper reported Wednesday.
	   Tuesday's court ruling also obliged journalist Tatyana Vorozhko,
who wrote the article, to pay 80 hryvna (dlrs 40) in damages, it
said. City authorities initially demanded compensation of 5 million
hryvna (dlrs 2.5 million), the daily noted.
	   Last year, Kievskiye Vedomosti lost 1 million hryvna (dlrs
500,000) in the original suit, brought by Kiev mayor Olexander
Omelchenko. But Ukraine's Supreme Court overturned that decision
and sent the case back to a district court.
	   Kievskiye Vedomosti editor in chief Yevhen Yakunov said that the
article in question alleged that speeches by Omelchenko and the
Georgian foreign minister during a Kiev event were virtually the
same, and that it contained descriptions of the event that did not
suit city authorities.
	   The newspaper will appeal the decision, part of Vedomosti's
numerous court battles with Omelchenko, the editor said in a
telephone interview.
	   ``Both this case and the 5 million hryvna to Kravchenko were a
political action ... a pretext for strangling the newspaper,''
Yakunov charged. ``It was one and the same court.''
	   Earlier this month, Kiev's Radyansky district court ordered the
paper to pay 5 million hryvna (dlrs 2.5 million) to Interior
Minister Yuri Kravchenko for falsely accusing him of corruption.
	   Representatives of the newspaper said they would appeal the
verdict, which they said was politically motivated.
	   Critics of President Leonid Kuchma and of presidential allies
frequently accuse the Ukrainian authorities of attempting to
silence opposition media in the former Soviet republic.

Hamas: Egypt refusing transit visa to Sheik Yassin 
</HEADLINE>
By SALAH NASRAWI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt is refusing a transit visa to Hamas
leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin until Israel announces officially that he
will be let into the Gaza Strip, a Hamas spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Yassin and two aides have been waiting more than two weeks in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, for visas to enter Egypt.
	   ``Our brothers in Egypt are only telling us to wait until
arrangements have been made,'' Jamal Issa, the Sudan representative
of Hamas, said in a telephone interview from Khartoum. ``But we do
not know for how long we should wait.''
	   An Israeli official said Monday that the government will allow
Yassin to return to the Gaza Strip. But Egypt appears to be waiting
for a formal statement.
	   Yassin can go to the Strip only through road border crossings in
Egypt.
	   Jordan, which borders the Palestinian-administered West Bank,
also has refused to allow Yassin in.
	   Egypt fears that if Yassin gets stuck at its border with Gaza,
he would be an embarrassment to the government, which has close
ties with Yasser Arafat and his Palestinian Authority. Hamas'
popularity in the Palestinian territories, especially in the Strip,
is seen as a growing threat to Arafat's authority.
	   Yassin came to Sudan on May 29 after a 14-week fund raising tour
of the Arab world and Iran. During his trip, he repeatedly issued
statements supporting the armed struggle against Israel.
	   Hamas opposes the Palestinian Authority and rejects Arafat's
peace agreements with Israel. It has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings since 1994 with the aim of wrecking the accords.
About 80 people were killed in its bombings in Israel in 1996-97.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last year in exchange for
the freedom of two Israeli spies captured in Jordan during a
bungled assassination attempt against another Hamas leader.

Sweden asks Romania to give back 1929 debt MIHAELA ARMASELU 
</HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In 1929, Sweden lent Romania dlrs 27
million. On Wednesday, the Romanian government set up a commission
to negotiate with Swedish authorities who claim they are now owed
dlrs 3.5 billion.
	   Romania, which is struggling to implement a market economy, does
not have that kind of spare change. So Sweden has devised an
alternative for recouping some of its cash.
	   They say they will reduce the cash debt to dlrs 800 million, and
also take a dlrs 1.2 billion stake in the national energy company,
a power station, an engine maker and a huge steel works on the
Danube port of Galati.
	   The Swedes have written off the remaining dlrs 1.5 billion, said
Valentin Lazea, a state secretary at Romania's finance ministry
quoting from documents given him by the Swedes.
	   ``The proposal seems very tempting, '' said Ionut Popescu, an
economic analyst from weekly Capital magazine. ``But Romania could
not afford to pay such a debt this way.''
	   Romania is in a bind: it does not want to damage relations with
Sweden, and its government is worried about straining already shaky
relations with international finance organizations.
	   ``The Swedish part could call us in front of the international
courts or make an unfavorable lobby to international financial
organizations,'' said Lazea, one of the negotiators for Romania.
	   In February, the International Monetary Fund suspended payment
of three tranches of a dlrs 430 million standby loan agreed last
year because of sluggish market reforms.
	   Back in 1929, when Romania was a market economy, it borrowed
treasury bonds worth dlrs 27 million from the Swedish Match
company, said finance ministry spokesman Razvan Popa.
	   In exchange, the Swedish company received a monopoly in all of
Romania's match industries. State industries were nationalized in
1947, after the communists took over.
	   When it signed the loan, Romania agreed to pay back the money
after 30 years. But the Communists did not keep their word.
	   After the fall of Communism in 1989, Sweden approached Romania
again and hired Asea Brown Boweri to negotiate the debt repayment
with Romanian authorities.
	   But negotiations proved difficult and broke off several times.
	   Earlier this year, auditing company Arthur Anderson said the
accrued debt had reached dlrs 3.5 billion, calculated with an
interest of 7 percent a year from 1929.
	   The Romanians disagree. They have no figure of their own but
want to negotiate.
	   ``Normally debts which are older than 50 years are subject to
discount,'' said Popescu. He calculates Romania should pay Sweden
``up to dlrs 40 million.''

World Cup: Croatian captain pulls muscle, out for Japan game 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Team captain Zvonimir Boban is expected to
miss Croatia's crucial game against Japan after pulling a leg
muscle in practice, coach Miroslav Blazevic said Wednesday.
	   The AC Milan star midfielder is a key force in Croatia's attack.
His injury is a blow to the team's hopes of clinching a
second-round berth with a victory against Japan on Saturday.
	   ``His participation in this historic match is highly doubtful,''
but he is expected to be fit again for the final group match
against Argentina, Blazevic told reporters in this eastern French
spa town where the team has its World Cup headquarters.
	   Boban, 29, strained a muscle in his left calf during practice
Tuesday and will be resting several days, Blazevic said.
	   He said he was considering options for reshaping the lineup but
did not want to go into details.
	   Boban is looking to add World Cup glory to his achievements at
the club level, which include the European Cup with Milan. Along
with playmaker Robert Prosinecki, he is one of the veterans of the
Yugoslav team that won the under-21 world championship in 1987.
	   Boban became a national hero in Croatia during the breakup of
Yugoslavia when he attacked a policeman during fan riots at a May
1990 game between his former club Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star
Belgrade.
	   He is often considered to be the team's shadow manager behind
Blazevic.

Libyan leader in interview denies claims he was wounded 
</HEADLINE>
By MARTIN BENDYK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi denied
in an interview with The Associated Press that he had been injured
in an assassination attempt this month, saying no such attack
occurred.
	   ``We hear of these things such as was reported this week. But
these are deliberate lies,'' Gadhafi told APTV.
	   A Libyan Islamic opposition group claimed it had killed four
bodyguards and wounded Gadhafi in an attack June 1 as the party
headed for Egypt on an official visit. The Libyan government had
denied the claim, but this was the first time Gadhafi had appeared
before a Western journalist to rebut it.
	   ``People say Gadhafi has been a target of numerous assassination
attempts. But up until now, I have never seen any assassination
attempt directed at me,'' he said.
	   Gadhafi spoke on camera in his quarters, a large, low-slung
white and gray tent, in the middle of a tightly guarded military
barracks in Tripoli.
	   He appeared relaxed and confident, and wore light brown military
fatigues with a large brown head-scarf holding back his trademark
mane of black hair.
	   His short-sleeved cloak was bare to the elbow. He frequently
waved his arms to illustrate a point, and there was no evident sign
of any injury.
	   Asked about reports of the attack, Gadhafi said: ``This is not
the first time that I have heard that someone has tried to
assassinate me. But it has never actually happened.''
	   In a wide-ranging interview, he also denied any involvement in
the Lockerbie bombing, asserted that sanctions were damaging other
countries as much as Libya itself, and rejected as ``ignorant''
claims that the Great Man-Made River Project had a military
purpose.
	   The United States and other Western countries imposed sanctions
against Libya in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to hand over the
suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner that killed 270 people
over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Gadhafi launched the river project in 1984. It is designed to
carry water from aquifers in the Sahara desert through 3,800
kilometers (2,400 miles) of pipes to the coastal cities.
	   Some Western officials have said the project had military
purposes, and neighboring countries like Egypt worry that their
underground water supply might decrease as a result of the Libyan
project.
	   Referring to the specific allegations that the pipeline was wide
enough for tanks and troops, he said: ``This is very funny. The
truth is that Western leaders are totally ignorant. This really is
very silly.
	   ``The first time I heard this allegation, I couldn't imagine why
they were saying it,'' Gadhafi said. ``Rather than a military
project, the great man-made river project will clean up the desert
and create green fields.''

Boat sent to aid search for escaped crocodiles 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Fisheries Department has
sent a boat to search for crocodiles missing from their pens in a
province east of the capital, one of its officials said Wednesday.
	   Villagers in Chachoengsao, 30 kilometers (18 miles) east of
Bangkok, complained to the department's provincial office last week
after seeing at least one of the reptiles in a river near their
homes.
	   A 3.5-meter- (11.5-foot)- long crocodile was later found and
shot dead by the villagers, who ate its meat, an official said.
	   Fishery officials are now cruising rivers in the area, looking
for others.
	   Almost every rainy season, which runs from June to September,
some crocodiles are reported to have escaped from pens that have
been filled by floodwaters. More than 100 reportedly escaped during
heavy flooding in 1996, from farms big and small.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply higher
Wednesday, reacting to a stronger yen and speculation that
Washington will step in to help prop it up. Stocks in Hong Kong,
Seoul, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta rallied on bargain
hunting and firmness in the yen and other local currencies. But
Indonesia's rupiah fell nearly 9 percent as local banks rushed to
buy the U.S. currency to pay off debts amid lingering political
uncertainty. After hovering at eight-year lows of about 145 yen to
the U.S. dollar in recent days, the yen rose Wednesday to as high
as 142.00 in late afternoon. In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average fell 5.00 points, or 0.03 percent, closing at
14,715.38. Hong Kong shares also staged a strong comeback on hopes
that Washington support for the yen would soften local interest
rates and pressures on the banking system. The blue-chip Hang Seng
Index closed 6.3 percent higher at 8,004.35. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's fragile currency plunged
more than 9 percent Wednesday, jeopardizing efforts by the
International Monetary Fund to haul the Southeast Asian nation's
shattered economy out of a yearlong crisis. The drop came as a big
blow to the government of President B.J. Habibie, which has pushed
an agenda of democratic reform since the ouster last month of the
authoritarian leader Suharto. A drastic weakening of the currency
could also worsen rising inflation and mass unemployment, problems
that helped spark riots and protests leading to Suharto's downfall
after 32 years in power. Some shopkeepers in Jakarta, the
Indonesian capital, shuttered their stores, fearing that the
rupiah's fall could spur more price increases and ensuing street
violence. (INDONESIA-CURRENCY)
	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ The hotel divisions of two of the
Asia-Pacific region's largest travel companies announced Wednesday
they will merge to create a new force in hotel management.
Australia's Harvey World Travel and Japan's HIS Travel said they
will create a new company, Aurum Hotels and Resorts, to operate and
manage the former's Escape Resorts and the latter's Watermark Hotel
Group. Aurum managing director Peter Nair, who was the regional
head of the Watermark Hotel Group, said the new company would
manage 600 rooms in Cairns and the Gold Coast in Queensland state
and the Blue Mountains in New South Wales state. He said the
company also plans large-scale development within the next 18
months to secure another 2,000 rooms in Australia, Asia and the
Pacific for the company. (AUSTRALIA-TRAVEL MERGER)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada plans
to sell three government-held television stations, four radio
stations and a newspaper chain in his first six months in office,
an official said Wednesday. The privatization binge is aimed at
raising funds for the government, which faces a budget deficit,
press secretary-designate Rod Reyes said. Ownership questions
regarding two of the TV stations, Intercontinental Broadcasting
Corp. and Radio Philippines Network, must be settled before the
government can proceed with the sale, Reyes said. The government
seized the stations from associates of the late dictator Ferdinand
Marcos after his 1986 ouster. Some previous owners have sought to
regain control of the stations. (PHILIPPINES-PRIVATIZED MEDIA)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's financial secretary said Wednesday
the government's earlier economic growth forecast for the next few
years is not attainable as the region's economic troubles show no
signs of abating. ``Because of the economic downturn, and because
of the performance, for instance, in the fast quarter of this year,
I believe it will be unlikely that we will be able to sustain
growth of 5 percent in real terms in the coming few years,'' Donald
Tsang told reporters. The economy shrank 2 percent in the first
quarter this year, the first contraction in 14 years. Officials
have hinted the economy may shrink further in the coming months.
Tsang had said earlier that the forecast annual economic growth of
3.5 percent is unlikely, and he would revise the forecast before
the fourth quarter. Hong Kong has weathered Asia's financial
turmoil better than most countries, but has been suffering from
high interest rates and slumping property and share prices. (HONG

World Cup: As Brazil grows, so do expectations 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ While 31 teams battle for the 15 remaining
berths in the second round of the World Cup, Brazil already is
looking ahead. And frankly, it makes little difference who gets in
their way.
	   ``The truth is I don't care who we play,'' said midfielder
Rivaldo. ``I think we've grown and can beat anyone.''
	   Cocky? Or simply realistic? After a 3-0 victory over Morocco on
Tuesday that was pure show time in the second half, the Brazilians
shed their opening-game jitters and felt the future unfold.
	   ``It was excellent,'' said coach Mario Zagallo. ``We played
joyful, sparkling and efficient soccer.''
	   No more excuses or pleas for patience. Brazil's solid play
against Morocco raised the already high expectations for a team in
quest of a record fifth World Cup.
	   Not surprisingly, the game highlights began with Ronaldo.
	   The two-time FIFA Player of the Year got his first goal with a
bullet into the lower left corner in the ninth minute. He also
assisted on the third goal by Bebeto and tormented the Moroccan
defense all night with an assortment of dribbles, passes and
near-misses.
	   Not that he played badly in Brazil's 2-1 win over Scotland, but
strikers live by goals. And against Morocco, Ronaldo was
unstoppable _ despite vicious fouls that tore his shorts and left
an ugly cleat mark on his thigh.
	   ``He was simply phenomenal,'' said Zagallo. ``That was the
player we all wanted to see.''
	   Meanwhile, Bebeto snapped his own scoring drought and helped set
up the second goal, by Rivaldo.
	   But every sector looked good against Morocco. The midfield,
uninspired against Scotland, gained new life with Leonardo in place
of Giovanni and a more self-assured Rivaldo in the role of
playmaker.
	   The much-maligned defense, which trained hard to plug the holes
evident in the first game, jelled against the agile Moroccan
attack. Despite some deft footwork, the Atlas Lions never seriously
threatened. Goalie Taffarel didn't make a save all night.
	   ``We studied their films and defensed them well,'' said
Taffarel. ``This team just keeps getting better.''
	   Zagallo said Brazil's domination shouldn't overshadow the
qualities of its opponent.
	   ``We didn't draw just any adversary,'' he said. ``Morocco is a
good team that knows how to play soccer. It might not qualify, but
it has every chance to take second in the group.''
	   True, Brazil had an uncommonly free rein against the Lions, for
whom the concept of defense seemingly hasn't taken root. Rivaldo is
unlikely to get the same unencumbered freedom to create against
other teams.
	   But the mood is distinctly upbeat. As Brazil contemplates a
possible second-round encounter with perennial contender Italy or
South American rival Chile, neither prospect causes apprehension.
	   ``They are two strong teams, but it doesn't matter to us,'' said
Ronaldo. ``In soccer, the pleasure comes from knowing that you beat
the best.''

Duma defends Serbs, assails NATO 
</HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers on Wednesday hailed the outcome
of President Boris Yeltsin's talks with Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic and assailed the West for its threat to use force against
the Serbs.
	   Ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky went even further,
asking the government to permit Russian pilots to defend Serbia in
case of NATO air strikes.
	   Communists and nationalists dominating the parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, often accuse Yeltsin of kowtowing to the
West and betraying Moscow's traditional allies. However, the Duma
said on Wednesday that it ``fully backs the efforts of Russian
diplomacy'' to solve the Kosovo crisis.
	   Lawmakers vented their anger at the West, accusing it of a
``biased policy that puts all the blame on Yugoslavia.''
	   ``Attempts to speak the language of sanctions and threats of
military force against Belgrade mean instigating separatism,'' the
Duma said.
	   In a statement, passed by a vote of 332 to three, the house also
warned that NATO's use of force might trigger a ``large-scale war''
in the Balkans, Russian news reports said.
	   Russian leaders on Tuesday extracted a promise from Milosevic to
resume negotiations with the moderate leader of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians, but it has remained unclear whether talks between the
Yugoslav president and Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova could quell
the volatile conflict.
	   Milosevic insisted Tuesday that he wouldn't talk to the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is leading the uprising. Moreover,
there were doubts that Rugova would agree to meet again with
Milosevic, whom he accuses of reneging on earlier commitments.
	   Since March, more than 300 people have been killed in the
Serbian-led army and police crackdown on Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 strive for an independent
state.
	   U.S. officials said Milosevic's promise to resume negotiations
with Albanian leaders was a step in the right direction but added
that he had failed to meet the key demand: to withdraw brutal
security forces from border areas without any preconditions. They
said military options remain on the table.
	   Russia has strongly opposed the use of force against the Serbs,
their traditional allies and Orthodox Slav brethren, but has agreed
with NATO that Milosevic's violent campaigns had to be stopped.
	   Zhirinovsky called on the Kremlin to show more ``toughness'' in
defending Belgrade.
	   If NATO planes bomb Yugoslavia, the Russian government should
allow ``volunteer pilots'' to go defend ``Serb brothers,''
Zhirinovsky told a news conference, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   ``Hundreds of pilots have remained jobless'' after military
cuts, he said.

EU postpones decision on subsidies to wine producers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union postponed a decision
Wednesday on whether to increase subsidies to wine growers, part of
a drive to make the sector more competitive.
	   The EU executive Commission said a decision on whether or not to
increase wine subsidies to dlrs 1.5 billion in 2003 from dlrs 935
million in 1998 - a 60 percent increase - should be taken in two
weeks.
	   ``The decision was put off for technical reasons,'' EU
agriculture spokesman Gerard Kiely told a news conference in
Strasbourg, where the Commission met this week.
	   ``No one is disputing the substance of the proposal, but many EU
Commissioners were missing and some of those present needed
clarification on budgetary aspects,'' he said.
	   Once the 20-member Commission has approved the measure, it still
has to be approved by EU countries to take effect.
	   The proposal to increase direct aid to wine producers is part of
a package of EU measures to reduce market support in the sector and
improve quality in the 15-nation bloc, which accounts for 60
percent of the world's production.
	   Under the proposal, the EU will no longer step in to buy wine
from producers at fixed rates, when producers find they cannot sell
their product at better rates elsewhere.
	   The proposal also includes reconversion measures, such as
changing grape variety, relocating vineyards and renewing
production techniques

Moscow city government to help rebuild bombed synagogue 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow's city government has set aside 350,000
rubles (about dlrs 60,000) to help rebuild a synagogue heavily
damaged in a bomb attack last month.
	   The money will be taken from the city reserves, officials were
quoted as telling the Interfax news agency Wednesday.
	   The attack on the Maryina Roshcha synagogue occurred May 13,
just minutes after 70 children and their teachers had left a
holiday celebration.
	   The blast shattered windows and caused a wall to partially
collapse. Two construction workers building a Jewish community
center next door were injured by glass.
	   It was the third attack since 1993 on the Orthodox synagogue, a
newly rebuilt center run by Lubavitch Jews.

Israelis arrested in killing of Palestinian farmer announcing campaign to resist West Bank troop withdrawal; changes byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with details from court hearing, settlers
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A 16-year-old Jewish settler who clubbed a
Palestinian farmer to death with a chunk of wood he held out from a
passing van was playing a prank and never intended to kill the man,
his lawyer said Wednesday.
	   A Jerusalem magistrate ordered the suspect and another
16-year-old held for six days, but released the van's driver, an
adult, even though he did not stop after the attack on 45-year-old
Abdel Majid Turki on Tuesday afternoon.
	   The two juveniles, who live in a halfway house for troubled
youths in the Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai in the West Bank,
covered their heads with prayer shawls as they walked into court.
	   Their lawyer, Naftali Werzberger, said one of the youths has
psychological problems. Werzberger said the two were on their way
back from their studies in another settlement when the incident
occurred on a road leading to Beit Hagai, south of Hebron.
	   ``During the van ride, one took out a chunk of wood and hit a
man on the side of the road,'' Werzberger told reporters after the
closed-door hearing. ``He (the suspect) said he never dreamed
something serious would happen because of this.''
	   At Turki's home in Hebron, family members gathered outside.
Turki's 11-year-old daughter, Noor, cried uncontrollably, her face
red. ``My destiny is to get revenge for my father,'' she said.
Turki was to be buried once an autopsy has been performed.
	   The Hebron area is one of the tensest in the West Bank, and
there was concern that the killing would spark new violence.
	   A number of Palestinians and Jewish settlers have been killed in
political violence in the Hebron area in recent years. The
bloodiest incident was the 1994 Hebron mosque massacre in which a
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshippers.
	   Werzberger said Turki was not targeted because he was a
Palestinian, and that the two juveniles have expressed remorse.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the killing ``horrible
and unacceptable.''
	   In other developments Wednesday, the Jewish Settlers' Council
said it would launch a civil disobedience campaign should Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agree to a U.S. proposal for an Israeli
troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Israeli daily Maariv said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has given Netanyahu until June 24 to make a decision on
the U.S. plan that has already been accepted by the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's office confirmed that Albright and Netanyahu spoke
on the phone earlier this week, but denied an ultimatum was set.
	   Settler spokesman Aharon Domb that the settlement movement would
try to topple Netanyahu, its erstwhile champion, should the Israeli
leader agree to a troop pullback. Settler leaders planned to hold
protest vigils in tents outside the prime minister's office and
organize mass demonstrations.
	   ``We cannot stand by and see the land being voluntarily given
away, and we will do all within our power to thwart any action by
Netanyahu,'' said Domb.
	   In another sign of the increasing tension between the settlers
and the government, police on Wednesday raided the settlers' pirate
radio station, Channel 7, which had been tolerated by successive
governments afraid to take on right-wing activists.
	   The station denounced the raid, calling it an attempt by
Netanyahu to ``shut down and shut up legitimate public protest.''
	   A poll taken by Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot indicated that
two-thirds of Israelis support a 13 percent troop pullback.
	   The poll, based on responses of 505 Jewish Israelis, found that
59 percent favor the U.S. plan, while 36 percent oppose it.
	   The poll's margin of error was 4.5 percent.

Rights group: 5 students injured in Khartoum University clashes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Islamic fundamentalist students wielding
sticks and knives have attacked students at Khartoum University,
leaving five badly injured, a human rights group said in a
statement Wednesday.
	   The fighting at the university, Sudan's biggest, took place
Sunday after pro-government students tore down posters put up by
pro-opposition factions, the London-based Sudan Human Rights
Organization said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in
Cairo.
	   The statement said five students were admitted to hospital, but
the police then detained them for questioning. Three more students
were arrested later.
	   It is not known if the eight students are still in detention.
	   The statement gave no details of the injuries suffered.
	   Government officials in Sudan could not be reached immediately
for comment.
	   Skirmishes are common between pro-opposition students and those
who support the Islamic fundamentalist government of President Omar
el-Bashir. El-Bashir banned opposition parties after he came to
power in a military coup in 1989.
	   The statement said the university authorities recognized only
the Islamic fundamentalist group as a legitimate student body and
ignored complaints from opposition students.
	   Students at Khartoum University have repeatedly complained that
pro-government students rig the campus elections.

Polish premier vows tough measures for striking train engineers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek declared a
strike that idled at least 30 percent of Poland's trains illegal
Wednesday and said tough measures would be taken against the
striking engineers.
	   The train drivers, who are seeking pay increases and early
retirement plans, failed to take all negotiating steps legally
required before being permitted to strike, Buzek said.
	   Buzek pledged ``tough consequences'' for strikers, who went off
the job at midnight. He did not elaborate, but railroad officials
said Tuesday that strikers could be fired.
	   Buzek said the government was ready for pay talks with the union
that called the strike, and urged them to go back to work in time
for school holidays starting Saturday.
	   ``This is not a good way of solving problems,'' Buzek said.
	   The government said 30 percent of the country's trains were out
of service and that 850 engineers were on strike. Union leader Jan
Zaborowski claimed the strike had idled 50 percent of the trains.
	   Non-striking engineers and buses were mobilized to minimize
disruption. Railway officials estimated the action will cost them
21 million zlotys (dlrs 6.1 million) daily.
	   Engineers belonging to the right-wing Solidarity union refused
to join the leftist union that called the strike, the Trade Union
of Train Engineers. Solidarity engineers maintained the strike was
not over money but was intended to sow political trouble.
	   Zaborowski said the union went forward with its strike because
government spokesman Jaroslaw Sellin refused to apologize for
saying the strike plans were politically motivated.
	   The engineers say they want their monthly pay of about 1,000
zlotys (dlrs 300) to be increased by 300 zlotys (dlrs 88).
	   They also want to be eligible for retirement at 55 if they have
worked for at least 20 years, and want the age limit dropped even
lower if they've worked at least 30 years. The current retirement
age is 65 for men and 60 for women.
	   In addition, the engineers want the government to spend more
money annually on the railroad, which is strapped for cash but
needs to lower prices to compete with cheaper road travel.
	   The Polish rail carries 1.1 million passengers and some 600,000
tons of goods daily.

Australian company directors pessimistic about region, survey finds 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Economic conditions in Australia are
expected to deteriorate over the next six months, according to a
national survey of company directors released Wednesday.
	   The regular Australian Institute of Company Directors and KPMG
Boardroom Report said that for the third consecutive quarter, more
company directors anticipated a downturn in the Australian economy.
	   ``While 40 percent of directors across all industry sectors
reflected this sentiment _ the highest proportion since 1996 _
directors from the mining-agricultural sector remain the most
pessimistic, although less so than in the previous quarter,'' said
the institute's chief executive officer, Ian Dunlop.
	   ``Directors from the construction-utility sector were more
positive, with only 18 percent reporting anticipated
deterioration.''
	   The next survey was expected to show even more pessimism because
the current survey period _ May 6-22 _ came before the latest round
of market volatility.
	   ``It doesn't fully reflect some of the dramatic changes that
have occurred over the recent days,'' Dunlop told reporters.
	   The survey report also said that 50 percent of directors
believed that economies would slow worldwide over the next six
months.
	   Companies looking for new business acquisitions in both
Australia and Southeast Asia also dropped, the report said.
	   Only 25 percent of companies, down from 34 percent in the
previous survey, intended to acquire new businesses in Australia,
while 37 percent, down from 46 percent, intended to acquire
Southeast Asian businesses, the report said.
	   For the report, 563 company directors were surveyed.

Australia urged to seek open skies agreements 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: EMBARGOED BY SOURCE UNTIL 1500 GMT, JUNE 17
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A government agency recommended
Thursday that Australia ditch complicated controls on international
air services and negotiate ``open skies'' agreements with other
countries.
	   The Productivity Commission, which advises the government on
free trade policies, said agreements of this kind would remove
controls on entry routes, airline capacity and flight frequency.
	   It said the world's international air services are currently
highly regulated by a complex web of about 3,000 bilateral
agreements, to which Australia is a party to 51.
	   ``This system regulates where airlines fly, the number and
frequency of flights they may operate and sometimes even what
aircraft they might use,'' the commission said in a report.
	   It said restrictions of this kind have hindered the development
of international air links and inbound tourism to regional
Australia.
	   The report is preliminary and the government has not set a
deadline to respond to the recommendation.

U.S., others call on Abkhazia to allow refugee return 
</HEADLINE>
By MISHA DZHINDZHIKHASHVILI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The United States and several other
nations warned the leaders of breakaway Abkhazia on Wednesday that
their continued refusal to allow the return of tens of thousands of
ethnic Georgian refugees would amount to ethnic cleansing.
	   Ambassadors from the United States, France, Germany and Russia
announced their threat to lodge a formal protest against Abkhazia
to Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze during a meeting
Wednesday, Shevardnadze's spokesman Vakhtang Abashidze said.
Shevardnadze, who has been urging the return of refugees, is
certain to welcome the move.
	   Some 38,000 ethnic Georgian refugees fled Abkhazia during
fighting last month between Abkhazian separatists and militia
groups that support Georgia's central government.
	   Georgia has been pushing for the refugees' immediate,
unconditional return. Abkhazia has stalled, saying it needed time
to build housing for returning refugees, many of whose homes were
burned during the fighting, and stressing that it intended to
screen the returning refugees to ensure that they did not include
pro-Georgian militants.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken about sporadically since then, despite the
presence of Russian peacekeepers in the region. Dozens of people
were killed in the fighting last month.
	   On Wednesday, Abkhazian security chief Astamur Tarba said
pro-Georgian militants continued to be active in the breakaway
region. He accused the guerrillas of an automatic rifle and grenade
attack on a Russian peacekeepers' helicopter last week, and of
planting several mines in Abkhazia in recent days.
	   Abashidze, the Georgian presidential spokesman, also said that
the ambassadors had called for solving the conflict through
political means, and praised Shevardnadze for not sending army
troops to Abkhazia during the latest clash.
	   Later Wednesday, the ambassadors left for Abkhazian capital
Sukhumi to meet with Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba.
	   Shevardnadze and Ardzinba have been planning to hold direct
talks, but a recent round of negotiations between the two
presidents' envoys failed to make any progress.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Lightning sparked a fire at ammunition depots in
the Ural Mountains on Wednesday, prompting the evacuation of 2,500
residents of the area, a news agency said.
	   The blaze has also engulfed 180 hectares (444.6 acres) of forest
around the depots near the town of Beryozovsky in the Ural
Mountains region of Yekaterinburg, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry was sending a plane to
help extinguish the fire.

Pope hopes Austrian visit will help church unity 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II said Wednesday he hopes
his trip to Austria this week will bring unity to a church shaken
by scandal and split by calls for reform.
	   The pope begins the three-day visit Friday, with stops in
Salzburg, Vienna and St. Poelten.
	   Speaking of his trip during his weekly general audience, John
Paul said ``recent years have been times of great trial'' for the
Roman Catholic church in Austria.
	   ``The pope and the bishop want to help the faithful to overcome
these difficulties,'' John Paul said.
	   Although he mentioned no specifics, it was clear he was
referring to the turmoil among Catholics in predominantly Roman
Catholic Austria.
	   An Austrian cardinal, accused of sexually molesting young boys,
was forced by the pope in April to relinquish all his duties. Hans
Hermann Groer, the former archbishop of Vienna, has gone into exile
in Germany.
	   Austrian church leaders had been anxious to resolve the Groer
case before the pope's visit to avoid potentially embarrassing
demonstrations while John Paul was in the country.
	   The church has also been rocked by demands that the Vatican
change church policy and drop the celibacy requirement for priests
and allow women to enter the priesthood.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Austrians have signed petitions calling
for such change.

Ukraine's shadow economy estimated at 60 percent of the economy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's shadow economy has reached up to
60 percent of the country's GDP, the Ukrainian tax chief said in an
interview published Wednesday.
	   Mykola Azarov, head of the State Tax Service, estimated the size
of the shadow economy between dlrs 13 and 15 billion, with the vast
majority of the commerce conducted in dollars. Of the total, only
dlrs 3 billion is in the local currency, the hryvna.
	   ``The withdrawal of money from legal economy into the shadow
economy is continuing,'' Azarov told the daily Fakty.
	   The existence of the shadow economy has hampered tax collection
and deepened the federal budget deficit. Foreign lenders have said
they are reluctant to provide aid unless Ukraine makes progress in
boosting revenues and reducing the deficit.
	   Premier Valery Pustovoitenko met with leaders of Ukraine's
debtor industries Wednesday and fired the head of the
government-run Titan company for failing to pay 9.3 million hryvna
(dlrs 4.65 million) in taxes and pensions to the state.
	   He also ordered the Cabinet to consider ousting the director of
the Ukroil company for similar offenses, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Azarov suggested his own measures, including a tax amnesty.
Under his proposal, income declared by Jan. 1, 1999 would be
considered tax-free, with the authorities making no inquiries
regarding the source of that income.
	   ``In the crisis-type financial situation, I consider this to be
a means of attracting capital to Ukraine,'' the tax chief said.

Eds: UPDATES with Lukashenko agreeing to a compromise allowing

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The diplomatic compound at the center of a
dispute between Belarusian authorities and a number of countries,
including the United States, France, Germany and Russia, was
decorated with a new sign on Wednesday.
	   ``The residence of the President of the Republic of Belarus,''
the sign said, in Russian and Belarusian.
	   But in a more hopeful sign for diplomats who live in the
compound, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko agreed to a
compromise Wednesday and signed a decree allowing the envoys to
continue living in the compound, the British Embassy said.
	   No details of the arrangement were immediately available.
	   Diplomats and their families living in the compound have been
resisting the government's efforts to evict them from their homes
in Drozdy, a pleasant pine woods on the outskirts of capital Minsk.
	   This spring, the Belarusian authorities decided that the sewage
and plumbing system that serves the 1940s-era compound is badly
antiquated and requires urgent repairs. They told the diplomats to
move out.
	   Ambassadors protested, saying that under the Vienna Convention,
diplomatic residences are considered the sovereign territory of the
diplomats' country.
	   Lukashenko, who has a residence down the road from the Drozdy
residences, responded that the diplomatic compound belongs to him.
	   On Wednesday, he had a new metal plaque to support the claim.
	   Ann Speckhard, the wife of U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard, who
went outside the compound to walk her dog, told reporters on
Wednesday that her family intended to stay. All sewage and plumbing
systems and telephone lines at the compound were working fine, and
her family was feeling ``OK,'' Mrs. Speckhard said.
	   The compromise between Lukashenko and the diplomats was
apparently reached at a briefing for the ambassadors at the Foreign
Ministry.
	   ``Nobody is evicting anyone, not today or tomorrow,'' said Col.
Mikhail Tesovets, the head of Lukashenko's personal guard service.
	   Ambassadors from Bulgaria and some former Soviet republics have
left the compound, but the U.S. ambassador and others want to stay
during the repairs.

EDS: UPDATES with inspections completed
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A rail operator removed its 31 high-speed,
electric trains from service for safety checks Wednesday after a
train carriage derailed outside London.
	   No one was seriously injured in the derailment Tuesday evening,
but one person required treatment for shock, British Transport
Police said. Great North Eastern Railways blamed the derailment on
a cracked wheel.
	   The inspections were completed by midday Wednesday and the
trains were gradually returning to service.
	   The railway said passengers on its main line from London to
northeast England and Scotland would experience long delays until
the fleet was fully redeployed. The line regularly carries about
30,000 passengers a day.

Malaysian PM: No one likely to challenge him for top post grafs 7-10 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Mahathir remarks on corruption, nepotism issues,
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad is unfazed by talk of a looming challenge from his deputy,
Anwar Ibrahim, according to news reports.
	   In an interview with the Far Eastern Economic Review, due to be
published Thursday, on the eve of the annual meeting of Malaysia's
dominant party, Mahathir said he doesn't think he'll be challenged
by Anwar _ or anyone for that matter.
	   Mahathir, who has led the Southeast Asian country for 17 years,
ruled out a no-contest motion at the United Malays National
Organization that would safeguard his and Anwar's top party posts
in polls at next year's general assembly.
	   There has been talk that a no-contest resolution might be passed
at this week's meeting to assure their positions until general
elections scheduled in 2000. That would, in effect, assure
Mahathir's position as prime minister once again, unless he chose
next year not to stand as UMNO president.
	   ``I don't want them to pass such a resolution because it means
I'm trying to perpetuate myself,'' said Mahathir. ``If anyone wants
to challenge me, he can ... but I don't think anyone will ... much
to the disappointment of a lot of people.''
	   Far from being embattled, the 72-year-old Mahathir told the
Review he's ready to take on all comers.
	   Asked if delegates can discuss sensitive issues such as
corruption and nepotism, Mahathir said that wasn't a problem. But
delegates should be aware that what they say could weaken or even
split the party, he warned.
	   Mahathir also said he explained to delegates that there is no
nepotism in the redistribution of wealth in the country, and that
this redistribution has to be equitable.
	   ``We cannot make everybody rich,'' he said, rejecting the idea
that any favoritism was being shown.
	   Some delegates have expressed unhappiness that only a few in the
majority ethnic Malay population that UMNO represents have become
wealthy tycoons, arguing that only businessmen close to Mahathir
have benefited from Malaysia's economic affirmative action program.
	   Meanwhile, the absence of a no-contest motion means Anwar, his
deputy in both party and government, could also be challenged,
particularly by former Finance Minister Razaleigh Hamzah.
	   Mahathir doesn't think that will happen, but he seemed to
distance himself from Anwar by saying he wouldn't take sides if it
occurred.
	   ``To give views like that would mean I'm siding with one or the
other,'' he said. The combative premier promised to turn up the
heat against Anwar allies who have obliquely accused him of
``corruption, cronyism and nepotism.''
	   Mahathir said: ``I'm going to publish a list of people who have
been given (privatization) awards and don't be surprised if the
people who got those things are the very same people who talk about
cronyism.''

Consultant, two others arrested in ticket scam case 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with details.
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities have arrested three people,
including a consultant for the World Cup's marketing agency, in a
probe of a ticket fraud that froze out thousands of Japanese soccer
fans, police officials said Wednesday.
	   More arrests could follow, the officials said on customary
anonymity.
	   Police arrested Gilles Favard, 46, the consultant for ISL
France, at his home Monday in the upscale western Paris suburb of
Rueil-Malmaison, where they found a large amount of cash and about
100 World Cup tickets, the sources said.
	   The arrests came after more than 12,000 Japanese fans were left
ticketless for the World Cup, among a number of cases that have
plagued the five-week championship that began last week.
	   Two other people were detained, police said, including Favard's
sister, Stella, believed not to have known of the fraud, and a
friend believed to have helped the consultant sell tickets by fax.
	   ISL France officials were not immediately available for comment.
But a spokesman for the parent company, Swiss-based ISL Worldwide,
said the consultant worked for an ISL France trade magazine.
	   Favard used ISL letterhead to con ticket agencies or buyers into
paying him for tickets, said Philippe Margraff, ISL Worldwide
senior vice president.

Ukrainian president orders a halt to military draft 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma signed a
decree ordering a temporary halt to the military draft, the
presidential press service said Wednesday.
	   The move was linked to organizational issues and the planned
reduction of military personnel, it said. The press service did not
say how long the draft would be suspended.
	   Ukraine's military, presently comprising 350,000 people, is to
be slashed by 17,000 servicemen in 1998, according to Defense
Ministry figures cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   The planned cuts would affect those servicemen who have reached
pension age or have served the maximum period possible, the report
said.

to erect a monument to the signatories of the 1979 peace agreement
between Israel and Egypt _ Carter, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat.

Rights group: 5 students injured in Khartoum University clashes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Islamic fundamentalist students wielding
sticks and knives have attacked students at Khartoum University,
leaving five badly injured, a human rights group said in a
statement Wednesday.
	   The fighting at Sudan's biggest university broke out after
pro-government students tore down posters put up by pro-opposition
factions, the London-based Sudan Human Rights Organization said in
a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   The statement said five students were admitted to hospital, but
the police then detained them for questioning. Three more students
were arrested later in Sunday's incident.
	   It was unknown if the eight students were still in detention.
	   Government officials in Sudan could not be reached immediately
for comment.
	   Skirmishes are common between pro-opposition students and those
who support the Islamic fundamentalist government of President Omar
el-Bashir. El-Bashir banned opposition parties after he came to
power in a military coup in 1989.
	   The statement said the university authorities recognized only
the Islamic fundamentalist group as a legitimate student body and
ignored complaints from opposition students.
	   Students at Khartoum University have repeatedly complained that
pro-government students rig the campus elections.

Cyprus protests visit of Turkish warships to occupied north 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus protested Wednesday the arrival of
five Turkish warships in the Turkish-occupied north, a day after
Turkey denounced the visit of Greek warplanes to the southern part
of the island.
	   ``The Turkish protests are monstrous, to say the least, at a
time when Turkish warships are visiting the occupied north,''
government spokesman Christos Stylianides told reporters.
	   Four Turkish warships _ two submarines, a destroyer and a
frigate _ docked in the eastern port of Famagusta early Wednesday
and another warship arrived at the northern port of Kyrenia, about
60 kilometers (38 miles) to the northwest.
	   The arrival of the warships, part of an announced Turkish naval
exercise, came a day after four Greek F-16 warplanes and two C-130
transport planes landed at an air base near Paphos in the southern
half of Cyprus, where the Greek-Cypriot government rules.
	   Two of the F-16s and one of the C-130s returned to Greece the
same day and the rest left Wednesday, said a Cypriot announcement.
	   Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou said the arrival of
the planes is within the framework of a five-year joint defense
agreement between Cyprus and Greece.
	   ``This gives a specific political message that the defense dogma
(agreement) with Greece will exist and develop as long as Turkish
expansionism exists,'' Omirou added.
	   A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement on Tuesday branded the
planes' arrival as ``an extremely grave and provocative development
directed at affecting trust on the island and in the region.''
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in 1974 in the wake of a coup by
supporters of union with Greece.
	   The tense relations between Greece and Turkey heightened last
year after Turkey warned it would take action to prevent the
deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles at the Paphos
air base.
	   Greece countered saying it would come to the aid of Cyprus if it
is attacked by Turkey, raising the specter of hostilities between
two countries which are members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.

Eds: UPDATES with over 100 still jailed in Marseille, 30 during
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities pursued a crackdown on World Cup
violence by further tightening security Wednesday and dealing out
more jail sentences, convicting two Germans and three more English
fans.
	   Among the 10 French cities hosting the World Cup, Marseille,
Toulouse and Lens announced new restrictions, especially for
high-risk matches with England.
	   More than 100 people remained jailed in Marseille after three
nights of violence involving English fans in Marseille, and
officials said about 30 of them would be kept behind bars until the
World Cup ends July 12, France Info radio reported.
	   Judges ordered two- and four-month jail terms for the three
English fans, after three others were convicted Monday. The two
Germans received three-month sentences, France Info radio reported.
	   Six more Germans were to be judged Wednesday, the radio said.
	   The crackdown followed violence around Monday's match in
Marseille between England and Tunisia. More than 50 people were
injured and 80 arrested in clashes that damaged the Old Port
district.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement signed an order
Tuesday to immediately expel five English fans and a Tunisian. He
threatened more expulsions if soccer violence recurs.
	   In addition to the expulsions, five English and three French
suspects in Marseille faced trial July 17.
	   Authorities took other measures to prevent hooliganism at other
matches in the 10 French cities hosting the Cup.
	   On Wednesday the Marseille area police prefect, Jean-Paul
Proust, announced that retail alcohol sales would be banned from
Friday afternoon until midnight Sunday ahead of the
Netherlands-South Korea match in town Saturday night.
	   Bars hosting the weekend's annual nationwide Festival of Music
will have to close their doors at 11 p.m. each night, he said.
	   The southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for England's next
match, with Romania on Monday. About 1,000 English fans were
already reported in France's fourth-largest city, prompting
officials to postpone a weekend music festival until July 11.
	   Officials also considered closing bars early and forgoing large
TV screens like the one on a Marseille beach where ticketless
English fans and local youths fought Monday afternoon.
	   The new head of FIFA, the international soccer federation, said
Wednesday he was ``saddened'' by the violence. But Sepp Blatter
said he hoped it would not take on ``too much importance.''
	   ``It's impossible to make a kind of ghetto out of each city
before each soccer match,'' Blatter told reporters, but added he
was satisfied French authorities have taken appropriate measures to
ensure security.
	   ``I'm convinced that from today, we won't have that hooligan
problem anymore,'' he said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities pursued a crackdown on World Cup
violence by further tightening security Wednesday and dealing out
more jail sentences, convicting two Germans and three more English
fans.
	   Among the 10 French cities hosting the World Cup, Marseille,
Toulouse and Lens announced new restrictions, especially for
high-risk matches with England.
	   More than 100 people remained jailed in Marseille after three
nights of violence involving English fans in Marseille, and
officials said about 30 of them would be kept behind bars until the
World Cup ends July 12, France Info radio reported.
	   Judges ordered two- and four-month jail terms for the three
English fans, after three others were convicted Monday. The two
Germans received three-month sentences, France Info radio reported.
	   Six more Germans were to be judged Wednesday, the radio said.
	   The crackdown followed violence around Monday's match in
Marseille between England and Tunisia. More than 50 people were
injured and 80 arrested in clashes that damaged the Old Port
district.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement signed an order
Tuesday to immediately expel five English fans and a Tunisian. He
threatened more expulsions if soccer violence recurs.
	   In addition to the expulsions, five English and three French
suspects in Marseille faced trial July 17.
	   Authorities took other measures to prevent hooliganism at other
matches in the 10 French cities hosting the Cup.
	   On Wednesday the Marseille area police prefect, Jean-Paul
Proust, announced that retail alcohol sales would be banned from
Friday afternoon until midnight Sunday ahead of the
Netherlands-South Korea match in town Saturday night.
	   Bars hosting the weekend's annual nationwide Festival of Music
will have to close their doors at 11 p.m. each night, he said.
	   The southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for England's next
match, with Romania on Monday. About 1,000 English fans were
already reported in France's fourth-largest city, prompting
officials to postpone a weekend music festival until July 11.
	   Officials also considered closing bars early and forgoing large
TV screens like the one on a Marseille beach where ticketless
English fans and local youths fought Monday afternoon.
	   The new head of FIFA, the international soccer federation, said
Wednesday he was ``saddened'' by the violence. But Sepp Blatter
said he hoped it would not take on ``too much importance.''
	   ``It's impossible to make a kind of ghetto out of each city
before each soccer match,'' Blatter told reporters, but added he
was satisfied French authorities have taken appropriate measures to
ensure security.
	   ``I'm convinced that from today, we won't have that hooligan
problem anymore,'' he said.

Amnesty report criticizes Israel and Palestinians on human rights 
</HEADLINE>
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A 14-year-old deaf boy, shot by Israeli
soldiers as he walked near a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip,
was one of at least 18 Palestinians killed by Israeli troops last
year, Amnesty International said Wednesday.
	   ``Most of those killed appeared to have posed no danger,'' the
London-based human rights watchdog said in its annual report, and
soldiers who carried out unlawful shootings ``were allowed virtual
impunity.''
	   The report also accused Israel of arresting and detaining
hundreds of Palestinian and Lebanese suspects without trial,
torturing detainees, and demolishing and sealing houses as
punishment.
	   The report also addressed areas under control of the Palestinian
Authority, which it said arrested and detained hundreds of
political opponents without charge or trial and tortured prisoners.
Seven detainees died in custody, including at least two believed
tortured to death.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has failed to approve a basic
law, or bill of rights, the report noted, and at least 11 competing
security forces operate without clearly defined responsibilities.
	   Elizabeth Hodgkin, a researcher with Amnesty's Middle East
department in London, said the human rights situation in
Palestinian-controlled areas had improved in 1997 as a result of
pressure from Palestinian legislators, human rights groups, and
ordinary Palestinians.
	   However, she noted that violations such as torture are
continuing and warned that ``The situation is still very fragile
... It can easily deteriorate.''
	   In Israel, Hodgkin said Amnesty was particularly concerned by
the widespread acceptance of human rights violations, including the
systematic torture of detainees.
	   She pointed to a Supreme Court ruling authorizing the use of
physical force during interrogations, and another allowing Israel
to hold Lebanese prisoners without trial for use as bargaining
chips in hostage negotiations, as well as a proposed bill that
would make it difficult for Palestinians injured during the
1987-1993 Palestinian uprising to get compensation.
	   ``There is a continual process of legalization and acceptance of
procedures that shouldn't be legalized,'' Hodgkin said.
	   Israel government spokesman Moshe Fogel said Amnesty failed to
take into account the constant security threat faced by Israel from
the ``belligerent'' Palestinian population it administers.
	   ``It is unfair not to put these circumstances in their proper
context, and that is one of a battlefield,'' he said. ``It's the
height of hypocrisy.''
	   ``Human and civil rights have been and will continue to be
respected in spite of the combat situation which has been imposed
upon Israel.''
	   Hanan Ashrawi, minister of higher education in Arafat's Cabinet
and former head of a Palestinian human rights commission, said the
Palestinians took the Amnesty report ``very seriously.''
	   ``We will look at them, investigate them, acknowledge them if
they exist, and punish those who are responsible,'' she said.

NATO members and partners gather for annual Black Sea exercises 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CONSTANTA, Romania (AP) _ Five NATO members joined four
post-Communist countries on Wednesday and began twelve days of
naval exercises designed to enhance coordination in sea defense.
	   Some 3,800 sailors gathered on 42 ships from the United States,
France, Greece, Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Georgia, Ukraine, and
Romania at Constanta, 222 kilometers (139 miles) east of Bucharest.
	   Some goals of the exercises were ``to stage a sea embargo, to
search and rescue survivors, to defend against water mines and to
evacuate civilians,'' said Commander Victor Blidea, a Romanian
officer directing the operation.
	   ``The main reason for this operation is to make NATO and
military forces from Partnership for Peace members compatible,''
said Blidea. The operation is called ``Cooperative Partner 98.''
	   Partnership for Peace was formed in 1994 to aid potential NATO
members in bringing their military and defense systems in line with
NATO standards.
	   Romania is hosting the operation, the largest NATO sea exercises
on the Black Sea held since ``Cooperative Partner'' was first
staged in 1996.
	   Romania has 619 sailors, 60 marine infantry, 12 ships, 4 MiG 21
Lancers and 2 PUMA helicopters taking part in the exercises, which
end June 27.

By SALAH NASRAWI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ One of the Muslim world's leading clerics,
Sheik Mohammed Mutwali Sharawi of Egypt, died Wednesday, his family
said. He was 87.
	   Egypt's leading Islamic authority, the Grand Sheik of Al-Azhar,
Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, described Sharawi's death as a great loss
not only to Egypt, but to the whole Islamic world.
	   ``Time rarely gives birth to such a glorious imam who devoted
his life to making the word of God esteemed,'' Tantawi said in a
statement.
	   Sharawi's ``fingerprints on Islamic teaching were matchless,''
said Moustafa Mashhour, the leader of Egypt's largest
fundamentalist group, the Muslim Brotherhood.
	   Sharawi, who served as minister of religious endowments under
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1976-78, died at his home near
the pyramids of Giza at dawn, his family said.
	   The cause of his death was not immediately known. Last week
Sharawi was admitted to hospital after a severe bout of asthma.
	   Sharawi gave a religious lecture on Egyptian television on
Fridays, that was popular particularly for the simple way in which
he conveyed Islamic principles and his speaking in a colloquial
dialect of Arabic.
	   His teachings and rulings won him wide acclaim in the Muslim
world, but they were also controversial. Moderate Muslims
considered them outdated.
	   He angered feminists and human rights activists by supporting
female circumcision and by ruling that women should not be
appointed to top government positions or become judges. He also
condemned organ transplants and the paying of interest on bank
deposits as un-Islamic.
	   But such rulings went down well in Saudi Arabia and Gulf
countries where governments enforce a strict interpretation of
Islam.
	   He trained at Al-Azhar, Cairo, the leading religous institute in
the Sunni Islami world. After working as a Muslim clerk in Egypt,
and a theological lecturer in Saudi Arabia, he rejoined Al-Azhar as
a director of teaching. But he had to leave after falling out with
President Gamal Abdel Nasser over Egypt's increasingly close ties
with the Soviet Union.
	   In what was possibly his most controversial move, he gave thanks
to God after Egypt suffered a calamitous defeat in the 1967
Arab-Israeli War. Asked why, he said that if Nasser had won the
war, Egypt would have become a communist country.
	   Egypt's Endowment Minister Hamdi Zaqzouq said state officials
would attend Sharawi's funeral and the government would provide
facilities. The ceremony was scheduled to be held before sundown
Wednesday in his home village of Daqadous, Daqahlliya province,
some 12O kilometers (75 miles) north of Cairo.
	   He is survived by three sons and two daughters. His son, Sheik
Sami, is a cleric at Al-Azhar.

Judge in Milan orders separate trial in Berlusconi case 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A Milan judge Wednesday decided to split in
two the current corruption trial of Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian
media tycoon and ex-premier, news reports said.
	   The ongoing All Iberian trial, which is expected to end next
month, centers on allegations that Berlusconi and his associates
made illegal contributions in 1991 to the Socialist Party of
ex-premier Bettino Craxi, falsifying the company's books to cover
the outlay.
	   Judge Carlo Ghezzi ruled the trial should keep going as far as
the alleged political payments were concerned but ordered a new
trial, starting in October, of Berlusconi on the false bookkeeping
charge.
	   The change was ordered after defense lawyers for Berlusconi's
Fininvest company claimed the company had not been formally
notified of the falsification charge, thus limiting its right to
seek damages.
	   The move appeared to be a delaying tactic by the defense.
	   Earlier this month, the prosecutor had wrapped up the case and
asked a court to sentence the media magnate to 5 1/2 years in
prison and fine him 12 billion lire (dlrs 6.7 million).
	   The All Iberian case, named after a holding company Craxi
allegedly used to pocket illegal payoffs, is one of several
investigations of Berlusconi, who leads the center-right
opposition.
	   Berlusconi was convicted in December in a case centering on a
film company deal and given a suspended 16-month sentence.
	   Berlusconi has long denied the corruption charges, claiming he
is the victim of a political vendetta from prosecutors.

Financial secretary: medium-term economic growth forecast not attainable

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's financial secretary said Wednesday
the government's earlier economic growth forecast for the next few
years is not attainable as the region's economic troubles show no
signs of abating.
	   ``Because of the economic downturn, and because of the
performance, for instance, in the fast quarter of this year, I
believe it will be unlikely that we will be able to sustain growth
of 5 percent in real terms in the coming few years,'' Donald Tsang
told reporters.
	   The economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter this year, the
first contraction in 14 years. Officials have hinted the economy
may shrink further in the coming months.
	   Tsang had said earlier that the forecast annual economic growth
of 3.5 percent is unlikely, and he would revise the forecast before
the fourth quarter.
	   Hong Kong has weathered Asia's financial turmoil better than
most countries, but has been suffering from high interest rates and
slumping property and share prices.
	   On Wednesday, about 100 homeowners protested in downtown Hong
Kong, asking for property developers to help them secure bank
loans. They paid down payments on their apartments when the
property market peaked last year, and now have trouble obtaining
loans to cover the balance as property prices have slumped and
banks have been hit by a credit crunch.
	   Property prices have fallen about 40 percent since the market
peaked last summer.
	   The government had announced Monday that unemployment hit a
15-year high of 4.2 percent in the latest three months. A survey by
an independent think tank released Wednesday said confidence in the
government's ability to lower unemployment dropped to 36.3 after
the news, from 43.1 in May.
	   The numbers represent an index, with 100 as the maximum
possible.
	   Confidence in Hong Kong's long-term economic prospects also fell
from 79.8 to 72.3, the survey by the Hong Kong Policy Research
Institute said.
	   The institute surveyed 983 people on Monday and Tuesday. The
margin of error was 3 percent.
	   Pressure is mounting on the government to adopt more aggressive
measures to revive the sagging economy, such as deeper tax cuts and
more public spending. A coalition of political parties has said
they would back a deficit budget if necessary.
	   But Tsang reiterated Wednesday it is against the government's
policy of fiscal prudence to adopt a deficit budget, meaning the
growth in government spending cannot exceed economic growth.
	   Tsang said he will balance the citizens' pleas for tax cuts and
``the international expectation of investors who want to see Hong
Kong continuing its prudent financial management principles.''
	   Tsang also ruled out a budget cut, saying, ``It is rather a
question of growth, of how much growth we would allow. ... Should
it be 5 percent, or should it be less than 5 percent?''
	   On Wednesday, the benchmark Hang Seng stock index rebounded 6.3
percent to 8,004.35 points, the first time it has closed above the
8,000-point support level since last Tuesday.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fires sparked by lightning at ammunition depots
killed at least one serviceman and injured 12 others in the Ural
Mountains on Wednesday, a news agency reported.
	   About 2,500 residents in the area were evacuated, Interfax said.
	   The fire also engulfed 180 hectares (445 acres) of forest around
the depots near the town of Beryozovsky.
	   The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry was sending a plane to
help extinguish the fire.
	   Blazes at ammunition depots, which are often located in thick
forests, break out frequently in Russia.

World Cup: Petrescu is key man for Romania against England 
</HEADLINE>
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALBI, France (AP) - Defender Dan Petrescu has a lot to tell
about English soccer to Romania's coach Anghel Iordanescu these
days.
	   Veteran of two World Cups and an attacking right wingback with a
calm finish, the 30-year-old Petrescu has been one of the stars of
Chelsea's successful season, making an impact in a league where
other Romanian players all failed.
	   Now, preparing for the game against England on June 22, he is a
source of valuable information for Iordanescu.
	   ``He knows a lot about the English soccer, about the players'
psychology and quality,'' said Iordanescu. ``I talked to him and
he's helping us with devising our game plan.''
	   Petrescu, like other Romanian players who beat Colombia 1-0 in a
Group G opener, did not take part in a warmup game Wednesday
against a French local team.
	   While the reserves played _ including defender Tibor Selymes of
Anderlecht who was sidelined in recent weeks with a sprained ankle
_ the first team followed a special program of fitness and
relaxation.
	   ``It's going to be a tough game against the English. Physically,
they're impressive,'' said Petrescu, who has played 69
international games with the national team.
	   The Romanian, known for his devastating runs down the wing, is a
veteran of the English top league, having first impressed with
Sheffield Wednesday before joining Chelsea. He became the first
Romanian to play in an English FA Cup final at Wembley when Chelsea
beat Middlesbrough 2-0 in 1997.
	   Since the start of his career, Petrescu has been used to
success.
	   A good marker and tackler, he won four Romanian First Division
titles and two Cups with Steaua Bucharest. In 1991 he joined
Italian club Foggia and moved onto Genoa two years later.
	   His big break came at the 1994 World Cup finals in the United
States, where he was one of the stars of the Romanian squad that
reached the top eight.
	   Petrescu, quiet and unassuming off the pitch, joined Chelsea for
a 2.6 million pound fee in 1996. Thriving under the coaching of
Ruud Gullit and then Gianluca Vialli, the blond Romanian has become
one of the most effective wingbacks in the English top division.

Three killed by fumes from decaying vegetables 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Three Ukrainians were killed by gas
produced by decaying vegetables stored in a cellar, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The three residents of the northeastern town of Izyum were
poisoned by the gas on Tuesday.
	   On the same day, two other people died when a well they were
digging collapsed in the northeastern village of Leliuki, in the
Kharkiv region, the ministry said. In Ligovka, a village in the
same region, a 10-year boy was killed Tuesday when he stepped on a
World war II mine.
	   And in the western city of Horodok, one person died and four
were injured Wednesday while dismantling the wall of an old brick
factory. They were apparently hoping to use the bricks at home, the
ministry said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hollywood heartthrob Alec Baldwin is jumping
career tracks. Baldwin has agreed to become the new voice of
Thomas, the Tank Engine in the animated television series.
	   The star of such hits as ``The Hunt for Red October'' and ``The
Edge'' has agreed to replace former Beatle Ringo Starr as the
narrator of the animated television series ``Thomas The Tank Engine
and Friends.''
	   Baldwin will narrate 26 new Thomas stories describing the latest
adventures of the talking trains. London's Shepperton Studios is
back in business creating the new Thomas series after a four-year
halt.
	   ``Alec Baldwin is a terrific actor with a wonderful
story-telling voice, sure to capture the heart of Thomas' fans,''
said Britt Allcroft, the show's producer.
	   The television series is based on the books by a British author,
the Rev. Wilbert Awdry. He first created the tales in 1945 for his
son, who was ill with measles.

Politicians make last-minute efforts to attract undecided voters 
</HEADLINE>
By NADIA RYBAROVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Top contenders were out in full
force Wednesday, using the last few hours of legal campaigning
allowed ahead of early parliamentary elections this weekend that
are expected to do little to ease the Czechs' political deadlock.
	   President Vaclav Havel warned Saturday on television that the
vote this Friday and Saturday means the choice between building a
democracy and becoming ``a banana republic.''
	   But opinion polls hint at deadlock between bitterly divided
center-right and center-left parties after polling ends. Havel,
recovering from stomach surgery in April, is seen as the only man
who can help break the impasse.
	   On Wednesday, campaigning officially ended at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT),
48 hours before the first polls open Friday. Voting ends for the
8.09 million eligble voters at 2 p.m. Saturday, with first results
expected later Saturday.
	   Of the top three parties, Social Democratic leader Milos Zeman
toured northern Moravia in his election bus. Former Premier Vaclav
Klaus met supporters in downtown Prague's Wenceslas Square, and Jan
Ruml's Freedom Union wooed supporters to a nearby ``entertaining
action.''
	   The elections come two years ahead of schedule following the
ouster of Premier Vaclav Klaus and the collapse of his center-right
coalition last November.
	   A caretaker government under banker Josef Tosovsky has run the
country since.
	   Prague and other big towns were plastered with posters screaming
``mobilization'' in huge letters and calling on Czech citizens who
``want to live in freedom'' to vote Klaus' Civic Democratic Party.
	   Klaus has frequently warned that if the Social Democrats win,
Czechs could return to life under socialism.
	   ``I consider it an insolence,'' said Zeman, whose Social
Democrats are leading the polls with 23.2 percent. The Civic
Democrats are a close second with 20.7 percent.
	   In a live debate on Czech state television late Tuesday, Klaus
and Zeman, both visibly in a good mood, exchanged bon mots.
	   At one point, Ruml criticized Zeman for allegedly offering the
communists the post of parliamentary speaker in exchange for
supporting the minority Social Democratic government.
	   ``At this point, I really have to stand up for Mr. Zeman,'' said
Klaus. ``Everybody was asking me about it and I said it just could
not be true ... because what he offered them was the post of the
parliament's vice chairman.''
	   ``Uff, I'm relieved,'' Ruml replied.
	   But beneath the jesting, political tensions were evident. Ruml
unconvincingly supported Klaus, and Communist leader Miroslav
Grebenicek supported Zeman.
	   At the same hour, the private NOVA television broadcast a
pre-recorded discussion between President Vaclav Havel and French
analyst Jacques Rupnik, causing viewers to jump from one channel to
another.
	   Havel has come under fire for repeatedly saying he may not
choose the largest party to form the next government. But in
Tuesday's debate he dodged the issue, saying the question was
offensive.
	   ``Because such a question contains the suspicion that I will not
respect the results of the elections, and name the gardener at the
Lany Park (his official residence) as the new premier,'' he said.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's cricket board named new
batsman Avishka Gunewardena Wednesday to a 14-member squad of
probables for a three-nation cricket tournament that begins this
week.
	   Gunewardena made a strong claim for inclusion in the national
team Tuesday after scoring 96 runs for the Board President's team,
playing against New Zealand. If chosen for the final 11, it will be
his first appearance in an international match.
	   The three-nation Independence Cup tournament has been organized
to celebrate the Indian Ocean island nation's 50th anniversary of
independence from its former colonial British rulers who introduced
the game to the country.
	   The tournament, featuring India and New Zealand along with host
Sri Lanka, begins Friday. The final is scheduled for July 7.
	   The Sri Lankan squad includes Arjuna Ranatunga (captain), Sanath
Jayasuriya, Marvan Atapattu, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Aravinda de
Silva (Vice captain), Mahela Jayawardena, Roshan Mahanama, Kumar
Dharmasena, Muttiah Muralitheran, Pramodya Wickremasinghe, Suresh
Perera, Avishka Gunewardena, Niroshan Bandaratilleke and Upul
Chandana.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Lawmakers in parliament's lower house
opened their first session since the June 3 high-speed crash in
Germany with a moment of silence in memory of the 100 passengers
killed.
	   Images of the InterCity Express train that derailed and slammed
into an overpass ``still affect us, still burrow in us,''
parliament president Rita Suessmuth said, while lawmakers stood at
their seats.
	   ``Nobody who saw the reports on the accident and the images of
the train cars wedged together meters-high (yards-high) can escape
the impression of the accident's unspeakable misfortune for so
many,'' Suessmuth said.
	   Meanwhile, transportation officials presented results so far of
an investigation into the crash before a parliamentary committee.
Investigators have focused on a wheel failure as the likely cause.

Police seek two men for political bombing in Hungary

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Police said Wednesday they are seeking
two men suspected in this week's bomb attack against Hungary's
leading parliamentary party.
	   Composite sketches have been issued of the two men, whom police
suspect of placing the bomb on a balcony of the Young
Democrats-Civic Party headquarters early Monday.
	   The explosion in Budapest's sixth district, near several
embassies, destroyed the balcony and a door of the party
headquarters but caused no injuries.
	   Police have posted a one million forint (dlrs 4,500) reward to
find the two men, believed to be between 25 and 35 years old, said
city police spokesman Robert Ragalyi.
	   The bombing was the latest in a series of attacks against
political parties and politicians in Hungary. The perpetrators have
not been found in any of them.

U.N.: Sierra Leone a `brutal reminder' of need for global court With UN-International Court 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Fighting in Sierra Leone in which thousands have
been killed or maimed proves that an effective international
criminal court is urgently needed, top United Nations officials
said Wednesday.
	   ``It is no longer sufficient for humanitarian and human rights
officials to denounce atrocities while unable to prevent their
recurrence,'' said a statement from refugee chief Sadako Ogata,
human rights commissioner Mary Robinson and children's fund
director Carol Bellamy among others.
	   Negotiators meeting in Rome hope to agree on a statute creating
the court, which would prosecute individuals and not nations.
	   The five-week U.N. conference began Monday.
	   Thousands of villagers in Sierra Leone have lost limbs and
others have been killed in attacks apparently being carried out by
former junta troops seeking revenge for their ouster from Freetown
by a Nigerian-led West African force in February.
	   That allowed elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to return from
months in exile after Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma took power in a
bloody May 1997 coup.
	   Shattered Sierra Leone's likely inability to bring the
perpetrators to justice ``raises the prospect of yet another round
of mindless violence going unpunished,'' the U.N. leaders said.
	   The crisis ``is a brutal reminder ... of the urgent need for an
effective international criminal court to provide justice for the
appalling violations of human rights in that country and
elsewhere,'' they added.
	   A court ``empowered and resourced to take action when national
systems are either unable or unwilling would provide a credible
deterrent,'' the statement said.

Health minister admits working for the Securitate 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's health minister on Wednesday
admitted he had work for the oppressive Securitate communist secret
police and said he was prepared to resign.
	   Ethnic Hungarian Francisc Baranyi, 63, said he had been forced
to make a ``commitment'' to the feared secret police in 1961.
However, he said he never harmed anyone.
	   ``If the prime minister deems it necessary, I will resign,''
Baranyi was quoted as saying by the national news agency Rompres.
	   ``I was forced with a weapon to sign and I don't consider myself
an agent because I never informed on anyone,'' said Baranyi.
	   He gave no further details. At the time he had just finished his
medical studies in the Transylvanian city of Targu Mures.
	   Baranyi's admission comes just after another leading politician,
Adrian Vliau, was exposed as a Securitate informer. Vilau's
Democratic Party banned him from heading a parliamentary commission
on foreign intelligence, accusing him of covering up his past.
	   Although one in four of the adult population was believed to
have collaborated with the Securitate, almost nobody has come clean
since 1989 when communism fell, leading to a society still haunted
by mistrust and rumor.
	   Before 1989, Baranyi worked as a doctor in the western city of
Timisoara. Dictator Nicholae Ceausescu was known to be especially
suspicious of any ethnic minority, including Romania's 1.6 million
ethnic Hungarians.

Japan Parliament passes extra budget for stimulus package 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Parliament passed a 4.6 trillion yen (dlrs
32 billion) supplementary budget Wednesday to help pay for tax cuts
and fresh spending as part of a 16.65 trillion yen (dlrs 117
billion) economic stimulus package.
	   Final approval for the extra budget for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1999, came in Parliament's upper house. The more powerful
lower house had passed it on Monday.
	   The stimulus package, Japan's largest ever, includes a range of
public works projects, a total of 4 trillion yen (dlrs 28 billion)
of special income tax cuts this year and next, and measures to
stimulate the real estate market.
	   The government has said the package will produce 1.9 percent
gross domestic product growth this fiscal year, but most private
analysts believe the economy will grow much more slowly, or even
contract.
	   Last week, the government announced that Japan had slipped into
recession for the third time this decade and suffered its worst
annual economic contraction since the end of World War II.
	   Japan is facing a new wave of pressure from the United States to
take measures to revive its flagging economy more quickly. Asian
countries, suffering from a yearlong slump, also are hoping Japan
can revive its economy enough to buy more of their products.

	   NEMA MILITARY SECTOR II, Senegal (AP) _ The Gambian foreign
minister reportedly held talks Wednesday with government officials
in Guinea-Bissau, where rebel soldiers have been in a standoff with
loyalist forces.
	   Mohamed Lamin Sedat Jobe and other Gambian officials arrived
Wednesday the presidential palace in the capital of Bissau at 10:30
a.m. (1030 GMT), according to the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   A French escort vessel Le Drogouat took the group to
Guinea-Bissau. ``It was the only way for them to reach Bissau,''
said Yves Doutriaux, deputy spokesman for the French foreign
ministry.
	   Sedat Jobe met with Guinea-Bissau's Minister for Parliamentary
Affairs Malal Sane, acting Foreign Minister Joao Cardoso,
Guinea-Bissau Ambassador to the United States Mario Lopes da Rosa,
and two unidentified advisors to President Joao Bernardo Vieira,
Lusa said.
	   Sedat Jobe was due to meet later with rebel leader Brig.
Ansumane Mane in an unspecified area of the city controlled by his
force. They have accused Vieira of corruption and abuse of power
and demanded that he step down.
	   Mane, the former head of Guinea-Bissau's armed forces, was born
in Gambia, and Vieira reportedly has warm relations with Gambian
President Yahya Jammeh, a retired colonel who seized power in 1994.
	   Vieira came to power in a 1980 coup after winning renown as a
guerilla fighter in the 1961-74 war against Portuguese colonial
rule. He was elected in the country's first democratic ballot in
1994.
	   Loyalist forces, with help from troops sent by neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, have maintained their siege of
a military garrison in a suburb of Bissau, where renegade soldiers
have been holed up since June 7.
	   On Tuesday, Senegal launched an artillery barrage across the
frontier into rebel territory as the violence in Guinea-Bissau
spread to the country's northern border. The attack was aimed at
dislodging Senegal's own separatist rebels with suspected links to
Mane.
	   The fighting near the border _ not uncommon in this
rebellion-wracked region _ appeared this time to indicate an
escalation in the conflict in Guinea-Bissau, Senegalese military
officers said.
	   ``We had been expecting the rebels to step up their fighting
here to coincide with the war in Guinea-Bissau,'' a senior
commander based near the border said on condition of customary
anonymity.
	   While thousands of refugees fled Bissau in hopes of seeking
refuge in Senegal, the cross-border clash cut one of their main
escape routes.
	   Thousands of people reportedly were camping outside the city
Tuesday. A Catholic mission in Nhacra-Mansoa, about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) northeast of Bissau on the road to Senegal, reported
more than 150,000 refugees in the area.
	   Those who had already made it into Senegal said many had been
cut off close to the border.
	   World Food Program spokesman Wagdi Othman said villages in
Guinea-Bissau's interior were quickly running out of ways to feed a
growing influx of refugees.
	   ``This is the rainy season, the lean season when there is not a
lot of food around,'' Othman said from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. ``We
don't have figures yet. but the situation is very unstable.''
	   The United Nations refugee agency said it was deploying missions
to both the Republic of Guinea and Senegal to assess the numbers of
refugees.
	   ``If the mediators are able to come up with a peaceful
settlement, then the problem could be contained. But if there is no
peace, then the refugee situation will quickly deteriorate,'' said
UNHCR official Khassim Diagne.
	   If the reports are accurate, what began as an attempted coup in
the capital of Bissau could end up involving three countries in
West Africa, fueled by years of simmering enmity.
	   Mane, accused of running guns to Senegal's separatist forces in
Casamance province, has suffered from poor relations with the
military command in Senegal's capital, Dakar. The two countries
also fought brief clashes in 1990 over offshore oil exploration
rights.
	   Senegal, meanwhile, was beefing up its contingent of soldiers
sent to support Vieira.
	   The Senegalese commander said several truck convoys with troops
had been sent to reinforce earlier troops and heavy artillery
pieces in the capital.
	   There also were unconfirmed reports from refugees and the
Senegalese military that said a significant number of Guinean
soldiers had lined up with Mane.

Israelis arrested in killing of Palestinian farmer

Eds: RECASTS lead to change reference to prank

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A 16-year-old Jewish settler who clubbed a
Palestinian farmer to death with a chunk of wood he held out from a
passing van never intended to kill the man, his lawyer said
Wednesday. The youth reportedly said he was ``playing a prank.''
	   A Jerusalem magistrate ordered the suspect and another
16-year-old held for six days, but released the van's driver, an
adult, even though he did not stop after the attack on 45-year-old
Abdel Majid Turki on Tuesday afternoon.
	   The two juveniles, who live in a halfway house for troubled
youths in the Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai in the West Bank,
covered their heads with prayer shawls as they walked into court.
	   Their lawyer, Naftali Werzberger, said one of the youths has
psychological problems. Werzberger said the two were on their way
back from their studies in another settlement when the incident
occurred on a road leading to Beit Hagai, south of Hebron.
	   ``During the van ride, one took out a chunk of wood and hit a
man on the side of the road,'' Werzberger told reporters after the
closed-door hearing. ``He (the suspect) said he never dreamed
something serious would happen because of this.''
	   Israel army radio said the suspect told police he was ``playing
a prank.

World Cup: Yugoslavia's raising stars have no fear of Germany 
</HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-GALMIER, France (AP) _ Yugoslavia has a history of
stumbling against Germany at big soccer championships. This time,
two young talents _ Dejan Stankovic and Perica Ognjenovic _ are
bent on changing its fortunes at the World Cup.
	   Stankovic, 19, is likely to start in midfield against Germany
when the two toughest rivals in Group F meet next Sunday in Lens.
Forward Ognjenovic, 20, will probably come in from the bench if
things start bad for the Yugoslavs.
	   Soccer history says the Germans usually had an upper hand when
they met Yugoslavia at major tournaments. The last time they played
at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, Germany humiliated Yugoslavia 4-1
in their opening match with Lothar Matthaus, still in the German
team, scoring two goals.
	   Germany leads Yugoslavia 14-7, with 3 ties (goal difference
44-29) in their overall record. The last time Yugoslavia beat
Germany at the World Cup was in 1962 in Chile, 1-0.
	   ``Germany is a mighty strong team,'' Stankovic said after
watching the Germans beat the United States 2-0 last Monday. ``But
I don't fear the Germans and I intend to show it if I get a chance
to play them next Sunday.''
	   ``Some of our older players might have a German complex, but us
two youngsters don't,'' said Ognjenovic, the small but fast
dribbler who is the only Yugoslav player in the national team who
is playing with a domestic team, Red Star Belgrade.
	   ``We played Kaiserslautern two years ago, and we trounced them
4-0,'' Ognjenovic said, referring to Red Star's victory over the
current German Bundesliga champions.
	   In that European Cup Winners' Cup game, Stankovic came in from
the bench to score two goals. That was his first major
international game that cemented his midfield position in the
Belgrade club.
	   ``That game was one thing, and playing the German national team
is completely different,'' Stankovic said. ``It will be extremely
tough for us, but we have to forget the past losses against the
Germans and start a new tradition.''
	   In his first ever national team warmup match against South Korea
last month, Stankovic scored two goals in Yugoslavia's 3-1 victory.
	   Stankovic, a strongly built midfielder with a special touch for
scoring goals, this summer left Red Star to sign for Lazio Rome for
a reported 24.5 million German mark, 9-year contract. This made him
the second-highest paid Yugoslav player after star striker Predrag
Mijatovic of Real Madrid.
	   Ognjenovic was sought by Real Madrid this summer, but Red Star
promised him to the Spanish team only after next season.
	   During Yugoslavia's lackluster 1-0 victory against Iran last
Sunday, both Stankovic and Ognjenovic came in from the bench in the
second half, completely changing the slow and uncreative Yugoslav
game to a faster and much more penetrating match.

Duma moves to define rules of president's dismissal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Supreme Court would have to determine
whether a president can be removed from office because of poor
health under a bill that received preliminary approval Wednesday.
	   Russia's constitution is vague on how a president can be ousted.
Boris Yeltsin's opponents, who have long claimed he is unfit for
office, are trying to spell out the procedures.
	   The bill discussed in the State Duma on Wednesday is the second
on this topic to be introduced in a week. To become law, either
bill would require final approval by both houses of parliament and
Yeltsin, who is likely to veto them.
	   The Russian constitution says a president must step down if he
suffers a ``lasting inability to exercise his powers.'' The
vagueness of the procedures to be followed has fueled controversy
since Yeltsin's heart illnesses and bypass surgery in 1996.
	   Doctors say Yeltsin has fully recovered from his surgery and is
in good shape, but Communists and other foes disagree. They argue
he is unfit for office and should step down.
	   A week ago, the Duma has given preliminary approval to a bill
that said parliament may demand a medical exam if a president is
unable to work full time for more than four months or if doctors
order him to reduce his workload.
	   Either house of parliament would be authorized to ask the
Supreme Court to appoint a team of doctors to examine a president
and, based on their findings, rule whether he could remain in
office.
	   The bill discussed Wednesday simply said the Supreme Court will
have to decide if the president is fit. It did not say they had to
consult doctors.
	   This bill is an amendment to Russia's basic law, known as the
Civil Procedural Code. The earlier one was an entirely new law. It
was not clear why both laws would be needed.
	   The Russian constitution also says that a president can be
impeached if he breaks the law.
	   Communists and others have repeatedly tried to launch
impeachment motions against Yeltsin. All such moves have fizzled,
mostly because Russia's constitution gives the president the upper
hand in confrontations with parliament.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A U.S. court has ordered Hajji Nasser
Ssebagala, the mayor of the Ugandan capital, to remain in the
country after he was charged with making false customs declaration
and being in possession of stolen travelers' checks, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   Ssebagala was en route from Chicago to London when he has taken
off the plane Saturday by customs officials at New York's John F.
Kennedy International Airport.
	   He appeared before the Eastern District of New York Court on
Monday and was granted bail, the newspaper New Vision reported.
	   The newspaper quoted Amy Rindskopf of federal prosecutor's
office as saying a hearing is scheduled for June 23 when the court
will decide whether Ssebagala is to be detained pending trial in
Boston, where the offenses allegedly were committed.
	   If found guilty, Ssebagala would face a maximum of five years
imprisonment plus a dlrs 250,000 fine, New Vision said.
	   It quoted Ugandan diplomats as saying the mayor and wife Sarah
Nabagesera, who is also a parliamentary deputy, were staying with
friends in New York City area.
	   They reportedly were returning from a garbage-management seminar
in Chicago.
	   Ssebagala, who owns a foreign-exchange house in Kampala, was
elected mayor by a a landslide in April. He campaigned in Luganda,
the dominant language in the Kampala area, after New Vision wrote a
story about his problems with English.
	   He later said he had decided to turn his lack of mastery of the
language to his advantage.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A 16-year-old Jewish settler who hit a
Palestinian farmer in the head with a chunk of wood he held out
from a passing van never intended to kill the man, his lawyer said
Wednesday. The youth reportedly said he was ``playing a prank.''
	   A Jerusalem magistrate ordered the suspect and another
16-year-old held for six days, but released the van's driver, an
adult, even though he did not stop after 45-year-old Abdel Majid
Turki was struck Tuesday afternoon.
	   There was concern that the killing would spark new violence.
	   The two juveniles, who live in a halfway house for troubled
youths in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, covered their heads
with prayer shawls as they walked into court.
	   Their lawyer, Naftali Werzberger, said one of the youths has
psychological problems. Werzberger said the two were on their way
back from their studies in another settlement when the incident
occurred south of Hebron.
	   ``During the van ride, one took out a chunk of wood and hit a
man on the side of the road,'' Werzberger told reporters after the
closed-door hearing. ``He (the suspect) said he never dreamed
something serious would happen because of this.''
	   Israel army radio said the suspect told police he was ``playing
a prank.
	   At Turki's home in Hebron, family members gathered outside.
Turki's 11-year-old daughter, Noor, cried uncontrollably, her face
red. ``My destiny is to get revenge for my father,'' she said.
Turki was to be buried once an autopsy has been performed.
	   The Hebron area is one of the most tense in the West Bank. A
number of Palestinians and Jewish settlers have been killed in
political violence in the Hebron area in recent years. The
bloodiest incident was the 1994 Hebron mosque massacre in which a
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshippers.
	   Werzberger said Turki was not targeted because he was a
Palestinian, and that the two juveniles have expressed remorse.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the killing ``horrible
and unacceptable.''
	   In other developments Wednesday, the Jewish Settlers' Council
said it would launch a civil disobedience campaign if Netanyahu
agreed to a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Settler leaders planned to hold protest vigils in tents outside
Netanyahu's office and organize mass demonstrations.
	   ``We cannot stand by and see the land being voluntarily given
away, and we will do all within our power to thwart any action by
Netanyahu,'' said settler spokesman Aharon Domb.
	   The Israeli daily Maariv said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has given Netanyahu until June 24 to decide on the U.S.
plan already accepted by the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's office confirmed Albright and Netanyahu spoke on the
phone earlier this week, but denied an ultimatum was set.
	   A poll taken by Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot indicated
two-thirds of Israelis support a 13 percent troop pullback. The
poll, based on responses of 505 Jewish Israelis, found that 59
percent favor the U.S. plan, while 36 percent oppose it. The poll's
margin of error was 4.5 percent.

Defense officer said.
	   The storm damaged or destroyed more than 250 farms, agricultural
production facilities, and residential buildings in the Vitebsk
region alone. Thousands of hectares (acres) of farmland were
flooded, the officer said.

World Cup: Blood donors go missing during World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Scotland has recorded a 30 percent drop
in blood donations since the start of the World Cup, officials said
Wednesday.
	   About 1,000 pints of blood are normally collected in Scotland
each day but the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service said
the total had dropped to about 700 pints a day during the first
week of the World Cup.
	   The service said restrictions had already been placed on the
supply of O group blood _ the most common blood type _ to
hospitals.
	   A spokesman for the service said blood stocks had dropped below
the three-day minimul level.
	   He said no serious operations had been canceled but there were
concerns that non-ermergency operations could soon be affected.
	   SNBTS donor service manager Moira Eadie said donors were needed
urgently to stop a serious situation getting worse.
	   ``Our message to fans is to please support Scotland twice - by
supporting the national team and by becoming a blood donor,'' she
said.
	   In England the number of blood donations fell by 1,000, or more
than 10 percent, when England played in the World Cup this week,
the National Blood Authority said.
	   But, by the next day, it had almost returned to the previous
level and so had not been ``noticeable.''

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The Southern African Transport and
Communications Commission and the United States Trade and
Development Agency agreed Tuesday to develop an air transport
safety system in Southern Africa.
	   The project is estimated to cost about dlrs 375,000. SATCC is a
body of the Southern African Develoment Community. The agreement,
was signed by the SATCC director, Eric Msolomba, and the United
States Ambassador in Maputo, Brian Curran.
	   The SATCC says the accord is aimed at financing a feasibility
study of an air traffic control project by satellite. The study
will analyze two navigation-type systems for SADC to enable each
member country to take the best decision as to its own needs.
	   Experts are also to visit each country to decide whether there
is a need to install systems that will help aircraft make safer and
more precise approaches and landings
	   Civil aviation expert Omari Nundi says the technology in use in
the region have been out of date for 15 years.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ More than 500 businessmen from
Mozambique, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Lesotho are analyzing
35 economic projects tabled by an investment forum which started in
Maputo on Tuesday.
	   President Joaquim Chissano opened the meeting and called on the
participants to analyze his country's industrial potential. He
expressed hope the discussions would result in some partnerships or
joint ventures.
	   The director of Mozambique's Investment Promotion Centre,
Fernando Sumbana, said the participants will have the opportunity
to look at the projects in detail before they decide whether to
invest in them.
	   Most of the projects are in the fields of agriculture, tourism,
industry, transport and trade.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A baby boom in the past 18 months has added 10
new members to the families of endangered African mountain
gorillas, the African Wildlife Foundation said Wednesday.
	   ``With only 600 mountain gorillas left in the world, this
gorilla baby boom represents the miraculous ability of African
wildlife to bounce back despite extraordinary chaos,'' said AWF
president Michael Wright.
	   The gorillas were born in the Virunga National Park in
northeastern Congo, formerly Zaire, Wright said in a statement.
	   Many of the births have occurred in gorilla families that have
been disrupted over the past three years because of ongoing
conflict in northeastern Congo and bordering Rwanda and Uganda _
their natural habitat.
	   The region has been the scene of violent fighting and massive
displacement of refugees since mid-1994.
	   ------
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Officials in Republic of
Congo have begun negotiating with the International Monetary Fund
for loans worth nearly dlrs 1 billion to rebuild its economy and
infrastructure shattered during the country's five-month civil war
last year.
	   The money would be used to repair badly-damaged buildings in the
battered
	   capital of Brazzaville and replace water and sanitary facilities
destroyed throughout the country during fighting which ended last
October, officials said.
	   In return, the IMF is asking the Republic of Congo to begin
privatizing its national telecommunications company, post office
and water, electricity and hydro-power works.
	   Negotiations were taking place between unnamed government and
IMF officials on Tuesday and Wednesday, a Republic of Congo
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   --------
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Liberian authorities have fired 13
police officers for allegedly ransacking the home of the country's
assistant minister of security.
	   The officers were arrested this week after being accused of
breaking into
	   the residence of Assistant Minister of National Security Fafini
Kamara and stealing a television and other electronic equipment, a
police official said on condition of anonymity.
	   It was not clear when the robbery took place.
	   The culprits were apparently searching for weapons believed
hidden in the
	   house, the officer said.
	   -------
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Four members of a
separatist guerrilla movement in the Angolan enclave of Cabinda
have been detained in Congo's capital of Kinshasa and are due to be
handed over to Angolan officials, a spokesman for the separatists
said.
	   The members of the Cabinda rebel movement, known as FLEC-FLAC,
were arrested by Congolese security forces last month, the group's
spokesman Auguste Tchioufou told reporters in Congo's neighboring
Republic of Congo on Monday.
	   Cabinda, a wedge of coastal territory cut off from Angola and
bordering the two Congos, has vast oil reserves that have financed
Angola's government and military for decades.
	   The presidents in both Kinshasa and Brazzaville are close allies
of Angola, which helped them rise to power last year.
	   ------
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ An amnesty applicant told the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission Wednesday that a state witness
and police informant played a leading role in building three bombs
that members of a neo-Nazi group detonated shortly before the 1994
election.
	   Former Afrikaner Resistance Movement member Etienne le Roux said
a Mr. Koekemoer, the main state witness in the subsequent criminal
case, played a leading role in building the bombs used in
explosions in Johannesburg, in the suburb of Germiston and at
Johannesburg airport. The three-day bombing spree killed 21 people
and injured 46.
	   Koekemoer's first name was not given at the hearing.
	   The Truth Commission is probing apartheid-era human rights
abuses and can give amnesty to those who confess fully to
politically motivated crimes.
	   ------
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ A German pro-democracy pressure group
was banned by the government from continuing its activities in
Malawi, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The German embassy in the capital, Lilongwe, declined to
comment, saying it was trying to clarify the action against the
German Technical Cooperation Agency's program to promote democracy,
the opposition-owned Daily Times reported.
	   The agency, known by its initials GTZ, began publishing a
newsletter entitled ``Take Part'' earlier this year that has
criticized electoral procedures in Malawi.
	   Information Minister Sam Mpasu protested to the German
government that GTZ was interfering in Malawi's internal affairs.
GTZ argued the newsletter aimed to promote civic education and
political awareness.
	   ------
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Hundreds of travelers hoping to
board a Zambia-bound train have been stranded at Dar es Salaam's
main railway station
	   after an accident involving a goods train blocked service, Radio
Tanzania said Wednesday. No casualties were reported.

World Cup: As Brazil grows, so do expectations 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ While 31 teams battle for the 15 remaining
berths in the second round of the World Cup, Brazil already is
looking ahead. And frankly, it makes little difference who gets in
their way.
	   ``The truth is I don't care who we play,'' said midfielder
Rivaldo. ``I think we've grown and can beat anyone.''
	   Cocky? Or simply realistic? After a 3-0 victory over Morocco on
Tuesday that was pure showtime in the second half, the Brazilians
shed their opening-game jitters and felt the future unfold.
	   ``It was excellent,'' said coach Mario Zagallo. ``We played
joyful, sparkling and efficient soccer.''
	   No more excuses or pleas for patience. Brazil's solid play
against Morocco raised the already high expectations for a team in
quest of a record fifth World Cup.
	   Not surprisingly, the game highlights began with Ronaldo.
	   The two-time FIFA Player of the Year got his first World Cup
with a bullet into the lower corner in the ninth minute. He also
assisted on the third goal by Bebeto and tormented the Moroccan
defense all night with an assortment of dribbles, passes and
near-misses.
	   Not that he played badly in Brazil's 2-1 win over Scotland, but
strikers live by goals. And against Morocco, Ronaldo was
unstoppable _ despite vicious fouls that tore his shorts and left
an ugly cleat mark on his thigh.
	   ``He was simply phenomenal,'' said Zagallo. ``That was the
player we all wanted to see.''
	   Meanwhile, Bebeto snapped his own scoring drought and helped set
up the second goal, by Rivaldo. The 34-year-old striker also was
benefited by the lackluster play of Edmundo, who replaced him in
the second half.
	   But every sector looked good against Morocco. The midfield,
uninspired against Scotland, gained new life with Leonardo in place
of Giovanni and a more self-assured Rivaldo in the role of
playmaker.
	   The much-maligned defense, which trained hard to plug the holes
evident in the first game, jelled against the agile Moroccan
attack. Despite some deft footwork, the Atlas Lions never seriously
threatened. Goalie Taffarel didn't make a save all night.
	   ``We studied their films and defended well,'' said Taffarel.
``This team just keeps getting better.''
	   Zagallo said Brazil's domination shouldn't overshadow the
qualities of its opponent.
	   ``We didn't draw just any adversary,'' he said. ``Morocco is a
good team that knows how to play soccer. It might not qualify, but
it has every chance to take second in the group.''
	   True, Brazil had an uncommonly free rein against the Lions.
Defense is a concept that seemingly hasn't taken root. Rivaldo is
unlikely to get the same unencumbered freedom to create against
other teams.
	   But the mood is distinctly upbeat. As Brazil contemplates a
possible second-round encounter with perenniel contender Italy or
South American rival Chile, neither causes apprehension.
	   ``They are two strong teams, but it doesn't matter to us,'' said
Ronaldo. ``In soccer, the pleasure comes from knowing that you beat
the best.''

	   NEMA MILITARY SECTOR II, Senegal (AP) _ The Gambian foreign
minister reportedly held talks Wednesday with government officials
in Guinea-Bissau, where rebel soldiers have been in a standoff with
loyalist forces.
	   ``We have come to look at the possibilities for a ceasefire,''
Mohamed Sedat Jobe was quoted as saying after a 45-minute meeting
in the captial of Bissau, according to the Portuguese news agency
Lusa.
	   ``We want to reopen the airport and re-establish (international)
communications and then go into negotiations,'' Sedat Jobe told
reporters, according to Lusa.
	   For the first time since the revolt broke out 11 days ago, there
was no shelling in the capital during the night and morning, Lusa
reported.
	   Acting Foreign Minister Joao Cardoso said that as long as the
firing stopped, the government was ready to talk with the
renegades, Lusa reported.
	   He said the legislative elections scheduled for this year would
inevitably have to be postponed because of the instability prompted
by the insurrection.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt is refusing a transit visa to Hamas
leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin until Israel announces officially that he
will be let into the Gaza Strip, a Hamas spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Yassin and two aides have been waiting more than two weeks in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, for visas to enter Egypt.
	   ``Our brothers in Egypt are only telling us to wait until
arrangements have been made,'' said Jamal Issa, the Sudan
representative of the radical Islamic group.
	   ``But we do not know for how long we should wait,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Khartoum.
	   Although an Israeli official said Monday that the government
would allow Yassin to return to Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's spokesman, Michael Stoltz, said Wednesday: ``The prime
minister and defense minister are still deliberating with senior
security officials on the issue.''
	   Egyptian officials have said privately that the government needs
a formal statement from Israel on Yassin's return.

U.S. opposes independent world court prosecutor to `personnel'; no pickup

Eds: ADDS in graf 2 other crimes; CORRECTS in graf 14 `prosecution'
By DANIEL J. WAKIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) - The United States Wednesday staked out a tough
position at the U.N. global court conference, demanding that the
Security Council be a trigger to set in motion prosecutions by such
a tribunal.
	   The court also should steer clear of prosecuting individuals
accused of waging national aggression, Bill Richardson, the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told the delegates. All nations
agree the court's main targets would be crimes against humanity,
war crimes and genocide.
	   He laid out a position that puts the United States at odds with
key allies like Britain, Canada and most of the European nations,
which want the court to remain independent from the Security
Council.
	   Critics say that without such independence, the court would be a
toothless pawn subject to the veto of the council's five permanent
members, the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain.
	   ``We must carefully distinguish between what looks good on paper
and what works in the real world,'' Richardson said.
	   The Security Council should play a key role because of its
``legal responsibilities for maintaining international peace and
security,'' Richardson added. Giving it the authority to refer
cases provides the prosecutor with the political muscle needed, he
said.
	   Individual states also should have the power to refer matters
for investigation, he said.
	   Human Rights Watch, a critic of the U.S. position, noted that
Richardson did not insist that individual Security Council members
be allowed to veto specific cases -- which shows the United States
may be open to compromise.
	   However, it was ``shameful'' that the United States did not take
a stand that individual states should not be allowed to block
investigations, said the group's Richard Dicker.
	   ``Any tyrant accused of war crimes can block his prosecution,''
he said.
	   Giving the prosecutor unlimited scope is ``unrealistic and
unwise'' and will weaken the court by overloading it, Richardson
told the delegates.
	   ``This court cannot and should not address every crime that goes
unpunished, no matter how horrific or atrocious it may be.''
	   The crux of the U.S. objections is the desire to protect its
soldiers serving abroad in peacekeeping operations. They ``need to
do their jobs without exposure to policiticized proceedings,'' he
said.
	   U.S. negotiators have submitted a proposal to overcome the
obstacle, calling for an exemption from prosecution for military
personnel acting under orders -- unless they knew the order was
illegal, or if the order in fact was ``manifestly unlawful.''
	   The United States voiced its support to including rape under
crimes of humanity, a measure it proposed in the draft statute. A
growing number of countries have agreed.
	   Richardson noted that the United States has long backed war
crimes trials, from Nuremberg after World War II to the current
tribunals judging the perpetrators of atrocities in Rwanda and
Bosnia.
	   Negotiators hope to agree on a statute creating the court, which
would prosecute individuals and not nations, during the five-week
conference, which began Monday. It would still need ratification by
individual nations.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ One of the Muslim world's leading clerics,
Sheik Mohammed Mutwali Sharawi of Egypt, died early Wednesday, his
family said. He was 87.
	   Sharawi, who served as minister of religious endowments under
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1976-78, died at his home near
the pyramids of Giza, his family said.
	   The cause of death was not immediately known. Last week, Sharawi
was admitted to hospital after a severe bout of asthma.
	   ``Time rarely gives birth to such a glorious imam who devoted
his life to making the word of God esteemed,'' Egypt's leading
Islamic authority, the Grand Sheik of Al-Azhar, Mohammed Sayed
Tantawi, said in a statement.
	   Sharawi's ``fingerprints on Islamic teaching were matchless,''
said Moustafa Mashhour, the leader of Egypt's largest
fundamentalist group, the Muslim Brotherhood.
	   Sharawi gave a religious lecture on Egyptian television on
Fridays that was popular particularly for the simple way in which
he conveyed Islamic principles and his speaking in a colloquial
dialect of Arabic.
	   His teachings and rulings won him wide acclaim in the Muslim
world, but they were also controversial. Moderate Muslims
considered them outdated.
	   He angered feminists and human rights activists by supporting
female circumcision and by ruling that women should not be
appointed to top government positions or become judges. He also
condemned organ transplants and the paying of interest on bank
deposits as un-Islamic.
	   But such rulings went down well in Saudi Arabia and Gulf
countries where governments enforce a strict interpretation of
Islam.
	   He trained at Al-Azhar, Cairo, the leading religous institute in
the Sunni Islami world. After working as a Muslim clerk in Egypt,
and a theological lecturer in Saudi Arabia, he rejoined Al-Azhar as
a director of teaching. But he had to leave after falling out with
President Gamal Abdel Nasser over Egypt's increasingly close ties
with the Soviet Union.
	   In what was possibly his most controversial move, he gave thanks
to God after Egypt suffered a calamitous defeat in the 1967
Arab-Israeli War. Asked why, he said that if Nasser had won the
war, Egypt would have become a communist country.
	   Egypt's Endowment Minister Hamdi Zaqzouq said state officials
would attend Sharawi's funeral. The ceremony was scheduled to be
held before sundown Wednesday in his home village of Daqadous,
Daqahlliya province, some 12O kilometers (75 miles) north of Cairo.
	   He is survived by three sons and two daughters. His son, Sheik
Sami, is a cleric at Al-Azhar Institute, Cairo.

Japan prime minister welcomes currency cooperation 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto welcomed
U.S. intervention in currency markets Wednesday to support Japan's
sinking currency.
	   Hashimoto said he and President Bill Clinton had consulted by
telephone earlier Wednesday, and that Japan would accelerate
efforts to pull its economy out of a slump that has raised worries
worldwide about the likely spillover.
	   ``The president and I are delighted to see that the United
States and Japan have cooperated in exchange markets to support a
strong, stable yen,'' he said in a statement.
	   Hashimoto said Japan realized a revival of its economy was
``urgently needed.''
	   ``We will made every effort to restore its banking system to
health, to achieve domestic demand-led growth, and to open and
deregulate its markets, which is of vital importance to Japan, to
the recovery of Asian countries affected by financial market
turbulence, and to the entire world economy,'' he added.
	   The weak yen has the effect of making Japanese products cheaper
abroad _ hurting sales by other nations _ and making it harder for
Japan to afford the products of other countries.
	   Thus the United States and others have insisted Japan should try
to lift its economy by improving its home market, rather than
selling more abroad.
	   Hashimoto promised that Japan would reform its taxes and
accelerate the implementation of its latest economic stimulus
package.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Parliament completed approval of 4.6 trillion
yen (dlrs 32 billion) in extra spending for the current fiscal year
to help pay for the tax cuts and fresh spending in the 16.65
trillion yen (dlrs 117 billion) stimulus package.
	   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said, ``We welcome
the fact that the United States and Japan acted concertedly in the
exchange markets.''
	   He said he spoke by telephone with U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin Wednesday morning.
	   Matsunaga said a strong and stable yen was ``of vital importance
to Japan, to the recovery of Asian countries affected by financial
market turbulence, and to the entire world economy.''

World Cup: Hiddink prepares to outflank South Korea 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ Dutch coach Guus Hiddink is preparing to outflank
South Korea Saturday, possibly using wide midfielders on both wings
as the Netherlands seeks its first World Cup Group E victory.
	   At training Wednesday, Boudewijn Zenden and Marc Overmars
practiced crossing the ball from the flanks to strikers and
midfielders in front of goal.
	   ``The Koreans are very well organized in the center of defense,
that means that you have to look for gaps elsewhere, for example on
the wings,'' Hiddink told reporters after his team's morning
training session.
	   Although Hiddink refused to reveal his starting lineup for
Saturday's match in Marseille, he appeared to rule out deploying
lanky striker Pierre van Hooijdonk as a target man alongside Dennis
Bergkamp up front.
	   The Nottingham Forest striker is a pinch hitter for the Dutch,
coming off the bench late in games to act as a battering ram to
break open stubborn but weary defenses.
	   ``Pierre has come into the team because he is in great form,''
Hiddink said. ``But he sometimes starts games a bit clumsily. He
seems to need to feel like he is being brought on to save the
fatherland.''
	   Van Hooijdonk, who has four goals in 11 appearances for the
Netherlands, led his English club, Nottingham Forest, to the first
division title this season, scoring 29 times in the league.
	   Hiddink also appeared to be considering using Overmars as his
right midfielder and PSV Eindhoven's Zenden on the left. Although
Overmars is left-footed, he also can deliver crosses from the
right.
	   ``The flanks are where the Koreans leave room. That is where we
can be creative,'' Hiddink said.
	   Midfielder Ronald de Boer sat out Wednesday's training with ice
packs strapped to both knees, but Hiddink said the treatment was
precautionary.
	   ``Ronald is just looking after his knees. He will play,'' the
coach said.
	   Hiddink's only enforced lineup change for the South Korea match
was caused by the two-match suspension handed to Patrick Kluivert
for elbowing Belgian defender Lorenzo Staelens in the chest
Saturday.
	   The Dutch were training in private Wednesday afternoon as
Hiddink began preparing his players for Saturday's match.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's foreign currency reserves
increased by dlrs 40.70 million in the first half of June, raising
the total to dlrs 2.986 billion, the Central Bank said in a report
published Wednesday.
	   The total currency reserves stood at dlrs 2.946 billion at the
end of May, said the report, which was published in the daily
An-Nahar and other newspapers.
	   That brought Lebanon's total foreign exchange reserves, which
include currencies, gold and other assets, to dlrs 5.95 billion, it
added.
	   In October, the Central Bank had reserves of dlrs 6.17 billion
but it had repeatedly intervened since then to defend the pound
against speculators on the exchange markets.
	   The pound remained stable despite the pressure and currently
trades at 1,520 pounds to the dollar.
	   The pressure on the currency was due to a sharp rise in the
state budget deficit, a rise in foreign debt and a slow economic
growth.
	   Deposits in the Central Bank of dlrs 600 million from Saudi
Arabia, dlrs 100 million from Kuwait and dlrs 100 million from the
United Arab Emirates in recent months helped replenish the coffers.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's first semi-independent employment
office will be launched soon to create jobs for Jordanians abroad
and at home, an official said Wednesday.
	   Only public employment offices were allowed to function here
until last February, when the government allowed the private sector
to dip in to bolster efforts against a rampant unemployment,
officially set at 15 percent.
	   Samer Majali, a board member representing the government in the
firm, said the employment office will create a data base with the
names of Jordanians seeking jobs.
	   ``We will find them jobs,'' he told The Associated Press, adding
that the office will act on behalf of job seekers in contacting
public and private firms abroad, especially in the Arab Gulf
region.
	   Majali said the firm, with an envisaged capital of 600,000
dinars (dlrs 845,000) will include investors from Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. They will own 25 percent of
the shares.
	   Jordanian businessmen will own another 25 percent, while the
Jordanian government will get 30 percent. The rest will go to
public Arab shareholders.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A joint Jordan-Syria transport firm made 2
million dinars (dlrs 2.8 million) profits last year because of
increased overland commercial activity between the two neighbors,
the company's director general said Wednesday.
	   Hamdi Habashneh said the profits of the Jordan-Syria Land
Transport Co. were divided equally by the governments of the two
countries, which own 50 percent each of the firm's shares.
	   Habashneh said overland trips between the two countries doubled
to 693,000 last year compared with 1996.
	   The firm, with a capital of dlrs 11.3 million, owns 412 vehicles
that transport goods imported by both countries and to others in
the region through Jordan's Red Sea and Syria's Mediterranean
ports.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Canadian government has agreed to
allow Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national carrier, to resume
its flights to Montreal after a 13-year stoppage, the state-run
National News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   The agency quoted Canadian Foreign Ministry sources as saying
that an initial approval had been given to the resumption of MEA's
weekly flights to Montreal.
	   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien had told Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri during his trip to Ottawa in April last year that his
government welcomed the resumption of MEA flights to Montreal, but
linked it to an agreement between MEA and Canadian airlines, it
said.

Real Madrid hires former player Camacho as coach

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former Real Madrid player Jose Antonio
Camacho returned to the club as coach Wednesday, with pressure on
him to win the Spanish league as well as retain the European title.
	   Camacho takes over from German Jupp Heynckes, who was fired on
May 28 despite guiding the club to the European Champions Cup
title.
	   Financial details of Camacho's two-year contract were not
released.
	   As with anyone who takes over Spain's most famous team, Camacho
will be expected to improve on a season that saw the club finish a
disappointing fourth in the league championship behind archrival FC
Barcelona, Athletic de Bilbao and Real Sociedad.
	   ``As I have been learned in this house, we always go out to
win,'' the 43-year-old Camacho said. ``Real Madrid lives on its
titles so as a coach you know that you have to win as much as
possible.''
	   Camacho, who was a regular on Madrid's first team between 1974 d
1989, becomes the team's third coach in three years. As a player
with Madrid, he won six championships and two UEFA Cup trophies.
	   When he retired as a player in 1989, Camacho became coach of
first division teams Espanyol and Sevilla.
	   Other reported candidates to take over from Heynckes had been
Sven Goran Eriksson, the Swedish coach of the Italian team Lazio;
Morten Olsen of Ajax; Arsene Wenger of Arsenal; and Ivica Osim of
Strum Graz.

Global software piracy cost estimated at dlrs 11.4 billion last year 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Software piracy worldwide cost the industry
U.S. dlrs 11.4 billion last year, up 1.8 percent increase from the
previous year, a group that combats piracy said Wednesday.
	   Six countries, including three in Asia, accounted for nearly 57
percent of the global losses, a study by the Washington-based
Business Software Alliance showed.
	   Piracy in the United States cost software makers worldwide dlrs
2.8 billion, and piracy in China cost them dlrs 1.5 billion in
China, the alliance said.
	   It said the costs amounted to dlrs 752 million in Japan, dlrs
582 million in South Korea, dlrs 509 million in Germany, and dlrs
408 million in France.
	   Asia continued to account for the largest losses to the software
industry, some dlrs 3.9 billion in 1997, up 3 percent increase from
1996, the alliance said.
	   But it said that of total software installed in Asia last year,
the percentage of pirated software dropped 3 percentage points to
52 percent, ``mostly because of increased anti-piracy efforts.''
	   This percentage _ the piracy rate _ was as high as 98 percent in
Vietnam and China and 93 percent in Indonesia, it said.
	   Elsewhere in Asia, it added, the rate was 70 percent in
Malaysia, 69 percent in India, 34 percent in New Zealand, and 32
percent in Japan and Australia.
	   The rate also dropped 3 percentage points globally last year, it
said.
	   Eastern Europe again had the highest piracy rate, although it
decreased from 80 percent to 77 percent in 1997, the alliance said.
	   The rates in Bulgaria, the Commonwealth of Independent States
and Russia were all above 89 percent.
	   Piracy declined in Western Europe, Latin America, the Middle
East and Africa, while in North America it held at 28 percent, the
alliance said.

Cyprus welcomes EU summit outcome, criticizes Clinton 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus described as positive Wednesday
European Union declarations on its entry into the group.
	   ``The EU conclusions relating to Cyprus are positive in that
they reaffirm once again that the accession course of Cyprus will
proceed unhindered without any preconditions,'' government
spokesman Christos Stylianides said.
	   The EU intends to negotiate eventual membership for Cyprus. But
all EU leaders agree that financial reforms are needed before the
trade bloc can include Cyprus and at least five east European
nations to be admitted by 2004.
	   The eastern Mediterranean island has been divided into a Greek
Cypriot controlled south and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974
when Turkey invaded and occupied its northern third in the wake of
an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state established in the north is only recognized
by Turkey which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Turkey and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash oppose Cyprus'
accession to the EU before Turkey, a development unlikely for many
years. They warned that Cyprus' membership will lead to the
parallel integration of north Cyprus with Turkey.

Charles ``Red'' Silva, swimming coach, dies at 87 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Massachusetts (AP) _ Charles ``Red'' Silva, who
coached more than 200 All-America swimmers and an Olympic gold
medal winner during his 41 years at Springfield College, has died.
He was 87.
	   Silva, who died Tuesday, graduated from Springfield in 1934, won
a New England championship and set several U.S. college records. He
coached and taught lifesaving at the college from 1937 until his
retirement in 1978.
	   His teams won 214 meets and 10 New England championships.
	   In 1976, Silva was elected to the International Swimming Hall of
Fame and later served as chairman of its board of directors.
	   Dr. William Yorzyk, who came to Springfield College as a
non-swimmer in 1950, won a gold medal in the butterfly at the 1956
Melbourne Olympics under Silva's tutelage.
	   Silva was also an author and promoter of water safety and
lifesaving skills and was the first to advocate mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation, said Springfield College professor Charles Smith.
	   Silva is survived by two daughters and three grandchildren.

Male model loses sexual discrimination case against case 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 54-year-old nude model who sued a college for
hiring more female models for its art classes lost his sexual
discrimination case Wednesday.
	   George Bond said the industrial tribunal that heard the case
ruled in favor of Northampton College, a school of further
education northwest of London.
	   Bond claimed that two tutors at the school hired female models
more often than him, citing as evidence the 68 hours _ out of a
possible 1,260 _ that he had been employed by the college.
	   The college and the tutors denied all claims of sexism and said
Bond was difficult to work with and unreliable. According to one
tutor, Bond was ``always moaning, complaining about the cold and
going to the toilet.''
	   College bosses also said they were not comfortable employing
Bond because he had appeared in a pornographic film and in a
documentary about the making of a sex film.
	   Bond, who has played bit parts on television and worked as an
ambulance driver, said he is deciding where to go from here.
	   He's also disillusioned with modeling.
	   ``Maybe I'll concentrate on my acting or my sculpture or maybe
just get a normal job to pay the bills,'' he said. ``I'll have to
see. I don't suppose I'll be working for Northampton College again
anyway.''

Ex-prime minister's gesture to far right stirs acrimony 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A conservative former prime minister's call to
discuss national preference with the far right stirred more
infighting Wednesday in a coalition struggling to redefine itself.
	   Edouard Balladur called in a weekend interview for a commission
to debate what job or subsidy preferences to give French nationals
over foreigners, and he said the National Front could participate.
	   The move was seen as another gesture to attract disenfranchised
voters, who turned to the anti-immigrant National Front in spring
elections and triggered battles within the conservative mainstream.
	   While welcomed by the National Front's No. 2 leader Bernard
Megret as more evidence it was gaining influence, Balladur drew
fire from a number of leading conservatives.
	   Liberal Democracy leader Alain Madelin on Wednesday supported
``a debate on all questions ... without the need for a
commission.'' He said he opposed ``national preference.''
	   On Tuesday the head of President Jacques Chirac's Rally for the
Republic slapped down Balladur's call. Philippe Seguin said it was
among ``false debates that elude the real problems and result in
passionate and sterile conflicts.''
	   But RPR spokesman Francois Fillon on Wednesday denounced what he
called ``the witchhunt against Edouard Balladur.
	   ``He didn't say he was for national preference, but he wanted to
open a debate on the subject,'' the lawmaker told Europe 1 radio.
	   Fillon said he believed Balladur ``wanted to open a debate on
the situation in Europe,'' since he said immigration problems in
France result from lax enforcement across the European Union.
	   The Front, led by former paratrooper Jean-Marie Le Pen, won up
to a third of the vote in some local elections last March. It
attracted voters fed up with double-digit unemployment and rising
urban crime often linked to poor immigrant youths.
	   A war of conservative chieftains broke out after some local
leaders accepted Front support to hold on to power. The right lost
parliamentary elections a year ago after refusing to ally with the
Front, and its next ballot test is the Europarliament election next
spring.
	   Balladur drew a widespread barrage from the governing left led
by Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who has undermined

economy.
	   Pierre Moscovici, a vice minister for European affairs, said
Balladur committed ``a heavy political error'' by putting
immigration ``at the center of French politics.''

World Cup: Yugoslav star to miss Germany match With Sports-Soccer-Yugoslavia 
</HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-GALMIER, France (AP) _ Dejan Savicevic, Yugoslavia's star
midfielder, will miss the World Cup match against chief rivals
Germany, the Yugoslav coach said Wednesday.
	   ``In the best case, Savicevic will play against the United
States,'' Slobodan Santrac told the Associated Press.
	   Germany and Yugoslavia, the favorites in Group F with three
points each, will play next Sunday in Lens. The other teams in the
group, the United States and Iran with no points so far, will face
each other the same day in Lyon.
	   Yugoslavia meets the United States in the last group match on
June 25 in Nantes.
	   A controversy about whether Savicevic, considered the architect
of Yugoslav play and the team's spiritual leader, is fit enough to
play at the World Cup has hampered team preparations.
	   The 31-year-old Savicevic, who has missed Yugoslavia's 1-0 World
Cup opener against Iran and most of its warmup matches, has said he
feels pains in his right knee ligaments.
	   The team officials clam is Savicevic's pain is only
``psychological'' and is triggered by his fear after a series of
injuries the AC Milan star suffered over the past year while
playing in the Italian league.
	   ``Savicevic is training, but he has not been playing matches for
the past two months,'' Santrac said. ``We need completely fit
players for our game against Germany.''
	   Savicevic's place in the midfield will likely be taken by rising
star Dejan Stankovic, 19, who said he doesn't fear ``the mighty
Germans.''

EDS: ADDS detail, reports that government officials asking Gomez to
By JAIRO ANCHIQUE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA TUR DU PIN, France (AP) _ Mercurial forward Faustino Asprilla
was dismissed from the Colombian World Cup side for the rest of the
tournament on Wednesday, his punishment for publicly criticizing
coach Hernan Dario Gomez.
	   ``He took himself out of the team with his behavior,'' Gomez
said.
	   Asprilla, who plays for Italy's Parma, did not participate in
the morning training session.
	   Gomez said he took his drastic decision because Asprilla ``broke
the rules we had established'' when he criticized the coach and
some teammates in a radio interview.
	   Asprilla claimed Gomez had a group of ``preferred'' players and
that he ``disrespected'' him when he took him out of the Colombia's
1-0 loss to Romania on Monday with five minutes remaining.
	   Gomez had warned Tuesday that he might take a dramatic action.
	   ``I can't let this go by. If he is so upset, he should go. I
won't let him disrupt the team,'' he said.
	   Colombian players were given Tuesday off and most used it to
visit Paris. Reached there by a radio reporter, Asprilla said that
there were ``untouchable'' players on the field who were not
substituted, regardless of their performance.
	   ``There are players whose performance was worse than mine
yerderday, and were never taken out of a game. And I was
substituted with five minutes remanining. It seems to me a show of
disrespect,'' Asprilla complained to radio Caracol.
	   Asprilla was replaced by Leider Preciado, a young striker with
little international experience.
	   Gomez felt no need to explain his actions.
	   ``Everybody saw (the game) on TV. I don't have much to add,'' he
said.
	   Gomez claimed Asprilla had no right to complain that he
preferred some players since ``the most preferred player has been
him.''
	   Asprilla almost took himself out of the World Cup before the
start because he didn't feel fit. A few weeks before the opening
kickoff he was still recovering from a groin injury that had him
out of action for almost six months.
	   Gomez waited for him until the very last minute and said he was
ready to take Asprilla to France ``even if he played on one leg,''
since he considered him a player who can make a difference.
	   The coach also said that Asprilla should emulate other World Cup
stars that ``run and sweat on the field, and don't talk off the
field.''
	   Asprilla returned to Parma this year, after a couple of seasons
with England's Newcastle. During his stay in Newcastle, he scored
three goals in one game in a European Champions League game.
	   Asprilla didn't comment on the situation Wednesday.
	   The Colombian camp was rife with rumors that top government
officials, including president Ernesto Samper, were asking Gomez to
reconsider his decision.

Two more top Romanian politicians admit working for the Securitate 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's health minister and another
leading politician both admitted Wednesday they had worked for the
oppressive Securitate communist secret police.
	   Health Minister Francisc Baranyi, 63, said he was prepared to
resign.
	   Baranyi, an ethnic Hungarian, said he had been forced to make a
``commitment'' to the feared secret police in 1961. However, he
said he never harmed anyone.
	   ``If the prime minister deems it necessary, I will resign,''
Baranyi was quoted as saying by the national news agency Rompres.
	   ``I was forced with a weapon to sign and I don't consider myself
an agent because I never informed on anyone,'' said Baranyi.
	   He gave no further details. At the time he had just finished his
medical studies in the Transylvanian city of Targu Mures.
	   Another politician, the deputy head of parliament's lower house,
the Chamber of Deputies, issued a statement Wednesday saying he,
too, had worked with the Securitate.
	   Vasile Lupu, who also is deputy head of the National Peasant
Party, the main party in the ruling coalition, said he was forced
to work for the secret police because he was accused of having
relations with foreign organizations _ the French and English
libraries in Bucharest.
	   The latest admissions come just after another leading
politician, Adrian Vliau, was exposed as a Securitate informer.
Vilau's Democratic Party banned him from heading a parliamentary
commission on foreign intelligence, accusing him of covering up his
past.
	   Although one in four of the adult population was believed to
have collaborated with the Securitate, almost nobody has come clean
since 1989 when communism fell, leading to a society still haunted
by mistrust and rumor.
	   Before 1989, Baranyi worked as a doctor in the western city of
Timisoara. Dictator Nicholae Ceausescu was known to be especially
suspicious of any ethnic minority, including Romania's 1.6 million
ethnic Hungarians.

Arab lawmaker causes uproar by blasting Israeli anthem, flag 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a heated moment in Israel's parliament
Wednesday, an Arab lawmaker drew anger from the house when he
proposed changing the country's Star of David flag and the national
anthem because they exclude the country's Arab minority, he said.
	   Taleb a-Sanna's motion to alter the national symbols and
possibly add a Muslim crescent and Christian cross to the flag,
failed to pass.
	   But his comments struck at the heart of Israel's complex desire
to maintain both a Jewish state and a democracy even though
one-fifth of the population are Arab.
	   Dedi Zukker of the liberal Meretz party, which helped defeat the
motion 53-7, described a-Sanna's speech as ``provocative, almost
insulting and challenging.'' Zukker said that ``even on the far
Israeli left, there is consensus that Israel's national character
is that of a Jewish state.''
	   But a-Sanna said Arabs could not relate to national Jewish
symbols, especially the anthem Hatikva, or The Hope, which
describes the longing of the Jewish soul for a national homeland.
	   ``Where is the Arab soul? We want simple symbols that represent
the common ground between us and become factors of unity instead of
discord,'' a-Sanna argued.
	   Israel was established 50 years ago on the heels of the Nazi
Holocaust as a homeland for Jews. During its war for independence,
more than 750,000 Arabs fled the area, but the 250,000 who remained
obtained citizenship. Today they and their descendants number close
to one million, making up one-fifth of the population.
	   ``We want this state to be a democracy, a state for all of its
citizens, and that means Arabs and Jews. Arabs should not be
excluded,'' a-Sanna argued.
	   A-Sanna and Zukker agreed however that symbols should not be
forced on people. Both men plan to oppose a motion up for debate
next week on a proposal to put the Israeli flag on license plates.

German foreign minister wants to send observers to Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on
Wednesday called for international monitors in Kosovo province to
check whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic keeps a promise
to stop military action against civilians there.
	   Kinkel also welcomed Milosevic's pledge after talks in Moscow
Tuesday to negotiate with the moderate leader of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians.
	   Kinkel, however, sounded a note of caution, saying that the
international community would watch carefully to ensure that
Milosevic follows through. The Yugoslav government should be judged
``not by their words, but by their deeds,'' Kinkel said in a
statement.
	   Kinkel called on the five other nations monitoring former
Yugoslavia to send observers to Kosovo, the separatist province
where more than 300 people have been killed since March in a
Serb-led army and police crackdown.
	   Kinkel said said additional personnel would be assigned to the
German embassy in Belgrade for an eventual observer force.
	   The Foreign Ministry statement said Kinkel and his Russian
counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, agreed in a telephone conversation
Wednesday that Milosevic did not meet all of the international
community's demands during the talks in Moscow.
	   Both foreign ministers were concerned that Milosevic did not
agree to withdraw Serbian security forces from the province, the
Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   A negotiated solution will only be found ``when the escalating
violence has come to an end, and that goes also for the Kosovo
Albanians themselves, and when the expulsion of Albanians is
halted,'' Kinkel said.

Russia's embalmers offer to preserve Castro 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Soviet era was kind to Russia's embalmers,
offering a steady stream of communist dignitaries to preserve for
posterity.
	   Today, like other Russian scientists, the experts from the Lenin
Mausoleum laboratory are starved of cash and clients. So a recent
news report suggesting that Cuban officials were investigating the
possibility of erecting a mausoleum to Fidel Castro has raised
spirits at the lab, according to a report Wednesday by the Interfax
news agency.
	   ``We are ready to meet a possible request by Cubans that
Castro's body be preserved if they contact us,'' Interfax quoted
top embalmer Yuri Denisov-Nikolsky as saying.
	   ``Our employees have an immense expertise in embalming.''
	   Last week, the Sunday Times of London reported that Cuban
officials were considering a plan to display Castro on Havana's
Revolution Square after his death.
	   The Cubans have not contacted the experts from the former
laboratory attached to the Lenin Museum, who have regrouped as the
Russian Institute of Medicinal Herbs, Interfax said.
	   But the reaction to the news report reflects the laboratory's
desperate desire for work.
	   Interfax said that the laboratory that had worked to preserve
such communist luminaries as Josef Stalin and leaders of Bulgaria,
Mongolia, Czechoslovakia and other onetime Soviet satellites was
now reduced to embalming wealthy ``new Russians,'' who had been
killed in contract killings or auto accidents, to keep itself
solvent.

Albanian negotiator dismisses Milosevic's pledge to talk Kosovo border area; aid convoy gets to Djakovica.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in
Kosovo on Wednesday dismissed President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge
to negotiate, saying his powerful forces must halt all actions and
leave the province before any talks can start.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the four-man Kosovo Albanian team named to
negotiate with the Serbs, spoke after Milosevic promised Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to reopen talks with the moderate
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``What was announced in Moscow is no news, because the problem
is not whether there will be any talks with the Albanians, but the
conditions in which talks should be held,'' chief negotiator Agani
told the Associated Press.
	   ``Two important conditions set by the international community
... have not been fulfilled. And meaningful talks depend on them,''
Agani added. ``Therefore, at this moment, we cannot say whether
there will be any talks.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen stressed Tuesday that while some progress was made in
Moscow, Milosevic failed to meet the key condition _ withdrawal of
his forces from Kosovo.
	   Milosevic promised free access for international monitors and
aid groups to western Kosovo. He said no repressive actions would
be carried out against civilians, but ruled out the withdrawal of
the Yugoslav army _ which guards the border with Albania _ and said
police presence would be reduced only when attacks by Albanian
militants cease.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March.
	   On Monday, NATO, in a show of force, sent warplanes over the
Adriatic Sea and Albania and Macedonia to reinforce the demand that
Milosevic pull back in Kosovo.
	   The Clinton administration said it will keep warships and jets
ready, should NATO decide on military action.
	   Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova met in May,
following U.S. mediation, but the Albanians canceled further talks
until Serb government troops halted their reported attacks.
	   The Serbs say they are battling the militant Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army, which wants to secede Kosovo from Serbia and
Yugoslavia by force. The clashes have driven some 60,000 people
from their homes, most within Kosovo. Others have fled to Albania
or the neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   On Tuesday, some refugees said that Serb police had attacked
makeshift refugee camps near the border with Albania, targeting
them from helicopters and killing two refugees. The reports could
not be independently confirmed.
	   In another incident late Tuesday, snipers shot and killed one
Albanian and two pack mules on the border, in an apparent message
from the Yugoslav army to arms smugglers not to risk crossing the
frontier with arms for Albanian militants.
	   Reports from both the pro-government Serb Media Center and the
Kosovo Albanians' Information Center suggested there was fighting
Wednesday south of Pristina, along the road that links it to the
market town of Prizren close to the Albanian border.
	   The U.N. refugee agency sent its first aid to the western Kosovo
town of Djakovica, in an area that reportedly has come under
sustained Serbian assault in the past three weeks as Yugoslav
forces reassert control over the border with Albania and adjoining
areas, trying to choke off arms supplies to the militants.
	   Serb sources said a 55-year-old Serb from central Kosovo has
been kidnapped by the KLA. Serbs have reported kidnappings before,
claiming the KLA have set up camps for Serbs. Albanians say about
200 of their kin are missing and held by the Serbs.
	   The KLA are responsible for dozens of killings of Serb policemen
and pro-Serb ethnic Albanians since 1996.
	   Most Kosovo Albanians, who make up over 90 percent of the
province's population, are seeking independence from Serbia which
rules it with heavy hand. Rugova, an advocate of peaceful
resistance, has recently been losing ground to the militant KLA.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ German chancellor candidate Gerhard
Schroeder assured Polish leaders Wednesday that he considers Poland
an important ally and foresees no major change in relations with
Warsaw should he win September elections.
	   ``We view good German-Polish relations as an important element
of the process of European integration,'' Schroeder told reporters
after talks and lunch with President Aleksander Kwasniewski.
	   Political change in Bonn would not erode German support for
Poland's aspirations to join NATO and the European Union, Schroeder
said.
	   Poland's membership in NATO ``is no problem and it will
certainly take place in 1999,'' he added.
	   While supporting Poland's entry into the EU, Schroeder also told
leaders that it would not mean immediate access to the German labor
market.
	   Schroeder said Kwasniewski agreed with him that a free flow of
Polish workers ``would require transitional periods.''
	   Schroeder argues that allowing workers to enter Germany from
Poland and other new EU members would diminish support in Germany
for EU expansion. He has said that these countries will have to
improve pay and living standards before gaining free access to the
German labor market.
	   Germany, Poland's largest trading partner, is seen here as a
major advocate of Poland's EU membership.
	   The one-day visit is Schroeder's third trip abroad since he won
the Social Democrats' nomination to challenge Chancellor Helmut
Kohl. He earlier visited Israel and Lebanon, then France.
	   In Warsaw, Schroeder also met Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz as well as Solidarity chairman
Marian Krzaklewski and opposition leader, Leszek Miller, the head
of Poland's ex-communist Social Democracy party.
	   The visit, seven years on Wednesday after Poland and Germany
signed a landmark friendship treaty that ended decades of tense
relations troubled by the legacy of World War II, was seen as
Schroeder's effort to establish personal ties with Polish political
leaders.

Ex-prime minister's gesture to far right stirs acrimony Bernard Megret 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with interior minister comment; CORRECTS to Bruno sted
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A conservative former prime minister's call to
discuss national preference with the far right stirred more
infighting Wednesday in a coalition struggling to redefine itself.
	   Edouard Balladur called in a weekend interview for a commission
to debate what job or subsidy preferences to give French nationals
over foreigners, and he said the National Front could participate.
	   The move was seen as another gesture to attract disenfranchised
voters, who turned to the anti-immigrant National Front in spring
elections and triggered battles within the conservative mainstream.
	   While welcomed by the National Front's No. 2 leader Bruno Megret
as more evidence it was gaining influence, Balladur drew fire from
a number of leading conservatives.
	   Liberal Democracy leader Alain Madelin on Wednesday supported
``a debate on all questions ... without the need for a
commission.'' He said he opposed ``national preference.''
	   On Tuesday the head of President Jacques Chirac's Rally for the
Republic slapped down Balladur's call. Philippe Seguin said it was
among ``false debates that elude the real problems and result in
passionate and sterile conflicts.''
	   But RPR spokesman Francois Fillon on Wednesday denounced what he
called ``the witchhunt against Edouard Balladur.
	   ``He didn't say he was for national preference, but he wanted to
open a debate on the subject,'' the lawmaker told Europe 1 radio.
	   Fillon said he believed Balladur ``wanted to open a debate on
the situation in Europe,'' since he said immigration problems in
France result from lax enforcement across the European Union.
	   The Front, led by former paratrooper Jean-Marie Le Pen, won up
to a third of the vote in some local elections last March. It
attracted voters fed up with double-digit unemployment and rising
urban crime often linked to poor immigrant youths.
	   A war of conservative chieftains broke out after some local
leaders accepted Front support to hold on to power. The right lost
parliamentary elections a year ago after refusing to ally with the
Front, and its next ballot test is the Europarliament election next
spring.
	   Balladur drew a widespread barrage from the governing left led
by Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who has undermined
conservatives by pursuing moderate policies on immigration and the
economy.
	   ``A legal foreigner has the same rights as a French citizen, and
he pays his social security taxes,'' said Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement. ``Balladur's remarks were more than a
wink. It's a hand extended to the National Front.''

Rwandan rebels attack camp for displaced; at least seven dead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed at least seven people
and wounded four, all Tutsis, in a pre-dawn attack Tuesday on a
camp for displaced people, officials said.
	   About 50 Hutu rebels, armed with machine-guns and machetes,
attacked from hills surrounding the camp at Nkamira, 100 kilometers
(60 miles) northwest of Kigali, which houses hundreds of minority
Tutsis who have fled the region's violence, the officials said on
condition of anonymity.
	   No other details were immediately available.
	   The rebels are former soldiers or militiamen who fled the
country in 1994. The army and militias were behind the slaughter of
more than 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   The three-month slaughter ended when Tutsi-led fighters won
power in July 1994.
	   Authorities say the rebels have killed thousands since 1996,
when the Hutu militiamen slipped back into the country mixed along
with more than 1 million Hutu refugees.

Presidents of Ukraine and Guinea meet, agree to increase trade 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine agreed Wednesday to increase
bauxite imports from the West African country of Guinea from dlrs
28 million a year to dlrs 40 million.
	   President Leonid Kuchma told visiting Guinean President Lansan
Conte that Ukraine might also buy shares of Guinea's
bauxite-producing plants, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Bauxite is used in making aluminum and building materials in
Ukraine.
	   Kuchma said Ukraine is also interested in helping Guinea build a
railway, possibly by supplying rails and other materials, according
to his spokesman, Olexander Maidannik.
	   Conte said his country could be interested in shipbuilding at
Ukraine's Mykolaiv plant.
	   The Guinean president plans to travel to Mykolaiv on Thursday
after meeting with other government and parliament officials. He
arrived in Ukraine Tuesday night and leaves Friday for Abu Dhabi.
	   Ukrainian media said Kiev was prepared to help Guinea modernize
the country's Soviet-made T-54 tanks. The last of the tanks were
supplied by the former Soviet Union in 1984 and now are only 40
percent operational, said Ukraine's Ambassador to Guinea, Valery
Pivovarov.

Sampras, Hingis are bookies' favorites 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Defending champions Pete Sampras and Martina
Hingis are solid favorites with British bookmakers to retain their
Wimbledon singles titles.
	   William Hill rates Sampras at 6-4, while Ladbrokes lists him at
11-8.
	   The second men's favorite is 1996 champion Richard Krajicek, who
is 7-1 with Ladbrokes and 8-1 with William Hill. Australia's
Patrick Rafter is rated next at 16-1 by both bookmakers.
	   Sharing the odds with Rafter on the William Hill list is 1992
champion Andre Agassi.
	   Chile's Marcelo Rios, the tournament's No. 2 seed, is 25-1 with
William Hill but not rated among the top 10 favorites by Ladbrokes.
	   William Hill is offering odds of 10-1 for a British player to
win the men's singles, with No. 4 Greg Rusedski at 12-1 and No.12
Tim Henman at 33-1.
	   In the women's singles, Ladbrokes lists Martina Hingis as 6-5
favorite ahead of Monica Seles and Steffi Graf, both at 9-2.
	   William Hill is offering odds of 8-11 for Hingis, 6-1 for Seles
and 10-1 for Graf.
	   Venus Williams is 10-1, with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario 14-1. The
tournament's No. 2 seed, Lindsay Davenport, is rated a 20-1 chance
along with Anna Kournikova and Conchita Martinez.

World Cup: South Korea recovering from stinging defeat to Mexico 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES thruout, recasts with Wednesday's training
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT QUENTIN, France (AP) _ South Korea's players appeared to
have recovered from their stinging 3-1 World Cup defeat to Mexico,
laughing and horsing around in a lively training session on
Wednesday.
	   Shrieking in delight during a pass-the-ball relay _ over their
heads, between the legs, around their backs _ the South Korean
players put the loss behind them and are looking forward to their
next challenge against the Netherlands in Marseille on Saturday.
	   ``We had a tough training session yesterday and I wanted the
players to recover from that,'' said coach Cha Bum-kun. ``I also
wanted them to get over their defeat to Mexico, which hit them very
hard.
	   ``I'm working to prepare them mentally, getting them to relax a
bit. So I included a bit of fun during training.''
	   For South Korea mental preparation will be just as important as
the physical groundwork for its match against the mighty Dutch.
	   ``My duty is getting the players as confident as possible,''
said Cha. ``Without confidence we're nothing. We're in a very
difficult situation and under enormous pressure.''
	   The Netherlands, one of the top contenders for the title, will
likely be South Korea's toughest rival in Group E, which also
includes Belgium.
	   But Cha remains undaunted.
	   ``The Dutch are a worldclass team,'' said Cha. ``But no one
knows beforehand what the outcome will be. Even the weakest team
can win.''
	   Apart from recovering from Saturday's bitter blow, South Korea
is also recuperating from the string of injuries that damaged its
opening bid.
	   ``Hwang (Sun-hong) couldn't play due to his injured knee,''
started Cha. ``Choi Sung-yong wasn't quite over his twisted ankle,
Seo Jung-won was recovering from chicken pox and Lee Sang-hun
fainted during training after being hit in the head with a ball.''
	   ``To top it all, Ha (Seok-ju) was sent off with a red card for
back-tackling a Mexican,'' summarized Cha. ``It was the worst
experience I've had (since) I've been coach.''
	   Hwang, one of South Korea's most prolific scorers, will also
have to skip the game against the Netherlands. He is expected to
play against Belgium on June 25.
	   The good news is that midfielder Choi Sung-yong, who hurt his
right ankle during training last week, will be able to start
against the talented Dutch.
	   Another blessing for South Korea is the return of the fast and
wily Seo, who was sick with chiken pox before coming to France.
	   Cha announced several changes to the next starting lineup.
	   South Korea's top-scorer Choi Yong-soo will replace Kim Do-hoon
up front. Kim will step back and flank Choi instead.

Former leader thanks Nigeria's new ruler after jail release 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Looking thin but exuberant, former
Nigerian state leader Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo greeted hundreds of
well-wishers on Wednesday just hours after being released from
prison by the country's latest military ruler.
	   Speaking to reporters and supporters outside his farmhouse in
Abeokuta, near Lagos, Obasanjo publicly thanked Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar for his freedom.
	   ``I thank the new head of state and all those whom were used by
God to effect my release,'' Obasanjo said. ``Indeed I am very
grateful to God.''
	   Abubakar announced the release of nine political prisoners
including Obasanjo on Monday, thus distancing himself from his
predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha, whose regime issued Obasanjo with a
15-year treason sentence in 1995.
	   Obasanjo, 62, voluntarily relinquished his presidency after an
election in 1979 and went on to become a formidable critic of
Abacha's regime.
	   He was released on compassionated grounds and it was clear that
imprisonment had caused the once-hefty man to lose a large amount
of weight.
	   Two of the other prisoners _ activist Beko Ransome-Kuti and
lawyer Olabintan Durojaiye _ were known to have returned home by
Tuesday afternoon. The others were being held in far-flung prisons
across this sprawling West African country and their immediate
status was unclear.

Sheik Mohammed Mutwali Sharawi of Egypt, died Wednesday, his family
said. He was 87.
	   Egypt's leading Islamic authority, the Grand Sheik of Al-Azhar,
Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, described Sharawi's death as a great loss
not only to Egypt, but to the whole Islamic world.
	   ``Time rarely gives birth to such a glorious imam who devoted
his life to making the word of God esteemed,'' Tantawi said in a
statement.

to Islam and enriched Muslims with his wide knowledge of the
correct teachings of Islam.''

Albanian negotiator dismisses Milosevic's pledge to talk Kosovo border area; aid convoy gets to Djakovica. No pickup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with reports of fighting, army reasserting control of
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in
Kosovo on Wednesday dismissed President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge
to negotiate, saying his powerful forces must halt all actions and
leave the separatist province before any talks can start.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the four-man Kosovo Albanian team named to
negotiate with the Serbs, spoke after Milosevic promised Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to reopen talks with the moderate
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``What was announced in Moscow is no news, because the problem
is not whether there will be any talks with the Albanians, but the
conditions in which talks should be held,'' Agani told The
Associated Press.
	   ``Two important conditions set by the international community
... have not been fulfilled. And meaningful talks depend on them,''
Agani said. ``Therefore, at this moment, we cannot say whether
there will be any talks.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen stressed Tuesday that while some progress was made in
Moscow, Milosevic failed to meet the key condition _ withdrawal of
his forces.
	   Milosevic promised free access for international monitors and
aid groups to western Kosovo. He said no repressive actions would
be carried out against civilians, but ruled out the withdrawal of
the Yugoslav army _ which guards the border with Albania _ and said
police presence would be reduced only when attacks by Albanian
militants cease.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March.
	   On Monday, NATO, in a show of force, sent warplanes over the
Adriatic Sea and Albania and Macedonia to reinforce the demand that
Milosevic pull back in Kosovo. The Clinton administration said it
will keep warships and jets ready, should NATO decide on military
action.
	   Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova met in May,
following U.S. mediation, but the Albanians canceled further talks
until Serb government troops halted their reported attacks.
	   The Serbs say they are battling the militant Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army, which wants to secede Kosovo from Serbia and
Yugoslavia by force. The clashes have driven some 60,000 people
from their homes, most within Kosovo. Others have fled to Albania
or the neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   On Tuesday, some refugees said Serb police attacked makeshift
refugee camps near Albanian border, targeting them from helicopters
and killing two refugees. The reports could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Also Tuesday, snipers shot and killed one Albanian and two pack
mules on the border, in an apparent message from the Yugoslav army
to arms smugglers not to risk crossing the frontier with arms for
Albanian militants.
	   Reports from the pro-government Serb Media Center and the Kosovo
Albanians' Information Center suggested there was fighting
Wednesday south of the provincial capital of Pristina.
	   The United Nations refugee agency sent its first aid to the
western Kosovo town of Djakovica, in an area that reportedly has
come under sustained Serbian assault in the past three weeks as
Yugoslav forces reassert control over the border with Albania and
adjoining areas, trying to choke off arms supplies to the
militants.
	   Serb sources said the KLA kidnapped a 55-year-old Serb from
central Kosovo. Serbs have reported kidnappings before, claiming
the KLA have set up camps for Serbs. Albanians say about 200 of
their kin are missing and held by the Serbs.
	   The KLA are responsible for dozens of killings of Serb policemen
and pro-Serb ethnic Albanians since 1996.
	   Most Kosovo Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of the
province's population, are seeking independence from Serbia which
rules it with heavy hand. Rugova, an advocate of peaceful
resistance, has recently been losing ground to the KLA.

UEFA discusses cup `wild cards' for former European champions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ A proposal to introduce ``wild cards''
that would allow former Champions League winners entry to the UEFA
Cup has been discussed, European football's governing body said
Wednesday.
	   Italy's AC Milan and Germany's Borussia Dortmund, neither of
which have qualified for next season's European club competitions,
likely would receive a place in the 1998/99 UEFA Cup if the
proposal is approved.
	   The bureau of UEFA's Club Competitions Committee reached no
decision on the proposal during a meeting in Paris, UEFA said in a
statement.
	   UEFA's Executive Committee will decide whether to accept the
plan when it meets in Paris next month, the statement added.
	   Only clubs which have won the Champions League within the five
preceding seasons would be allocated a ``wild card,'' UEFA said.
	   The offer would be available only once in a five-year period.
	   ``This would reward any club that has made an outstanding
contribution to European soccer but which hasn't qualified for any
of the three UEFA club competitions,'' said Senes Erzik, who chairs
the Club Competitions Committee.
	   AC Milan won the Champions League in 1994. Borussia Dortmund,
which this year lost to Real Madrid at the semifinal stage, won in
1997.

First non-Serb to hold office in Srpska expects better times 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The first non-Serb to hold
national office in the Bosnian Serb republic was quoted as saying
Thursday that ``better days'' can come with the moderate government
which took power last winter.
	   Safet Bico, a Muslim, was elected a deputy speaker of the
Bosnian Serb parliament Wednesday after supporters of a pro-Western
course unseated his hardline predecessor and the speaker of
parliament, a Serb nationalist supporter of Bosnian Serb wartime
leader Radovan Karadzic.
	   The hardliners boycotted Wednesday's election of Bico and Petar
Djokic, a Serb, as speaker.
	   Parliament acted at the urging of the top international official
in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, who had reminded them of a pledge to
unseat the hard speaker, made in January when the moderate Milorad
Dodik was installed as Bosnian Serb prime minister.
	   The advent of a more moderate government in the Serb-ruled half
of Bosnia has freed up foreign aid denied the Bosnian Serbs under
their previous government, loyal to Karadzic.
	   Bico welcomed his election as a ``normal step,'' although he
said he could not take his oath of office on a Bible _ a measure
installed as procedure for all legislators by the strongly Serb
Orthodox parliament.
	   ``Life here could be much better,'' Bico told the Banja Luka
daily Vecernje Novosti Thursday. ``People have reason to expect
better days with the government of Milorad Dodik.''
	   A 45-year-old physician, Bico spent the 1992-95 Bosnian war
working in field hospitals and received a high Bosnian award for
his work.

Arrests made in ticket scandal, threats made to disrupt US-Iran game with Wednesday night's games AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW throughout with Wednesday's developments; WILL be UPDATED
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Street violence, ticket fraud and now political
protests. The World Cup can't seem to get away from the real world.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said Wednesday that Iranian exile
groups threatened to demonstrate against the Tehran government at
Sunday's politically charged World Cup match between the United
States and Iran in Lyon.
	   ``We have received more-or-less anonymous letters from groups of
exiled Iranians who say they will do something to disrupt the match
to show what is going on in their country,'' Blatter said.
	   He declined to identify the groups or say if any specific type
of action was threatened. He also said he was certain police and
security forces would be able to deal with any problems.
	   The Iranian team is already upset with a French television
network for Monday night's broadcast of an unflattering U.S. film
about Iran on French TV.
	   In Wednesday's games, Chile played Austria in Saint-Etienne, and
Italy faced Cameroon in Montpellier.
	   Meanwhile, police sources said the first arrests had been made
in the international scandal that left thousands of fans without
World Cup tickets that had been paid for.
	   French authorities arrested three people, including a consultant
for a subsidiary of FIFA's exclusive marketing partner, ISL Ltd.,
the sources said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. A large
amount of cash and about 100 Cup tickets were found, the sources
said, and more arrests were expected.
	   All this came the morning after a dazzling performance by
defending-champion Brazil _ a 3-0 victory over Morocco _ which
seemed to a perfect panacea to a week flush with hooligan violence
and griping teams.
	   One of the loudest gripers was Faustino Asprilla, who went on
radio and criticized Colombian coach Hernan Dario Gomez. Asprilla
claimed Gomez had ``disrespected'' him when he took him out of
Monday's game against Romania five minutes from the end.
	   On Wednesday, Gomez promptly removed the star midfielder from
his plans.
	   ``He took himself out of the team with his behavior,'' Gomez
said.
	   In Toulouse, French police are bracing for another round of fan
violence as English supporters make their way to the site of
England's next game, against Romania on Monday.
	   In Marseille, where three days of violence surrounded England's
2-0 victory over Tunisia on Monday, the courts continued to deal
swiftly with arrested hooligans, convicting two Germans and three
more English fans.
	   Judges ordered two- and four-month jail terms for the three
English fans, after three others were convicted Monday. The two
Germans received three-month sentences, France Info radio reported.
	   More than 100 people remained jailed in Marseille, and officials
said about 30 of them would be kept behind bars until the World Cup
ends July 12.
	   About 1,000 English fans are already reported in Toulouse, where
officials have postponed a weekend music festival. Officials are
also considered closing bars early and forgoing large TV screens
like the one on a Marseille beach where ticketless English fans and
local youths fought Monday afternoon.
	   While saying he was ``saddened'' by the violence, Blatter said
he hoped it would not take on ``too much importance.''
	   ``It's impossible to make a kind of ghetto out of each city
before each soccer match,'' Blatter said. ``I'm convinced that from
today, we won't have that hooligan problem anymore.''
	   The Iranian team was upset over a telecast of ``Not Without My
Daughter,'' which stars Sally Field and portrays Iranians as dirty,
boorish, cruel and obsessed with their Islamic religion and its
attitudes toward women. It was screened on France's privately owned
channel M6.
	   ``Out of 365 days in a year, why was this film shown now?'' said
star striker Khodadad Azizi. ``I think that the showing was not
without reason, and it has hurt morale.''

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ One of the Muslim world's leading clerics,
Sheik Mohammed Mutwali Sharawi of Egypt, died early Wednesday, his
family said. He was 87.

Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1976-78, died at his home near
the pyramids of Giza, his family said.

was admitted to hospital after a severe bout of asthma.

Japan prime minister welcomes currency cooperation 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with additional comment, ADDS background
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto expressed delight
at U.S. help in currency markets Wednesday to support Japan's
sinking yen, and pledged quick moves to rescue the Japanese economy
to avoid harm to other nations.
	   Hashimoto said he and President Bill Clinton had consulted by
telephone earlier Wednesday, and that Japan realized a revival of
its economy was ``urgently needed.''
	   ``The president and I are delighted to see that the United
States and Japan have cooperated in exchange markets to support a
strong, stable yen,'' he said in a statement.
	   Asian nations, suffering from a yearlong financial crisis, had
criticized Japan recently for adding to their problems by not
putting its own economic house in order.
	   This week, the newspaper of China's central bank accused both
the United States and Japan of allowing ``the yen to depreciate
without making any efforts'' to stabilize it.
	   Malaysian Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Japan was
spreading gloom by ``foot-dragging'' with economic repairs.
	   A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said the joint
yen-support moves in exchange markets were made Wednesday because
the United States and Japan agreed that the timing was appropriate.
	   Briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, the official said
the intervention didn't necessarily indicate that the United States
had abandoned its strong dollar policy. But, he said, Washington
has agreed ``that a strong yen is also necessary for Asia and the
world economy.''
	   The dollar had climbed 15 yen against the Japanese currency
since the end of April, including 6 yen in the four trading days up
to Monday, when it soared to an eight-year high above 146 yen.
	   It had edged down to 142 yen in late Tokyo trading Wednesday as
the market grew wary about possible intervention by monetary
authorities.
	   Still, ``it was a surprise,'' said Kengo Ikeda, a Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank trader. ``We were expecting that the action, if there
was going to be one at all, would come Thursday evening, when (U.S.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence) Summers will be here.''
	   The joint action was much more effective than what the Bank of
Japan alone could have done, he said.
	   It quickly sent the dollar down to around 138 yen.
	   ``I think the action reflected the fact that the United States
took it seriously that the recent pace of the dollar's climb was
too much,'' Ikeda said. ``Now I wonder what Mr. Summers is going to
do here.''
	   Japan's problems stem from the collapse of a speculative
``bubble'' in the late 1980s, when easy credit sent stock and land
prices soaring.
	   In its wake came a mound of bad loans, a pinch on new funds for
Japanese business, growing unemployment and a gloom that led
consumers to tighten their purse strings _ just the opposite of
what Japan's trading partners thought they should be doing to help
revive the economy.
	   The weak yen made Japanese goods abroad cheaper, undercutting
rivals from other nations and leading to criticism that Japan was
trying to export its way out of trouble.
	   Hashimoto said, ``We will make every effort to restore its
banking system to health, to achieve domestic demand-led growth,
and to open and deregulate (Japan's) markets, which is of vital
importance to Japan, to the recovery of Asian countries affected by
financial market turbulence, and to the entire world economy.''
	   Hashimoto promised that Japan would reform its taxes and
accelerate the implementation of its latest economic stimulus
package.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Parliament completed approval of 4.6 trillion
yen (dlrs 32 billion) in extra spending for the current fiscal year
to help pay for the tax cuts and fresh spending in the 16.65
trillion yen (dlrs 117 billion) stimulus package.
	   Last Friday, Japan's Economic Planning Agency said that the
gross domestic product in the world's second-largest economy had
shrunk for two consecutive quarters, and that in fiscal 1977 it
suffered the first full year of contraction in 20 years.
	   With banks reluctant to lend, low interest rates here haven't
helped. But they have prompted investors to move their funds out of
yen and into dollars for purchases on the thriving U.S. stock and
bond markets, pushing the dollar up.
	   At home, ``the market has no confidence in Japan's economic
policies,'' said investor Shigemi Nonaka, a managing director at
Sakura Asset Management Co.

Jordache jeans owners to build peace monument in desert

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jimmy Carter was born too late to be
immortalized on Mount Rushmore, but the former U.S. president's
image will soon be chiseled into a cliff in Israel's Negev Desert.
	   The Nakash brothers, owners of the Jordache jeans company, plan
to erect a monument to the signatories of the 1979 peace agreement
between Israel and Egypt _ Carter, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat.
	   The sculptures will be on a somewhat smaller scale than the
giant busts carved into the Black Hills of South Dakota, said Avda
Lloyd, spokeswoman of the Ramat Hanegev regionl council. Lloyd said
the actual dimensions have not yet been decided on.
	   Avi Nakash said a drls 10 million park will be built around the
monument near the grave of former Israeli Prime Minister David Ben
Gurion in the Kibbutz of Sde Boker. Carter and the families of
Begin and Sadat to attend the cornerstone-laying ceremony in

World Cup: Kluivert says Staelens called him a rapist 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ After initially saying he wouldn't discuss the
matter, Patrick Kluivert has told a Dutch newspaper that Belgian
defender Lorenzo Staelens called him a rapist during their World
Cup match on Saturday.
	   Enraged by the comment, the 21-year-old Kluivert waved his
finger at Staelens then elbowed him in the chest, drawing an
immediate ejection and a two-match suspension. The game ended in a
0-0 draw.
	   ``Staelens called me a rapist,'' Kluivert told the Algemeen
Dagblad for Wednesday's edition. ``I'm used to being called a
nigger on the football field ... that doesn't hurt me any more. But
when I heard this I could no longer control myself.''
	   Kluivert was accused last June in an alleged gang rape with a
group of friends of a woman they picked up outside an Amsterdam
night club.
	   Police investigated the incident, but decided against
prosecuting the case in February because of insufficient evidence.
	   ``He reminded me in a very painful way ... of something that
happened in my private life,'' Kluivert said.
	   Initially, the AC Milan and former Ajax Amsterdam star refused
to divulge what Staelens had said.
	   Besides being accused of rape, in May 1996 Kluivert was
convicted of vehicular homicide after slamming a borrowed BMW into
another car, killing its driver. He was ordered to perform 240
hours of community service.
	   Dutch coach Guus Hiddink sent a letter to FIFA explaining that
Staelens provoked Kluivert, but the letter did not contain the
actual words Staelens used.
	   ``If they want to know, I will tell them, after consulting with
Patrick,'' Hiddink said.
	   The Dutch team held a closed training session Wednesday
afternoon, and Kluivert could not be reached for comment.

By CHRISTOPHER BURNS

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities pursued a crackdown on World Cup
violence by further tightening security Wednesday and dealing out
more jail sentences, convicting two Germans and three more English
fans.
	   Among the 10 French cities hosting the World Cup, Marseille,
Toulouse and Lens announced new restrictions, especially for
high-risk matches with England.
	   More than 100 people remained jailed in Marseille after three
nights of violence involving English fans in Marseille, and
officials said about 30 would be kept behind bars until the World
Cup ends July 12, Marseille police said.
	   Judges ordered two- and four-month jail terms for the three
English fans, after three others were convicted Monday. The two
Germans received three-month sentences, France Info radio reported.
	   Six more Germans were to be judged Wednesday, the radio said.
	   The crackdown followed violence around Monday's match in
Marseille between England and Tunisia. More than 50 people were
injured and 80 arrested in clashes that damaged the Old Port
district.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement signed an order
Tuesday to immediately expel five English fans and a Tunisian. He
threatened more expulsions if soccer violence recurs.
	   The six to be expelled were to first serve jail terms of two to
three months, officials said Wednesday.
	   Authorities took other measures to prevent hooliganism at other
matches in the 10 French cities hosting the Cup.
	   On Wednesday the Marseille area police prefect, Jean-Paul
Proust, announced that retail alcohol sales would be banned from
Friday afternoon until midnight Sunday ahead of the
Netherlands-South Korea match in town Saturday night.
	   Bars hosting the weekend's annual nationwide Festival of Music
will have to close their doors at 11 p.m. each night, he said.
	   The southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for England's next
match, with Romania on Monday. About 1,000 English fans were
already reported in France's fourth-largest city, prompting
officials to postpone the music festival until July 11.
	   Officials also considered closing bars early and forgoing large
TV screens like the one on a Marseille beach where ticketless
English fans and local youths fought Monday afternoon.
	   In the northern city of Lens, where England is to play Colombia
on Friday, June 26, officials were boosting police presence and
canceled city events including the music festival, France Info
radio reported.
	   The new head of FIFA, the international soccer federation, said
Wednesday he was ``saddened'' by the violence. But Sepp Blatter
said he was satisfied French authorities took appropriate measures
to ensure security.
	   ``I'm convinced that from today, we won't have that hooligan
problem anymore,'' he said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Egypt signed a trade deal
Wednesday to boost economic cooperation, the official Iraqi News
Agency reported.
	   The pact was signed by Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh and
his Egyptian counterpart, Ahmed Guweili, the agency said.
	   Saleh was quoted as saying the deal would boost the volume of
trade between the two countries.
	   Some 120 Egyptian firms have staged a trade fair in Baghdad in a
bid to win contracts under Iraq's oil-for-food deal with the United
Nations.
	   ``The two sides have agreed to expand the horizon of cooperation
in the fields of commerce, industry, agriculture, health,
transport, communications, housing and reconstruction,'' the Iraqi
agency said.
	   Iraqi-Egyptian relations soured after Iraqi forces invaded
Kuwait in 1990, but they have improved recently.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed at least seven people
and wounded four, all Tutsis, in a pre-dawn attack Wednesday on a
camp for displaced people, officials said.
	   About 50 Hutu rebels, armed with machine-guns and machetes,
attacked from hills surrounding the camp at Nkamira, 100 kilometers
(60 miles) northwest of Kigali, which houses hundreds of minority
Tutsis who have fled the region's violence, the officials said on
condition of anonymity.
	   No other details were immediately available.
	   The rebels are former soldiers or militiamen who fled the
country in 1994. The army and militias were behind the slaughter of
more than 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   The three-month slaughter ended when Tutsi-led fighters won
power in July 1994.
	   Authorities say the rebels have killed thousands since 1996,
when the Hutu militiamen slipped back into the country mixed along
with more than 1 million Hutu refugees.

Italian mezzo-soprano dies at 51 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian mezzo-soprano Lucia Valentini
Terrani, whose light, agile voice made her a leading performer of
Rossini's works, has died of leukemia. She was 51.
	   A funeral service will be held Monday, Paolo Klun, an official
from La Scala opera house here said Wednesday. Just where the
funeral will be held was not immediately known.
	   Valentini Terrani died June 11 while in Seattle for treatment.
	   She was ``a great lady, in the theater as well as in life,''
opera star Luciano Pavarotti was quoted by the ANSA news agency as
saying.
	   Her career began by winning a national contest for young opera
singers dedicated to Gioacchino Rossini, whose works gave her her
best successes.
	   In 1973, she won international acclaim with her debut at Milan's
La Scala as Cinderella in Rossini's ``La Cenerentola,'' conducted
by Claudio Abbado.
	   Throughout her career, she favored Rossini's works such as
``Barber of Seville,'' and ``Tancredi,'' but also added dramatic
works to her repertory, including Giuseppe Verdi's ``Falstaff,''
and Georges Bizet's ``Carmen.''
	   For her ability as a soloist, conductors such as Abbado and
Zubin Mehta often requested her participation in symphony concert
with vocal items.
	   Valentini Terrani is survived by her husband, actor Alberto
Terrani. The couple had no children.

World Cup: Spain seeks to avenge Nigerian defeat against Paraguay 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Still licking its wounds after the
Nigerian defeat, Spain is getting tired of the criticism. Against
Paraguay, it hopes to turn the tables and show what it's really
worth.
	   ``We're gunning for revenge,'' said veteran Real Madrid defender
Fernando Hierro. 'We want to demonstrate that we are a top class
team. This game will be vital''
	   Hierro's remarks captured the growing feeling among the Spanish
squad of being fed up with criticism following the side's Group D
shock debut defeat to Nigeria.
	   On Wednesday the team shut doors to begin its final preparations
before taking on Hispanic cousin Paraguay in the south central city
of Saint-Etienne on Friday.
	   Contrary to the video bombardment they underwent prior to the
Nigeria battle, the Spaniards say that so far they have only seen
Paraguay twice and admit knowing little about their opponents
beyond the fact that they performed well to finish runners-up in
the South American qualifiers.
	   Meanwhile, for the fourth day running, coach Javier Clemente
eluded the media, angered the heavy criticism of his strategy in
the opening game.
	   Spain, bottom of the table and without any points, needs a
victory badly against Paraguay both to save face and to stave off a
humilliating early exit from its 10th World Cup.
	   ``Our ranking as a favorite can't be wiped out in one game or
rather in 10 minutes of one game,'' said striker Luis Enrique
Martinez. ``Against Nigeria there were a couple of accidents that
proved disastrous for us. Luck plays a part too and against Nigeria
we had none in the end.''
	   The 3-2 Nigeria defeat was Spain's second in 35 games.
	   ``There are no two ways about it, we have to win, ``said the
shaven-headed FC Barcelona player.''We would have liked to have
more options, but there's no cause for pessimism.''
	   For Hierro, Spain is accustomed to dealing with disadvantages.
	   ``In the 1994 cup and in the European champions in 1996 we went
from bad to better,'' he said. ``Let's hope we do the same here.''
	   Spain, however, also has a tradition of lagging in achievements
and despite the successes of its clubs, the national team's last
title was the European championships in 1964 while its World Cup
best was No. 4 in Brazil, 1950.
	   Spain goes into the game with only defender Miguel Angel nursing
a minor calf injury suffered against Nigeria.
	   Moving Nadal from midfield back to defense to replace Ivan Campo
and substituting new Chelsea signing Albert Ferrer with Carlos
Aguilera are changes expect against Paraguay.
	   Speculation is also strong that Clemente will bring out the
league's revelation striker Fernando Morientes to play alongside
Real Madrid teammate Raul Gonzalez up front.

Passengers spend nervous 90 minutes in air after engine burnout 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Passengers said they nervously held
hands across the aisles as their flight circled a New Zealand
airport and dumped excess fuel in the ocean before making an
emergency landing after an engine explosion Wednesday.
	   One of the engines of Air New Zealand flight NZ50, bound for
Fiji and the United States, burst into flames as the Boeing 747
took off from Auckland International Airport Wednesday, an airline
spokesman said.
	   The engine was shut down as soon as it caught fire and the 372
passengers spent a further 90 minutes in the air as the plane
dumped its fuel load into nearby Manukau harbor as a safety
precaution before landing.
	   The four-engine plan can fly safely with three engines
operating, Air New Zealand spokesman Cameron Hill said.
	   Passenger Brendon Burns, who was taking his family on holiday to
Fiji, said he had heard a banging noise after takeoff.
	   ``I heard a pilot who was sitting near us say he thought a tire
had burst,'' he said.
	   Other passengers described holding hands across the aisles after
seeing a bright flash outside the plane's left window.
	   Passenger Valerie Salt said there was ``white-knuckle nervous
laughter'' among passengers in the packed aircraft.
	   ``People were laughing and talking and taking it quite casually
until they saw all the emergency vehicles line up at the airport,''
she said.
	   Airport officials have withdrawn the plane from service while a
new engine is fitted.
	   The airline said the cause of the flameout had not been
identified, but that bird-strike was one theory.

Six Russian ``spy mailbox'' satellites go into wrong orbit thruout. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPGRADES attribution, UPDATES with new details

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Six ``spy mailbox'' satellites launched by Russia
have gone into the wrong orbit, but officials said Wednesday they
can still be used to transmit secret messages to and from
intelligence agents.
	   The six satellites were launched simultaneously early Tuesday
from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northwestern Russia. Russian media
said they were designed for the Main Intelligence Department of the
Russian Defense Ministry (GRU).
	   By Tuesday night some were reported to be having trouble finding
their proper orbits and on Wednesday officials said all six had
gone astray.
	   The satellites, which the military earlier described generically
as the Kosmos variety, were actually Strela-3s _ also known as
``space mailboxes for Russian spies,'' the Russky Telegraf
newspaper said.
	   Strela-3 satellites are used to record radio messages
transmitted by Russian intelligence agents throughout the world,
and relay them to intelligence headquarters in Moscow. They can
also receive messages from Moscow for spies abroad.
	   The satellites are supposed to circle the Earth every two hours,
said Mission Control spokesman Anatoly Kiryushkin.
	   Until recently, the system was highly classified. Russia's
former military intelligence chief, Gen. Col. Fyodor Ladygin,
confirmed their existence when Russia decided to start producing a
commercial version to earn cash for the underfunded space and
military programs, Russky Telegraf said.
	   The satellites were sent into the wrong orbits after they were
given an incorrect command, the Interfax news agency quoted an
unidentified military official as saying.
	   Instead of going into a round orbit 1,400 kilometers (868 miles)
above the Earth, the satellites went into an elliptical one,
passing 1,310 kilometers (812 miles) above the Earth at the lowest
point, and 1,889 kilometers (1171 miles) at the highest point,
Kiryushkin said.
	   The military still intends to use the satellites, but will have
to adjust some settings, Kiryushkin said.
	   The Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 500 kilometers (312 miles) below
the Arctic Circle in northwestern Russia, is used mostly for
military satellite launches.
	   Russia also uses the Baikonur cosmodrome, leased from Kazakstan,
for international satellite launches and manned space flights.
Baikonur is closer to the equator, allowing launches of satellites
to higher orbits using less powerful boosters.

World Cup: Jeremies gets high marks 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ For Franz Beckenbauer, he is already the
revelation of the World Cup. Others think he is the successor to
Lothar Matthaeus. These are heady days for a 24-year-old with only
six caps.
	   Jens Jeremies, the youngest member of the tournament's oldest
team, has established himself as one of Germany's starters. And
he's quickly turning into one of the pillars.
	   ``I would describe myself more as a worker than an artist,''
Jeremies said Wednesday of his role in the team.
	   But that role is becoming indispensable.
	   Jeremies collects loose balls in the midfield and defense, marks
the opponent's play maker, uses his good vision to give splendid
passes and often becomes a dominant force in central midfield, even
overshadowing such stars as Andreas Moeller and Thomas Haessler.
	   He did his job so well against the United States that the
American playmaker Claudio Reyna was a non-factor in the match. The
Germans won 2-0, not least thanks to a lot of good work by
Jeremies.
	   Shaggy, shoulder-length hair that parts in the middle to create
a curtain-like effect over his face once earned him the nickname of
``Gardinen'' (curtain) in his native town of Goerlitz, on the
Polish border.
	   Jeremies began his career in Goerlitz, and later moved to Dynamo
Dresden, the powerhouse club of former East Germany that collected
most the nation's talent. En route, he became a skilled industrial
mechanic.
	   ``But I always chose soccer, that was my professional goal,''
Jeremies said.
	   In 1990, less than a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall and
shortly before German reunification, Jeremies watched Germany win
the World Cup title in Italy.
	   ``And now I am having breakfast with guys like Matthaeus and
Klinsmann,'' Jeremies said. ``It's incredible.''
	   In 1995, after Dynamo Dresden was relegated from the unified
Bundesliga, Jeremies went to 1860 Munich on a 40,000-mark (dlrs
23,500) transfer as an amateur.
	   But within a few weeks, Jeremies advanced from the amateur ranks
to a substitute, then regular starter and the German Under-21 team,
where his performances earned heaps of praise.
	   Finally, in November, coach Berti Vogts gave him his
international debut against South Africa.
	   ``He brings a breath of fresh air'' into a team based on
thritysomething veterans, said the Frankfurter Allgemeine
newspaper.
	   In the team, Jeremies plays the role held by Guido Buchwald at
the 1990 World Cup and Dieter Eilts at the 1996 European
Championship, when Germany also won the title.
	   Jeremies has become one of the most feared tacklers and his
uncompromising style has earned him a contract with Bayern Munich
from the next season. Bayern officials hope he will slowly take
over the role once played by Matthaeus.
	   Matthaeus, at 37 in his fifth World Cup, now plays libero in
Bayern Munich, after a long career in midfield. He is only a
substitute in Germany's team. Jeremies has also played occasionally
as libero for his old club.
	   Jeremies, who is also called ``Jerry'' by friends, sometimes
gets carried away by his enthusiasm for the game. Once, in a 7-0
rout of Bulgaria by Germany's Under-21 team, he slapped an opponent
and received a four-match suspension.
	   ``He has to reign in his temper a bit,'' Vogts said.
	   Beckenbauer, now chairman of Bayern Munich who will be Jeremies'
boss next season, said: ``In Jeremies, we have the first revelation
of this World Cup.''
	   One result of Jeremies' effort against the United States is
strained right-ankle ligaments that could keep him out of the match
against Yugoslavia on Sunday in Lens.

Giants beat Dragons 6-2, regain first place 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Rookie Yoshinobu Takahashi doubled home two runs in
the four-run fifth inning as the Yomiuri Giants beat Chunichi 6-2
at Tokyo Dome Wednesday and regained the Central League lead from
the Dragons.
	   Masumi Kuwata limited the Dragons to six hits for his fifth
victory against one defeat.
	   The Giants, who had slipped to second behind the Dragons on
Tuesday, now are a half-game ahead.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, the Yakult Swallows rapped out 12
hits, including a grand slam home run by Takahiro Ikeyama, and beat
the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 11-5. Ikeyama has nine homers.
	   At Yokohama, Robert Rose hit a home run in the fourth and
Norihiro Komada doubled home two runs in the three-run seventh as
the Yokohama BayStars edged the Hanshin Tigers 5-4.
	   Rose, formerly with the California Angels, has four homers.
	   In the Pacific League, Fumiya Nishiguchi hurled a four-hit
shutout for his second victory against seven defeats as the Seibu
Lions blanked the front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 1-0 at Seibu
Dome.
	   The Lions scored the only run in the seventh on Susumu Ohtomo's
sacrifice fly after Tsutomu Itoh reached first on an error and
advanced on a sacrifice bunt and Kazuo Matsui's hit.
	   The Fighters are one game ahead of the Kintetsu Buffaloes, who
moved into second place with a 9-6 victory over the Chiba Lotte
Marines at Fujiidera on three home runs, including a three-run
homer by Tuffy Rhodes.
	   Rhodes, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has 10 homers.
	   At Kobe, Harvey Jerom Pulliam Jr. smashed a three-run home home
run in the five-run first inning, leading the Orix BlueWave to a
6-2 victory over the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.
	   Pulliam, formerly with the Colorado Rockies, has eight homers.

Jordache jeans owners to build peace monument in desert

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jimmy Carter was born too late to be
immortalized on Mount Rushmore, but the former U.S. president's
image will soon be chiseled into a cliff in Israel's Negev Desert.
	   The Nakash brothers, owners of the Jordache jeans company, plan
to erect a monument to the signatories of the 1979 peace agreement
between Israel and Egypt _ Carter, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat.
	   The sculptures will be on a somewhat smaller scale than the
giant busts carved into the Black Hills of South Dakota, said Avda
Lloyd, spokeswoman of the Ramat Hanegev regionl council. Lloyd said
the actual dimensions have not yet been decided on.
	   Avi Nakash said a drls 10 million park will be built around the
monument near the grave of former Israeli Prime Minister David Ben
Gurion in the Kibbutz of Sde Boker. Carter and the families of
Begin and Sadat will attend the cornerstone-laying ceremony in
October, Nakash said.

Mandela acknowledged apartheid criminals may go unpunished 
</HEADLINE>
By DANIEL J. WAKIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ South African leader Nelson Mandela acknowledged
Wednesday that his country's drive to investigate human rights
abuses during the apartheid era may leave the ``big shots''
untouched.
	   But he said that perpetrators for whom strong evidence exists of
serious violent crimes with ``no justifications'' will not receive
amnesty.
	   ``Where there is evidence of a criminal act being committed,
action is being taken,'' Mandela told reporters during a visit to
Italy.
	   ``But you can't act against someone unless there is clear
evidence. ... It is the foot soldiers who are now in danger of
being arrested,'' he said.
	   ``The big shots themselves who actually authorized these
(criminal) actions _ there is very little evidence to convict them
of criminal offenses which have been committed.''
	   Mandela's government set up a body, the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, to investigate apartheid's atrocities. It can grant
amnesty to those who confess fully, though it does not have the
power to file charges.
	   The commission's work is considered vital to the process of
reconciling the hatreds bred by the apartheid regime's system of
racial separation. Some whites believe the commission is biased in
favor of blacks; some blacks say apartheid's powerful figures,
goverment officials and generals, are escaping scrutiny.
	   ``The task of nation-building and reconciliation cannot be
achieved overnight,'' Mandela said. ``We have made tremendous
progress.''
	   Nevertheless, ``patterns of thought which have been there for
more than three centuries can't be changed in four years,'' he
said.
	   The South African president said he was optimistic about the
future of Africa and had ``confidence'' in its leaders.
	   He said Laurent Kabila, who assumed power last year in what is
now called the Republic of Congo, has ``made very serious efforts
to democratize his country.''
	   The United Nations recently withdrew a team of investigators
from Congo after accusing Kabila of blocking an inquiry into
alleged massacres during the civil war that brought him to power.
	   The South African leader came to Italy on a state visit after
visiting the European Union summit in Cardiff, Wales, where he
lobbied for a long-sought free trade agreement with the union.
Mandela's aides said they expected it to come through in August.
	   A meeting with Pope John Paul II was planned for Thursday.
	   But with Mandela's departure from office after next year's
elections, the trip to Cardiff and Rome also was something of a
farewell to European leaders.
	   When asked what he would do after leaving the presidency, he
smiled and threw up his hands. ``Oh look, I'll be unemployed. I'm
going to stand on the roadside and announce, `Help me, I'm
unemployed!' ''
	   Mandela then offered he'd be available to work for any
``relevant structures'' on the continent.

Albanian president calls border shootings a provocation

<TEXT>
	   BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) _ Albania's president called on
Yugoslavia on Wednesday to ``stop the bloodshed'' after what he
described as a series of provocations by Serb forces firing across
the border from Kosovo.
	   One Albanian was reported killed by a Serb sniper across the
border on Tuesday, and more Serb gunfire was reported at the same
site on Wednesday.
	   The incidents, along with similar earlier accounts, suggest the
Yugoslav army is reasserting control of its border in an attempt to
stop the smuggling of arms to militants seeking independence for
Kosovo, a province of southern Serbia.
	   ``It is another provocation,'' said President Rexhep Meidani,
who was touring the border to get a first-hand look at the refugee
crisis. ``I am not surprised, when you hear that more than 300
Albanians have been killed in Kosovo.''
	   According to Western military observers, international monitors
and local accounts, Serbs on Tuesday fired on two Albanians riding
pack mules just inside the Albanian border. One was killed and the
other escaped.
	   Serb forces later exchanged fire with four men, believed to be
the dead Albanian's brothers, as they tried to recover the body
from a rugged mountain ridge near the Padesh border point
separating Albania from Kosovo.
	   Albanian border police who attempted to reach the site of the
shooting were fired on Wednesday. No one was injured, but it was an
indication that Serb forces show little if any regard for Albania's
tiny military, which is estimated at 4,000 to 6,000 men.
	   A Yugoslav army helicopter was seen flying over the Albanian
border on Tuesday. People who fled over the border that night
reported the same helicopter allegedly opened fire on two makeshift
refugees camps just across the frontier, killing two people.
	   ``It is the same machinery, the same old mentality,'' said
Meidani.
	   The shootings have apparently scared more than 1,000 refugees
hiding in the hills just across the frontier and effectively sealed
the border trails used by gunrunners. None were seen on the same
trail Wednesday.
	   Meidani said that if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic does
not begin promised talks with Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate leader
of Kosovo's Albanians, then NATO and the West should bomb Serb
forces in the Albanian-dominated province without approval from the
United Nations.
	   ``It is the only language understood by Milosevic,'' Meidani
said.
	   He pointed to the series of shootings following NATO's show of
force on Monday when more than 80 jets flew over Albania and near
the Kosovo border.
	   ``They have done other things after this NATO exercise. They
flew over Albanian territory,'' Meidani said at a news conference,
flanked by U.S. Ambassador Marisa Lino.
	   ``It is proof that violence has not stopped ... dramatic
international initiatives are needed,'' Meidani said.
	   He was in this dusty and impoverished town to asses the efforts
being made to shelter the more than 15,000 refugees who have fled
across the rugged mountains separating Albania from Kosovo.
	   There were indications that Serb snipers killed the Albanian, a
resident of Tropoje, as he and the other man were returning from a
smuggling trip across the border to supply weapons to the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Local residents speculated it may have been a message from Serb
forces that they will no longer tolerate the smuggling of thousands
of weapons from Tropoje, a dusty, lawless town just 15 kilometers
(9 miles) inside the border.
	   Bloodstains were found about 100 meters (yards) inside Albania
along the main smuggling route used by Tropoje residents to smuggle
KLA weapons.
	   Residents reportedly receive dlrs 150 from the KLA for every
pack mule they manage to get across the frontier. Most of the funds
are believed to be supplied by Albanian emigres in Switzerland and
Germany.
	   ``It is isolated but significant. If the Serbs are not going to
honor the Albanian border, we could see this as a cross-boarder
incident,'' said Bill Foxton, head of mission here for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Eds: UPDATES with Iran saying it considered pulling out of
contents of 14th graf.
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Street violence, ticket fraud, bickering players
and now political protests. The World Cup can't seem to get away
from the real world.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said Wednesday that Iranian exile
groups threatened to demonstrate against the Tehran government at
Sunday's politically charged World Cup match between the United
States and Iran in Lyon.
	   ``We have received more-or-less anonymous letters from groups of
exiled Iranians who say they will do something to disrupt the match
to show what is going on in their country,'' Blatter said.
	   He declined to identify the groups or say if any specific type
of action was threatened. He also said he was certain police and
security forces would be able to deal with any problems.
	   An official at the Iranian embassy said the country had
considered pulling its team out of the tournament, but decided
against it.
	   ``The national team will stay in France and play with the United
States,'' said the official, who refused to be identified by name.
``The study is over ... the team will play against the United
States and against Germany.''
	   The Iranian team is already upset with a French television
network for Monday night's broadcast of an unflattering U.S. film
about Iran on French TV.
	   In Wednesday's games, Chile played Austria in Saint-Etienne, and
Italy faced Cameroon in Montpellier.
	   Meanwhile, police sources said the first arrests had been made
in the international scandal that left thousands of fans without
World Cup tickets that had been paid for.
	   French authorities arrested three people, including a consultant
for a subsidiary of FIFA's exclusive marketing partner, ISL Ltd.,
the sources said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. A large
amount of cash and about 100 Cup tickets were found, the sources
said, and more arrests were expected.
	   Player misbehavior was also in the limelight Wednesday.
	   After initially saying he wouldn't discuss the matter, Patrick
Kluivert has told a Dutch newspaper that Belgian defender Lorenzo
Staelens called him a rapist during their World Cup match on
Saturday.
	   Enraged by the alleged comment, the 21-year-old Dutch striker
waved his finger at Staelens then elbowed him in the chest, drawing
an immediate ejection and a two-match suspension.
	   ``Staelens called me a rapist,'' Kluivert told the Algemeen
Dagblad for Wednesday's edition. ``I'm used to being called a
nigger on the football field ... that doesn't hurt me any more. But
when I heard this I could no longer control myself.''
	   Kluivert was accused last June in an alleged gang rape with a
group of friends of a woman they picked up outside an Amsterdam
night club. Police investigated the incident, but decided against
prosecuting the case in February because of insufficient evidence.
	   ``He reminded me in a very painful way ... of something that
happened in my private life,'' Kluivert said.
	   Another disgruntled player is Colombia's Faustino Asprilla, who
went on the radio and criticized coach Hernan Dario Gomez. Asprilla
claimed Gomez had ``disrespected'' him when he took him out of
Monday's game against Romania five minutes from the end.
	   On Wednesday, Gomez promptly removed the star midfielder from
his plans.
	   ``He took himself out of the team with his behavior,'' Gomez
said.
	   In Marseille, where three days of violence surrounded England's
2-0 victory over Tunisia on Monday, the courts continued to deal
swiftly with arrested hooligans, convicting two Germans and three
more English fans.
	   Judges ordered two- and four-month jail terms for the three
English fans, after three others were convicted Monday. The two
Germans received three-month sentences, France Info radio reported.
	   More than 100 people remained jailed in Marseille, and officials
said about 30 of them would be kept behind bars until the World Cup
ends July 12.
	   In Toulouse, French police are bracing for another round of fan
violence as English supporters make their way to the site of
England's next game, against Romania on Monday.
	   A music festival has been canceled, and officials are also
considering closing bars early.
	   While saying he was ``saddened'' by the violence, Blatter said
he hoped it would not take on ``too much importance.''
	   ``It's impossible to make a kind of ghetto out of each city
before each soccer match,'' Blatter said. ``I'm convinced that from
today, we won't have that hooligan problem anymore.''

Governments to sign global telecommunications relief pact 
</HEADLINE>
By MATTI HUUHTANEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TAMPERE, Finland (AP) _ Hoping to save thousands of lives in
global catastrophes and major accidents, 94 nations were finalizing
an agreement Wednesday to cut red tape that can hamper the use of
modern telecommunications during international rescue operations.
	   The convention, to be signed Thursday, will provide guidelines
for governments to ease license requirements for telecommunications
equipment used in disaster areas, and ease the work of relief
teams.
	   ``This is the first effort ever to help in this context. We will
be able to save thousands of lives and millions of dollars by
making relief services more efficient,'' said Pekka Tarjanne,
secretary-general of the International Telecommunication Union,
based in Geneva, Switzerland.
	   Since 1970, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural
disasters have caused damage estimated at 120 billion dollars,
killing an average of 100,000 people a year as well as leaving
millions homeless, relief agencies said.
	   ``We can never prevent natural catastrophes, but we can minimize
their effects,'' Tarjanne said. ``One way of doing this is by
easing telecommunications operations.''
	   Rescue operations are often hampered by paperwork at national
borders, with aid teams delayed by visas and customs clearance for
telecommunications and other equipment.
	   Last year, such barriers stalled international relief workers
for three days in reaching earthquake victims at the
Kazakstan-Kyrgyzstan border, Tarjanne said.
	   ``In this way, a minor disaster can become a major one, and we
want to avoid this,'' he added.
	   The agreement also aims to improve telecommunications in
isolated, disaster prone areas.
	   ``This is a step in the right direction and can help us in our
rescue operations,'' said Dominique Loye, from the International
Committee of the Red Cross. ``But it depends on the will of the
countries who sign the convention.''
	   In a written address to conference participants, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the meeting could be a milestone.
	   ``It will enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian
assistance,''Annan said. ``Today's telecommunication industry
provides us with a multitude of equipment and services, but
national regulatory barriers still hinder the full use of these
valuable tools.''
	   Most of the participating nations were expected to sign the
pact, but countries will have to ratify the agreement before it
comes into force. Some nations are likely to adopt the guidelines
immediately.
	   The three-day meeting in Tampere, 170 kilometers (105 miles)
north of the capital, Helsinki, is a follow up to the 1991 Tampere
Declaration on disaster communications which paved the way for
Thursday's convention.

Premier: Working with IMF is `complex' for Ukraine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's prime minister complained
Wednesday that the International Monetary Fund has a different
``vision'' for the country's economic development, which leads to
tense relations.
	   Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko spoke after meeting with an
IMF delegation which arrived this week to assess Kiev's progress
toward implementing the conditions for a dlrs 2.5 billion loan.
	   The IMF refused to release an installment on a dlrs 542 million
stand-by loan this year. In 1997, it rejected another dlrs 2.5
billion loan, citing Ukraine's stalled reforms and the need for
structural changes.
	   The government says it has met some of the requirements, such as
slashing the budget deficit _ a measure that still has to go
through the new, largely leftist parliament.
	   Pustovoitenko said Ukraine finds it ``very, very complex'' to
work with the IMF, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``The IMF has its own vision and we have our own,''
Pustovoitenko said, calling on the IMF to take into account
Ukraine's growing social problems.
	   The former Soviet republic remains plagued by strikes and other
protests by unpaid workers, even as the government struggles to get
the economy in order.
	   This week, a prominent American economist suggested that the IMF
ease some of its 87 conditions for the dlrs 2.5 billion loan.
	   Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University economist who advises
Ukraine, suggested that the IMF make only the 10 most important
conditions mandatory, turning the rest into recommendations.

	   ``He said something in French that I believe was pretty
unpleasant,'' Draper said. ``It's never nice to win a match that
way but these things happen. It's an unfortunate situation.''
	   Pioline faces a heavy fine for the incident. He also loses
whatever prize money he would have earned from the tournament and
gets zero points for computer rankings.
	   In 1996, the ATP Tour specified that a player can face automatic
default _ rather than just a warning or point penalty _ if he
verbally or physically abuses an umpire.
	   Andre Agassi was kicked out of the RCA Championships in
Indianapolis in 1996 for cursing officials, while John McEnroe was
booted from the Australian Open for verbal abuse in 1990.
	   At the French Open last month, Gustavo Kuerten was disqualified
in a doubles match for throwing his racket at the chair umpire.
	   Wednesday's incident arose after Pioline thought a let should
have been called on his serve. He lost the point when Draper hit a
forehand return for a winner.
	   Pioline walked up to Bravo and started shouting at him.
	   The Chilean umpire immediately called a code violation for
verbal abuse, then suspended play and called for tournament
supervisor Armstrong.
	   Armstrong spoke with Bravo and Pioline before announcing, ``Code
violation, verbal abuse. Default Mr. Pioline.''

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan received a sympathetic
hearing in the United States and Canada as to why it exploded six
nuclear devices, but it was unclear if the sentiments would result
in milder sanctions, a Pakistani official said Wednesday.
	   ``With everyone I met, I said that the time has come to move
away from punitive diplomacy toward creative diplomacy and
constructive engagement,'' said Akram Zaki, head of Pakistan's
foreign relations committee, who returned Wednesday from Canada and
the United States, where he met with political leaders.
	   Zaki told reporters at the Islamabad international Airport that
he left North America sure that there was a better understanding of
Pakistan's position. While it seemed certain that the U.S. would
impose sanctions, Zaki said there was a growing opinion among U.S.
lawmakers that sanctions could be counter productive.
	   Some U.S. legislators suggested Pakistan would have benefited
economically had it resisted nuclear testing and ``taken the moral
high ground,'' Zaki said.
	   India's first nuclear explosion was in 1974, he said. While
Pakistan achieved nuclear capability in 1986, it showed restraint
for the next 12 years, he said.
	   When India again conducted nuclears test in May, Zaki said
``Pakistan really had no options but to redress the psychological
and strategic balance in the region.''
	   Zaki also said many of the U.S. lawmakers appeared to
sympathize, but his biggest breakthrough was to convince
legislators both in Canada and the United States that it was a
mistake to equate India and Pakistan.
	   India launched the Asian subcontinent down the nuclear road by
detonating five nuclear devices and following them up with
belligerent statements against Pakistan, threatening to attack in
the disputed state of Kashmir, he said.
	   ``India was the one who first exploded the nuclear devices ...
Pakistan's compulsion was one of self-defense,'' said Zaki. ``A
balance of terror was better than a terror of imbalance.''
	   Zaki said Pakistan still wants to avoid an arms race on the
subcontinent and is willing to enter into a non-aggression pact
with India while negotiating a settlement in Kashmir.
	   For the first time in decades, Zaki said the disputed state of
Kashmir has caught the world's attention. There is also realization
that international intervention is needed to try to settle the
51-year-old dispute that has been the cause of two wars between
Pakistan and India, he said.
	   Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub last week warned that another war
would most probably escalate into a nuclear war.

Russian government defends plans for czar's funeral 
</HEADLINE>
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government insisted Wednesday that the
country's last czar will be buried with pomp and circumstance
despite funding woes and the reluctance of the Russian Orthodox
church.
	   ``The fact that the funeral is taking place is far more
important than the form it takes,'' said Viktor Aksyuchits, an aide
to Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, who is in charge of the
funeral.
	   ``What's more important is that the funeral proceeds not just
with pomp, but with reverence and piety,'' Aksyuchits told a news
conference.
	   Plans for the July 17 state funeral in St. Petersburg have drawn
criticism from various quarters in recent weeks.
	   The Russian Orthodox Church hierarchy has decided to boycott the
event, citing doubts over the identities of the remains. Because
the patriarch will not attend, President Boris Yeltsin has said he
won't, either. The highest-ranking government representative is
expected to be Nemtsov.
	   Aksyuchits said the government is still working out how to pay
for the ceremony and restoration work on the Peter and Paul
Cathedral. But he denied Russian media reports that the government
is so short of cash that it can't afford a marble memorial plaque
and planned to install a wooden one instead.
	   He said sponsors, including Aeroflot, have been found to bear
some of the costs, and the result would be a ceremony fitting the
grandeur of the event.
	   ``The funeral of the murdered czar, Nicholas II, and his family
is in every aspect a grand act,'' Aksyuchits said. ``(It is) an act
of restoring historical memory, of national atonement, of restoring
national identity, of reconnecting with the historical past.''
	   Nicholas II, his family and four servants were executed in the
Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg on July 17, 1918, by a
Bolshevik firing squad who tried to destroy their bodies. Nine
skeletons were recovered in 1991 from a swampy pit, and batteries
of forensic tests in Russia and abroad have identified them as
belonging to the royal entourage.
	   Aksyuchits and others insist there are no doubts about the
identity of the remains. He suggested the church may one day regret
its decision not to take part.
	   ``People are going to ask, Where were they when the state buried
the czar?'' he said.
	   The funeral is set to begin July 15 with a ceremony in
Yekaterinburg, where the family was murdered and their remains have
been kept for the last seven years.
	   After a liturgy on July 16, the skeletons will be flown to St.
Petersburg, where a funeral cortege will proceed to the Romanov
family crypt in the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral.
	   An official state funeral will be held the following morning.
Hundreds of relatives of the deposed czar have been invited,
including many representatives of Europe's current monarchs.

UEFA discusses cup `wild cards' for former European champions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ A proposal to introduce ``wild cards''
that would allow former Champions League winners entry to the UEFA
Cup has been discussed, European football's governing body said
Wednesday.
	   Italy's AC Milan and Germany's Borussia Dortmund, neither of
which have qualified for next season's European club competitions,
likely would receive a place in the 1998-99 UEFA Cup if the
proposal is approved.
	   The bureau of UEFA's Club Competitions Committee reached no
decision on the proposal during a meeting in Paris, UEFA, the
European soccer union, said in a statement.
	   UEFA's Executive Committee will decide whether to accept the
plan when it meets in Paris next month, the statement added.
	   Only clubs which have won the Champions League within the five
preceding seasons would be allocated a ``wild card,'' UEFA said.
	   The offer would be available to each team only once in a
five-year period.
	   ``This would reward any club that has made an outstanding
contribution to European soccer but which hasn't qualified for any
of the three UEFA club competitions,'' said Senes Erzik, who chairs
the Club Competitions Committee.
	   AC Milan won the Champions League in 1994. Borussia Dortmund,
which this year lost to Real Madrid at the semifinal stage, won in
1997.

Louise Woodward faces battle to rebuild life after conviction 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. UPDATES, RECASTS throughout

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Amid the yellow ribbons, jubilant banners
and welcome-home cakes decorated with her face, residents of this
quiet village nurtured doubts Wednesday about how Louise Woodward
will resume her life with a manslaughter conviction hanging over
her.
	   ``People will always say `That's Louise Woodward.' The name is
infamous,'' oil worker Tony Doyle said of the former au pair,
convicted of killing a 8-month-old boy in her care.
	   ``She has said she wants to go to university, but if I were her,
I would choose London _ it's more anonymous,'' said Rachel Park as
she pushed a stroller along Elton's main street.
	   On Tuesday, the highest court in Massachusetts cleared the way
for Ms. Woodward's return to this north England village, upholding
a judge's ruling that freed her after she was convicted in the
death of young Matthew Eappen.
	   Few here really know the 20-year-old Ms. Woodward, described as
a quiet vegetarian from a close, churchgoing family who decided to
travel in the United States for a year while she debated whether to
go to college.
	   ``She talked about going to university and I'm sure she just
wants to get home and try to get back to normal,'' said Julie
Smith, landlady at the Rigger pub, where the campaign to secure Ms.
Woodward's release was born.
	   But those who dealt with the plump young woman in Massachusetts
described her as moody and difficult, with a taste for parties and
late nights that brought her into conflict with her employers.
	   In Elton, there are those who believe life in a big city like
Boston will have spoiled Ms. Woodward _ but they don't want to
appear to be criticizing a local heroine.
	   ``I can't imagine her staying here after the life she's had in
America,'' said one woman who would identify herself only as Mary.
	   Doyle agreed that Ms. Woodward will find it difficult to settle
down.
	   ``It would be a lot easier if the press would leave her alone,''
he said, gesturing at the television vans jamming the parking lot
next to the Rigger.
	   In the window of the Mr. Firkin bakery nearby stood three
celebration cakes bearing Ms. Woodward's photograph and the words,
``Welcome home, Louise.'' Trees, lampposts and neighboring stores
all were festooned with bright yellow ribbons.
	   As they do every Wednesday, campaigners for the Louise Woodward
Appeal Fund met in the village hall to open mail and log the latest
donations. In one envelope, they found an offer of private
accommodation from a woman in Scotland concerned about the huge
publicity.
	   The fund once topped 280,000 pounds (dlrs 456,000), but now
stands at less than 50,000 pounds (dlrs 81,500), they said, and
legal bills still need to be paid.
	   ``Carry on sending in the money,'' said Sandra McCabe, a
Woodward family friend.
	   Fellow campaigner Gareth Jones said that whatever Ms. Woodward
decides to do, she has local backing.
	   ``I know she'll cope. She's got a strong character, a strong
family and good friends. Despite what some may say, the whole
village is behind her,'' he said, referring to former campaigner
Jean Jones, who this week accused Ms. Woodward's mother, Sue, of
treating the fund as her own private stash.
	   Few believe Ms. Woodward will cash in by selling her story to
one of Britain's tabloids, which are salivating at the thought of
boosted circulation figures.
	   ``It's true, her story needs to be told,'' said Mrs. Smith,
landlady of The Rigger. ``But accept payment? No. She's not that
kind of girl.''

North Korean `Godzilla' version making world debut in Tokyo 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo Available
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A North Korean version of ``Godzilla'' has been
sleeping for 13 years. Now the monster is about to make its world
film debut in a Tokyo theater.
	   Its name is ``Pulgasari,'' and it protects farmers against
soldiers by eating cannons and weapons.
	   The film was made in 1985, but was banned both in North Korea
and abroad after its director, Shin Sang-ok, sought asylum in the
United States in 1986, when its Japanese premiere was originally
scheduled.
	   Media reports say Shin, a South Korean, and his wife were
kidnapped in the late 1970s and held for several years to make
movies for Kim Jong Il, known as a film enthusiast. ``Pulgasari''
was one product of that time.
	   Kim succeeded his father, Kim Il Sung, as top leader of the
reclusive communist state after the elder Kim died of heart failure
in July 1994.
	   The film now is being distributed by a Tokyo-based agent, Raging
Thunder, which was officially licensed by the North Korean film
authority, said Hiroyasu Hirano, manager of the Tokyo theater
Kineca Omori.
	   The theater plans to show the film in July, along with the
Hollywood version of Godzilla and a popular Japanese monster
animation film, ``Pokemon.''
	   The role of Pulgasari is played by the same person who had
played the role of ``Godzilla'' in a Japanese film, although in his
monster costume he wouldn't be recognized in either movie.
	   Several others from the Japanese film crew that made
``Godzilla'' also went to the North by invitation for the project.
	   Hirano said the plot is based on an old Korean legend about an
iron-eating monster.
	   In the film, Pulgasari starts out as a doll made of rice by a
blacksmith who refused to submit iron utensils for the military's
arms production. It comes to life, grows into a monster, falls in
love with the blacksmith's daughter, and fights against the army.
	   Gradually, however, the monster becomes a burden to the farmers
it helped because of its large consumption of household iron. The
blacksmith's daughter hides inside a gong to be eaten by the
monster and pleads with it to disappear.
	   Pulgasari cries and breaks into pieces.
	   ``Pulgasari is a monster with a human heart, and the story is
moving,'' Hirano said. ``The movie is also handmade, from the
monster played by a man to miniature castles, which gives it a
warmth, compared to SFX Godzilla.''
	   The film will be also released in July in Osaka and about a
dozen other cities throughout Japan.

Ford loses dlrs 55 million in production due to delivery halt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Ford's German subsidiary said Wednesday
it has lost 100 million marks (dlrs 55 million) since a lock
supplier halted deliveries last week, stalling production.
	   Ford said it expected to receive a delivery and resume
production of its Puma and Fiesta models late Wednesday.
	   The supplier, Kiekert Gmbh, however, declined to confirm that
deliveries would be restarted.
	   The problem has idled 8,000 workers at German plants since
Monday, and interrupted work at a British plant.
	   Kiekert halted the deliveries June 9, citing a problem with its
production software.

Former leader thanks Nigeria's new ruler after jail release 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS date to Wednesday in 7th graf. No pickup.
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Looking thin but exuberant, former
Nigerian state leader Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo greeted hundreds of
well-wishers on Wednesday just hours after being released from
prison by the country's latest military ruler.
	   Speaking to reporters and supporters outside his farmhouse in
Abeokuta, near Lagos, Obasanjo publicly thanked Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar for his freedom.
	   ``I thank the new head of state and all those whom were used by
God to effect my release,'' Obasanjo said. ``Indeed I am very
grateful to God.''
	   Abubakar announced the release of nine political prisoners
including Obasanjo on Monday, thus distancing himself from his
predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha, whose regime issued Obasanjo with a
15-year treason sentence in 1995.
	   Obasanjo, 62, voluntarily relinquished his presidency after an
election in 1979 and went on to become a formidable critic of
Abacha's regime.
	   He was released on compassionated grounds and it was clear that
imprisonment had caused the once-hefty man to lose a large amount
of weight.
	   Two of the other prisoners _ activist Beko Ransome-Kuti and
lawyer Olabintan Durojaiye _ were known to have returned home by
Wednesday afternoon. The others were being held in far-flung
prisons across this sprawling West African country and their
immediate status was unclear.

Bank board member arrested on suspicion of forgery 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A board member of a major Dutch
bank has been arrested on suspicion of forgery, the Amsterdam
prosecutors' office said Wednesday.
	   SNS Bank Nederland board member Tijmen Korver was arrested on
Monday, the latest to be detained by Dutch authorities as they
crack down on alleged misdealings on the Amsterdam stock exchange.
	   The authorities made numerous arrests in late 1997 following
investigations of money laundering on the bourse.
	   In a brief press statement, SNS said it had contacted the
prosecutors office about ``some transactions in 1994 and 1995 which
have led to a suspicion of forgery.''
	   During that period, Korver was head of one of SNS's divisions.
	   The bank also said it has started an internal investigation and
is cooperating with the authorities. The bank declined any further
comment.
	   SNS is among the top five banks in the Netherlands.

Venus Williams routed in grass-court match 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ Venus Williams suffered an
embarrassing defeat on her 18th birthday Wednesday when she was
trounced 6-2, 6-1 by Natasha Zvereva at the Wimbledon warmup
tournament at Eastbourne.
	   Playing in a cold, blustery wind, the fourth-seeded American had
trouble adapting her game to the grass that had been removed from
the old No. 1 court at Wimbledon and transported to Eastbourne.
	   Williams rarely came to the net and rarely attempted a volley,
preferring instead to rally from the baseline. She was repeatedly
outplayed by Zvereva, a doubles specialist from Belarus who mixed
up her game and took the pace off the ball with heavy slice.
	   In the final game, Williams double-faulted and then sent a
forehand soaring over the baseline on match point to end a dismal
performance.
	   ``I was very inconsistent and didn't play well,'' she said. ``I
didn't serve well at all. ... I played poorly. That's the word.''
	   Williams had only two days of practice on grass before the
match, and felt she had not approached it in the right way.
	   ``I've learned that I'm going to have to practice harder and be
more serious in my practices,'' she said. ``I wasn't overconfident,
but in practice I should play every point as if I were in a match.
Sometimes when I practice I try a lot of different things instead
of really focusing.''
	   Williams' younger sister, Serena, fared better. She reached the
quarterfinals by beating No. 8 seed Ai Sugiyama of Japan 6-2, 7-5,
and will next face No. 3 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who beat Tamarine
Tanasugarn of Thailand by the same score.
	   Top seeded Jana Novotna advanced with a 6-2, 6-2 winner over
French qualifier Nathalie Dechy, while No. 2 Steffi Graf eased past
Britain's Samantha Smith 6-1, 6-2.
	   Also advancing was No. 5 Irina Spirlea of Romania, who beat
Italy's Rita Grande 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in a match suspended overnight by
rain, and then Kerry Anne Guse of Australia 6-0, 7-5.
	   Former champion and No. 7 Nathalie Tauziat of France was ousted
6-2, 4-6, 8-6 by Russia's Elena Likhovtseva.

France's Vivendi finalizes deal with American Express 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French services and communications group Vivendi
said Wednesday its Havas subsidiary has sold its Havas Voyages unit
to U.S. travel and credit card company American Express for about
one billion francs (dlrs 166.7 million)
	   Charles Petruccelli, head of American Express travel operations
outside the U.S., said the company valued Havas Voyages for its
good earnings and strong position in the French travel market.
	   Havas President Eric Licoys told reporters Vivendi had sold 100
percent of Havas Voyages to American Express for ``about one
billion,'' francs, with the deal to be finalized in coming weeks.
	   The final price of the sale will be between one billion and 1.3
billion (dlrs 216.7 million) francs, a Havas spokeswoman said.
	   Vivendi, formerly known as Compagnie Generale des Eaux, took
full control of Havas earlier this year. At the time, Vivendi
chairman Jean-Marie Messier said Havas Voyages would be sold by the
end of June.
	   Havas and American Express have had a business travel joint
venture since 1995.

Red Wings cap memorable season with a memorable finals AP Hockey Writer

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Winning the Stanley Cup might have been second
best for the Detroit Red Wings.
	   Winning for Vlady and Sergei came first.
	   ``Not too often does a moment in hockey transcend sports, but
that was one of them,'' Detroit forward Brendan Shanahan said after
the Red Wings completed a four-game sweep of the Washington
Capitals with a 4-1 victory Tuesday night. ``That was one of the
greatest moments I've ever had as an athlete.''
	   Fans and players from both teams were moved to tears as they
watched wheelchair-bound Vladimir Konstantinov taking a slow
victory lap with the Stanley Cup while being pushed by his
teammates.
	   The Cup was presented to Konstantinov, who was wheeled onto the
ice wearing a Red Wings jersey. The jubilant players surrounded him
and urged him to raise two fingers to signify Detroit's second
straight championship.
	   The Red Wings became the first team to repeat as Cup champions
since the Pittsburgh Penguins did it in 1991-92. But this one had a
special meaning for them, above and beyond a mere league
championship. They were able to win it for Vlady, the once dynamic
defenseman who suffered brain damage after a car crash several days
after the Red Wings won the Cup.
	   Konstantinov's presence thrilled the Red Wing players as the
game wound toward its inevitable conclusion. Hundreds of Detroit
fans chanted, ``Vlady ... Vlady.'' Konstantinov's wife, Irina,
lifted him out of his wheelchair as he waved his hand to the crowd.
The chants grew louder.
	   ``It just went right through the whole bench and it was still 16
minutes to go,'' Detroit coach Scotty Bowman said. ``I was just
thrilled that he was responding to the crowd and everybody else.''
	   By that time, the Red Wings had things well in hand _ thanks to
two goals by Doug Brown. They were on their way to their second
straight sweep in the finals following last year's victory over
Philadelphia.
	   No one would have given them a chance to repeat, particularly
after the tragic auto accident just six days after winning the
title in 1997 that left Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei
Mnatsakanov with severe head injuries.
	   The Red Wings also played most of the season without star
forward Sergei Fedorov because of a contract battle.
	   Steve Yzerman, the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the playoffs'
most valuable player, made sure that he handed the Stanley Cup
first to Konstantinov after he was brought on the ice to share the
trophy.
	   ``Throughout the year we were aware of his progress,'' Yzerman
said. ``He was never forgotten on our team.''
	   Washington coach Ron Wilson was impressed with the moment, too,
even though his team had reached the end of its season sooner than
he expected.
	   ``I think that's outstanding,'' Wilson said. ``It's a very
tight-knit group. I mean, when you have someone like that to rally
around, what can you say?''
	   Martin Lapointe and Larry Murphy also scored for the Red Wings,
while goaltender Chris Osgood completed a great series by making 30
saves. He allowed but seven goals on 99 shots in the finals.

EDS: ADDS background on Asprilla off-field troubles in new 21st
graf; CORRECTS spelling of TOUR in dateline.

<TEXT>
	   LA TOUR DU PIN, France (AP) _ Mercurial forward Faustino
Asprilla was dismissed from the Colombian World Cup side for the
rest of the tournament on Wednesday, his punishment for publicly
criticizing coach Hernan Dario Gomez.
	   ``He took himself out of the team with his behavior,'' Gomez
said.
	   Asprilla, who plays for Italy's Parma, did not participate in
the morning training session.
	   Gomez said he took his drastic decision because Asprilla ``broke
the rules we had established'' when he criticized the coach and
some teammates in a radio interview.
	   Asprilla claimed Gomez had a group of ``preferred'' players and
that he ``disrespected'' him when he took him out of the Colombia's
1-0 loss to Romania on Monday with five minutes remaining.
	   Gomez had warned Tuesday that he might take a dramatic action.
	   ``I can't let this go by. If he is so upset, he should go. I
won't let him disrupt the team,'' he said.
	   Colombian players were given Tuesday off and most used it to
visit Paris. Reached there by a radio reporter, Asprilla said that
there were ``untouchable'' players on the field who were not
substituted, regardless of their performance.
	   ``There are players whose performance was worse than mine
yerderday, and were never taken out of a game. And I was
substituted with five minutes remanining. It seems to me a show of
disrespect,'' Asprilla complained to radio Caracol.
	   Asprilla was replaced by Leider Preciado, a young striker with
little international experience.
	   Gomez felt no need to explain his actions.
	   ``Everybody saw (the game) on TV. I don't have much to add,'' he
said.
	   Gomez claimed Asprilla had no right to complain that he
preferred some players since ``the most preferred player has been
him.''
	   Asprilla almost took himself out of the World Cup before the
start because he didn't feel fit. A few weeks before the opening
kickoff he was still recovering from a groin injury that had him
out of action for almost six months.
	   Gomez waited for him until the very last minute and said he was
ready to take Asprilla to France ``even if he played on one leg,''
since he considered him a player who can make a difference.
	   The coach also said that Asprilla should emulate other World Cup
stars that ``run and sweat on the field, and don't talk off the
field.''
	   Asprilla returned to Parma this year after two seasons with
England's Newcastle.
	   Asprilla has had series of off-field troubles during his career
including a pistol-firing incident at a New Year's party in Tulua,
Colombia, in 1995 and the year before that he injured his foot
after kicking a bus in a dispute after an auto accident.
	   He didn't comment on his dismissal from the team Wednesday.
	   The Colombian camp was rife with rumors that top government
officials, including president Ernesto Samper, were asking Gomez to
reconsider his decision.

Emergency program, Chubais' possible appointment to fight crisis international lenders, Kiriyenko speaks on plans to negotiate a new loan from IMF. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin appointing Chubais his envoy to

By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko confirmed
Wednesday the Russian government is seeking a new loan from the
International Monetary Fund to replenish its currency reserves
following recent market upheavals.
	   The government also brought reformer Anatoly Chubais back into
the inner circle, restoring him to his former rank as deputy prime
minister and putting him in charge of relations with international
lending organizations.
	   Kiriyenko said Russia will ask the IMF for credit to bolster the
Central Bank's reserves, Russian media reported. He would not say
how much money the government was seeking.
	   ``All I can confirm is we are going to ask the IMF mission for
an additional loan to help stabilize the financial situation,''
Kiriyenko said.
	   Turmoil on the stock market that began late last month slowed
slightly when rumors began circulating of a bailout package from
the International Monetary Fund. The IMF confirmed Tuesday that it
would send a team to Moscow next week to discuss new loans.
	   The cave-in of Russia's financial markets prompted fears of a
devaluation of the national currency, the ruble, which could lead
to a sharp rise in prices. Combined with the government's
continuing inability to pay state workers on time, that could lead
to mass protests.
	   Sergei Dubinin, the head of the Central Bank, reiterated
Wednesday that the ruble would not be devalued and said the bank
had dlrs 15 billion in reserves. However, those reserves could be
depleted rapidly if the bank is forced to prevent a run on the
currency.
	   Negotiating the terms of the IMF loan will be one of the first
tasks for Chubais, who is popular in the West as a proponent of
rigid financial policies and a tough administrator.
	   He already acted as President Boris Yeltsin's envoy when he went
to the United States last month to ask the IMF and other potential
lenders for help.
	   Yeltsin has twice fired Chubais from his Cabinet, most recently
in the government shakeup in March. He was recently appointed head
of Russia's huge state-owned electricity monopoly, Unified Energy
Systems.
	   Along with pressing the IMF for new credits, the government is
preparing an emergency program involving deep spending cuts and
aggressive tax collections.
	   Apart from the Asian financial crisis and the fall in prices for
oil and natural gas _ Russia's main exports _ the recent market
collapse has been caused by the government's free spending,
Kiriyenko said.
	   ``The world financial crisis has fallen on fertile ground in
Russia _ that is the crisis of confidence in the system that lives
beyond its means,'' Kiriyenko said, addressing an economic
conference of former Soviet republics in St. Petersburg, Russia's
second-largest city.
	   The Russian government will need all its ``courage and political
will,'' to implement the new austerity program, Kiriyenko said,
``Some of the program's provisions are going to be unpopular.''

Belgian captain Van der Elst injured in training 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MONTHIEUX, France (AP) _ Belgian captain Franky Van der Elst had
to quit training Wednesday because of a groin strain, raising fears
he will not be ready for Belgium's vital qualifier against Mexico.
	   With Saturday's Group E match approaching, Van der Elst left
practice as soon as he felt the first warning signs in his groin.
He will undergo further tests Thursday.
	   Van der Elst was a key member of Belgium's staunch defense that
kept the favored Dutch to a goalless draw in their first game on
Saturday. Mexico beat South Korea 3-1 to lead the group.
	   The omission of Van der Elst would create a big hole in
Belgium's defensive midfield section, where his experience and
anticipation have been a major asset in the recent string of good
results for the Red Devils.
	   At 37, Van der Elst is playing in his last World Cup and will
quit international soccer after the finals in France.
	   Apart from Van der Elst, coach Georges Leekens had a fully fit
squad Wednesday, with defender Gordan Vidovic and midfielder Marc
Wilmots rejoining the group for training.

Bizarre denouement in conflict over ambassadors' homes in Belarus 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The president of Belarus laid claim to a
neighborhood of ambassadors' homes on Wednesday, but then appeared
to back down and said diplomats could continue living in the
compound during water and sewer repairs.
	   Late Wednesday, the British Embassy announced that President
Alexander Lukashenko had agreed to let the ambassadors stay, but
provided no other details.
	   The diplomatic dispute has raged since April, when the
government of this former Soviet republic tried to evict about two
dozen ambassadors from their homes in the pleasant wooded compound
in Drozdy, saying the water and sewage system needed urgent
repairs.
	   The conflict took an odd turn Wednesday morning, when diplomats
saw a new sign hanging at the entrance: ``The residence of the
President of the Republic of Belarus.''
	   Lukashenko has a residence adjacent to the diplomatic compound
on the outskirts of Minsk, but had not previously suggested he
wanted to take it over the area for his personal use. The
government refused to provide an explanation.
	   Ambassadors from Bulgaria and some former Soviet republics have
left the compound, but the U.S. ambassador and others want to stay
during the repairs. They argue that under the Vienna Convention,
ambassadors' residences are sovereign territory and the host
country has no right to force them out.
	   Ann Speckhard, the wife of U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard,
spoke to reporters while walking her dog and pledged to stay in her
home.
	   All sewage and plumbing systems and telephone lines are working
fine, and her family was feeling ``OK,'' Mrs. Speckhard said.
	   The compromise between Lukashenko and the diplomats was
apparently reached at a briefing for the ambassadors at the Foreign
Ministry.
	   ``Nobody is evicting anyone, not today or tomorrow,'' said Col.
Mikhail Tesovets, the head of Lukashenko's personal guard service.
	   The British Embassy released a short statement saying the
compromise will permit the ambassadors to remain in their homes.
	   ``The solution takes account of the repair and technical work
required to (the) premises and of the requirements of ambassadors
consistent with their status and rights under the Vienna
Convention,'' the statement said, without providing details.
	   Officials at the British and U.S. Embassies contacted by The
Associated Press refused to provide further information.
	   Belarusian authorities say that the sewage and plumbing system
in the 1940s-era compound is badly antiquated and requires urgent
repairs.
	   However, the embassies point out that the embassies hold valid
leases, some of which were signed the same month as they were
ordered to leave.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The Dalai Lama said Wednesday he hopes President
Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to China will help open a
constructive dialogue on Tibet.
	   The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader was speaking before the
Foreign Affairs commission at the National Assembly during a
three-day visit to France.
	   Clinton visits China June 25 through July 3, the first visit of
a U.S. president since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
	   The Dalai Lama said he was ``absolutely certain that President
Clinton will ask the Chinese government to open a dialogue with the
Dalai Lama.''
	   On other issues, he expressed no public regrets that President
Jacques Chirac was not offering him an official reception at the
Elysee Palace. Chirac had met him three times when he was mayor of
Paris.
	   ``I know he has great sympathy for our cause and will aid us in
any way necessary,'' the Dalai Lama said.
	   A parliamentary group that deals with the Tibet issue had called
on Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to receive the Dalai
Lama officially. But French leaders have been unwilling to irritate
the Beijing government by doing so.
	   The Tibetan leader was received, however, by parliament
president Laurent Fabius, who said he supports the idea of a French
parliamentary mission to Tibet.
	   The Dalai Lama said he was optimistic about Tibet's future. ``I
am 100 percent sure that I will be able to return one day to
Tibet,'' he said.
	   In China, he said, there have been ``changes that would have
been inconceivable a year ago,'' notably a few favorable articles
about Tibet appearing in the press.
	   He rejected the idea of economic sanctions on Beijing. ``One
must not isolate China but integrate it in the international
community,'' he said, all the while remaining ``extremely firm on
the fundamental principles: human rights, democracy, the
environment, and preservation of the Tibetan heritage in the
cultural and spiritual domains.''
	   ``The problem of Tibet is essential for China's image in the
world,'' said the Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. ``If
the problem of Tibet is resolved in a reasonable way, that could
open the way to unification of China and Taiwan.''
	   ``I don't demand independence,'' he said. ``I demand a real
autonomy so that we can take care of our own affairs.''

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ The streets of Detroit ran red and white
Wednesday as hundreds of fans celebrated the Red Wings' second
consecutive Stanley Cup win by chanting, dancing and waving brooms.
	   After the roar died down from a sold-out Joe Louis Arena, where
people watched the 4-1 win over the Washington Capitals on
television, fans streamed into the streets of downtown Detroit to
high-five any and every passerby and chant, ``Sweep! Sweep!
Sweep!''
	   ``Hopefully, we'll be back for a three-peat,'' said Mark Davis,
25, of Detroit, who came to the Spirit of Detroit statue clutching
two brooms.
	   The dancing in the street wasn't just confined to Detroit. In
Washington, Wings fan Michael Sullivan, 23, danced a jig in the
middle of the street outside MCI Center.
	   ``I think they won this one for the city,'' said Sullivan, one
of the thousands of Detroit fans to make the trip. ``You don't see
that kind of loyalty in pro sports anymore. Hockey is definitely a
passion in Detroit. I don't think that people realize how much
Detroit loves the sport.''
	   Fans in suburban Detroit turned violent. Two young men were
stabbed on a street where large groups gathered after the game,
Roseville Police Chief William Lucas said Wednesday. They were
listed in serious condition.
	   Another man was beaten in a separate assault. Lucas and other
Roseville officers were not immediately available to explain any
connection to the hockey celebration.
	   Twelve people were arrested in Detroit _ eight accused of
disorderly conduct, one of drunken driving and three of ordering
drinks without paying, said Sgt. Eleanor McBurrows. She said there
was no property damage.
	   When the Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup in 42 years last
June, their celebration was cut short by a limousine accident just
six days later that injured three team members.
	   The celebration began again on Tuesday and will continue
Thursday, when a parade down Woodward Avenue and rally in Hart
Plaza are planned. On Friday, a rally at Joe Louis Arena is planned
for season ticket-holders.
	   ``For the second year, the Red Wings' teamwork and masterful
play have helped them capture one of the greatest trophies in
professional sports,'' said Mayor Dennis Archer. ``I congratulate
them on keeping Lord Stanley's cup in Hockeytown.''
	   In Detroit, highway exits leading to downtown were shut down
just before midnight as the city became gridlocked with revelers,
Detroit police public information officer Ricardo Moore said.
	   Police Chief Isaiah McKinnon kept an eye on the crowd at the
Spirit of Detroit statue, which had been adorned with a huge Red
Wings jersey all week. The jersey was removed Tuesday night as a
precaution.
	   At the famed Lindell AC, a legend among local sports bars, every
seat in the small saloon was taken by a Wings fan Tuesday night.
When Doug Brown scored Detroit's first goal early in the first
period, the place erupted in cheers and high fives.
	   Back in Washington, Vladimir Konstantinov, a player who suffered
head injuries in the limousine accident after the Red Wings'
Stanley Cup victory a year ago, was pushed onto the ice in his
wheelchair before the NHL presented the Stanley Cup to the Red
Wings.
	   When MVP Steve Yzerman was handed the trophy, he placed it on
Konstantinov's lap. His teammates formed a circle around him and he
raised two fingers to signify the second title. His teammates then
pushed him around the ice in a victory lap.

Senior lawmaker speaks against START II ratification 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament has balked at ratifying the
START II arms reduction treaty because it would dismantle the most
powerful weapon in Russia's inventory, a senior lawmaker said
Wednesday.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, a Communist who heads parliament's security
affairs committee, said he and other lawmakers oppose START II
because it envisages the destruction of SS-18 ballistic missiles.
	   They are Russia's most formidable weapon, capable of hitting the
United States, which has made ``Americans rush for ratification''
of the treaty, Ilyukhin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The land-based SS-18 missile, code-named ``Satan'' in the West,
carries 10 nuclear warheads and is considered a ``first-strike''
weapon capable of overcoming anti-missile defenses.
	   Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin signed the START II
agreement in 1993, which would halve Russian and American nuclear
arsenals to 3,500 warheads each.
	   The treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, but the
lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, has balked,
saying it would damage Russia's national security and be too
expensive for the cash-strapped country.
	   Ilyukhin, one of the most vocal critics of START II, said it
would be premature to ratify the treaty because Russia is unable to
develop the SS-18's successor in the near future.
	   Russian military leaders support ratification. They say that by
2007 _ the treaty's deadline for destroying the weapons _ SS-18s
will be at the end of their service life and will have to be
discarded anyway.

Israeli convicted of treason for selling weapons components to Iran 
</HEADLINE>
By DANIEL BEN-TAL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli businessman on Wednesday was
convicted of treason for illegally selling chemical and biological
weapons components and know-how to Iran for drls 16 million.
	   The defendant, Nachum Manbar, faces life in prison when he is
sentenced July 15.
	   Manbar was secretly arrested in March 1997 and his trial was
held behind closed-doors, except for Wednesday's verdict hearing.
	   Reading from the 80-page decision, Tel Aviv District Court Judge
Amnon Strasnov said Manbar ``has been found guilty of giving
information to the enemy, and aiding the enemy in its war against
Israel.''
	   Manbar denied wrongdoing and said he coordinated his sales to
Iran with agents of Israel's secretive Shin Bet security agency.
	   ``If I am guilty so are at least 200 people. Maybe I am guilty
of naivete but definitely not of trying to harm the country,''
Manbar told reporters.
	   Strasnov said Manbar lied repeatedly to the court and tampered
with evidence to cover up his business dealings with Iran.
	   ``He played a double game, supplying the Iranians with
components for weapons of mass destruction, while deliberately
misleading the Shin Bet regarding his business deals,'' the judge
said.
	   Israel and Iran have been in a technical state of war since the
Islamic revolution there in 1979. Israel has been the most vocal in
warning that the Islamic republic is close to completing a missile
with capabilities of striking the Jewish state and is advancing its
nuclear program.
	   Strasnov said Manbar ``supplied materials used for producing
mustard gas and equipment for building four production factories
and received dlrs 16 million from the Iranians for this.''
	   The court said 150 tons of materials for weapons production were
delivered by 24 trucks to Iran from an undisclosed location in
Europe.
	   Several sections of the decision were classified.
	   Manbar met several times with an Iranian contact identified as
Majed Abasbur, and the two signed a deal in a Vienna, Austria hotel
room in the early 1990s, according to the court.
	   Manbar told the court that he ``had heard of other Israeli
companies doing business with Iran'' and didn't think his supplies
were being used for military purposes. However, the court said
Mabar did not heed a warning from Israeli security officials in
1993 to cut all business dealings with Iran.
	   In July 1994, the U.S. State Department said Manbar and two of
his companies violated a U.S. trade embargo against Iran, and
Manbar was barred from the United States.
	   Israeli newspapers reported last year that U.S. officials asked
Israel to stop Manbar's activities and the CIA provided new
information to Israel on Manbar's links with Iran.

NATO Secretary General kicks off tour of hopeful Baltic countries 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
began a tour Wednesday of the three Baltic countries striving for
alliance membership, landing in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius,
the Baltic News Agency said.
	   NATO has already said the door to the alliance is open to the
former Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, despite
bitter Russian opposition. Solana was expected to repeat that view
in a visit that has boosted hopes in the small countries.
	   In Lithuania, Solana was to meet President Valdas Adamkus,
Defense Minister Algirdas Saudargas, and other top leaders, the
Baltic News Service reported from Vilnius. Solana will also tour
Vilnius's old town, where a a popular bar called ``NATO'' reflects
the enthusiasm of this Baltic coast nation for the alliance.
	   After a half-century under Soviet rule, all three Baltic states,
which gained independence in 1991, see NATO membership as a
guarantee of their military security and full integration into
Western Europe. Their military forces still fall below NATO
standards, but all three nations have vowed to qualify for the next
round of alliance expansion.
	   Moscow has grudgingly accepted NATO expansion to Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic, but has protested moving NATO's frontier to
the Baltic states on Russia's border.
	   After talks in Vilnius, Solana is scheduled to fly to Latvia's
capital of Riga Thursday and Estonia's capital of Tallinn on
Friday.

Albanian negotiator dismisses Milosevic's pledge to talk Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in
Kosovo on Wednesday dismissed President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge
to negotiate, saying his powerful forces must halt all actions and
leave the separatist province before any talks can start.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the four-man Kosovo Albanian team named to
negotiate with the Serbs, spoke after Milosevic promised Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to reopen talks with the moderate
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``What was announced in Moscow is no news, because the problem
is not whether there will be any talks with the Albanians, but the
conditions in which talks should be held,'' Agani told The
Associated Press.
	   ``Two important conditions set by the international community
... have not been fulfilled. And meaningful talks depend on them,''
Agani said. ``Therefore, at this moment, we cannot say whether
there will be any talks.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen stressed Tuesday that while some progress was made in
Moscow, Milosevic failed to meet the key condition _ withdrawal of
his forces.
	   Milosevic promised free access for international monitors and
aid groups to western Kosovo. He said no repressive actions would
be carried out against civilians, but ruled out the withdrawal of
the Yugoslav army _ which guards the border with Albania _ and said
police presence would be reduced only when attacks by Albanian
militants cease.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March.
	   In neighboring Albania, President Rexhep Meidani called on
Yugoslavia on Wednesday to ``stop the bloodshed.'' .
	   ``It is another provocation,'' said Meidani, who was touring
northern Albanian border, which it shares with Kosovo, to get a
first-hand look at the refugee crisis. ``I am not surprised, when
you hear that more than 300 Albanians have been killed in Kosovo.''
	   On Monday, NATO, 8th graf pvs.

U.S.-Iran match target of anti-Tehran groups, FIFA says AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs; RECASTS with new material throughout
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A soccer game already surrounded by political and
cultural sideshows took on a new dimension Wednesday when soccer's
top official said Iranian exiles have threatened action against the
World Cup match between Iran and the United States.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said his office had received
correspondence from groups opposed to the Islamic government in
Tehran, who said there would be trouble at Sunday's match in Lyon.
	   ``We have received more-or-less anonymous letters from groups of
exiled Iranians who say they will do something to disrupt the match
to show what is going on in their country,'' Blatter said.
	   He declined to identify the groups or say if any specific type
of action was threatened.
	   The Mujahedeen Khalq, the largest exile group, denied through a
Paris spokesman that the exiles were threatening disruption. It
said the letters were part of a campaign by Tehran to discredit the
group.
	   At the Iranian Embassy, meanwhile, officials said they briefly
considered pulling out of the World Cup in protest to this week's
French telecast of an American movie that depicted Iranians as
boorish and violent. The ambassador finally decided the team should
stay.
	   Security forces reportedly were told to keep a close watch at
Iran's opening match against Yugoslavia last Sunday for banners or
posters denouncing the Tehran regime.
	   Blatter said police and security forces would be able to deal
with any problems that might occur at Stade Gerland.
	   ``I'm sure the local organizing committee and the public
authorities are going to take specific measures,'' Blatter said.
``I'm sure things will be fine at the match.''
	   Big international sports events always seem to come with an
element of politics attached. But Sunday's game between two
mediocre teams struggling just to reach the second round is one of
the most politically and culturally charged matches ever held.
	   This is, after all, U.S. vs. Iran, the ``Great Satan'' vs. the
Ayatollah, West vs. East.
	   There have been no diplomatic relations between the one-time
allies since 1979, when Islamic militants overthrew the ruling shah
and took Americans hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Inability
to end that crisis helped curtail Jimmy Carter's presidency and
heaped another American embarrassment on top of Vietnam and
Watergate.
	   Recent months there has been a slight thaw in relations between
Washington and Tehran, accompanied by movement in sports.
	   A U.S. wrestling team received a warm welcome when it competed
in a Tehran tournament this year. Iranians, in turn, later wrestled
in a tournament in Oklahoma.
	   The soccer teams are playing because of a blind draw last
December that placed them in the same first-round group, along with
Germany and Yugoslavia. Both the United States and Iran lost their
opener and the loser Sunday will be virtually eliminated.
	   Players on each team have talked about concentrating on soccer
and treating the game like any other.
	   But the Iranians were so angered by Monday night's broadcast on
a French TV network of an American film, ``Not Without My
Daughter,'' which paints an unflattering portrait of Iran and its
religious leadership, that they briefly considered withdrawing from
the tournament before deciding to stay, according to an embassy
official.
	   The official, who refused to be identified, said Iran had
studied whether to pull out of the Cup but ``the study is over. ...
The team will play against the United States and against Germany''
June 25.
	   Iranian Ambassador Hamidreza Assefi personally made the decision
to remain in the tournament, the official said.
	   The Mujahedeen Khalq, one of the forces which helped topple the
shah, is the top armed exile group opposing Tehran, with leader
Massoud Rajavi and his army based in Iraq. Several representatives
of the Mujahedeen, including a brother of Rajavi, have been killed
in attacks the group blames on the Iranian government.
	   Thousands of exiled Iranians live in France.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fire sparked by lightning at ammunition depots
killed at least six serviceman and injured 14 others in the Ural
Mountains on Wednesday, officials said.
	   At least seven other servicemen are missing in a blaze, the NTV
television network said citing local officials.
	   The fire, which has also engulfed 180 hectares (445 acres) of
forest around the depots, forced the evacuation of 3,000 local
residents, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The depots contained from 160 to 240 mines, artillery shells and
rockets that belonged to Russian troops withdrawn from Eastern
Germany.
	   Some of them detonated because of the fire, and officials were
concerned that some rockets could fly a long distance and threaten
the population.
	   The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry was sending an Il-76
plane capable of carrying 40 tons of water to help extinguish the
fire.
	   Blazes at ammunition depots, which are often located in thick
forests, break out frequently in Russia.

UN official says Sudan to help return kidnapped Ugandan children 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Sudanese government has promised to
help secure the return of children abducted by Ugandan rebels and
taken to their bases in southern Sudan, a senior U.N. official said
Wednesday.
	   Olara A. Otunnu, Under Secretary-General and Special
Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, said he obtained
the promise during a three-day stay in the Sudanese capital,
Khartoum.
	   Otunnu said he also visited Juba, the largest town in southern
Sudan still controlled by the government. Much of the southern
third of Sudan _ the largest nation in Africa _ is controlled by
rebels of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army.
	   ``I have every reason to believe the Sudanese government will
continue to cooperate with the United Nations and make better
progress until the matter is resolved,'' Otunnu said.
	   He was referring to the October 1996 kidnapping by rebels of the
Lord's Resistance Army of 152 girls from St. Mary's Roman Catholic
school in northern Uganda. An Italian nun later managed to convince
the rebels to release 109 of the girls.
	   On May 21, the Ugandan government freed 42 Sudanese soldiers in
a deal they thought would secure the release of the remaining
girls. In the meantime, some had escaped and a few had died.
	   Ugandan troops captured the Sudanese soldiers when they chased
LRA rebels across the border into southern Sudan.
	   An angry President Yoweri Museveni, who had agreed to the deal,
said Uganda would have to use force to free the girls.
	   The LRA rebels, who have been battling government troops for 11
years, routinely abduct school boys and girls. The boys are given
military training, while the girls are given chores and some become
``wives'' of LRA officers and favored soldiers.
	   The New York-based group Human Rights Watch estimates that the
LRA has abducted between 8,000 and 10,000 children from northern
Uganda and trained them to attack their home villages and families.
	   Uganda accuses Sudan of providing sanctuary and weapons to the
LRA, a charge Khartoum denies.
	   Otunnu, who is Ugandan, said he also raised the issue with the
Sudanese government of the military recruitment of youths under 18.
He said Sudanese authorities assured him there will be no such
recruitment.
	   Otunnu said he would raise the same issue with SPLA officials in
Kenya.
	   Journalists visiting southern Sudan have seen boys as young as
15 in both government and rebel ranks.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for increased autonomy for
the predominantly Christian, African and animist south,
traditionally dominated by the Muslim and Arabized north.

Third suspect arrested in killing of Russian journalist 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police have arrested a third suspect in connection
with the killing of a prominent journalist in Russia's southern
region of Kalmykia, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Larisa Yudina, editor of the Soviet Kalmykia Today newspaper,
was found dead June 8 in the Kalmykian capital Elista with multiple
knife wounds and a fractured skull.
	   Two former aides to the regional leader have already confessed
to the killing. The Interfax news agency gave the third suspect's
surname as ``Shanukov,'' but did not identify him further.
	   Yudina's newspaper had long criticized the leadership of Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov, president of Kalmykia. It recently accused him of
extorting money from local businessmen.
	   The two men already in custody are Sergei Vaskin, a former aide
to Ilyumzhinov, and Tyurbya Boskhomdzhiyev, Ilyumzhinov's envoy to
a nearby region.
	   According to the Kommersant daily, Boskhomdzhiyev lured Yudina
to a meeting by promising to turn over compromising materials on
Ilyumzhinov, but used the occasion to murder her.
	   Boskhomdzhiyev told investigators that a decision was taken to
kill Yudina after she ignored warnings to halt her criticism of
Ilyumzhinov, Kommersant said.
	   Liberal Russian media have accused Ilyumzhinov, a millionaire
businessman, of running the impoverished region like a medieval
baron, flaunting his wealth while crushing dissent and ignoring the
republic's social woes.
	   Ilyumzhinov, who also serves as the president of the World Chess
Federation, says that he will seek the Russian presidency in 2000.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has demanded that Yudina's killing be
investigated ``to the utmost level,'' adding that local officials
investigating the case ``cannot be fully trusted.''

United Nations launches appeal to help flood-stricken region 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations on Wednesday launched an
emergency appeal for aid to help thousands of people made homeless
by floods in northeastern Russia.
	   During the past month, floods in the Sakha-Yakutia region have
claimed at least 13 lives and made 36,000 people homeless, said a
statement from the Geneva-based Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs.
	   The Russian government has requested the OCHA to ask countries,
international organizations and others to provide tons of
equipment, food and medicine.
	   The floods were triggered by the springtime snow melt in the
region, which caused the major Siberian river, the Lena, and the
River Aldan to overflow.
	   A state of emergency has been declared in the flood-hit area,
where 350,000 people live.
	   Authorities used helicopters to evacuate 900 people from
riverside villages. Some 42,600 people have been evacuated from the
flood-hit area as a whole, the OCHA said.
	   More than 9,000 houses sunk and roads, bridges, houses and
electric lines were damaged.
	   Russian SU-24 military planes have been dropping bombs to break
up chunks of ice blocking the Lena and other rivers in the region,
the OCHA said.
	   The Japanese government last week pledged to give 5 million yen
(dlrs 35,200) in humanitarian aid.

Brazilians: team finally fulfilling its promise 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A new optimism was palpable among
fans and sports writers Wednesday as this nation, famed to have 160
million soccer coaches, grudgingly conceded that national team
coach Mario Zagallo may finally be getting things right.
	   With Tuesday's 3-0 rout of Morroco, Brazil was the first time to
qualify for the second round of World Cup play.
	   ``We're the best again,'' read the cover of the sports section
in the O Globo newspaper.
	   Although Brazil won its first World Cup tie against Scotland
2-1, none of its star strikers scored and the team needed an own
goal to avoid a tie.
	   This was something that left many here worried about the team's
chances for an unprecedented fifth World Cup victory.
	   All that changed Tuesday.
	   ``The national team yesterday (Tuesday) finally showed soccer
worthy of its prestige as four-time World Cup champion,'' the Rio
daily O Dia concluded.
	   The papers also celebrated Ronaldo's first goal in four games
which was also his first in World Cup play.

Jewelry merchant accused of stealing dlrs 180 million extradited to Russia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A jewelry merchant suspected of engineering a
fraudulent scheme that cost Russia dlrs 180 million in stolen gold
and gems was extradited Wednesday from Greece.
	   Andrei Kozlenok, 38, had been in custody in Athens since his
arrest in January. He fought extradition by claiming his life would
be in danger in Russia.
	   Another suspect in the scheme, Sergei Dovbysh, a former Russian
Interior Ministry official, was found dead in February in a court
house cell in Moscow. His death was officially ruled a suicide.
	   Greek Justice Minister Evangelos Yiannopoulos signed the
extradition order Monday after Greek courts rejected Kozlenok's
appeals. He was flown to Moscow and taken directly to a jail for
questioning, Russian media said.
	   Additional security was ordered for Kozlenok, said Ruslan
Tamayev, the investigator from the Russian Prosecutor General's
office in charge of the case. He refused to say exactly where
Kozlenok was being held.
	   Kozlenok is charged in the embezzlement of more than dlrs 183
million in gold, diamonds and silver. He is accused of making a
fake jewelry production contract with the Russian State Committee
on Metals and Gems on behalf of a San Francisco-based company,
Golden ADA Inc.
	   The Russian government filed a lawsuit in San Francisco in 1995,
claiming Golden ADA sold the metals and gems without permission
instead of returning them to Russia after processing and used the
money to buy yachts, a business jet, luxury cars and a mansion.
	   A U.S. court trustee ruled in April that dlrs 40 million in
remaining Golden ADA assets will be divided among the Russian
government, the Internal Revenue Service and creditors.
	   Prosecutors believe that Kozlenok might give a fresh evidence
against some former senior government officials involved in the
scheme.
	   One of them, Yevgeny Bychkov, the former head of State Committee
on Metals and Gems, was fired by President Boris Yeltsin in
February 1996 after the scandal broke. Bychkov has already faced
charges, but was granted an amnesty.

Eleven dead in bar shooting 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Three heavily armed men opened fire in
a bar early Wednesday, killing 11 people and seriously wounding
four others, police said.
	   The shooting occurred in the Fancisco Morato neighborhood on
city's outskirts at around 4 a.m. (0700 GMT) while people were
still celebrating Brazil's 3-0 victory over Morocco in the World
Cup, said Police Chief Eduardo Salles Pitta.
	   Three women and possibly a minor were among the dead, Pitta
said.
	   Police believe the killings, which they characterized as
execution-style because most of the victims were shot in the head,
were drug-related and that the bar was a drug-selling spot.
	   Police had no suspects.
	   Pitta said the killings mark the largest number of deaths in a
single shooting in the greater Sao Paulo area. About 45 massacres
have claimed 160 lives in Sao Paulo this year.

EU rebuilding Bosnian Croat refugees' pre-war homes 
</HEADLINE>
By NERMINA DURMIC-KAHROVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ULICE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In an attempt to help displaced
Bosnian Croats to return, the European Union is spending 13 million
German marks (about dlrs 7 million) to rebuild their pre-war homes.
	   The project includes reconstructing 300 houses in four villages
near the northern town of Brcko, officials said Wednesday.
	   Since the villages were destroyed during the Bosnian war, the
project also includes rebuilding the water supply and electricity
systems as well as a school and hospital.
	   At least 300 new jobs are to be created by the project.
	   The villages, situated on the former front line, belong to the
Brcko municipality and are under Bosnian Serb control.
	   An international arbitrator has yet to decide the fate of Brcko
and the villages _ whether they ultimately become part of the
Muslim-Croat Federation or remain under the control of the Bosnian
Serbs' substate.
	   The international supervisor for Brcko, Robert Farrand, said
about 1,000 applications were issued last year to refugees wanting
to return to the Brcko area.
	   But just 18 of those were issued to Bosnian Croat families, he
said, stressing that the effort to return refugees should also
include Bosnian Croats.
	   Reconstruction work on the houses is to be finished this summer.
The whole project is expected to be completed by next March, said
Colin Coyle, manager of Mercy Corps Europe-Scottish European Aid,
the organization in charge.

Consultant, two others arrested in ticket scam case 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with more details; ADDS byline
By CHRISTOPHE BERNARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities have arrested three people,
including a consultant for a subsidiary of the World Cup's
marketing agency, in a probe of ticket fraud, police officials said
Wednesday.
	   More arrests could follow after police arrested the consultant
for ISL France at his home Monday in the upscale western Paris
suburb of Rueil-Malmaison, said the officials, who spoke under the
department rules of anonymity.
	   Investigators found a large amount of cash and about 100 World
Cup tickets at the home of the consultant, identified as Gilles
Favard.
	   ISL Worldwide, which has a minority stake in ISL France and is
the marketing agency for soccer's international body FIFA, said it
was conducting an audit of the French company's books.
	   The arrests came after more than 12,000 Japanese fans were left
ticketless for the World Cup, among a number of cases that have
plagued the handling of tickets for the soccer championship that
began last week.
	   Two other people were arrested _ Favard's sister and a friend
believed to have helped the consultant sell by tickets by fax, the
police said.
	   ISL France officials were not immediately available for comment.
But a spokesman for the Swiss-based ISL Worldwide said the
consultant worked for an ISL France trade magazine.
	   Favard used ISL letterhead to con ticket agencies or buyers into
paying him for tickets, said Philippe Margraff, ISL Worldwide
senior vice president.
	   ``He used the name and stationery of ISL France, pretending to
be the director of development, which he wasn't, to convince
clients to buy tickets,'' Margraff said in a telephone interview.
``He used the reputation of ISL to get clients. The money was given
directly to that person.''
	   ISL France and a Japanese agency have filed complaints in the
case. ISL Worldwide denounced the fraud in a letter to French
prosecutors last week, Margraff said.
	   Glen Kirton, ISL Worldwide senior vice president, told a news
conference that ISL France ``is an independent company responsible
for its own business and the employment of permanent and
non-permanent persons who operate the business.
	   He said it ``has no relationship with FIFA in any capacity,
either via ISL Worldwide or otherwise.''
	   Judicial authorities were unavailable for comment. World Cup
officials said they knew nothing of the arrests but stressed that
the person involved was a consultant to neither the tournament nor
FIFA, the international soccer federation represented by ISL
Worldwide.
	   The World Cup organizing committee said Sunday it was
aggressively working to track down anyone involved in ticket fraud.
	   A day earlier, French prosecutors said they would investigate
criminal charges against businesses and individuals involved in the
scams.
	   The arrest is the latest development in a more than a year of
controversy surrounding the World Cup ticket sales.
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.7 million tickets
printed, almost 1.5 million were earmarked for interests in the
host country.
	   Soccer federations worldwide and commercial sponsors of the
World Cup received almost 1.2 million tickets to distribute through
their own channels, leaving only 138,000 for the general public.
	   Fans were told to deal with 17 approved agencies worldwide to
get those tickets. But officials said many fans arrived in France
to discover tickets they thought would be waiting for them came
from unlicensed brokers and tour operators, especially in Japan,
where some 12,000 fans were left ticketless.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Cedric Pioline, the runner-up at
Wimbledon last year, was kicked out of the Nottingham Open on
Wednesday for cursing the chair umpire.
	   The French player was trailing Australia's Scott Draper 6-3, 1-1
and was down 0-40 in the third game of the second set when he was
ejected for ``verbal abuse.''
	   ATP Tour officials said Pioline used a strong four-letter word
in arguing a call with umpire Pedro Bravo.
	   ``I don't remember what I said to the umpire but when you get
fed up you don't send flowers _ you're not happy,'' Pioline said.
	   The crowd booed Pioline when he walked off the court after being
ejected by tournament supervisor Gerry Armstrong.
	   Pioline, who reached the semifinals at the French Open last
month, is seeded eighth for Wimbledon starting next week.
	   He faces a heavy fine for the incident and also loses whatever
prize money he would have earned from the tournament and gets zero
points for computer rankings.
	   Pioline claimed the default was unfair.
	   ``If the top players say something, nothing happens,'' he said.
``Everyone says tennis is getting boring but if you say things you
get defaulted.''
	   Draper said the situation was unfortunate and called for
consistency in adherence to rules.
	   ``He said something in French that I believe was pretty
unpleasant,'' Draper said. ``It's never nice to win a match that
way but these things happen.''
	   The incident arose after Pioline thought a let should have been
called on his serve. He lost the point when Draper hit a forehand
return for a winner.
	   Pioline walked up to Bravo and started shouting at him.
	   The Chilean umpire immediately called a code violation for
verbal abuse, then suspended play and called for tournament
supervisor Armstrong.
	   Armstrong spoke with Bravo and Pioline before announcing, ``Code
violation, verbal abuse. Default Mr. Pioline.''
	   In 1996, the ATP Tour specified that a player can face automatic
default _ rather than just a warning or point penalty _ if he
verbally or physically abuses an umpire.
	   Andre Agassi was kicked out of the RCA Championships in
Indianapolis in 1996 for cursing officials, while John McEnroe was
booted from the Australian Open for verbal abuse in 1990.
	   At the French Open last month, Gustavo Kuerten was disqualified
in a doubles match for throwing his racket at the chair umpire.

Governments to sign global telecommunications relief pact 
</HEADLINE>
By MATTI HUUHTANEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TAMPERE, Finland (AP) _ Hoping to save thousands of lives in
global catastrophes and major accidents, 94 nations were finalizing
an agreement Wednesday to cut red tape that can hamper the use of
modern telecommunications during international rescue operations.
	   The convention, to be signed Thursday, will provide guidelines
for governments to ease license requirements for telecommunications
equipment used in disaster areas.
	   ``This is the first effort ever to help in this context. We will
be able to save thousands of lives and millions of dollars by
making relief services more efficient,'' said Pekka Tarjanne,
secretary-general of the International Telecommunication Union,
based in Geneva, Switzerland.
	   Since 1970, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural
disasters have caused damage estimated at 120 billion dollars,
killing an average of 100,000 people a year as well as leaving
millions homeless, relief agencies said.
	   ``We can never prevent natural catastrophes, but we can minimize
their effects,'' Tarjanne said. ``One way of doing this is by
easing telecommunications operations.''
	   Rescue operations are often hampered by paperwork at national
borders, with aid teams delayed by visas and customs clearance for
telecommunications and other equipment.
	   Last year, such barriers stalled international relief workers
for three days in reaching earthquake victims at the
Kazakstan-Kyrgyzstan border, Tarjanne said.
	   ``In this way, a minor disaster can become a major one, and we
want to avoid this,'' he said.
	   The agreement also aims to improve telecommunications in
isolated, disaster prone areas.
	   ``This is a step in the right direction and can help us in our
rescue operations,'' said Dominique Loye, from the International
Committee of the Red Cross. ``But it depends on the will of the
countries who sign the convention.''
	   In a written address to conference participants, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the meeting could be a milestone.
	   ``It will enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian
assistance,'' Annan said. ``Today's telecommunication industry
provides us with a multitude of equipment and services, but
national regulatory barriers still hinder the full use of these
valuable tools.''
	   Most of the participating nations were expected to sign the
pact, but countries will have to ratify the agreement. Some nations
are likely to adopt the guidelines immediately.
	   The three-day meeting in Tampere, 170 kilometers (105 miles)
north of the capital, Helsinki, is a follow up to the 1991 Tampere
Declaration on disaster communications.

Government gets left-wing support for package to cool Danish economy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The minority government on Wednesday
won the support it needed in parliament to pass a package of
national budget revisions intended to cool off the buoyant Danish
economy.
	   The state Central Bank and independent economists began calling
for fiscal restraint since last year, warning that the economy
would overheat.
	   In a compromise with two left-wing parties, the coalition's
package offers tax relief for those with low incomes, and sharpens
taxes on high-income Danes. It raises the maximum income tax rate
to 59 percent, one percentage point higher than the rate proposed
by the Social Democratic-led government.
	   With support from the left-wing Socialist People's Party and the
Red-Green Alliance, the two-party ruling coalition's proposal has
the backing of 91 lawmaker, a majority in the 179-seat parliament.
	   The package also includes increased tax deductions for interest
on home loans, and makes a mandatory pension payment of 1 percent
on a wage earners, imposed as a temporary measure last year, into a
permanent part of the tax system.
	   The coalition, which includes the social-liberal Radical Party,
sought support from the left after the Liberal and Conservative
opposition collapsed earlier Wednesday.

UN official says Sudan to help return kidnapped Ugandan children 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Sudanese government has promised to
help secure the return of children abducted by Ugandan rebels and
taken to their bases in southern Sudan, a senior U.N. official said
Wednesday.
	   Olara A. Otunnu, Under Secretary-General and Special
Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, said he obtained
the promise during a three-day stay in the Sudanese capital,
Khartoum.
	   Otunnu said he also visited Juba, the largest town in southern
Sudan still controlled by the government. Much of the southern
third of Sudan _ the largest nation in Africa _ is controlled by
rebels of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army.
	   ``I have every reason to believe the Sudanese government will
continue to cooperate with the United Nations and make better
progress until the matter is resolved,'' Otunnu said.
	   He was referring to the October 1996 kidnapping by rebels of the
Lord's Resistance Army of 152 girls from St. Mary's Roman Catholic
school in northern Uganda. An Italian nun later managed to convince
the rebels to release 109 of the girls.
	   On May 21, the Ugandan government freed 42 Sudanese soldiers in
a deal they thought would secure the release of the remaining
girls. In the meantime, some had escaped and a few had died.
	   Ugandan troops captured the Sudanese soldiers when they chased
LRA rebels across the border into southern Sudan.
	   An angry President Yoweri Museveni, who had agreed to the deal,
said Uganda would have to use force to free the girls.
	   The LRA rebels, who have been battling government troops for 11
years, routinely abduct school boys and girls. The boys are given
military training, while the girls are given chores and some become
``wives'' of LRA officers and favored soldiers.
	   The New York-based group Human Rights Watch estimates that the
LRA has abducted between 8,000 and 10,000 children from northern
Uganda and trained them to attack their home villages and families.
	   Uganda accuses Sudan of providing sanctuary and weapons to the
LRA, a charge Khartoum denies.
	   Otunnu, who is Ugandan, said he also raised the issue with the
Sudanese government of the military recruitment of youths under 18.
He said Sudanese authorities assured him there will be no such
recruitment.
	   Otunnu said he would raise the same issue with SPLA officials in
Kenya.
	   Journalists visiting southern Sudan have seen boys as young as
15 in both government and rebel ranks.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for increased autonomy for
the predominantly Christian, African and animist south,
traditionally dominated by the Muslim and Arabized north.

	   PARIS (AP) _ An ex-prime minister's call to discuss whether
French nationals should get more state benefits than foreigners _ a
gesture to the far right _ triggered more infighting Wednesday
among already bruised conservative parties.
	   Edouard Balladur called in a weekend interview for a commission

World Cup: Chile, Austria 0-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Chile and Austria were tied at 0-0
at halftime Wednesday as the feared strikeforce of Marcelo Salas
and Ivan Zamorano failed to force Austria's Michael Konsel to make
a single save in the first 45 minutes.
	   In a disappointing opening half at the Geoffrey Guichard
stadium, there were few chances to thrill the crowd.
	   Chile moved the ball around well and, after Nelson Parraguez won
possession on the halfway line in the 22nd minute, the confident
South Americans strung together a slick five-man move which ended
in a long-range Zamorano header wide of the target.
	   But, with the Austrian strikeforce kept at bay by a
well-organized Chilean defense and midfield, neither goalkeeper had
anything to save until the 42nd minute when Chile's Nelson Tapia
dived to hold the ball at the foot of the post from an angled cross
from Heimo Pfeifenberger.
	   Chile's Moises Villarroel moved into a good shooting position 25
meters from goal from a neat pass by Fabian Estay but Austrian
goalkeeper Michael Konsel watched it fly well wide of the post.
	   Austria's first shot at goal didn't come until the 38th minute
when Mario Haas fired goalwards from 18 meters. It was on target
but it was blocked by a Chilean defender long before it would have
reached 'keeper Tapia.
	   Lineups:
	   Austria _ Michael Konsel; Peter Schoettel, Anton Pfeffer,
Wolfgang Feiersinger, Mario Haas; Heimo Pfeifenberger, Harald
Cerny, Arnold Wetl, Roman Maehlich; Dietmar Kuehbauer, Anton
Polster.
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier
Margas, Moises Villarroel; Francisco Rojas, Nelson Parraguez,
Clarence Acuna, Fabian Estay; Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   Referee _ Gamal Ghandour, Egypt.

political opponents emboldened by a high court ruling protecting
their right to say he had collaborated with the former East German
secret police.
	   Brandenburg governor Manfred Stolpe has never denied that, as
the Lutheran church's top legal advisor in the former East Germany,
he often communicated with communist leaders and the Ministry for
State Security, or Stasi.
	   But Stolpe denies having collaborated with the Stasi.
	   He lost an important court battle on Tuesday when Germany's
highest appeals court said that a politician from Germany's leading
political party, the Christian Democrats, could say he was a Stasi
informer even though it has not been proven.
	   The court said the statement was protected by freedom of
expression, a basic right guaranteed by Germany's constitution.
	   The reaction to the ruling emphasized enormous differences
remaining between eastern and western Germans eight years after
reunification.
	   Politicians from Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and
its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, immediately
called for Stolpe, a Social Democrat, to step down. ``Stolpe is no
longer politically acceptable,'' Peter Ramsauer, CSU parliamentary
floor leader, told the Neue Osnabruecker newspaper.
	   However, politicians in the former east Germany, without regard
to party, rallied behind Stolpe, as did former East German human
rights activists, many who paid dearly for their opposition to the
former communist regime.
	   Noted east German Lutheran theologian, Friedrich Schorlemmer, an
expert on the psychological barriers dividing the nation despite
reunification, called the court ruling ``disastrous for the
situation between east and west Germany.''
	   Resigning ``would be like an admission of guilt,'' he said.
	   Former East German human rights activist Guenter Nooke told
Berlin's Inforadio that while the ``facts were against,'' Stolpe,
voters reelected him in 1994. ``This must be accepted.''
	   Even a member of Kohl's party in Stolpe's home state, Peter
Wagner, saw no reason for the governor to step down. Wagner said
that an investigation concluded in 1994 found that Stolpe had
damaged neither individuals nor the church through his contacts
with the secret police.
	   The Social Democratic party chairman in Brandenburg state, Klaus
Ness, said the calls for Stolpe's resignation were ``election
campaign hysteria.'' He said they would not be considered.
	   Stolpe's attorney, Oliver Claus, said the governor may choose to
appeal the ruling to the federal Constitutional Court.

Wiesenthal calls report on Swiss Nazis exaggerated 
</HEADLINE>
By ALISON SMALE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal on Wednesday
dismissed as exaggerated a report from the Los Angeles-based center
bearing his name that depicts neutral Switzerland as a land of Nazi
sympathizers during World War II.
	   The report, surveying Nazi and pro-Nazi groups in Switzerland
from 1939-45, was the second by American historian Alan M. Schrom
to paint a distorted picture of the Swiss role in World War II,
Wiesenthal said.
	   ``Both sides must always be shown,'' he told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview.
	   He said he had obtained the latest report only Tuesday, and
recommended that the Simon Wiesenthal Center not use Schrom again.
	   ``I think this is the last time he will be used (by the center)
as a historian,'' Wiesenthal said, adding that Schrom's speciality
was French colonial policy.
	   ``He does not need to say things like ... the Swiss today are
just as greedy for money'' as he suggests they were during World
War II, Wiesenthal said. ``These are things he can say, but our
center should not publish this in this way.''
	   He cited as evidence of bias what he said was Schrom's listing
of Vaterland (Fatherland) and other ``small'' pro-Nazi groups, as
well as pro-Nazi newspapers in Switzerland in the 1930s. Schrom
does not show ``there was also something else,'' Wiesenthal added.
	   In his first report for the center, Schrom discussed some 40
labor camps in Switzerland for detainees during World War II,
Wiesenthal said.
	   Certainly, ``he spoke to a few inmates who really suffered, but
these labor camps cannot be compared to Nazi camps,'' said
Wiesenthal, who survived several Nazi death camps, including
Mauthausen in Austria, where he was liberated in 1945 by U.S.
troops.
	   Wiesenthal, 89, heads the Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna
and has devoted the past 53 years to tracking down Nazis and
speaking out against neo-Nazism.
	   Wiesenthal said he accepted Schrom's depiction of the
connections of Eduard von Steiger, Swiss minister of justice after
World War II, to Vaterland and other pro-Nazi groups.
	   ``But from this man 50 years ago somehow to draw consequences
about a general picture of Swiss citizens is very bold,''
Wiesenthal said.
	   Wiesenthal said that from 1940, when the Nazis occupied France,
Switzerland was an island surrounded by Nazi-occupied or allied
countries, and acted in a more friendly way towards Adolf Hitler in
order not to be occupied.
	   ``They had to survive,'' he said, noting that Switzerland
provided shelter for tens of thousands of Jewish refugees.

Venus Williams routed in grass-court match 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: updates with other results, Graf quotes
<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ Venus Williams suffered an
embarrassing defeat on her 18th birthday Wednesday when she was
trounced 6-2, 6-1 by Natasha Zvereva at the Wimbledon warmup
tournament at Eastbourne.
	   Playing in a cold, blustery wind, the fourth-seeded American had
trouble adapting her game to the grass that had been removed from
the old No. 1 court at Wimbledon and transported to Eastbourne.
	   Williams rarely came to the net and rarely attempted a volley,
preferring instead to rally from the baseline. She was repeatedly
outplayed by Zvereva, a doubles specialist from Belarus who mixed
up her game and took the pace off the ball with heavy slice.
	   In the final game, Williams double-faulted and then sent a
forehand soaring over the baseline on match point to end a dismal
performance.
	   ``I was very inconsistent and didn't play well,'' she said. ``I
didn't serve well at all. ... I played poorly. That's the word.''
	   Williams had only two days of practice on grass before the
match, and felt she had not approached it in the right way.
	   ``I've learned that I'm going to have to practice harder and be
more serious in my practices,'' she said. ``I wasn't overconfident,
but in practice I should play every point as if I were in a match.
Sometimes when I practice I try a lot of different things instead
of really focusing.''
	   Williams' younger sister, Serena, fared better. She reached the
quarterfinals by beating No. 8 seed Ai Sugiyama of Japan 6-2, 7-5,
and will next face No. 3 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who beat Tamarine
Tanasugarn of Thailand by the same score.
	   Top seeded Jana Novotna advanced with a 6-2, 6-2 winner over
French qualifier Nathalie Dechy, while No. 2 Steffi Graf eased past
Britain's Samantha Smith 6-1, 6-2.
	   Graf will next face No. 6 Anna Kournikova, a 6-4, 6-1 winner
over Mariaan De Swardt of South Africa.
	   Graf, playing only her fourth tournament since undergoing knee
surgery a year ago, declared herself completely satisfied with her
fitness and preparation for Wimbledon.
	   ``It wasn't easy out there with all the wind, but with the
circumstances I don't think I could have played that much better,''
she said.
	   Graf said she has been able to practice up to 3 1/2 hours a day.
	   ``I think I'm getting towards playing the way I want to,'' she
said. ``My preparations for Wimbledon are going the way I hoped
they would. I think I'm on schedule and I feel good about my
draw.''
	   Also advancing was No. 5 Irina Spirlea of Romania, who beat
Italy's Rita Grande 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in a match suspended overnight by
rain, and then Kerry Anne Guse of Australia 6-0, 7-5.
	   Former champion and No. 7 Nathalie Tauziat of France was ousted
6-2, 4-6, 8-6 by Russia's Elena Likhovtseva. The Russian was later
beaten 6-4, 7-5 by Magui Serna of Spain.

Ex-president Cossiga comes to Andreotti's defense in Sicily 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos
<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ Former President Francesco Cossiga on
Wednesday gave ex-Premier Giulio Andreotti, accused of helping the
Mafia, one of his strongest defenses yet in the 2 1-2 year-old
trial here.
	   Testifying for the defense, Cossiga focused on what he described
as a fierce crusade by Andreotti while in power against organized
crime.
	   Testifying about the 1970s and 1980s, when Andreotti was several
times a Christian Democrat premier and he served as premier and
interior minister and later as Italian president, Cossiga told the
court that Andreotti ``was obsessed on coming up with special
(anti-Mafia) laws that I considered bordering on illegality.''
	   Cossiga recalled reluctantly signing a 1991 decree converting
into law a measure proposed by Andreotti to keep Mafia bosses in
jail after their maximum custody limits ran out during long trials.
	   Cossiga, a former Christian Democrat and like Andreotti now a
senator-for-life, recalled telling Andreotti: ``I'm signing this
decree, but I don't consider it a law, I consider it a necessary
act of war.''
	   The trial on charges of Mafia association began in September
1995, and the prosecution called its last witness in April.
	   Andreotti has repeatedly denied the accusations, which are
largely based on testimony from ex-mobsters, including one who told
the court that the ex-premier received a kiss of respect from
Salvatore Riina, the reputed top boss of Cosa Nostra who was
arrested in 1993.
	   Andreotti, 79, claims he is the victim of a vendetta because of
his governments' actions against organized crime.

Reports: Nigeria offers incentive ahead of Bulgaria match 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian authorities have promised match
bonuses of dlrs 15,000 to each player if the national team beats
Bulgaria in its second World Cup match on Friday, newspapers
reported here Wednesday.
	   Group D leader Nigeria would virtually guarantee a spot in the
next round of play if they emerge victorious over Bulgaria in the
second match for each team at Paris stadium.
	   Players had squabbled with football officials prior to the
tournament over the issue of match payments.
	   Nigerians basked in a wave of national pride on Saturday when
the team pulled off a stunning come-from-behind 3-2 win over Spain.
	   The country has recently gone through a period of emotional
turmoil, including the death of military leader Gen. Sani Abacha
and mixed signals of promised reforms, protest clampdowns and
prisoner releases from the new leader, Gen. Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar.

Tajik leader of U.N. security force found dead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The deputy commander of a special
squad assigned to protect United Nations officials was found dead
in the Tajik capital on Wednesday.
	   The guard unit was formed just two months ago as a joint
operation by the Tajik government and its mostly Muslim opposition,
who ended a five-year civil war in the Central Asian country with a
peace pact last year.
	   Opposition leaders immediately issued statements demanding the
government find and punish those responsible for the death of Usmon
Khodzhayev.
	   ``This is not the first provocation against opposition
commanders this month,'' the statement said.
	   Khodzhayev appeared to have been shot Tuesday night as he was
returning home, the Interfax news agency reported, citing
opposition spokesmen in the former Soviet republic.
	   Khodzhayev was one of a number of members of the opposition who
had taken up government posts after the peace deal.
	   President Emomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Said Abdullo
Nuri held a three-hour private meeting Wednesday to discuss the
appointment of the opposition figures to the newly integrated
government.
	   Under the peace pact, the opposition is supposed to be granted
30 percent of the government's executive positions. Nuri has
complained that Rakhmonov has been slow to approve nominations, and
only a handful of opposition members have taken up their new posts.
	   The United Nations, which brokered Tajikistan's peace accord,
has 70 military observers in the country.

	   SPRINGFIELD, Massachusetts (AP) _ Charles ``Red'' Silvia, who
coached more than 200 All-America swimmers and an Olympic gold
medal winner during his 41 years at Springfield College, has died.
He was 87.
	   Silvia, who died Tuesday, graduated from Springfield in 1934,
won a New England championship and set several U.S. college
records. He coached and taught lifesaving at the college from 1937
until his retirement in 1978.
	   His teams won 214 meets and 10 New England championships.
	   In 1976, Silvia was elected to the International Swimming Hall
of Fame and later served as chairman of its board of directors.
	   Dr. William Yorzyk, who came to Springfield College as a
non-swimmer in 1950, won a gold medal in the butterfly at the 1956
Melbourne Olympics under Silvia's tutelage.
	   Silvia was also an author and promoter of water safety and
lifesaving skills and was the first to advocate mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation, said Springfield College professor Charles Smith.
	   Silvia is survived by two daughters and three grandchildren.

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Cedric Pioline, the runner-up at
Wimbledon last year, was kicked out of the Nottingham Open on
Wednesday for cursing the chair umpire.
	   The French player was trailing Australia's Scott Draper 6-3, 1-1
and was down 0-40 in the third game of the second set when he was
ejected for ``verbal abuse.''
	   ATP Tour officials said Pioline used a strong four-letter word
in arguing a call with umpire Pedro Bravo.
	   ``I don't remember what I said to the umpire but when you get
fed up you don't send flowers _ you're not happy,'' Pioline said.
	   The crowd booed Pioline when he walked off the court after being
ejected by tournament supervisor Gerry Armstrong.
	   ``I don't want to say what he said but it was verbal abuse,''
Armstrong asid. ``It was said in French but the umpire understands
French.''
	   Pioline, who reached the semifinals at the French Open last
month, is seeded eighth for Wimbledon starting next week.
	   He faces a heavy fine for the incident and also loses whatever
prize money he would have earned from the tournament and gets zero
points for computer rankings. This tournament must also be included
in his top 14 performances for ranking purposes.
	   Pioline claimed the default was unfair.
	   ``If the top players say something, nothing happens,'' he said.
``Everyone says tennis is getting boring but if you say things you
get defaulted.''
	   Draper said the situation was unfortunate and called for
consistency in adherence to rules.
	   ``He said something in French that I believe was pretty
unpleasant,'' Draper said. ``It's never nice to win a match that
way but these things happen.''
	   The incident arose after Pioline thought a let should have been
called on his serve. He lost the point when Draper hit a forehand
return for a winner.
	   Pioline walked up to Bravo and started shouting at him.
	   The Chilean umpire immediately called a code violation for
verbal abuse, then suspended play and called for tournament
supervisor Armstrong.
	   Armstrong spoke with Bravo and Pioline before announcing, ``Code
violation, verbal abuse. Default Mr. Pioline.''
	   In 1996, the ATP Tour specified that a player can face automatic
default _ rather than just a warning or point penalty _ if he
verbally or physically abuses an umpire.
	   Andre Agassi was kicked out of the RCA Championships in
Indianapolis in 1996 for cursing officials, while John McEnroe was
booted from the Australian Open for verbal abuse in 1990.
	   At the French Open last month, Gustavo Kuerten was disqualified
in a doubles match for throwing his racket at the chair umpire.

Turkish Cypriot sentenced to 10 years for spying for Cyprus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Turkish Cypriot military court on
Wednesday convicted a man of spying for the Greek-Cypriot side of
the island and sentenced him to 10 years in prison, the Turkish
news agency Anatolia reported.
	   Cengiz Fevzioglu, a Turkish Cypriot, was convicted for taking
pictures of military sites in the Turkish-occupied north and
handing them over to Cyprus.
	   Fevzioglu, 45, obtained the information while working as a
driver for a military unit, the Turkish news agency Anatolia
reported.
	   Turkey has maintained 30,000 troops in the northern part of
Cyprus since it invaded the island in 1974, following a failed coup
by supporters of union with Greece.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian authorities have promised match
bonuses of dlrs 15,000 to each player if the national team beats
Bulgaria in its second World Cup match on Friday, newspapers
reported here Wednesday.
	   Group D leader Nigeria would virtually guarantee a spot in the
next round of play if they emerge victorious over Bulgaria in the
second match for each team at Paris stadium.
	   Players had squabbled with football officials prior to the
tournament over the issue of match payments.
	   Nigerians basked in a wave of national pride on Saturday when
the team pulled off a stunning come-from-behind 3-2 win over Spain.
	   The country has recently gone through a period of emotional
turmoil, including the death of military leader Gen. Sani Abacha
and mixed signals of promised reforms, protest clampdowns and
prisoner releases from the new leader, Gen. Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar.

Hearing on murder of Italians in Argentine `dirty-war' begins 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A judge on Wednesday began considering an indictment
request for seven Argentine military officials charged with
murdering several Italian citizens during Argetina's so-called
``dirty war.''
	   Prosecutors sustain the officials slayed at least eight Italians
and possibly as many as 10 during Argentina's military dictatorship
in the mid-1970s. Thousands of people died during the dirty war
from systematic torture and murder by the military.
	   The Italian government has joined a civil lawsuit attached to
the criminal proceedings.
	   None of the seven defendants were in court for Wednesday's
session which was adjourned shortly after it began for a
technicality. No new date has been set.

Polish premier vows tough measures for striking train engineers

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek declared a
strike that idled at least 30 percent of Poland's trains illegal
Wednesday and said tough measures would be taken against the
striking engineers.
	   The engineers, who are seeking pay increases and early
retirement plans, failed to take all negotiating steps legally
required before being permitted to strike, Buzek said.
	   Buzek pledged ``tough consequences'' for strikers, who went off
the job at midnight. He did not elaborate, but railroad officials
said Tuesday that strikers could be fired.
	   Buzek said the government was ready for pay talks with the union
that called the strike, and urged them to go back to work in time
for school holidays starting Saturday.
	   ``This is not a good way of solving problems,'' Buzek said.
	   According to government estimates, 850 engineers were on strike.
	   Union leader Jan Zaborowski claimed the strike had idled 50
percent of the trains, while railroad officials said about 30
percent of passenger trains and 60 percent of freight trains were
canceled.
	   All international and inter-city trains were running, according
to state railroad director Krzysztof Supa, who predicted that the
situation should not worsen.
	   Non-striking engineers and buses were mobilized to minimize
disruption. Railway officials estimated the action will cost them
21 million zlotys (dlrs 6.1 million) daily.
	   Engineers belonging to the right-wing Solidarity union refused
to join the leftist union that called the strike, the Trade Union
of Train Engineers. Solidarity engineers maintained the strike was
not over money but was intended to sow political trouble.
	   Zaborowski said the union went forward with its strike because
government spokesman Jaroslaw Sellin refused to apologize for
saying the strike plans were politically motivated.
	   The engineers say they want their monthly pay of about 1,000
zlotys (dlrs 300) to be increased by 300 zlotys (dlrs 88).
	   They also want to be eligible for retirement at 55 if they have
worked for at least 20 years, and want the age limit dropped even
lower if they've worked at least 30 years. The current retirement
age is 65 for men and 60 for women.
	   In addition, the engineers want the government to spend more
money annually on the railroad, which is strapped for cash but
needs to lower prices to compete with cheaper road travel.
	   The Polish rail carries 1.1 million passengers and some 600,000
tons of goods daily.

Italian homemakers may soon have to buy disability insurance 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italians who stay home to cook, clean and take care
of the kids may soon be forced to buy insurance to pay for injuries
sustained while performing these tasks.
	   Italian newspapers on Wednesday reported that the Chamber of
Deputies has passed a bill which would oblige homemakers ages 18 to
65 to pay an annual fee of 25,000 lire (dlrs 14) for disability
insurance.
	   Italian homemaker groups, who have long-campaigned to have their
duties in the home recognized as ``work,'' greeted the law with
jubilation.
	   ``The mandatory insurance is a first and fundamental recognition
of the fact that people work at home just as they do in a
factory,'' said Federica Rossi Gasparrini, a top Labor Ministry
official and head of an association of Italian homemakers.
	   However, at other jobs, the employer is obliged to pay for
disability insurance for its workers.
	   The state will pay the fee for homemakers in households where
income is less than 9 million lire (dlrs 5,000) per year.
	   The bill now goes before the Senate for final approval.

U.S. claims world court could become forum for `every imaginable complaint' 
</HEADLINE>

By CANDICE HUGHES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) - A world criminal court might lose sight of its
mission to try only the most horrendous crimes, like genocide, and
become an overwhelmed forum for ``every imaginable complaint,'' the
United States said Wednesday.
	   Taking a stance at odds with most close allies and human rights
groups, U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson said giving the court an
independent prosecutor could muddy the tribunal's mandate.
	   ``We must not turn an international criminal court _ or its
prosecutor into a human rights ombudsman open to, and responsible
for responding to any and all complaints from any source,'' he said
at treaty talks on the court.
	   A large coalition of other nations, including Britain, Canada
and other allies, do not share the American doubts.
	   They point to the extremely short list of crimes the court would
handle and say it needs a prosecutor who can initiate cases
independently.
	   France, which shared many U.S. positions on the court, broke
ranks Wednesday on the idea of an independent prosecutor.
	   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine announced it now favors the idea
as long as a judicial panel reviews and approves cases.
	   Staking out increasingly lonely ground, the United States wants
cases to come from just two sources: the U.N. Security Council,
where it has a veto, and states.
	   As now envisioned, the court would step in only when national
courts fail to act. It would try individuals for three offenses:
war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.
	   Some want aggression added to the list; the United States is
against this.
	   Envoys from 157 countries are spending five weeks in Rome trying
to hammer out a treaty to create the world's first permanent
criminal tribunal.
	   On the defensive, Richardson pointed to the U.S. record of
backing war crimes tribunals from Nuremberg to Rwanda and suggested
the court needs U.S. backing to succeed.
	   ``The court cannot be the creation of a single group of
nations,'' he insisted.
	   Allies have said they'll go ahead without the United States if
need be, as they did on the recent treaty banning land mines.
	   A key force driving the U.S. stance is pressure from the
Pentagon, which has troops in dozens of countries, and from
conservatives to keep Americans out of the court's reach.
	   Richardson said Wednesday the treaty must protect ``soldiers
deployed far from home'' from ``exposure to politicized
proceedings.''
	   Proponents of an independent prosecutor say it will keep the
court from becoming a feeble pawn subject to the veto of the
Security Council's five permanent members.
	   One of the few undisputed proposals on the table at Rome is the
location of the court _ if the conference manages to produce a
treaty.
	   Delegates have given their informal approval to The Hague, site
of the World Court, which handles disputes between nations.

Croatia asks extradition of Yugoslavs who killed policemen 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia has asked neighboring Yugoslavia
to extradite seven people suspected of killing two Croat policemen
on the border, Deputy Interior Minister Josko Moric said Wednesday.
	   Moric said Yugoslav police acknowledged that the seven are in
Yugoslavia.
	   Authorities say they killed the Croat policemen in a shootout
late Monday in Croatia's easternmost region of eastern Slavonia.
	   Four men are hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and
three are in Yugoslav custody, Croatian police said after meeting
with Yugoslav colleagues in Yugoslavia on Tuesday. It was the first
such professional meeting since the 1991 Serbo-Croat war.
	   Yugoslavia's response to the extradition request is expected
later this week, Moric said, according to the state-run news agency
HINA.
	   The Croatian policemen, 31-year-old Milan Arambasic and
28-year-old Nedjeljko Kocijan, were killed while guarding Croatia's
border with Yugoslavia, which in that area is the river Dunav.
	   The two apparently spotted a group of illegal aliens from
Yugoslavia stealing timber from the rich woods of Kopacki Rit, a
national park. Croatian television said the aliens were cutting
down ash trees, which can be sold for thousands of dollars.
	   Moric said Croatian police increased their presence at that part
of the border.

Lawyer for former Nazi slaves rejects federal fund plan as unrealistic 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BREMEN, Germany (AP) _ A lawyer for 30 Hungarian Jews forced to
work for Volkswagen during World War II on Wednesday rejected a
proposal to establish a federally administrated fund to compensate
former slave laborers.
	   Klaus von Muenchhausen, who plans to sue Volkswagen for back
wages on behalf of the 30 slave laborers, said the suggested fund
is ``legally unrealistic.'' He said companies forced to pay into
similar funds in the past successfully sued to cease payments.
	   The fund was proposed by chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder,
who is a member of VW's supervisory board. The fund would be
federally administered, but based on contributions from companies
who used Nazi slave labor.
	   Sabine Hack, a Schroeder government spokeswoman in Hanover, said
VW has indicated that it might accept such an arrangement.
	   On Friday, Muenchhausen said he planned to file a lawsuit
seeking back wages for the 30 Hungarian Jews, who are now in their
70s. As teen-agers in 1944-45, they had been sent from the
Auschwitz concentration camp to Volkswagen's factory in Wolfsburg
to produce armaments, he said.
	   Volkswagen, in a letter dated Monday, said the Nazi government
was responsible for the forced labor and that the Hungarians should
place their claims with the regime's successor, the current German
government.
	   Muenchhausen's clients, like other Nazi victims who wound up
behind the Iron Curtain, were unable to seek government restitution
in the early postwar years.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Hundreds of Eritreans rounded up for
deportation by the Ethiopian government reached their homeland
Wednesday at the end of an arduous, dusty three-day trip aboard
packed buses, angry Eritrean officials said Wednesday.
	   ``The Ethiopian government continues to pursue its witch-hunt of
Eritreans with greater intensity,'' a government statement said.
	   The deportations were the latest salvo fired in the Horn of
Africa countries' nearly six-week-old border conflict. No fighting
was reported Wednesday
	   A delegation of African leaders was scheduled to meet Thursday
with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and with Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki in a bid to prevent the clashes that broke
out May 6 from escalating into full-scale war.
	   Thirsty and hungry, the deported Eritreans arrived in the border
town of Om Hajer, 310 kilometers (190 miles) southwest of Asmara
and near the Sudanese border, said presidential adviser Yemane
Gebremeskel.
	   Eritreans said 800 were expelled, while Ethiopians put the
figure at 500. About 550,000 Eritreans live in Ethiopia, mostly in
the capital and the northern provinces.
	   The Ethiopian government said the deportees posed security
risks, for example because they had military training, or were
raising funds for the Eritrean war effort.
	   In Asmara, relatives reported that hundreds more Eritreans were
being rounded up at Guellele in the suburbs of Ethiopian capital
Addis Ababa. But Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse
sharply denied the reports, calling them ``absolutely false.''
	   An Asmara businessman said his 70-year-old father was abruptly
taken from his Addis Ababa home of 57 years by military police
Sunday night and hauled to a military barracks on the outskirts of
the capital.
	   On Monday, he was ordered onto a bus to Eritrea, via the longest
and worst route, the son said, speaking on condition of anonymity
because he feared retaliation against other relatives living in
Addis Ababa.
	   ``They were badly treated, abused, told they were parasites,
spies, acting for the Eritrean government,'' the son said. ``My
father hasn't got a strong bond with Eritrea, he's not a spy and
he's too old for military duty.''
	   Also Wednesday, hundreds of Ethiopians displaced by the fighting
waited under the cover of eucalyptus trees to recieve food rations
in Adigrat, where an Eritrean air strike killed four people and
destroyed a grain warehouse last week.
	   ``We would rather not have to be here, but at least we can take
cover under the trees,'' said Tesfaye Gebru, who arrived in Adigrat
with his wife and 2-week-old child the day of the bombing. ``We
came to Adigrat because we expected it to be peaceful.''
	   The Ethiopian government has accused Eritrea of expelling
thousands of its citizens, a charged denied by Eritrea. The
Eritrean government has insisted that the 100,000 Ethiopians living
within its boundaries not be harassed in radio and TV
announcements.
	   In an effort to restore peace between the one-time allies in a
successful war to oust Ethiopia's Marxist dictator in 1991, African
leaders chosen by the Organization of African Unity were to meet in
Addis Ababa on Thursday.
	   Burkina Faso President Blaise Campaore, as current OAU chief,
will lead the delegation that also includes Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu and OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.
Another member of the delegation, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe,
arrived Wednesday; Djibouti President Hassan Gouled Aptidon was
receiving medical treatment in France, and was expected to send a
representative.

Bizarre denouement in conflict over ambassadors' homes in Belarus 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The president of Belarus laid claim to a
neighborhood of ambassadors' homes on Wednesday, but then backed
down and said diplomats could continue living in the compound
during water and sewer repairs.
	   Late Wednesday, the British Embassy announced that President
Alexander Lukashenko had agreed to let the ambassadors stay, but
provided no other details.
	   The diplomatic dispute has raged since April, when the
government of this former Soviet republic tried to evict about two
dozen ambassadors from their homes in the pleasant wooded compound
in Drozdy, saying the water and sewage system needed urgent
repairs.
	   The conflict took an odd turn Wednesday morning, when diplomats
saw a new sign hanging at the entrance: ``The residence of the
President of the Republic of Belarus.''
	   Lukashenko has a home adjacent to the diplomatic compound on the
outskirts of Minsk, and has said previously that he's not keen on
having diplomats as neighbors. Moreover, in a news conference last
week he suggested that the compound by rights should be his home.
	   ``The Drozdy compound is the head of state's residence, you
should know,'' Lukashenko said. ``But today, across the fence at
the distance of 50 meters, we have foreign representatives _ the
U.S., Germany, Italy, India and others.''
	   Ambassadors from Bulgaria and some former Soviet republics have
left the compound, but the U.S. ambassador and others want to stay
during the repairs. They argue that under the Vienna Convention,
ambassadors' residences are sovereign territory and the host
country has no right to force them out.
	   The compromise between Lukashenko and the diplomats was
apparently reached at a briefing for the ambassadors at the Foreign
Ministry.
	   ``Nobody is evicting anyone, not today or tomorrow,'' said Col.
Mikhail Tesovets, the head of Lukashenko's personal guard service.
	   The British Embassy released a short statement saying the
compromise will permit the ambassadors to remain in their homes.
	   ``The solution takes account of the repair and technical work
required to (the) premises and of the requirements of ambassadors
consistent with their status and rights under the Vienna
Convention,'' the statement said, without providing details.
	   Officials at the British and U.S. Embassies contacted by The
Associated Press refused to provide further information. The
British ambassador does not live in the Drozdy compound but helped
negotiate the agreement on behalf of the diplomatic corps.
	   Belarusian authorities say that the sewage and plumbing system
in the 1940s-era compound is badly antiquated and requires urgent
repairs.
	   However, the embassies point out that the embassies hold valid
leases, some of which were signed the same month as they were
ordered to leave.

World Cup: Blatter says referees must get tougher 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The predicted flood of red cards due to FIFA's new
directive to punish tackles from behind with ejections has not
flowed _ and it's not necessarily because defenders have altered
their tactics.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said Wednesday that referees have
not been protecting offensive players or always issuing the
mandated red card for the sliding, studs-up tackles.
	   ``You have to protect the players and especially the key players
that make the game, the show,'' Blatter said. ``For a tackle from
behind, the sanction is a red card.''
	   Overall, Blatter called the officiating good but not perfect.
	   ``In the last games I saw some tackles from behind that weren't
sanctioned and especially yesterday there was an attack on a player
that went unsanctioned,'' Blatter said referring to the challenge
from Morocco's Said Chiba that delivered his studs into the thigh
of Brazil's Ronaldo during Tuesday's match.
	   Referees have also ``forgotten'' the rule that goalkeepers must
release the ball within six seconds and may not take more than four
steps, Blatter said.
	   Blatter said FIFA will remind referees of the rules and
directives regarding the issues, but rejected the notion that it
would put undue influence on the referees to issue red cards
indiscriminately.
	   ``If calling referees to their duties and reminding them of
their instructions puts them under pressure, they are not in the
right place here,'' Blatter said.
	   He said it was not out of the question that he would travel to
the referees base camp in Seine-et-Marne to personally remind
referees of the rules.
	   Blatter denied rumors that the referee Lucien Bouchardeau from
Niger was sent home for his performance in the Chile-Italy game.
Blatter said Bouchardeau ``did his job correctly.''
	   Bouchardeau has been criticized for his calling of a penalty on
Ronald Fuentes in the 84th minute, converted by Roberto Baggio,
that gave Italy a 2-2 draw.
	   Baggio's cross inadvertently struck the dangling arm of Fuentes
standing in the penalty area, resulting in the penalty.
	   Blatter said he didn't understand what all the fuss was about.
	   ``He made a decision over a handball. The player touched the
ball with his hand. Whether it was voluntary or not, he changed the
trajectory of the ball. It was in the penalty area,'' Blatter said.
	   Bouchardeau was not relieved of his duties and Blatter added he
thought that ``his opinion was fair.''

De Beers continues to restrict diamond supply to support prices 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The world's biggest producer
of diamonds, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., said Wednesday that
a continuing slump in consumer demand has prompted the firm to
restrict supply.
	   De Beers said sales fell by 41 percent to dlrs 1.70 billion in
the first half of 1998, compared with record sales in the first
half of 1997.
	   The latest half-year figures from De Beers' London-based
marketing arm, the Central Selling organization, are the worst
since the second half of 1994 when total gem sales amounted to dlrs
1.67 billion, Dow Jones Newswires reported.
	   De Beers blamed the decline on persistent economic woes in key
Asian markets.
	   Against the second half of 1997, sales fell by only 3.4 percent.
	   ``The impact of the South East Asia problems, which affected
retail sales only in the second half of 1997, is likely to result
in a further reduction in overall global diamond consumption in
1998,'' De Beers said in a statement.
	   In an effort to maintain prices, the CSO has reduced supply of
rough diamonds to the cutting centers ``below the level of retail
consumption,'' a statement said.
	   Current stocks of rough and polished diamonds is now dlrs 1
billion lower than in July 1997, De Beers said.
	   The world's premier diamond company said the supply reduction
had lifted trade confidence but described the recovery as ``still
fragile.''
	   De Beers, which accounts for more than 60 percent of the world's
rough, or uncut, diamond trade, reported strong growth in the
United States, Canada, India and Europe.

Israelis who paid parking tickets feel like `suckers' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A favorite expression came true for many
Israelis Wednesday, a day after the Supreme Court decided that
parking tickets issued before 1995 are invalid: ``Only suckers
pay.''
	   The court ruled Tuesday in favor of a Tel Aviv resident with 154
outstanding parking fines and said the city could no longer collect
fines or impound his car because of unpaid tickets issued between
1989 and 1995.
	   The decision created a three-year statute of limitations on
parking tickets issued anywhere in the country. The decision so
angered drivers who pay fines on time that the Tel Aviv
municipality was considering giving them money back.

Israeli student election seen as victory for extreme right 
</HEADLINE>
By VITA BEKKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A contributor to a book glorifying a Jewish
settler who massacred 29 Palestinians was elected student union
chairman on Wednesday at Israel's second-largest university.
	   Meir Lapid, a 25-year-old biology student, won the student union
elections at Bar Ilan University, which notes among its former
students Yigal Amir, the convicted assassin of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
	   Lapid, running on a platform of student unity, won the elections
with just over 50 percent of the vote. He ran as an independent and
said he had no political affiliation.
	   But critics saw his victory as a triumph for the extreme right.
	   ``Bar Ilan University has turned into a hothouse of the fanatic
and racist elements of the Israeli society,'' Ofir Pines, a Knesset
member from Rabin's Labor Party, said Wednesday.
	   Pines called for an emergency meeting of the Knesset education
committee to discuss the consequences of Lapid's election.
	   University spokesman David Weinberg called Pines' comments
``outrageous'' and ``irresponsible,'' and said the election was not
about politics, but about the religious-secular divide.
	   Lapid is known on campus as a leading proponent of
religious-secular dialogue, Weinberg said.
	   His father and brother were killed by Palestinians in a drive-by
shooting five years ago. Lapid's mother Miriam made an unsuccessful
bid for the Knesset on an extremist right-wing party list.
	   Lapid told The Associated Press he views Goldstein as a brother
who committed a horrible act.
	   He said he wrote a poem about Goldstein, which was included in a
book that paid tribute to the settler, because ``I want the public
and media to wonder how a person in our nation got into that kind
of situation.''
	   Instead of condemning Goldstein's attack, people should learn
from it so it won't happen again, he said.
	   About 2,800 of the university's 25,000 students voted in the
election, Weinberg said.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ German chancellor candidate Gerhard
Schroeder assured Polish leaders Wednesday that he considers Poland
an important ally and foresees no major change in relations with
Warsaw should he win September elections.
	   ``We view good German-Polish relations as an important element
of the process of European integration,'' Schroeder told reporters
after talks and lunch with President Aleksander Kwasniewski.
	   Political change in Bonn would not erode German support for
Poland's aspirations to join NATO and the European Union, Schroeder
said.
	   Poland's membership in NATO ``is no problem and it will
certainly take place in 1999,'' he added.
	   While supporting Poland's entry into the EU, Schroeder also told
leaders that it would not mean immediate access to the German labor
market.
	   Schroeder said Kwasniewski agreed with him that a free flow of
Polish workers ``would require transitional periods.''
	   Schroeder argues that allowing workers to enter Germany from
Poland and other new EU members would diminish support in Germany
for EU expansion. He has said that these countries will have to
improve pay and living standards before gaining free access to the
German labor market.
	   Germany, Poland's largest trading partner, is seen here as a
major advocate of Poland's EU membership.
	   The one-day visit is Schroeder's third trip abroad since he won
the Social Democrats' nomination to challenge Chancellor Helmut
Kohl on Sept. 27. He earlier visited Israel and Lebanon, then
France.
	   In Warsaw, Schroeder also met Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz as well as Solidarity chairman
Marian Krzaklewski and opposition leader, Leszek Miller, the head
of Poland's ex-communist Social Democracy party.
	   The visit, seven years on Wednesday after Poland and Germany
signed a landmark friendship treaty that ended decades of tense
relations troubled by the legacy of World War II, was seen as
Schroeder's effort to establish personal ties with Polish political
leaders.
	   At the end of his visit, Schroeder delivered a speech on
German-Polish relations to diplomats and intellectuals, at the
invitation of Warsaw's branch of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation for
promoting democracy and human rights.
	   ``I wanted to come to Poland because I would like to confirm
here that German-Polish relations have a special quality for me and
my party,'' comparable to Germany's relations with France,
Schroeder said.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ St. Peter's tomb under the basilica named
after him will be brighter and cleaner thanks to a dlrs 1.7 million
restoration paid for by an Italian electricity company.
	   The restoration, with help from ENEL utility company, aims to
remove mold and humidity from the underground burial ground,
officials from the Vatican and ENEL said Wednesday.
	   Work should be completed by November 1999, just in time for the
Catholic church's celebration of the Holy Year in 2000.
	   Besides the natural dampness, the breath of some 250 tourists
who each day take one of the Vatican's most fascinating tours is
taking its toll on the underground area.
	   Besides the tomb of St. Peter, the first pope, the area includes
a necropolis, which will also be restored, with early Christian
frescoes and inscriptions on pagan tombs.

Swiss government, politicians, business welcome accords 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss politicians and the country's
business community Wednesday welcomed the conclusion of
Switzerland's bilateral negotiations with the European Union on
several thorny issues.
	   The agreements ended more than three years of complicated talks
that at times got bogged down, especially on such issues as free
movement of people and goods lorries through Switzerland. They
still have to be approved by the two sides' governments.
	   Other areas of negotiation covered research and development,
reduction of technical barriers, access to public procurement,
opening of agricultural markets, and air transport.
	   A compromise over heavy surface transport was among accords
reached. Switzerland agreed to allow more heavy EU truck traffic
through its strategically located passes, but managed to keep some
restrictions on the rigs.
	   The four Swiss governing coalition political parties rated the
agreements as a step towards closer relations with the EU.
	   The bilateral accords were supposed to fill in the gaps left
when Swiss voters rejected membership in the European Economic Area
in late 1992. The EEA grouped countries outside the E.U. in an
affiliated trade zone.
	   Since then, domestic pressure has mounted on the Swiss
government to seek EU membership. Recalling its bitter defeat in
the EEA plebiscite, the government chose to first complete the
bilateral agreements and seek membership later.
	   Even with the bilateral agreements' completion, the even more
complex membership issue will likely take years to resolve.
	   Hilmar Gernet, secretary general of the center-right Christian
Peoples Party, avoided calling the pacts a breakthrough. His party
wants to see if the E.U.'s political leadership accepts the heavy
surface transport compromise, he said.
	   The party also wants to weigh the cost of the free flow of
people to Switzerland's social insurance net. ``If this costs
billions of (Swiss francs), the agreement won't have a chance of
getting through in Switzerland,'' he said.
	   Guido Schommer, the moderate Free Democrats' spokesman, said his
party wants evidence by year-end that the two sides' politicians
are ready to ratify the agreements.
	   The Swiss Federation of Commerce and Industry said the business
community was satisfied with the accords.
	   Anti-EU politician Christoph Blocher, a member of the Swiss
parliament and the rightist Swiss Peoples Party, withheld immediate
judgment, telling Swiss television the consequences of an accord
with Brussels are still unclear.

World Cup: Japan's midfield key against Croatia 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Japanese coach Takeshi Okada calls
it ``image.'' Although he skillfully evades discussing specifics,
he definitely has a plan for Japan's match against Croatia on
Saturday.
	   Using computer graphics that Okada and assistant coach Takeshi
Ono have conjured up, as well as hours and hours of videotape, the
Japanese have been carefully analyzing the Croatian team.
	   What they lack in experience, physical prowess and individual
technique, the World Cup first-timers intend to make up with smart
planning and team work.
	   If Japan's strategy in its 1-0 loss to Argentina in its
surprisingly impressive Group H opener was based on defense, the
midfield is the focus against Croatia.
	   ``I am impressed that Croatia not only has quality individual
players but also a very organized system,'' coach Takeshi Okada
said. ``Some of our strategy will have to change. Otherwise, we'll
be giving them exactly what they want.''
	   Japan's task will be somewhat easier with news that a leg injury
will likely force Croatian captain and midfielder Zvonimir Boban to
sit out the match. Okada had viewed Boban as the center of the
Croatian team.
	   The team practiced behind closed doors Wednesday. During open
practices earlier this week, Okada, who has studied coaching in
Germany, spent most of his time with the reserves. They obviously
hold the key to his plan.
	   Among the bench-warmers last Sunday are several aggressive
midfielders with proven scoring power. Japan also has strong
starters in midfield _ Hidetoshi Nakata, Hiroshi Nanami and
Motohiro Yamaguchi.
	   ``I have tried to present to the players an image of what they
must do,'' said Okada, who has demonstrated his flair for
intelligent substitutions during qualifiers. ``The reserves know
they're going to be called upon, if the game is going a certain
way.''
	   The players feel exonerated by their valiant showing against
Argentina.
	   ``They're not as threatening as Argentina,'' said defender
Eisuke Nakanishi of the Croat strikers. ``I want to play so hard
they have to respect us.''
	   ``All those players who are supposed to be so fast, they don't
look that fast to me,'' said Masayuki Okano, a substitute forward
who is itching to play.
	   ``The coach,'' said defender Yutaka Akita, ``has a plan.''

Tens of thousands mourn death of prominent Egyptian cleric

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Thousands of Egyptians, many of them weeping
and chanting religious slogans, mourned the death Wednesday of
Sheik Mohammed Mutwali Sharawi, a leading cleric in the Muslim
world and one of Egypt's most popular figures.
	   Sharawi, who served as minister of religious endowments under
former President Anwar Sadat, died at his home near the pyramids of
Giza Wednesday. He was 87.
	   The cause of death was not announced. Last week he was admitted
to hospital with severe asthma.
	   President Hosni Mubarak praised the popular cleric, saying he
had ``greatly contributed to Islam and enriched Muslims with his
wide knowledge of the correct teachings of Islam.''
	   Egypt's leading Islamic authority, the Grand Sheik of Al-Azhar,
Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, described Sharawi's death as a great loss
not only to Egypt, but to the entire Muslim world.
	   ``Time rarely gives birth to such a glorious imam who devoted
his life to making the word of God esteemed,'' Tantawi said.
	   In his home village of Daqadous in the Nile Delta, thousands
poured into narrow, dirt streets in a procession that carried his
body to the cemetery. Groups of black-uniformed police pushed back
crowds that surged toward the green coffin.
	   Many chanted, ``There is no god but God.'' Women dressed in
black cried, and clouds of dirt drifted through the hot afternoon
air as the procession made its way through the village.
	   Sharawi gave a religious lecture on Egyptian television on
Fridays that was widely watched because of the simple way in which
he conveyed Islamic principles and the fact that he spoke in a
colloquial dialect of Arabic. His books, videotapes and cassettes
were available at bookstores and sidewalk stalls across the city of
15 million.
	   His teachings and rulings won him wide acclaim in the Muslim
world, but they were also controversial. Moderate Muslims
considered them outdated.
	   He angered feminists and human rights activists by supporting
female circumcision and by ruling that women should not be
appointed to top government positions or become judges. He also
condemned organ transplants and the paying of interest on bank
deposits as un-Islamic.
	   But such rulings went down well in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
countries, where governments enforce a strict brand of Islam.
	   Sharawi was born in Daqadous, a small village 12O kilometers (75
miles) north of Cairo where he later built a religious school, a
mosque and a hospital.
	   He trained at Al-Azhar in Cairo, the leading religious institute
in the Sunni Muslim world. He became a theological lecturer in
Saudi Arabia and then rejoined Al-Azhar as a director of teaching.
But he had to leave after falling out with President Gamal Abdel
Nasser over Egypt's increasingly close ties with the Soviet Union.
	   In what was possibly his most controversial move, he gave thanks
to God after Egypt suffered a calamitous defeat in the 1967
Arab-Israeli War. Asked why, he said that if Nasser had won the
war, Egypt would have become a communist country.
	   He is survived by three sons and two daughters. His son, Sheik
Sami, is a cleric at Al-Azhar.

World Cup: Blair urges employers to take action on hooligans 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned English
hooligans involved in violence at the World Cup in France as a
``mindless minority'' and urged their British employers to fire or
discipline them.
	   ``We condemn without any reservation or qualification that
mindless minority who do nothing but bring disgrace on themselves
and on the name of our country abroad,'' Blair said during a debate
in the House of Commons.
	   Blair called on businesses to ``take strong action against those
people that are convicted of football offenses abroad'' in the
aftermath of running battles between English hooligans, rival fans
and police in Marseille.
	   Blair agreed to look at proposals by the opposition Conservative
party to toughen existing powers to restrict known troublemakers
from travelling abroad.
	   ``We will consider whatever measures we can take so that this
small minority is eliminated,'' he said.
	   But he said the government could only act against known
troublemakers.
	   ``I have to say the vast majority of those picked up by the
French police do not either have a record of football hooliganism
that appears on the criminal records or even on our database, which
is the most extensive anywhere in the world,'' Blair said.
	   He also sought to pin the responsibility on the hooligans
themselves.
	   ``We can take all the measures we like as a government, and we
should take whatever measures are necessary,'' he said. ``But in
the end let's be quite clear where responsibility for this violence
lies. It lies with those individuals themselves who do not
represent the best of Britain, England or English soccer.''
	   Earlier, former Conservative Party minister Alan Clark created a
storm of controversy by saying England fans involved in rioting in
Marseille were ``victims of prejudice.''
	   The MP for Chelsea said English fans had been targeted by French
police and rival supporters, adding it was ``perfectly natural''
for supporters to react in such a confrontational atmosphere.
	   ``If you are English you are targeted, and particularly if you
are English and tough looking and wearing an English flag,'' he
said during in an interview on BBC radio.
	   ``If you are (wearing and English flag), you will find that not
only normal police target you, but there are particular groups of
thugs who are set up.''
	   Clarke said certain fans travelled to France deliberately to
seek out fights with the English.
	   ``In a sense that is a kind of compliment to the English martial
spirit, but they really haven't got a chance, these guys. Everyone
is out to get them.''
	   The Conservative Party was quick to distance itself from Clark's
comments, releasing a statement that ``Alan Clark's views are not
those of the Conservative Party''.
	   However, Clark was not the only person to attribute some of the
blame to the authorities in France.
	   In an editorial in The Times newspaper on Wednesday, columnist
Simon Barnes said French authorities had contributed to the
trouble.
	   ``A mixture of stupidity and greed is what has undone
Marseilles,'' he said. ``I'm not excusing the English violence. But
the French bogged it up and they know it.''

Roadside slaying points up hatreds in divided West Bank city 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank _ A makeshift memorial already marks the spot
where Palestinian farmer Abdel Majid Abu Turki fell, clubbed to
death by a teen-aged Jewish settler in a passing van.
	   But the plaintive roadside monument _ a clump of olive branches
protruding from a pile of dusty rocks _ belies the fury many
Palestinians feel toward the Jewish settlers among them.
	   ``To them, we are targets _ they can maim and kill us at will,''
Mohammed Abu Turki, 63, a cousin of the slain man, raged as he and
other relatives waited outside the morgue at a Hebron hospital on
Wednesday, a day after the killing.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack ``horrible
and unacceptable.'' But the Palestinian police commander in Hebron,
Tarek Zeid, blamed a climate of hatred _ and said acts like this
could doom the tenuous effort to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
	   ``It's a terrible crime, and the Israelis bear responsibility,''
he said. ``This is the way to bury the peace process.''
	   It wasn't the first time that the close proximity of Jewish
settlers and Palestinians in and around Hebron _ one of the
angriest spots in all the West Bank _ has boiled over into
bloodshed.
	   The city is divided between Israeli and Palestinian control,
with an enclave of 500 settlers in the midst of 120,000
Palestinians. On its rocky outskirts, Jewish settlements bump up
against Palestinian villages.
	   In the most spectacular outbreak of violence here, a Jewish
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshippers at a Hebron mosque in
1994. More often, though, deaths come singly and sporadically, as
in April, when a Jewish settler was killed in a dispute with
Palestinian shepherds near a settlement outside Hebron.
	   Or as happened late Tuesday afternoon, when Abu Turki, a
45-year-old father of six, was walking home from the fields.
	   He was within sight of home when a van carrying a group of
teen-agers _ all from a halfway house for troubled youths at the
nearby Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai _ approached from behind.
One of the teens, by his own admission, reached out the window and
clubbed Abu Turki with a length of wood as the van passed.
	   On Wednesday, the family home was a house of mourning. The dead
man's 11-year-old daughter, Noor, wept uncontrollably in the center
of a knot of women, red-faced and flailing her arms.
	   ``My destiny is to get revenge for my father,'' she shouted,
while relatives tried to comfort her.
	   Muslim tradition calls for swift burial, but the family agreed
to a delay so that Palestinian officials could turn the body over
to Israel for autopsy. They said they hoped doing so would help
bring about justice.
	   At the Hebron hospital, doctors beckoned journalists into a
narrow room where Abu Turki's body was laid out on a table, wrapped
in a bloody shroud. His feet, still in their worn brown shoes, were
bound together with gauze; the back of his head was nearly
obliterated by a gaping wound.
	   ``See what they did to him?'' one murmured.
	   In Jerusalem, two of the teens who were riding in the van
appeared before a magistrate Wednesday, covering their heads with
prayer shawls as they walked into court. Their names were not
released because of their age.
	   Their lawyer, Naftali Werzberger, acknowledged that one of them
had struck the fatal blow, but said the boy hadn't realized it
could be fatal to club someone from a moving van. Werzberger also
said Turki was not targeted simply because he was a Palestinian,
but could not explain the motive for the attack.
	   The van's driver, an adult, was released by the Israeli
magistrate even though he drove on after the attack, leaving Abu
Turki lying on the side of the road. Settlers turned the boys in
after learning the victim had died.
	   At Beit Hagai, home to about 350 people, the mood was uneasy,
with some settlers fearing Palestinian retribution.
	   ``We haven't gone to the bunkers, but we're certainly alert,''
said the settlement's security chief, Zvi Katz. He said the army
had made some suggestions for improving security, which he refused
to detail but said the settlers were following.
	   He and others expressed regret over Abu Turki's death, but said
it should not be seen in political terms.
	   ``We don't know why this happened,'' said Katz. ``It's true,
though, that here you always have the sense these things, of Jews
and Arabs, peace or not peace...It's hard to escape.''
	   The halfway house program was established six years ago, and
settler families serve as foster parents to the troubled teens,
Katz said. Asked whether violent, volatile Hebron was the best
place for problem juveniles, Katz sighed.
	   ``It's one incident in all these years,'' he said.

American owner of ill-fated Lusitania plans salvage operation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The American owner of the ill-fated S.S.
Lusitania, torpedoed by a German submarine in World War I, is
planning an exploration and salvage operation of the liner's watery
grave.
	   The sinking of the civilian liner off the southwest Irish coast
on May 7, 1915, killed 1,198 people, among them 128 Americans,
influencing the United States' eventual decision to enter the war
two years later.
	   ``The Lusitania is probably the most important shipwreck that
hasn't been investigated in any detail so far,'' said Gregg Bemis
Jr., whose father bought the title to the ship but not its
contents.
	   Bemis said he was raising funds for a ``forensic study'' next
year of the wreckage, which lies under about 300 feet (100 meters)
of water off the Cork coast.
	   Bemis said his main goal was to determine ``what caused the
second explosion, which took place about 20 seconds after the
torpedo hit and which, in my opinion, caused the ship to sink.''
	   He said the second reported explosion was most likely caused by
explosives stowed aboard the ship. ``I don't think one torpedo
probably would have sunk an 800-foot ship in 18 minutes,'' Bemis
said.
	   In April the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Bemis Sr., a
businessman from Santa Fe, New Mexico, was the sole owner of the
Lusitania wreckage, but not any of its contents.
	   He previously lost a similar case before the Irish Supreme
Court, which upheld the right of the Irish government to claim
ownership of historical valuables recovered.
	   The ship might contain paintings by European Masters purchased
in America and being brought to Ireland by the then-director of the
National Gallery of Ireland.
	   Bemis said his divers, working round the clock for two weeks,
would still ``probably do some salvage'' in hopes that the rightful
owners of valuables would not step forward.
	   But the possibility that the ship was carrying a substantial
load of weaponry will be of more interest to historians. The ship's
manifest noted 4,200 cases of rifle ammo were on board, but Bemis
said he expected to find evidence of much more weaponry.
	   The German government had published warnings in New York
newspapers advising would-be passengers that the British-owned
Lusitania would be considered a legitimate target.

Scientists figure out 3-D shape of AIDS `key' AP Science Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Hold for release at 2000 GMT.
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In an exciting advance that could speed the
development of new drugs and a vaccine against AIDS, scientists
have figured out the 3-D shape of the ``key'' the virus uses to
unlock and enter cells.
	   Scientists already knew a lot about the key, a complex protein
called gp120 that sticks out from the AIDS virus like dozens of
spikes. But the new work exposes far more detail about its defenses
and its potential vulnerabilities.
	   ``Before we were blind. Now we're sighted,'' said Dr. Joseph
Sodroski of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, one of the
researchers. ``We can see what the defenses of this virus are, and
that allows us to focus on a logical approach to penetrate those
defenses.
	   ``Is that approach going to work? Well, we don't know. There's
no way of predicting how soon any of this structural information
will lead to better drugs and vaccines. But there's no question
we're better off now than we were before.''
	   The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature
and Friday's issue of Science by Sodroski, Wayne Hendrickson of the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Columbia University in New
York, and other scientists.
	   ``It's a tour de force,'' said AIDS researcher Dani Bolognesi of
the Duke University Medical Center, who wasn't involved in the
work. ``We've been waiting to see the structure of this molecule
for many years.''
	   The researchers overcame technical difficulties that had
hindered prior attempts, he said.
	   Bolognesi said the work will be very important for developing
vaccines and drugs that block virus infection. Such drugs, in
combination with current medications, would help infected people by
shutting down the spread of the virus within their bodies.
	   Another scientist not involved with the work, John P. Moore of
the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York, called the work
the most important AIDS research published so far this year.
	   The gp120 spikes on the AIDS virus bind to two protein sites,
one after the other, on the surface of a cell. That essentially
unlocks the cell for the virus to enter.
	   The first site, called CD4, has a chemical finger that fits
precisely into a hole on gp120. The new work reveals details of
that hole, which might allow scientists to design drugs that
essentially plug it, and thereby prevent infection. The researchers
also exposed other sites on gp120 that are crucial for infection,
and so might be targets for an interfering molecule.
	   Vaccines are designed to train the immune system to attack
germs, and the new work reveals details of defenses gp120 uses to
evade attack. Since gp120 is the main part of HIV that the immune
system notices, understanding its defenses could be crucial for
vaccine development.
	   One problem is that certain parts of gp120 vary greatly from
strain to strain. These variable regions are like decoys; if the
immune system raises antibodies to attack one version of them, the
antibodies will be useless against a different strain in the same
person.
	   The new work should help scientists develop vaccines that focus
the immune system's attention on other parts of gp120 that are
identical in all strains, Sodroski said.

Jordache jeans owners to build peace monument in desert 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jimmy Carter was born too late to be
immortalized on Mount Rushmore, but the former American president's
image will soon be chiseled into a cliff in Israel's Negev Desert.
	   The Nakash brothers, owners of the Jordache jeans company, plan
to erect a monument to the signers of the 1979 peace agreement
between Israel and Egypt _ Carter, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat.
	   The sculptures will be on a somewhat smaller scale than the
giant busts carved into the Black Hills of South Dakota, said Avda
Lloyd, spokeswoman of the Ramat Hanegev regional council. Lloyd
said the actual dimensions have not yet been determined.
	   Avi Nakash said a dlrs 10 million park will be built around the
monument near the grave of former Israeli Prime Minister David Ben
Gurion in the Sde Boker kibbutz. Carter and the families of Begin
and Sadat will attend the cornerstone-laying ceremony in October,
Nakash said.

Russia to cut oil exports 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia announced Wednesday it would make a small
cut in oil exports in an effort to raise world oil prices.
	   Russia will cut exports by 63,000 barrels a day starting July 1,
said Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov. That's about 1 percent of
current exports, he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia is the world's third-largest oil exporter.

Eds: contains items on Vogts and sex before matches, Tomislav Ivic,
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ German coach Berti Vogts, apparently bucking
a trend among soccer thinkers, says sex before a match is OK.
	   ``Before a game? They boys can do whatever they like,'' Vogts
said in an interview with the German magazine Bunte. ``But it's not
possible at halftime.''
	   The girlfriends and wives of German players are staying in the
Cote d'Azure area near Nice, while the players are based in a
four-star hotel near Saint-Paul-de-Vence.
	   Since arriving in their headquarters June 7, the players have
had two nights off.
	   ``The wives can see their husbands, but they have to respect our
schedule,'' Vogts told Bunte.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatian Tomislav Ivic, sacked as the
Iranian national team coach just before the start of the World Cup,
has signed a three-year contract with Belgium club Standard Liege,
state-run HINA reported Wednesday.
	   Ivic, 63, was dismissed less than a month ago following a series
of disappointing performances in the team's leadup to the World
Cup, including a 7-1 thrashing by an AC Roma reserve squad.
	   He was the third of four coaches Iran has had in the past eight
months.
	   Ivic has had successful stints with several top Europe clubs,
including Ajax Amsterdam, Belgium's Anderlecht, Atletico Madrid,
Marseille, Paris-Saint German, and Portugal's Benfica and Porto.
	   He was hired by Iran in January to replace Brazilian Valdir
Vierra, who ensured the team a berth in the final's in France.
	   Under new coach Jalal Talebi, Iran narrowly lost its opening
match in Group F to Yugoslavia 1-0 on Sunday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Georges Leekens says he will remain as coach of the
Belgian national team through the 2000 European Championship,
squashing rumors that he was headed for one of several clubs,
including the Netherlands' Vitesse of Arnhem.
	   ``My ambition is to coach Belgium until after Euro 2000,'' said
Leekens, who was hired in February 1997. ``I've informed the
president of the Belgian Football Association of my decision.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NICE, France (AP) _ After seeing all major soccer nations in
action, German coach Berti Vogts thinks Brazil is still the top
World Cup favorite.
	   ``Brazil is already in the second round and for me it is still
the top favorite,'' Vogts said Wednesday.
	   ``France also showed its trumps. And my dark horse Nigeria
played very well,'' Vogts said.
	   Vogts said his own team, a 2-0 winner over the United States,
still has to improve.
	   Franz Beckenbauer, coach of Germany's winning team in 1990 and
captain of the 1974 World Cup-winning side, placed France at the
top.
	   ``I was very convinced by the French. They ran a lot, they were
very disciplined and they played with the necessary passion,''
Beckenbauer said of France's 3-0 victory over South Africa.
Beckenbauer made the comments in his column for the daily newspaper
Bild.
	   Beckenbauer said Germany had reached 60 percent of its
potential. Vogts said: ``It'd be nice if it were so.''

Wiesenthal calls report on Swiss Nazis exaggerated 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS to Schom sted Schrom throughout
By ALISON SMALE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal on Wednesday
dismissed as exaggerated a report from the Los Angeles-based center
bearing his name that depicts neutral Switzerland as a land of Nazi
sympathizers during World War II.
	   The report, surveying Nazi and pro-Nazi groups in Switzerland
from 1939-45, was the second by American historian Alan M. Schom to
paint a distorted picture of the Swiss role in World War II,
Wiesenthal said.
	   ``Both sides must always be shown,'' he told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview.
	   He said he had obtained the latest report only Tuesday, and
recommended that the Simon Wiesenthal Center not use Schom again.
	   ``I think this is the last time he will be used (by the center)
as a historian,'' Wiesenthal said, adding that Schom's speciality
was French colonial policy.
	   ``He does not need to say things like ... the Swiss today are
just as greedy for money'' as he suggests they were during World
War II, Wiesenthal said. ``These are things he can say, but our
center should not publish this in this way.''
	   He cited as evidence of bias what he said was Schom's listing of
Vaterland (Fatherland) and other ``small'' pro-Nazi groups, as well
as pro-Nazi newspapers in Switzerland in the 1930s. Schom does not
show ``there was also something else,'' Wiesenthal added.
	   In his first report for the center, Schom discussed some 40
labor camps in Switzerland for detainees during World War II,
Wiesenthal said.
	   Certainly, ``he spoke to a few inmates who really suffered, but
these labor camps cannot be compared to Nazi camps,'' said
Wiesenthal, who survived several Nazi death camps, including
Mauthausen in Austria, where he was liberated in 1945 by U.S.
troops.
	   Wiesenthal, 89, heads the Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna
and has devoted the past 53 years to tracking down Nazis and
speaking out against neo-Nazism.
	   Wiesenthal said he accepted Schom's depiction of the connections
of Eduard von Steiger, Swiss minister of justice after World War
II, to Vaterland and other pro-Nazi groups.
	   ``But from this man 50 years ago somehow to draw consequences
about a general picture of Swiss citizens is very bold,''
Wiesenthal said.
	   Wiesenthal said that from 1940, when the Nazis occupied France,
Switzerland was an island surrounded by Nazi-occupied or allied
countries, and acted in a more friendly way towards Adolf Hitler in
order not to be occupied.
	   ``They had to survive,'' he said, noting that Switzerland
provided shelter for tens of thousands of Jewish refugees.

Road accident kills 13 pilgrims in northern India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A bus packed with Hindu pilgrims veered
off a road and rammed into a tree in India's most populous state
Wednesday, killing at least 13 people and injuring 70 others,
domestic news agencies said.
	   Six women and five children were among the dead near Pratapgarh
town in Uttar Pradesh state, United News of India said. The private
bus was carrying more than 100 passengers, the news agency said.
	   The pilgrims were headed toward a nearby bank of the river
Ganga, regarded by Hindus as the holiest river, for ritual bathing
on the occasion of a local religious festival.
	   Pratapgarh is about 550 kilometers (340 miles) southeast of
India's capital New Delhi.

Italy's Rebellin takes race lead with win in second stage 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VILLARS-SUR-OLLON, Switzerland (AP) _ Davide Rebellin of Italy
won the second stage of the Tour de Suisse Wednesday with a solo
attack on the final climb into this mountain village.
	   Rebellin covered the 182.2 kilometers (113.2 miles) from the
northern town of Biel in 4 hours 42 minutes 54 seconds.
	   He finished 41 seconds ahead of fellow Italian Francesco
Casagrande, who was among 11 riders to finish in the same time.
Switzerland's Beat Zberg was third.
	   The stage win gave Rebellin the overall lead in the race. He
overtook France's Laurent Jalabert, who won Tuesday's 5.6 kilometer
(3.5 mile) prologue in Biel with a time of 6 minutes, 35.09
seconds.
	   Erik Dekker of the Netherlands mounted the day's first
successful attack after 61 kilometers (37.9 miles), and stayed
ahead until Rebellin overhauled him at the beginning of the climb
into Villars-sur-Ollon.
	   Jalabert finished fifth, in the group led by Casagrande.
	   Last year's Tour de France winner, Jan Ullrich of Germany,
finished 24th, over two minutes behind the stage winner.
	   Thursday's third stage will take racers 159.2 kilometers (98.9
miles) from Aigle to Ulrichen.
	   The 10-stage race finishes next Thursday in the Swiss capital,
Bern. There are 159 riders in all.

World Cup: Late Vastic strike earns Austria another 1-1 tie 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Another late equalizer earned
Austria an ill-deserved 1-1 tie with Chile Wednesday as Herbert
Prohaska's team scrambled its second tie of the World Cup.
	   After Tony Polster's strike had gained a 1-1 tie with Cameroon
in Toulouse June 11, this time it was substitute Ivica Vastic who
came up with the leveller. Each time the late goal was in second
half injury time with the Austrians looking well beaten.
	   Marcelo Salas scrambled his third goal of the World Cup as Chile
moved into a 1-0 lead with 20 minutes to go and Austrian goalkeeper
Michael Konsel made a brilliant, finger-tip save to deny Ivan
Zamorano in the 88th minute.
	   It proved a vital save as Vastic curled a right-footed shot from
22 meters past Chilean goalkeeper Nelson Tapia in the second minute
of injury time.
	   The result gave both teams two points from two games with Italy
and Cameroon, one point apiece, meeting later Wednesday.
	   Chile's Moises Villarroel moved into a good shooting position 25
meters from goal from a neat pass by Fabian Estay but Konsel
watched it fly well wide of the post.
	   Austria's first shot at goal didn't come until the 38th minute
when Mario Haas fired goalwards from 18 meters. It was on target
but it was blocked by a Chilean defender long before it would have
reached 'keeper Tapia.
	   With the Austrian strikeforce kept at bay by a well-organized
Chilean defense and midfield, neither goalkeeper had anything to
save until the 42nd minute when Tapia dived to hold the ball at the
foot of the post from an angled cross from Heimo Pfeifenberger.
	   Chile should have gone ahead in the 53rd minute when Villarroel
made the overlap on the right and ran clear of the Austrian
defense. He messed it up completely.
	   Villarroel took the wrong option, firing at the near post
instead of the far post, and his shot appeared to be going wide
anyway before Konsel blocked it with his left hand.
	   There was an even better chance in the 62nd when Salas got clear
down the right and Zamorano was unmarked in the center. Salas, who
scored twice in the 2-2 tie with Italy, aimed for his
strike-partner but his cross was far too close to Konsel who
gathered easily, leaving Zamorano frustrated.
	   The Chileans finally got it right in the 70th minute but only
just.
	   Egyptian referee Gamal Ghandour awarded them a free kick just
outside the area wide on the left, Zamorano climbed to head
goalwards and Konsel half stopped it.
	   Salas forced the rebound goalwards from six meters out and the
Austrian 'keeper was convinced he had got back to stop the ball
rolling over the line.
	   Ghandour didn't agree and Chile led 1-0 with 20 minutes to go.
	   Three minutes from the end, Zamorano nearly made it 2-0 when he
collected a forward pass and charged clear. His low shot was headed
just inside the post but Konsel got down to finger-tip the ball
round the post.
	   Lineups:
	   Austria _ Michael Konsel; Peter Schoettel, Anton Pfeffer,
Wolfgang Feiersinger, Mario Haas (Ivica Vastic, 74th); Heimo
Pfeifenberger, Harald Cerny, Arnold Wetl, Roman Maehlich; Dietmar
Kuehbauer (Andreas Herzog, 46th), Anton Polster.
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier
Margas, Moises Villarroel (Cristian Castaneda, 67th); Francisco
Rojas, Nelson Parraguez, Clarence Acuna, Fabian Estay (Jose Sierra,
57th); Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   Referee _ Gamal Ghandour, Egypt.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed at least 25 people and
wounded 62 others, all Tutsis, in a pre-dawn attack Wednesday on a
camp for displaced people, officials and hospital sources said.
	   About 50 Hutu rebels, armed with machine-guns and machetes,
attacked from hills surrounding the camp at Nkamira, 100 kilometers
(60 miles) northwest of Kigali, which houses 6,000 minority Tutsis
who have fled the region's violence, the officials said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Doctors treating casualties at the hospital in nearby Gisenyi
said they requested additional bandages and blood supplies from
Kigali. At least 55 children were among the wounded.
	   The rebels are former soldiers or militiamen who fled the
country in 1994. The army and militias were behind the slaughter of
more than 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   The three-month slaughter ended when Tutsi-led fighters won
power in July 1994.
	   Authorities say the rebels have killed thousands since 1996,
when the Hutu militiamen slipped back into the country with more
than 1 million Hutu refugees.
	   In December, a similar rebel attack on the camp and a nearby
army contingent left 71 people dead, including 48 rebels killed by
the troops.
	   On Wednesday, soldiers stationed at the barracks opposite
Nkamira opened fire at the attackers after 20 minutes of the
assault, officials said. It wasn't immediately clear if any of the
rebels were killed.
	   In the past three months, the rebels appeared to have stepped up
attacks in response to a government campaign to turn the
predominantly Hutu population against providing insurgents with
food, money and shelter.
	   Since March, at least 25,000 Hutus have returned from the
volcanic mountains on the Congolese border where they had been
forced by the rebels crossing in and out of Rwanda.

World Cup: Late Vastic strike earns Austria another 1-1 tie REPEATING 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Another late equalizer earned
Austria an ill-deserved 1-1 tie with Chile Wednesday as Herbert
Prohaska's team scrambled its second tie of the World Cup.
	   After Tony Polster's strike had gained a 1-1 tie with Cameroon
in Toulouse June 11, this time it was substitute Ivica Vastic who
came up with the leveller. Each time the late goal was in second
half injury time with the Austrians looking well beaten.
	   Marcelo Salas scrambled his third goal of the World Cup as Chile
moved into a 1-0 lead with 20 minutes to go and Austrian goalkeeper
Michael Konsel made a brilliant, finger-tip save to deny Ivan
Zamorano in the 88th minute.
	   It proved a vital save as Vastic curled a right-footed shot from
22 meters past Chilean goalkeeper Nelson Tapia in the second minute
of injury time.
	   The result gave both teams two points from two games with Italy
and Cameroon, one point apiece, meeting later Wednesday.
	   Chile's Moises Villarroel moved into a good shooting position 25
meters from goal from a neat pass by Fabian Estay but Konsel
watched it fly well wide of the post.
	   Austria's first shot at goal didn't come until the 38th minute
when Mario Haas fired goalwards from 18 meters. It was on target
but it was blocked by a Chilean defender long before it would have
reached 'keeper Tapia.
	   With the Austrian strikeforce kept at bay by a well-organized
Chilean defense and midfield, neither goalkeeper had anything to
save until the 42nd minute when Tapia dived to hold the ball at the
foot of the post from an angled cross from Heimo Pfeifenberger.
	   Chile should have gone ahead in the 53rd minute when Villarroel
made the overlap on the right and ran clear of the Austrian
defense. He messed it up completely.
	   Villarroel took the wrong option, firing at the near post
instead of the far post, and his shot appeared to be going wide
anyway before Konsel blocked it with his left hand.
	   There was an even better chance in the 62nd when Salas got clear
down the right and Zamorano was unmarked in the center. Salas, who
scored twice in the 2-2 tie with Italy, aimed for his
strike-partner but his cross was far too close to Konsel who
gathered easily, leaving Zamorano frustrated.
	   The Chileans finally got it right in the 70th minute but only
just.
	   Egyptian referee Gamal Ghandour awarded them a free kick just
outside the area wide on the left, Zamorano climbed to head
goalwards and Konsel half stopped it.
	   Salas forced the rebound goalwards from six meters out and the
Austrian 'keeper was convinced he had got back to stop the ball
rolling over the line.
	   Ghandour didn't agree and Chile led 1-0 with 20 minutes to go.
	   Three minutes from the end, Zamorano nearly made it 2-0 when he
collected a forward pass and charged clear. His low shot was headed
just inside the post but Konsel got down to finger-tip the ball
round the post.
	   Lineups:
	   Austria _ Michael Konsel; Peter Schoettel, Anton Pfeffer,
Wolfgang Feiersinger, Mario Haas (Ivica Vastic, 74th); Heimo
Pfeifenberger, Harald Cerny, Arnold Wetl, Roman Maehlich; Dietmar
Kuehbauer (Andreas Herzog, 46th), Anton Polster.
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier
Margas, Moises Villarroel (Cristian Castaneda, 67th); Francisco
Rojas, Nelson Parraguez, Clarence Acuna, Fabian Estay (Jose Sierra,
57th); Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.

Pioline kicked out for cursing umpire 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: incorporates Sports-Tennis-Pioline Defaulted
<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Cedric Pioline claimed he couldn't
remember what he said to the chair umpire. Whatever it was, it was
enough to get him kicked out of the tournament.
	   Pioline, the runner-up at Wimbledon last year, was defaulted
from the Nottingham Open on Wednesday for swearing at Chilean
umpire Pedro Bravo.
	   ``I don't remember what I said to the umpire but when you get
fed up you don't send flowers _ you're not happy,'' Pioline said.
	   The French player was trailing Australia's Scott Draper 6-3, 1-1
and was down 0-40 in the third game of the second set when he was
ejected for ``verbal abuse.''
	   Tour officials said Pioline used a strong obscenity in arguing a
call with Bravo.
	   ``I don't want to say what he said but it was verbal abuse,''
tournament supervisor Gerry Armstrong said. ``It was said in French
but the umpire understands French.''
	   The default was the only result of the day as rain washed out
play.
	   Pioline, who reached the semifinals at the French Open last
month, is seeded eighth for Wimbledon starting next week.
	   He faces a heavy fine for the incident and also loses whatever
prize money he would have earned from the tournament and gets zero
points for computer rankings. This tournament must also be included
in his top 14 performances for ranking purposes.
	   Pioline claimed the default was unfair.
	   ``If the top players say something, nothing happens,'' he said.
``Everyone says tennis is getting boring but if you say things you
get defaulted.''
	   The incident arose after Pioline thought a let should have been
called on his serve. He lost the point when Draper hit a forehand
return for a winner.
	   Pioline walked up to Bravo and started shouting at him.
	   The Chilean umpire immediately called a code violation for
verbal abuse, then suspended play and called for tournament
supervisor Armstrong.
	   Armstrong spoke with Bravo and Pioline before announcing, ``Code
violation, verbal abuse. Default Mr. Pioline.''
	   In 1996, the ATP Tour specified that a player can face automatic
default _ rather than just a warning or point penalty _ if he
verbally or physically abuses an umpire.
	   Andre Agassi was kicked out of the RCA Championships in
Indianapolis in 1996 for cursing officials, while John McEnroe was
booted from the Australian Open for verbal abuse in 1990.

Arrests made in ticket scandal, threats made to disrupt US-Iran game AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Street violence, ticket fraud, bickering players
and now political protests _ everything but goals.
	   The World Cup can't seem to get away from the real world.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said Wednesday that Iranian exile
groups threatened to demonstrate against the Tehran government at
Sunday's politically charged World Cup match between the United
States and Iran in Lyon.
	   ``We have received more-or-less anonymous letters from groups of
exiled Iranians who say they will do something to disrupt the match
to show what is going on in their country,'' Blatter said.
	   He declined to identify the groups or say if any specific type
of action was threatened. He also said he was certain police and
security forces would be able to deal with any problems.
	   Iran is already upset with a French television network for
Monday night's broadcast of a U.S. film, ``Not Without My
Daughter,'' which paints an unflattering picture of Islamic Iran.
	   An official at the Iranian embassy said the country had
considered pulling its team out of the tournament buckeyes of the
film, but decided against it.
	   ``The national team will stay in France and play with the United
States,'' said the official, who refused to be identified by name.
	   Staying in the tournament is one thing, scoring is another. And
that isn't happening much.
	   Wednesday's first match was a poor, blunder-filled game, ending
with Ivica Vastic's second-half injury time goal that gave Austria
a 1-1 draw with Chile at Saint-Etienne. It's the second time in row
the Austrians have pulled that trick: Anton Polster netted in
injury time last week in a 1-1 draw with Italy.
	   Marcelo Salas scored in the 70th minute for Chile, making him
the first player at France '98 to score three goals.
	   After a flurry of goals _ including two from Salas _ in the
first two days of the tournament, the last 15 matches over six days
have produced an average of just 2.07 goals per game.
	   Late Wednesday, Italy faced Cameroon in Montpellier.
	   Meanwhile, police sources said the first arrests had been made
in the international scandal that left thousands of fans without
World Cup tickets that had been paid for.
	   French authorities arrested three people, including a consultant
for a subsidiary of FIFA's exclusive marketing partner, ISL Ltd.,
the sources said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. A large
amount of cash and about 100 Cup tickets were found, the sources
said, and more arrests were expected.
	   Player misbehavior was also in the limelight Wednesday.
	   After initially saying he wouldn't discuss the matter, Patrick
Kluivert has told a Dutch newspaper that Belgian defender Lorenzo
Staelens called him a rapist during their World Cup match on
Saturday.
	   Enraged by the alleged comment, the 21-year-old Dutch striker
waved his finger at Staelens then elbowed him in the chest, drawing
an immediate ejection and a two-match suspension.
	   ``Staelens called me a rapist,'' Kluivert told the Algemeen
Dagblad for Wednesday's edition. ``I'm used to being called a
nigger on the football field ... that doesn't hurt me any more. But
when I heard this I could no longer control myself.''
	   Kluivert was accused last June in an alleged gang rape with a
group of friends of a woman they picked up outside an Amsterdam
night club. Police investigated the incident, but decided against
prosecuting the case because of insufficient evidence.
	   Another disgruntled player is Colombia's Faustino Asprilla, who
went on the radio and criticized coach Hernan Dario Gomez. Asprilla
claimed Gomez had ``disrespected'' him when he took him out of
Monday's game against Romania five minutes from the end.
	   On Wednesday, Gomez promptly removed the star midfielder from
his plans for the rest of the World Cup.
	   ``He took himself out of the team with his behavior,'' Gomez
said.
	   In Marseille, where three days of violence surrounded England's
2-0 victory over Tunisia on Monday, more than 100 people remained
jailed. Some have received jail sentences of at least two months,
and others will be kept behind bars until the World Cup ends July
12.
	   In Toulouse, French police are bracing for another round of fan
violence as English supporters make their way to the site of
England's next game against Romania on Monday.
	   While saying he was ``saddened'' by the violence, Blatter said
he hoped it would not take on ``too much importance.''
	   ``It's impossible to make a kind of ghetto out of each city
before each soccer match,'' Blatter said. ``I'm convinced that from
today, we won't have that hooligan problem anymore.''

Nostalgia brings curtain call for standing long jump 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Call it the ghost of track meets past.
	   Not seen at the Olympic Games since 1912, the standing long jump
made a brief and sentimental appearance Wednesday at Athens'
Tsiklitiria International Track Meet.
	   The annual meet is named after Kostas Tsiklitiras, a Greek who
was the world's last Olympic champion standing broad-jumper. He
died a year after taking the gold medal in the 1912 Stockholm
Olympics with a 3.37 meter leap. The event was eliminated the same
year.
	   ``Of course you need to have certain qualifications, but it's
not the same as more prestigious events,'' said Anastasios
Makrinikolas, 21, who finished last in Wednesday's all Greek
six-man field.
	   The top finisher, Christos Kyritsis, jumped 3.22 meters.

	   CRNI LUG, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Demonstrating their growing support
and confidence, the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army buried a
fallen comrade with military honors Wednesday after a funeral
attended by thousands of villagers.
	   Imer Krasniqi, 41, was shot Tuesday by a Serb sniper not far
from his home village of Crni Lug, about 35 kilometers (20 miles)
southwest of the provincial capital of Pristina.
	   About 200 armed ethnic Albanian militants, including a handful
of women, stood at attention as the wooden coffin, draped with a
red and black Albanian flag, was carried to the grave on a hill
overlooking Crni Lug.
	   A six-man honor guard fired three times into the air as his
grieving family looked on, surrounded by about 5,000 people from
surrounding villages.
	   ``We came because he is our fighter,'' said one, a 35-year-old
former truck driver who gave only his first name, Behram. ``We are
all with them,'' he said, referring to the KLA.
	   Serb police, stationed at checkpoints just a few kilometers
(miles) from Crni Lug, did not interfere with the funeral. The
village is within the 40 percent or so of Kosovo the ethnic
Albanian militants say they control.
	   Foreign journalists were allowed to witness the burial, but not
to interview any KLA members, who were dressed in a hodge-podge of
camouflage uniforms with mismatched caps and carried a variety of
guns.
	   Little is known about the group's size or structure, but the
militants have recently started to emerge from the shadows as they
gain more and more popular support _ apparently at the expense of
the ethnic Albanians' pacifist political leader, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Serbia has branded the KLA terrorists and has waged an
anti-insurgency campaign against them since February. More than 300
people have been killed in the fighting and tens of thousands
forced from their homes.
	   Fighting reportedly continued Wednesday. Ethnic Albanian sources
said Serbs shelled four villages in the Klina region, 50 kilometers
(30 miles) west of Kosovo.

Eighty people accused of spying expelled from central Russia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 80 foreigners have been expelled from the
Ulyanovsk region in central Russia for alleged espionage in the
last 18 months, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Wednesday.
	   The industrial region on the Volga River attracts spies because
of its many factories, research centers and formerly secret
installations, the news agency said, quoting Gen. Leonid
Stepanenko, regional chief of the Federal Security Service.
	   Among other things, Ulyanovsk is home to a large auto factory
and the Aviastar airplane company that makes the Tupolev 204,
similar to the Boeing 757, and the Antonov 124 military transport
plane.
	   The expelled foreigners were involved in collecting classified
information about Russia's national property, Stepanenko said. The
report did not elaborate.
	   Ulyanovsk, 720 kilometers (430 miles) east of Moscow, was Soviet
founder Vladimir Lenin's hometown.

Blair emphasizes IRA disarmament `essential' on eve of vote 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair emphasized Wednesday
that Irish Republican Army disarmament was ``essential'' to making
the Northern Ireland peace agreement work.
	   Blair offered his assurances to opposition Conservatives and the
north's pro-British Protestant politicians on the eve of a House of
Commons vote to approve early paroles for convicted IRA and
pro-British militants.
	   The Conservatives and the Ulster Unionists, the major Protestant
party that supported the April 10 agreement, last week registered
their opposition to the proposed legislation, which would allow
more than 400 imprisoned members of the IRA and two pro-British
gangs, the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster Volunteer Force,
to be freed by mid-2000 if their truces hold.
	   Since then, lawmakers have been considering, and rejecting, a
trove of proposed amendments authored by Conservatives and Ulster
Unionists that would more bluntly link any paroles to the gradual
disarmament of the IRA, UDA and UVF.
	   ``We will look very, very carefully at any amendments that are
tabled,'' Blair said in an appeal for hard-liners from other
parties to support his overwhelming Labor Party majority in
Thursday's deciding vote.
	   ``But they cannot rewrite the agreement,'' he said in reference
to those seeking to tighten up the paroles legislation.
	   Disarmament ``is and remains an essential part of that
agreement,'' Blair said.
	   The Financial Times newspaper of London reported Wednesday that
Padraic Wilson, the IRA commander inside Northern Ireland's Maze
prison, had said in an interview that the IRA would consider
discarding its weapons under international supervision.
	   The agreement, supported by the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party,
specifies this should happen by mid-2000, though it doesn't link
this deadline with paroles.
	   Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, on Wednesday
called IRA disarmament ``a dead-end issue.''
	   ``I think far too much attention has been paid to this issue.
From the beginning, this issue has been hyped up by the Ulster
Unionist Party,'' said McGuinness, a reputed former IRA commander,
in response to the Financial Times report.

Mexico negotiating team fails to make contact with Zapatistas to conform. No pickup

Eds: RECASTS, leads with second attempt fails, trip ending. EDITS

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA REALIDAD, Mexico (AP) _ Failing twice in efforts to meet
Zapatista leaders, a team of congressmen left this remote rebel
stronghold Wednesday still hoping to revive peace talks between
insurgents and the government.
	   No leaders of the Zapatista National Liberation Army came to
meet the multi-party mediation group that arrived Tuesday in hopes
of heading off a renewed conflict in southern Mexico following
clashes last week.
	   Instead, the congressmen left an envelope with a thin,
T-shirt-clad Tolojabal Indian identified only as Miguel, a leader
of the local farm cooperative
	   ``We don't know anything about the rebels,'' he said. ``We have
lost contact with them and as I told you, I will give them the
document you brought when they come down from the mountains.''
	   The congressmen waited for about two hours under a hot sun for
the first meeting with Miguel. They returned at night for a second
encounter, as crickets chirped and dogs barked around them.
	   They left Wednesday, saying they would return later to seek a
response.
	   This village 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of the Guatemalan
border _ and several hours journey by rutted dirt track from the
nearest paved road _ has become the standard meeting point between
visitors and Zapatista officials.
	   But nobody seems to know where to find rebel leaders, despite
the first notable confrontations between government and rebel
forces in more than three years. Zapatista leaders issued no
communiques, nor given any interviews since March.
	   The Zapatistas staged a brief uprising in January 1994 in the
name of Indian rights and greater democracy. At least 145 people
died before a cease-fire took hold two weeks later.
	   The last serious threat to the truce came in February 1995, when
the government sent troops into Zapatista-held territory, saying it
wanted to arrest rebel leaders. That led to renewed peace talks.
	   The multi-party mediation commission said it hoped to persuade
the Zapatistas to renew the talks that stalled in late 1996 in a
dispute over how to implement the only major accord reached so far:
greater rights for Mexico's Indians.
	   The cease-fire has been threatened by a series of army and
police raids on pro-Zapatista townships since January to arrest
people accused of murder, kidnapping or usurping government powers.
	   Zapatista fighters clashed with hundreds of troops and police
during the latest raids on June 10 in the township of El Bosque,
and at least 10 people were killed.
	   Another group of congressmen from the mediation commission
visited El Bosque Tuesday. But villagers, still enraged by last
week's raid, refused to talk with the men, accusing them of being
from the government.

World Cup: Whining and complaining all right with Sampson AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos XLF101-106
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ U.S. soccer players finally
sound like real pro athletes: When they lose, they whine and
complain.
	   The 2-0 loss to Germany on Monday left players questioning
themselves and their coach. Steve Sampson, in turned, questioned
some of his starters as the Americans prepared for Sunday's
politically charged game against Iran.
	   Eric Wynalda, the starting forward, was a non-factor against the
Germans, saying he never had the ball in a scoring situation and it
was the first time in 101 international games he never took one
single shot.
	   ``Everything was in place for Eric to grasp the opportunity''
Sampson responded Wednesday. ``When Frankie (Hejduk) got in, he got
off a shot, didn't he? Can you imagine how much work it took to get
to the near post? Tab Ramos got off a shot. Brian Maisonneuve
created situations from himself. I think it's all a matter of how
badly you want it.''
	   Players said some Americans were hanging their heads in practice
Tuesday night and Wednesday, and that it took some motivational
talk from Alexi Lalas to get them going.
	   ``Much of the team, just about everybody, was down,'' Ramos
said. ``I think that maybe some of the people who weren't as
experienced think about it a little more.''
	   Lalas, a starter in 1994, has been on the bench in recent
months. The defender with the flaming red hair and goatee took it
upon himself to try to wake his somnambulant teammates.
	   ``At halftime of the Germany game, from the time the players
first walked into the locker room, Alexi lifted their spirits and
got them refocused on the task at hand, which was playing better in
the second half,'' Sampson said. ``Today in training, he did the
same kind of things.''
	   Ramos, who will start against Iran, and Wynalda were the most
vocal players criticizing Sampson for leaving too many veterans on
the bench against Germany and starting seven World Cup rookies. The
coach said he thought his players needed to ``vent'' and seemed to
pay little attention to the criticism.
	   ``I think they were angry. It's more important to me how they
play than what they say,'' Sampson said. ``It's natural to go
through an angry period after a game like that, which I think is
healthy. The best way to deal with that is to train.''
	   Players have criticized themselves for taking too defensive an
approach against the Germans. The U.S. players can't afford to make
the same mistake Sunday, when they need a win or a tie to avoid
mathematical elimination.
	   All of them think Iran is the easiest of the four teams in the
group, and many have concluded they must beat both Iran and
Yugoslavia to advance.
	   ``There's no more ties for us,'' Hejduk said. ``We can't afford
to tie anyone. We have to throw as many people as we can forward.
That takes a lot of running from everyone on the team, to get four,
five guys in the box.''
	   Hejduk, who came in at the start of the second half, was the
only American who came close to scoring against the Germans and
will start against Iran. Sampson hinted he may alter his 3-6-1
formation (three defenders, six midfielders and one forward) and
start two forwards.
	   That could result in starting both Wynalda and Roy Wegerle, or
perhaps Wegerle and Brian McBride.
	   ``We're going to consider everything,'' Sampson said.

Lawmakers approve creation of forest giant with Stora Enso merger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved
Wednesday the merger of Finland's Enso, and the Swedish company,
Stora, which will create the world's biggest producer of paper and
board.
	   The 118-41 vote, with 41 abstensions or absentees, followed
hours of heated debate over government ownership in the new
company.
	   Once the merger is complete, the Finnish state will be the
largest owner of the Stora Enso with an 18-percent stake. Sweden's
Investor AB, currently the single largest owner in Stora, will have
about 10 percent.
	   Enso is 44-percent state owned, and Finnish law stipulates that
any reduction in government ownership of the company needed the
approval of Parliament.
	   The companies have predicted savings of some dlrs 240 million
per year from the deal. They expect job cuts to be limited to 500
positions, mainly at the headquarters and regional offices.
	   Stora Enso's headquarters will be in Finland, but the company
will have executive offices in both Helsinki and Stockholm.
	   Enso and Stora had a combined annual revenue of about dlrs 12
billion last year and 40,000 employees in 40 countries. The deal
will help them to better compete against low-cost producers from
Asia and Latin America.

Investigator used ``guesswork'' in Indian armsdrop case 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ The police official on whose report a
former British army officer was charged with waging war against
India said Wednesday that he used ``guess work'' in the sensational
case related to a huge arms drop.
	   Tapan Kumar Mitra said in court that he believed a huge cache of
Russian-made arms and ammunition had been airdropped from an
aircraft in a remote village in West Bengal state in December 1995.
	   Mitra was cross-examined by suspect Peter Bleach, who is
defending himself in court.
	   Bleach and five Latvians have been in jail since their arrest
for allegedly parachuting assault rifles, antitank missiles, rocket
launchers, grenades and thousands of rounds of ammunition from an
AN-26 cargo plane. The suspects have denied the allegations. If
convicted, they could face life imprisonment or even death.
	   Mitra acknowledged he had not seen the plane nor met anyone who
saw it fly over the huge rural expanse. He said he described the
arms as Russian-made in his police report on the basis of hearsay.
	   He said he had prepared a map, showing the places where the arms
landed, on the basis of ``guess work.''
	   Mitra said villagepeople in the Purulia district of the state,
where he was posted, told him they heard the droning of an airplane
and a loud thud after which they discovered the arms.
	   Police said the wooden crates containing arms and ammunition
were meant for an insurgency against the West Bengal state
government by a cult called Ananda Marg (Happy Path), based in
Purulia town, near where the boxes were dropped.
	   Air force jets intercepted the cargo plane when it returned to
India and arrested the six at Bombay airport.
	   The plane belonged to the Hong Kong-based Carol Airlines owned
by New Zealander Kim Peter Davy, who fled after the plane landed.

Jane's: India's potential nuclear arsenal is bigger than Britain's 
</HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ India's potential nuclear arsenal is bigger than
Britain's and in the same league as the French and Chinese, Jane's
Intelligence Review reported Wednesday.
	   Pakistan, however, exhausted a significant part of its meager
arsenal in last month's nuclear tests _ and the poor performance of
its weapons revealed the country's strategic nuclear weakness, the
respected military magazine said.
	   Last month's rival nuclear tests by the South Asian neighbors,
who have fought three wars in the last 50 years, heightened fears
of a new nuclear arms race that could ultimately spread to other
aspiring nuclear nations.
	   While the international community has been trying to put the
brakes on the development of nuclear weapons in South Asia, Jane's
Intelligence Review said in its July issue that India logically
sees greater security in furthering its nuclear potential.
	   Its special report on the tests was written mainly by W.P.S.
Sidhu, a specialist on South Asian security issues who did his
doctoral thesis at Cambridge University on the development of
India's nuclear doctrine and now works at the Rockefeller
Foundation in New York.
	   According to Jane's, India's nuclear weapons program is
primarily based on weapons-grade plutonium reprocessed from fuel
taken from the CIRUS and Dhruva research reactors located at
Trombay.
	   Based on the fissile material produced by the two reactors,
India's stockpile is now estimated at between 20 and 60 nuclear
weapons, the magazine said.
	   By contrast, Pakistan's arsenal is now estimated at between 6
and 12 nuclear weapons, it said.
	   But India also has commercial nuclear reactors to produce
electricity, which also produce plutonium. While this plutonium is
not considered ideal for use in nuclear weapons, Britain has
successfully made nuclear weapons from it, and there are
indications that Indian scientists attempted ``a similar feat'' in
the two tests conducted May 13, Jane's said.
	   ``Although they do not appear to have been entirely successful,
the information gathered from these tests would go a long way in
giving India the ability to build weapons from reactor fuel,'' it
said.
	   According to one estimate, if India's commercial reactor fuel
was taken into account, the country would possess enough fissile
material to build at least 390 nuclear weapons and as many as 470
weapons, Jane's said.
	   ``This makes the potential Indian nuclear arsenal bigger than
that of Britain and in the same league as the French and the
Chinese,'' the magazine said.
	   According to estimates by the Washington-based National
Resources Defense Council, at the end of 1996, Britain had 260
nuclear weapons, China had 400 and France had 450.
	   Jane's Intelligence Review said India is also developing land,
sea and air systems to deliver nuclear weapons.
	   India's Sukhoi Su-30 fighters can already deliver a nuclear
payload to Pakistan and deep into China, but their range and flight
time will be ``substantially enhanced'' when it takes delivery of
six Ilyushin Il-78 refueling tankers ordered from Russia early this
year, the magazine said.
	   But India's two nuclear-capable missiles, the Prithvi and the
Agni, are expected to be the mainstay of its nuclear delivery
system, Jane's said. While the Agni is still in the development
stage, India's Prithvi force is considered to be in the range of 20
to 50 missiles, it said.
	   The magazine said there are reports that a surface ship-launched
version of the Prithvi could become operational as early as 2001.
India's Defense Research and Development Organization is also
working on a submarine-launched missile called Sagarika, which
could become operational by 2010, Jane's said.
	   As for Pakistan, the report said seasoned analysts insist its
first tests involved a maximum of three devices _ not five as the
government claimed. And the estimated cumulative force of the
blasts is between 2 and 12 kilotons and most likely around 6
kilotons, far smaller than the 18 kilotons that the Pakistani
government reported.
	   Pakistan's second blast measured only 1.2 kilotons, suggesting
the test was ``a fizzle,'' Jane's said. According to analysts, its
aim was to design a smaller warhead that could fit the country's
recently test-fired Ghauri missile, which can strike targets deep
in India, the magazine said.

World Cup: Late Vastic strike earns Austria another 1-1 tie Eds UPDATES with detail, quotes 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Another late equalizer earned
Austria an ill-deserved 1-1 tie with Chile Wednesday as Herbert
Prohaska's team scrambled its second tie of the World Cup.
	   After Tony Polster's strike had gained a 1-1 tie with Cameroon
in Toulouse June 11, this time it was substitute Ivica Vastic who
came up with the leveler. Each time the late goal was in
second-half injury time with the Austrians looking well beaten.
	   Marcelo Salas scrambled his third goal of the World Cup as Chile
moved into a 1-0 lead with 20 minutes to go and Austrian goalkeeper
Michael Konsel made a brilliant, finger-tip save to deny Ivan
Zamorano in the 88th minute.
	   It proved a vital save as Vastic curled a right-footed shot from
22 meters past Chilean goalkeeper Nelson Tapia in the second minute
of injury time. The long, looping ball went from the right into the
left corner of the net.
	   The result gave both teams two points from two games with Italy
and Cameroon, one point apiece, meeting later Wednesday.
	   It should have been Chile's game, judging from possession, ball
control and scoring opportunities. Still Austrian players said the
draw was well-deserved, if lucky.
	   ``It's no miracle, it's football'' said midfielder Harald Cerny,
one of the better Austrian players Wednesday. ``We fought hard.''
	   He acknowledged Austria's shortcomings on the attack, alluding
to several chances lost after the midfield had played the ball to
Polster or attacking midfielder Mario Haas.
	   ``We look good in the backfield, but the game up front is too
stiff, we don't trust ourselves on the attack.''
	   Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska also faulted his team's
attacking game.
	   ``We had a good defense,'' he said. ``Offensively we lacked
cohesion, we lacked spontaneity as far as passing is concerned.
	   ``We really failed on the right side for 90 minutes, so we had
to start playing on the left side.''
	   Chilean Coach Nelson Acosta was predictably disappointed by the
last-minute Austrian goal.
	   ``I do not know what to say, why we have to suffer through
things like this,'' he said. ``I do not know what happened, can't
explain it.''
	   Chile's Moises Villarroel moved into a good shooting position 25
meters from goal from a neat pass by Fabian Estay but Konsel
watched it fly well wide of the post.
	   Austria's first shot at goal didn't come until the 38th minute
when Mario Haas fired goalwards from 18 meters. It was on target
but it was blocked by a Chilean defender long before it would have
reached keeper Tapia.
	   With the Austrian strikeforce kept at bay by a well-organized
Chilean defense and midfield, neither goalkeeper had anything to
save until the 42nd minute when Tapia dived to hold the ball at the
foot of the post from an angled cross from Heimo Pfeifenberger.
	   Chile should have gone ahead in the 53rd minute when Villarroel
made the overlap on the right and ran clear of the Austrian
defense. He messed it up completely.
	   Villarroel took the wrong option, firing at the near post
instead of the far post, and his shot appeared to be going wide
anyway before Konsel blocked it with his left hand.
	   There was an even better chance in the 62nd when Salas got clear
down the right and Zamorano was unmarked in the center. Salas, who
scored twice in the 2-2 tie with Italy, aimed for his
strike-partner but his cross was far too close to Konsel who
gathered easily, leaving Zamorano frustrated.
	   The Chileans finally got it right in the 70th minute but only
just.
	   Egyptian referee Gamal Ghandour awarded them a free kick just
outside the area wide on the left, Zamorano climbed to head
goalwards and Konsel half stopped it.
	   Salas forced the rebound goalwards from six meters out and the
Austrian 'keeper was convinced he had got back to stop the ball
rolling over the line.
	   Ghandour didn't agree and Chile led 1-0 with 20 minutes to go.
	   Three minutes from the end, Zamorano nearly made it 2-0 when he
collected a forward pass and charged clear. His low shot was headed
just inside the post but Konsel got down to finger-tip the ball
round the post.
	   Lineups:
	   Austria _ Michael Konsel; Peter Schoettel, Anton Pfeffer,
Wolfgang Feiersinger, Mario Haas (Ivica Vastic, 74th); Heimo
Pfeifenberger, Harald Cerny, Arnold Wetl, Roman Maehlich; Dietmar
Kuehbauer (Andreas Herzog, 46th), Anton Polster.
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier
Margas, Moises Villarroel (Cristian Castaneda, 67th); Francisco
Rojas, Nelson Parraguez, Clarence Acuna, Fabian Estay (Jose Sierra,
57th); Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   Referee _ Gamal Ghandour, Egypt.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ German military observers on Wednesday performed
their first inspection flight over Russia's Northern Urals under
the Open Skies Treaty, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The 1992 treaty, signed by 27 countries, promotes openness by
allowing participating countries to gather information about each
other's military forces through unarmed observation flights.
	   The treaty has been ratified by all signatories except Russia
and Ukraine.
	   Earlier this month, French observers performed an Open Skies
flight over Russia's Southern Urals.

After Falklands landing, pilot to face charges of flight violations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ An Argentine pilot who made an
unscheduled landing in the Falkland Islands will face charges of
civil aviation violations, a British embassy official said
Wednesday.
	   Eduardo Lucio Barcella, who landed his twin-plane engine on the
islands Monday, was scheduled to fly back to Argentina in his own
plane Wednesday. However, he was delayed due to inclement weather,
said Andres Federman, a British embassy spokesman.
	   Federman said the islands' government decided to allow Barcella
to return on condition that he face charges of not filing proper
flight plans with aviation authorities.
	   While in the Falklands, Barcella will continue to be detained as
an illegal immigrant, a statement issued by the islands' government
said.
	   Since the end of the 1982 Falkland Islands war, Argentines have
not been able to travel to the Falklands, over which Great Britain
maintains sovereignty.
	   On Monday, Barcella, who told local authorites he was headed for
a southern coastal city, took off from Comodoro Rivadavia, 1711 kms
(1061 miles) south of Buenos Aires.
	   Hours later he landed at the islands' Mount Pleasant military
base, escorted by a British fighter plane,
	   According to local reports, the 35-year-old engineer, who now
lives in Bakersfield, California, is on a flight tour of the
Americas.

Once again, Russian president brings back Chubais to solve crisis analysis, background.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three months after firing him, President Boris
Yeltsin brought Russia's most disliked reformer back into the
government Wednesday in an effort to save the country's flailing
economy.
	   Anatoly Chubais, who has now been fired and rehired by Yeltsin
twice, was named deputy prime minister and placed in charge of
relations with international lending organizations.
	   The appointment coincided with an announcement confirming what
the markets have suspected for weeks _ that Russia is seeking a new
bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Chubais's new job will make him Russia's point man with the IMF
and other Western aid agencies, who laud his efforts to privatize
state companies and reform the still shaky economy.
	   But the same actions have made him one of the country's most
widely reviled politicians. Russians accuse him of squandering
valuable state assets and deepening their poverty.
	   Yeltsin emphasized that Chubais will not be a ``standing
member'' of the Cabinet _ an apparent effort to appease critics by
suggesting that Chubais will not control overall economic policy.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said new IMF money is needed to
replenish currency reserves in case there is a serious run on the
ruble. He refused to say how large a loan Russia is seeking.
	   The stock market rose Wednesday on the news, closing 7.7 percent
higher.
	   Russia's stock and financial markets plunged late last month,
triggered by a drop in world oil prices, a wave of miners' strikes,
and lingering nerves over the Asian financial crisis. The stock
market lost half its value since the beginning of the year.
	   The skid slowed when rumors of an IMF bailout began to
circulate. However, the government insisted in public that new
lending was unnecessary and it could resolve the crisis on its own.
	   All the same, the government has acknowledged that it is
desperate to prevent a devaluation of the ruble, fearing that a new
round of inflation, combined with a chronic inability to pay wages,
could lead to social unrest and political instability.
	   Sergei Dubinin, the head of the Central Bank, reiterated
Wednesday that the ruble would not be devalued and said the bank
still has dlrs 15 billion in reserves. However, those reserves
could be depleted rapidly if the bank is forced to prevent a run on
the currency.
	   Negotiating the terms of the IMF loan will be one of Chubais'
first tasks. He had a head start, since he traveled to the United
States last month as Yeltsin's envoy to ask the IMF and other
lenders for help.
	   Yeltsin has twice fired Chubais from his Cabinet. In January
1996 he was ousted as deputy prime minister, only to be brought
back into government a few months later to run Yeltsin's reelection
campaign.
	   He was fired again in early March, and has since been serving as
head of Russia's huge state-owned electricity monopoly, Unified
Energy Systems.
	   Along with pressing the IMF for new credits, the government is
preparing an emergency program involving deep spending cuts and
aggressive tax collection.
	   The IMF has insisted on precisely such measures, even delaying
installments of a current dlrs 10 billion loan in an effort to
force Russian compliance.

Whole family killed by lightning

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A powerful bolt of lightning killed
eight people who had taken shelter under a tree while picking
strawberries in northern Romania.
	   An entire family _ a man and woman, their children aged 4 and
14, and a grandfather _ were among the victims, police said
Wednesday.
	   The other three killed, and four injured, were friends of the
same Feher family, officer Vasile Lupu said in the city of Satu
Mare.
	   All 12 were picking strawberries when a sudden storm drove them
into a hut made of corn cobs and covered with iron sheeting under a
large tree near Satu Mare, 450 kilometers (280 miles) northwest of
Bucharest.

	   LA TOUR DU PIN, France (AP) _ Mercurial forward Faustino
Asprilla was dismissed from the Colombian World Cup side for the
rest of the tournament on Wednesday after publicly criticizing
coach Hernan Dario Gomez.
	   ``He took himself out of the team with his behavior,'' Gomez
said.
	   Gomez revealed he took his drastic decision because Asprilla
``broke the rules we had established'' when he criticized him and
some teammates in a radio interview.
	   Asprilla's departure was supported Colombian Football Federation
president Alvaro Fina, who said that ``unfortunately, he had to be
removed from the team. There is a limit for everything, and this
time he went over the limit.''
	   Asprilla left the team's headquarters in La Tour du Pin, near
Lyon, this afternoon, accompanied by his agent Gustavo Mascardi,
according to sources from the hotel.
	   Asprilla claimed Gomez had a group of ``preferred'' players and
that the coach had ``disrespected'' him when he took him out of the
Colombia's 1-0 loss to Romania on Monday with five minutes
remaining.
	   Gomez had warned Tuesday that he might take a dramatic action.
	   ``I can't let this go by. If he is so upset, he should go. I
won't let him disrupt the team,'' he said.
	   The announcement caused shock waves in Colombia, where President
Ernesto Samper even tried to persuade Gomez to reconsider his
decision.
	   ``I personally talked to him. He stressed what 'Tino' represents
to the world, to the country, and to the hopes of Colombians to
advance to the second round,'' Fina said.
	   But neither Fina nor Gomez yielded.
	   ``We would have wanted to please not only him, but the whole
country. But we had no arguments'' considering what he did, he
said.
	   Colombian players were given Tuesday off and most used it to
visit Paris. Reached there by a radio reporter, Asprilla said that
there were ``untouchable'' players on the field who were not
substituted, regardless of their performance.
	   ``There are players whose performance was worse than mine
yerderday, and were never taken out of a game. And I was
substituted with five minutes remanining. It seems to me a show of
disrespect,'' Asprilla complained to radio Caracol.
	   Asprilla was replaced by Leider Preciado, a young striker with
little international experience.
	   Gomez felt no need to explain his actions.
	   ``Everybody saw (the game) on TV. I don't have much to add,'' he
said.
	   Gomez claimed Asprilla had no right to complain that he
preferred some players since ``the most preferred player has been
him.''
	   Asprilla almost took himself out of the World Cup before the
start because he didn't feel fit. A few weeks before the opening
kickoff he was still recovering from a groin injury that had him
out of action for almost six months.
	   Gomez waited for him until the very last minute and said he was
ready to take Asprilla to France ``even if he played on one leg,''
since he considered him a player who can make a difference.
	   The coach also said that Asprilla should emulate other World Cup
stars that ``run and sweat on the field, and don't talk off the
field.''
	   Asprilla returned to Parma this year after two seasons with
England's Newcastle.
	   Asprilla has had series of off-field troubles during his career
including a pistol-firing incident at a New Year's party in Tulua,
Colombia, in 1995 and the year before that he injured his foot
after kicking a bus in a dispute after an auto accident.
	   He didn't comment on his dismissal from the team Wednesday.

Christie weeps in witness box 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Olympic and world champion sprinter Linford
Christie wept while giving evidence in his libel action over a
magazine article acusing him of using performance enhancing drugs.
	   Christie launched the libel action in the High Court on
Wednesday over claims by John McVicker, a convicted armed robber
turned writer, in the now defunct Spiked magazine.
	   Christie, 38, fell silent and then started weeping with emotion
five minutes after he went into the witness box.
	   ``I sit here and what am I guilty of?'' Christie said.
	   ``I worked so hard ... I trained hard.
	   ``To sit here and people accuse me of cheating ... I just get so
emotional about my athletics.''
	   Christie won the Olympic 100 meter gold medal at Barcelona in
1992 and was world 100 meter champion in 1995.
	   An active participant in anti-drugs campaigns, Christie said he
would be lying if he said he did not think some people in track and
field used drugs.
	   ``Some of them do. I don't know who. I know that I don't,'' he
said.
	   Christie is suing McVicar over an article ``How did Linford get
this good?'', which appeared in satirical magazine, Spiked, in
September 1995.
	   Christie is also suing printers and distributors of the article.
	   McVicar wrote that Christie, who has now retired from
competitive running, had been ``outwitting the testers for years''
and exhibited a number of ``possible effects'' of
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   ``His remarkable physique, in regard to both its bulk and
definition, is consistent with the use of anabolic steroids,'' the
article said.
	   Christie's lawyer, Patrick Moloney said the ``very serious,
untrue and damaging allegation was the most serious thing you could
ever say about a top professional sportsman.''
	   ``If that were true, his whole life and his whole career would
be a sham,'' he said.
	   Moloney said Christie had been tested more than 100 times and
had only ``nearly tested positive'' once at Seoul in 1988, and was
subsequently cleared, when a tiny quantity of a substance that
could be derived from the legal health supplement, ginseng, was
detected.
	   The hearing, which is expected to take three weeks, was
adjourned until Thursday.

Nostalgia brings curtain call for standing long jump 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The standing long jump, not seen at the
Olympic Games since 1912, made a brief and sentimental appearance
Wednesday at Athens' Tsiklitiria International Track Meet.
	   The annual meet is named after Kostas Tsiklitiras, a Greek who
was the world's last Olympic champion standing broad-jumper. He
died a year after taking the gold medal in the 1912 Stockholm
Olympics with a 3.37 meter (3.69-yard) leap. The event was
eliminated the same year.
	   ``Of course you need to have certain qualifications, but it's
not the same as more prestigious events,'' said Anastasios
Makrinikolas, 21, who finished last in Wednesday's all Greek
six-man field.
	   The top finisher, Christos Kyritsis, jumped 3.22 meters (3.52
yards).

	   PARIS (AP) _ A soccer game already surrounded by political and
cultural sideshows took on a new dimension Wednesday when soccer's
top official said Iranian exiles have threatened action against the
World Cup match between Iran and the United States.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said his office had received
correspondence from groups opposed to the Islamic government in
Tehran, who said there would be trouble at Sunday's match in Lyon.
	   ``We have received more-or-less anonymous letters from groups of
exiled Iranians who say they will do something to disrupt the match
to show what is going on in their country,'' Blatter said.
	   He declined to identify the groups or say if any specific type
of action was threatened.
	   The Iranian ambassador, meanwhile, put to rest reports that Iran
might pull its team out of the World Cup because of its anger at
the screening on French TV of an American film, ``Not Without My
Daughter,'' which paints an unflattering portrait of Iran.
	   ``I ask the French media to avoid giving a bad image of a
country which is participating in the World Cup,'' Iranian
Ambassador Hamidreza Assefi said in an interview on TF1 television.
	   ``Of course the Iranian team will take part in the matches and
we hope Iranians will support them.''
	   The Mujahedeen Khalq, the largest exile group, denied through a
Paris spokesman that the exiles were threatening disruption. It
said the letters were part of a campaign by Tehran to discredit the
group.
	   Security forces reportedly were told to keep a close watch at
Iran's opening match against Yugoslavia last Sunday for banners or
posters denouncing the Tehran regime.
	   Blatter said police and security forces would be able to deal
with any problems that might occur at Stade Gerland.
	   ``I'm sure the local organizing committee and the public
authorities are going to take specific measures,'' Blatter said.
``I'm sure things will be fine at the match.''
	   Big international sports events always seem to come with an
element of politics attached. But Sunday's game between two
mediocre teams struggling just to reach the second round is one of
the most politically and culturally charged matches ever held.
	   This is, after all, U.S. vs. Iran, the ``Great Satan'' vs. the
Ayatollah, West vs. East.
	   There have been no diplomatic relations between the one-time
allies since 1979, when Islamic militants overthrew the ruling shah
and took Americans hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Inability
to end that crisis helped curtail Jimmy Carter's presidency and
heaped another American embarrassment on top of Vietnam and
Watergate.
	   Recent months there has been a slight thaw in relations between
Washington and Tehran, accompanied by movement in sports.
	   A U.S. wrestling team received a warm welcome when it competed
in a Tehran tournament this year. Iranians, in turn, later wrestled
in a tournament in Oklahoma.
	   The soccer teams are playing because of a blind draw last
December that placed them in the same first-round group, along with
Germany and Yugoslavia. Both the United States and Iran lost their
opener and the loser Sunday will be virtually eliminated.
	   The Mujahedeen Khalq, one of the forces which helped topple the
shah, is the top armed exile group opposing Tehran, with leader
Massoud Rajavi and his army based in Iraq. Several representatives
of the Mujahedeen, including a brother of Rajavi, have been killed
in attacks the group blames on the Iranian government.
	   Thousands of exiled Iranians live in France.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Street violence, ticket fraud, bickering players
and now political protests _ everything but goals.
	   The World Cup can't seem to get away from the real world.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said Wednesday that Iranian exile
groups threatened to demonstrate against the Tehran government at
Sunday's politically charged World Cup match between the United
States and Iran in Lyon.
	   ``We have received more-or-less anonymous letters from groups of
exiled Iranians who say they will do something to disrupt the match
to show what is going on in their country,'' Blatter said.
	   He declined to identify the groups or say if any specific type
of action was threatened. He also said he was certain police and
security forces would be able to deal with any problems.
	   Iran already is upset with a French television network for
Monday night's broadcast of a U.S. film, ``Not Without My
Daughter,'' which paints an unflattering picture of Islamic Iran.
	   An official at the Iranian embassy said the country had
considered pulling its team out of the tournament because of the
film, but decided against it.
	   ``The national team will stay in France and play with the United
States,'' said the official, who refused to be identified by name.
	   Staying in the tournament is one thing, scoring is another. And
that isn't happening much.
	   Wednesday's first match was a poor, blunder-filled game, ending
with Ivica Vastic's second-half injury time goal that gave Austria
a 1-1 draw with Chile at Saint-Etienne. It's the second time in row
the Austrians have pulled that trick: Anton Polster netted in
injury time last week in a 1-1 draw with Cameroon.

<TEXT>
	   TANAF, Senegal (AP) _ Rebels in Guinea-Bissau were on the
retreat Wednesday after 11 days of fighting that sent thousands
fleeing and left the capital nearly deserted, Guinea-Bissau and
Senegalese officials said.
	   Guinea-Bissau's foreign minister Fernando Delfim da Silva told
The Associated Press in Lisbon that loyalist soldiers had forced
renegade troops to retreat three kilometers (two miles) from an
army garrison to the airport just outside the capital of Bissau on
Tuesday.
	   ``The rebel forces are in retreat,'' Da Silva said. ``The rebels
are pulling back to the airport.''
	   Da Silva, who was in Lisbon due to flight cancellations, said he
was told about the retreat in a phone call with Guinea-Bissau
President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   Senegal's military released a three-day-old statement signed by
its ambassador to Guinea-Bissau saying loyalists and their
Senegalese allies had on Saturday captured the Ba military garisson
where the rebellion erupted on June 7.
	   ``The moral (of the loyalists) is very good,'' the Senegalese
ambassador Ben Khatab Sokhna said in the statement issued from
Dakar and dated June 14.
	   Senegalese troops sealed the border Wednesday with their West
African neighbor to contain the conflict in Guinea-Bissau, where
they said fighting had spread to rural areas along the border.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Gambia's foreign minister held talks with
government officials in the nearly-abandoned capital of the former
Portuguese colony in an attempt to mediate.
	   ``We have come to look at the possibilities for a cease-fire,''
Mohamed Sedat Jobe was quoted as saying after a 45-minute meeting
according to the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   Government troops, backed by soldiers from neighboring Senegal
and the Republic of Guinea, had been bombarding the garrison since
the revolt began.
	   More than three-quarters of Bissau's population of 300,000
people had fled the city during the fighting, witnesses and several
aid groups said. Most of the refugees had fled with little more
than the clothes on their back.
	   The U.N. food agency, the World Food Program, reported some
100,000 refugees near the town of Mansoa, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) from the capital. A Catholic mission put the number at
150,000.
	   ``The situation in Bissau is growing progressively more
desparate,'' WFP representative Sanda Maina said in a statement
issued from Rome.
	   Villages in Guinea-Bissau were quickly running out of ways to
feed a growing influx of displaced people, another WFP official
said.
	   ``This is the rainy season, the lean season when there is not a
lot of food around,'' Wagdi Othman said from Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
	   Relief groups said the fate of the refugees could depend on the
result of the Gambian mediation efforts.
	   The Gambian minister had been reportedly scheduled to meet later
Wednesday with rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane. It was not
immediately clear whether the meeting would take place.
	   Mane, the former head of Guinea-Bissau's armed forces, has
accused Vieira of corruption and demanded he step down.
	   Vieira came to power in a 1980 coup after winning renown as a
guerilla fighter in the 1961-74 war against Portuguese colonial
rule. He was elected in the country's first democratic ballot in
1994.
	   On Tuesday, Senegal launched an artillery barrage across the
frontier into rebel territory in a move that appeared to indicate
an escalation in the conflict to involve three West African
countries.
	   Senegalese troops continued to pour over the border to reinforce
loyalist and Republic of Guinea forces.
	   The cross-border attack was aimed at dislodging Senegal's own
separatist rebels with suspected links to the mutineers in
Guinea-Bissau.
	   Thousands of refugees who fled Bissau hoping to seek refuge in
Senegal were cut off from one of their main escape routes.
	   Senegalese refugees who have lived in Guinea-Bissau for several
years were vulnerable to the artillery attacks, the U.N. refugee
agency said.
	   In a statement issued in Brussels, the European Union expressed
``deep concern'' about the extent of the fighting and reports of
civilian victims. The EU offered humanitarian aid.
	   In New York, United Nations spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt said
that all U.N. staff and their families had been evacuated by sea
from Guinea-Bissau.

Four people die in bomb explosion in Algerian cemetery 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a cemetery outside Algiers on
Wednesday, killing four people and injuring four others, French
radio reported.
	   The attack took place near Tipaza, a coastal town 70 kilometers
(44 miles) west of Algiers.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack,
reported on France Info radio. But such attacks are usually blamed
on Muslim militants waging a 6-year-old insurgency against the
military-backed government.
	   At least 75,000 people have died in Algeria since the start of
the insurgency, which erupted after the military-backed regime
canceled 1992 parliamentary elections an Islamic party appeared set
to win.

Argentina launches talks in Buenos Aires on creating a Free Trade Area of Americas 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES (AP) _ Argentina's foreign minister launched early
talks toward a Free Trade Area of the Americas, warning Wednesday
he expected limited progress until U.S. President Clinton has
``fast track'' authority in hand.
	   Guido di Tella said negotiators can begin broad talks toward an
eventual accord but would have to wait until any U.S. congressional
approval of fast track authority to tackle ``underlying issues.''
	   ``If we don't have fast track by the end of this year or early
next year, the process will begin to stall,'' di Tella told
reporters after his speech to negotiators here. ``Next year, we'll
need fast track to give the negotiations a final push.''
	   Fast track requires the U.S. Congress to approve or reject
outright _ with no amendments _ trade treaties negotiated by the
executive branch.
	   The issue has bogged down amid debate over whether to include
labor and environmental issues within fast-track powers, an effort
generally opposed to by the Republican majority in Congress.
	   ``We want a clean fast track,'' di Tella told reporters.
	   The talks here follow an April summit in neighboring Chile at
which the Western Hemisphere's 34 democracies forged ahead with a
bold plan for duty-free trade in their countries by 2005. Such a
free trade area would combine economies totaling dlrs 9 trillion
and encompass nearly 800 million people.
	   While in Chile, U.S. officials dismissed the current lack of
``fast track'' authority, which allows the president to negotiate
treaties without congressional approval. When a treaty is complete,
the U.S. Congress can either approve it or reject it, and cannot
add any conditions.
	   The nine working groups that began two days of closed-door
meetings here on Wednesday are charged with drafting chapters of
any future FTAA accord.
	   According to an initial draft work program circulated among
negotiators, the groups are expected ``to achieve concrete progress
in the negotiations by the year 2000.''
	   The working groups are studying market access, investment,
services, government procurement, dispute settlement, agriculture,
intellectual property rights, subsidies and ``dumping'' _ the
practice of selling products at below-market prices to win market
share.

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A makeshift memorial already marks the
spot where Palestinian farmer Abdel Majid Abu Turki fell, fatally
struck by a teen-age Jewish settler in a passing van.
	   But the plaintive roadside monument _ a clump of olive branches
protruding from a pile of dusty rocks _ conceals the fury many
Palestinians feel toward the Jewish settlers among them.
	   ``To them, we are targets _ they can maim and kill us at will,''
Mohammed Abu Turki, 63, a cousin of the slain man, raged as he and
other relatives waited outside the morgue at a Hebron hospital on
Wednesday, a day after the killing.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack
``horrible and unacceptable.'' But the Palestinian police commander
in Hebron, Tarek Zeid, blamed a climate of hatred _ and said acts
like this could doom the tenuous effort to restart
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
	   ``It's a terrible crime, and the Israelis bear responsibility,''
he said. ``This is the way to bury the peace process.''
	   It wasn't the first time that the close proximity of Jewish
settlers and Palestinians in and around Hebron _ one of the
angriest spots in all the West Bank _ has boiled over into
bloodshed.
	   The city is divided between Israeli and Palestinian control,
with an enclave of 500 settlers in the midst of 120,000
Palestinians. On its rocky outskirts, Jewish settlements bump up
against Palestinian villages.
	   In the most spectacular outbreak of violence here, a Jewish
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshippers at a Hebron mosque in
1994. More often, though, deaths come singly and sporadically, as
in April, when a Jewish settler was killed in a dispute with
Palestinian shepherds near a settlement outside Hebron.
	   Or as happened late Tuesday afternoon, when Abu Turki, a
45-year-old father of six, was walking home from the fields.
	   He was within sight of home when a van carrying a group of
teen-agers _ all from a halfway house for troubled youths at the
nearby Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai _ approached from behind.
One of the teens, by his own admission, reached out the window and
struck Abu Turki with a length of wood as the van passed.
	   On Wednesday, the family home was a house of mourning. The dead
man's 11-year-old daughter, Noor, wept uncontrollably in the center
of a knot of women, red-faced and flailing her arms.
	   ``My destiny is to get revenge for my father,'' she shouted,
while relatives tried to comfort her.
	   Muslim tradition calls for swift burial, but the family agreed
to a delay so that Palestinian officials could turn the body over
to Israel for an autopsy. They said they hoped doing so would help
bring about justice.
	   At the Hebron hospital, doctors beckoned journalists into a
narrow room where Abu Turki's body was laid out on a table, wrapped
in a bloody shroud. His feet, still in their worn brown shoes, were
bound together with gauze; the back of his head was nearly
obliterated by a gaping wound.
	   ``See what they did to him?'' one murmured.
	   In Jerusalem, two of the teens who were riding in the van
appeared before a magistrate Wednesday, covering their heads with
prayer shawls as they walked into court. Their names were not
released because of their age.
	   Their lawyer, Naftali Werzberger, acknowledged that one of them
had struck the deadly blow, but said the boy hadn't realized it
could be fatal to strike someone from a moving van. Werzberger also
said Turki was not targeted simply because he was a Palestinian,
but could not explain the motive for the attack.
	   The van's driver, an adult, was released by the Israeli
magistrate even though he drove on after the attack, leaving Abu
Turki lying on the side of the road. Settlers turned the boys in
after learning the victim had died.
	   At Beit Hagai, home to about 350 people, the mood was uneasy,
with some settlers fearing Palestinian retribution.
	   ``We haven't gone to the bunkers, but we're certainly alert,''
said the settlement's security chief, Zvi Katz. He said the army
had made some suggestions for improving security, which he refused
to detail but said the settlers were following.
	   He and others expressed regret over Abu Turki's death, but said
it should not be seen in political terms.
	   ``We don't know why this happened,'' Katz said. ``It's true,
though, that here you always have the sense of these things, of
Jews and Arabs, peace or not peace. ... It's hard to escape.''
	   The halfway house program was established six years ago, and
settler families serve as foster parents to the troubled teens,
Katz said. Asked whether violent, volatile Hebron was the best
place for problem juveniles, Katz sighed.
	   ``It's one incident in all these years,'' he said.

U.N. secretary-general says Turkish demand blocks Cyprus talks 
</HEADLINE>
By ALEX EFTY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Demands by the breakaway government in
northern Cyprus have blocked a resumption of talks on the island's
reunification, the U.N. secretary-general said.
	   In a report to the Security Council, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, has called
``for a new approach based on the `acknowledgement of the existence
of two fully functioning democratic states on the island.'''
	   President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader,
``reiterated his readiness to resume direct talks,'' he said.
	   Annan expressed hope that ``all parties involved will abstain
from any action which could further exacerbate tension.''
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in the north has
been branded illegal by the Security Council and is only recognized
by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The report, which was dated Tuesday, coincided with mounting
tension following a 24-hour visit by Greek warplanes to an airbase
in the south and a visit by Turkish warships taking part in a naval
exercise to ports in the north.
	   Cyprus has also ordered Russian anti-aircraft missiles, and
Turkey has warned it will act to prevent their deployment.
	   The United Nations has urged a settlement that will reunify the
island in a two-zone federation.
	   But Denktash, backed by the Turkish government, has refused to
return to the negotiating table unless his breakaway state is
recognized and the European Union breaks off membership
negotiations with the Clerides government.

Russia urges other put pressure on Kosovo to resume talks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia urged other countries Wednesday to
encourage Kosovo Albanians to resume talks with Serb President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Milosevic promised Russian President Boris Yeltsin during a
meeting in Moscow on Tuesday that he would enter talks with
moderate ethnic Albanians.
	   But Fehmi Agani, head of the four-man Kosovo Albanian
negotiating team, said Milosevic's forces must first leave the
separatist province.
	   Yeltsin had ``detailed discussions'' about Kosovo by telephone
with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Wednesday, Russian news
agencies said.
	   Yeltsin stressed the need for other countries to ``exert
appropriate international influence'' on the Kosovo Albanians and
encourage them to negotiate, said presidential adviser Sergei
Prikhodko.
	   The Kosovo Albanians must also ``stop terrorist activities,''
Prikhodko quoted Yeltsin as saying.
	   The insistence that Serb forces withdraw from Kosovo before
talks can take place is ``too hasty,'' said deputy foreign minister
Nikola Afanasyevski.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov held telephone
conversations about Kosovo on Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and
Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Gieremek, who is acting chairman
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

De Beers continues to restrict diamond supply to support prices 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The world's biggest producer
of diamonds, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., said Wednesday that
a continuing slump in consumer demand has prompted the firm to
restrict supply.
	   De Beers said sales fell by 41 percent to dlrs 1.70 billion in
the first half of 1998 compared to record sales in the first half
of 1997.
	   The latest half-year figures from De Beers' London-based
marketing arm, the Central Selling organization, are the worst
since the second half of 1994 when total gem sales amounted to dlrs
1.67 billion, Dow Jones Newswires reported.
	   De Beers blamed the decline on persistent economic woes in key
Asian markets.
	   Against the second half of 1997, sales fell by only 3.4 percent.
	   ``The impact of the South East Asia problems, which affected
retail sales only in the second half of 1997, is likely to result
in a further reduction in overall global diamond consumption in
1998,'' De Beers said in a statement.
	   In an effort to maintain prices, the CSO has reduced supply of
rough diamonds to the cutting centers ``below the level of retail
consumption,'' a statement said.
	   Current stocks of rough and polished diamonds is now dlrs 1
billion lower than in July 1997, De Beers said.
	   The world's premier diamond company said the de-stocking had
lifted trade confidence but described the recovery as ``still
fragile.''
	   De Beers, which accounts for more than 60 percent of the world's
rough, or uncut, diamond trade, reported strong growth in the
United States, Canada, India and Europe.

U.N. secretary-general says Turkish demand blocks Cyprus talks

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Demands by the breakaway government in
northern Cyprus have blocked a resumption of talks on the island's
reunification, the U.N. secretary-general said Wednesday.
	   In a report to the Security Council, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, has called
``for a new approach based on the `acknowledgement of the existence
of two fully functioning democratic states on the island.'''
	   President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader,
``reiterated his readiness to resume direct talks,'' he said.
	   Annan expressed hope that ``all parties involved will abstain
from any action which could further exacerbate tension.''
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in the north has
been branded illegal by the Security Council and is only recognized
by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The report, which was dated Tuesday and released Wednesday,
coincided with mounting tension following a 24-hour visit by Greek
warplanes to an airbase in the south and a visit by Turkish
warships taking part in a naval exercise to ports in the north.

World Cup: Late Vastic strike earns Austria another 1-1 tie Eds Recasts; UPDATES with new quotes, adds Austrian substitute Schopp 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ It was the second minute of injury
time and Chile was leading 1-0. The Austrian fans were already
starting to pack to go home. Then, a miracle.
	   Midfielder Ivica Vastic, a substitute who had not seen play in
this or any World Cup, curled a right-footed shot past Chilean
goalkeeper Nelson Tapia, and suddenly the Alpine underdogs, who had
looked almost certain to go out, were still in the World Cup.
	   Underserved? Maybe. Lucky? Perhaps. But it's not how you survive
the World Cup, it's whether you do.
	   The Austrian guardian angel which had given the squad an
injury-time 1-1 draw with Cameroon in it's first World Cup game,
had struck again. Against Cameroon, the angel looked like striker
Anton Polster. This time, Vastic.
	   While nobody was giving Austria odds on winning the World Cup
after the Chile encounter, his late strike did keep them in the
game. It also came after a stunning late save by 'keeper Michael
Konsel stopped the Chileans going 2-0 up with two minutes to go.
	   ``It's no miracle, it's football,'' said midfielder Harald
Cerny, one of the better Austrian players Wednesday. ``We fought
hard for both goals, today and against Cameroon.''
	   With two encounters _ and two draws _ behind them in Group B,
the two teams are even with two points each. Italy and Cameroon,
one point apiece were to meet later Wednesday.
	   Chilean coach Nelson Acosta, whose team appeared on course to
win against Italy June 11 until the Italians equalized 2-2 with a
controversial Roberto Baggio penalty, was predictably bitter.
	   ``I do not know what to say, why we have to suffer through
things like this,'' he said. ``I do not know what happened, can't
explain it.''
	   Enough draws, he said Wednesday. ``We will do our utmost to win
our next game'' _ against Cameroon June 23.
	   Again on Wednesday, it was Marcelo Salas who notched Chile's
goal with 20 minutes to go. With his two earlier against Italy, it
made him the tournament's top scorer.
	   It should have been Chile's game, judging from possession, ball
control and scoring opportunities.
	   Hardscrambling midfielder Harald Cerny acknowledged Austria's
shortcomings on the attack, alluding to several chances lost after
the midfield had played the ball to Polster or midfielder Mario
Haas.
	   ``We look good in the backfield, but the game up front is too
stiff, we don't trust ourselves on the attack,'' he said
	   Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska said he was happy with his
squad's defense, but ``offensively we lacked cohesion, we lacked
spontaneity as far as passing is concerned.''
	   After a bland first half, Chile should have gone ahead in the
53rd minute when midfielder Moises Villarroel made the overlap on
the right and ran clear of the Austrian defense. He messed it up
completely.
	   Villarroel took the wrong option, firing at the near post
instead of the far post, and his shot appeared to be going wide
anyway before keeper Michael
	   Konsel blocked it with his left hand.
	   There was an even better chance in the 62nd when Salas got clear
down the right and Ivan Zamorano was unmarked in the center. Salas
aimed for his strike-partner but his cross was far too close to
Konsel who gathered easily, leaving Zamorano frustrated.
	   The Chileans finally got it right in the 70th minute but only
just.
	   Egyptian referee Gamal Ghandour awarded them a free kick just
outside the area wide on the left, Zamorano climbed to head
goalwards and Konsel half stopped it.
	   Salas forced the rebound goalwards from six meters (yards) out
and the Austrian keeper was convinced he had got back to stop the
ball rolling over the line.
	   Ghandour didn't agree and Chile led 1-0 with 20 minutes to go.
	   Three minutes from the end, Zamorano nearly made it 2-0 when he
collected a forward pass and charged clear. His low shot was headed
just inside the post but Konsel got down to finger-tip the ball
round the post.
	   etmar Kuehbauer (Andreas Herzog, 46th), Anton
Polster.
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier
Margas, Moises Villarroel (Cristian Castaneda, 67th); Francisco
Rojas, Nelson Parraguez, Clarence Acuna, Fabian Estay (Jose Sierra,

Relaxed Montgomerie still looking for first major With Sports-Golf-US Open AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie promises it will be
different this time, even if the outcome is still the same.
	   From his experience at two previous major golf championships in
California, he doesn't expect to hear the kind of heckling that
followed him around Congressional at the U.S. Open last year.
	   The burden of being the most accomplished golfer in the world
without a major feels lighter this year, perhaps because The
Olympic Club doesn't suit his game as well as Congressional or
Oakmont or Pebble Beach.
	   ``I am a much more relaxed golfer than I was a few years back,''
Montgomerie said.
	   Even so, the 34-year-old Scotsman arrived at the U.S. Open full
of confidence _ some would say full of himself, but Montgomerie
will never be confused with Lou Holtz when it comes to assessing
his game or his chances.
	   He likes them, especially at the U.S. Open.
	   ``All I can do is control what I do personally, and it is
usually quite good at the U.S. Open,'' he said. ``Course management
is one of my strengths, and these courses demand a very strong
course-management skill. That is how I tend to get around U.S. Open
courses.''
	   And Montgomerie gets around them quite nicely. The trouble is,
someone else _ Ernie Els, for one _ seems to get around them a
little better.
	   Montgomerie has come painfully close to winning his first major
_ let alone his first victory on American soil.
	   A year ago, he fought through an errant driver in the second
round and a strong dose of hecklers to tie for the lead through 70
holes. But he dropped a shot on No. 17 when he was distracted by
the noise, missing a 5-foot (1.52 meters) par putt.
	   Els parred the 18th to seal the win, and Montgomerie was in
tears.
	   In 1994, Montgomerie had a one-stroke lead going into the final
nine of the U.S. Open at Oakmont until he bogeyed three straight
holes starting at No. 11. Still, he birdied the 17th from 12 feet
(3.66 meters) and parred the final hole to get into a playoff with
Els and Loren Roberts.
	   But he languished in the suffocating heat of western
Pennsylvania _ wearing all black didn't help _ and shot himself out
of the playoff with a 42 on the front. Els won on the first extra
hole.
	   His other close calls were in California. In the 1992 U.S. Open
at Pebble Beach, Montgomerie was in the clubhouse at even-par 288,
but Tom Kite held off the howling Pacific wind for his first major.
	   And at the 1995 PGA Championship at Riviera, Montgomerie birdied
the last three holes to get into a playoff with Steve Elkington,
only to watch Elkington birdie the first extra hole.
	   ``I don't think you learn unless you're in that position again,
and hopefully I will get in that position again, and probably do
something differently,'' he said. ``I am gaining experience every
round, every tournament I play. And hopefully one day, I might just
win one of these major tournaments.''
	   Whether that day comes at Olympic, its slanted fairways bending
around walls of cypress trees and rough reputed to be among the
toughest ever at a U.S. Open, is debatable.
	   Montgomerie is one of the most accurate drivers in the game,
which is why he is usually in contention at the U.S. Open. But
Olympic plays only 6,797 yards (6,213 meters), which may eliminate
some of his advantage.

Unseeded Americans oust Kafelnikov, Coetzer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Yevgeni Kafelnikov, No. 7 seed at
Wimbledon next week, tumbled out of the Heineken Open grass court
Wednesday, downed 7-5, 6-2 by American Steve Campbell.
	   The Russian, seeded two here and coming off a victory in the
Halle, Germany tourney last week, played well below his best in the
second set of his first-round match against the unseeded Campbell.
	   And in the women's WTA event here, American Kimberley Po knocked
top-seeded South African Amanda Coetzer out of the second round in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-2.
	   But the men's top seed, Australian Patrick Rafter recovered from
dropping a set to down Czech Daniel Vacek, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
	   After two days of almost constant downpour, this Wimbledon
warm-up grass court tourney made up a lot of ground in a packed day
Wednesday, with the men's first round and women's second round now
completed.
	   Another men's seed to perish was the No. 6, Brazilian Gustavo
Kuerten, who was upset in a final-set tiebreaker by Dutchman Dennis
van Scheppingen, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).
	   The women's No. 2 seed Sandrine Testud eased through to the
quarterfinals with a straight sets victory over Italian Laura
Golarsa, 6-3, 6-4.
	   But American No.7 seed Corina Moriariu went down to Dutchwoman
Kristie Boogert, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.

Precede JERUSALEM Israelis arrested in killing of Palestinian farmer referendum on withdrawal deal, violence at funeral of Palestinian man killed by Jewish settler

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
appointed a staff to begin exploratory work for a national
referendum on a U.S. package proposal for an Israeli troop
withdrawal from West Bank land, a report said Wednesday.
	   Netanyahu's aide David Bar-Illan said the report on Israel's
Channel 2 TV sounded ``very likely.''
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States to respond to
a U.S. proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank. The plan, which has not been made public, also calls for the
Palestinian to crackdown on terrorism and a reported freeze in
Israeli construction of Jewish settlements. The plan, first
introduced in January, has been accepted by the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu said earlier this week that he favored public input
into the proposal. ``The prime minister is taking the idea of a
referendum very seriously,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press.
Palestinians have called the referendum an unnecessary stalling
tactic by Israel since Israel's Knesset already approved a deal for
the withdrawal last year.
	   Bar-Illan said he could not provide any further details of a
public vote but Channel 2 reported that a copy of any agreement
approved by Netanyahu would then be mailed to every Israeli
household prior to voting.
	   Tuesday Netanyahu said Israel was not closer to accepting the
deal, which he had earlier said would harm Israel's security. In
Washington, an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had told the Israeli
leader that a decision on the plan was urgent.
	   Bar-Illan blamed the American administration for encouraging
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to adopt a more hardline in
negotiations.
	   ``The fact that the Americans privatly have announced what its
idea of a credible withdrawal would be has encouraged the
Palestinians to be more intransigent because they are not going to
be less demanding than the Americans,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Meanwhile in the West Bank city of Hebron, several dozen
Palestinian youths threw stones at Israeli troops and burned
Israeli flags at the funeral of a Palestinian farmer killed clubbed
to death by a Jewish settler Tuesday.
	   Abdel Abu Turki was walking home from his fields Tuesday with a
cousin when a 16-year-old Jewish youth apparently leaned out of a
van carrying six other friends and wacked Abu Turki on the back of
the head. The youth and another 16-year-old in the car with him,
were in Israeli custody.
	   Some 3000 mourners turned out for Abu Turki's funeral which
turned violent with some mourners throwing stones at Israeli police
and soldiers. Others chanted ``No peace with settlers,'' and ``With
our blood and soul, we will redeeem Palestine.''
	   Peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian broke down
16 months ago after Israel announced it would build homes for Jews
on a disputed hilltop in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem which it
captured along with the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war.
	   The Palestinians, who have gained autonomy in eight different
cities as a result of the talks, hope negotiations will lead to an
independent state with east Jerusalem as its capital.

	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Lawmakers in the Yugoslav republic
of Montenegro on Wednesday condemned the Kosovo policy of federal
President Slobodan Milosevic, and demanded a pullout of Montenegrin

Iran coach: Iran-US both need win in their big match to advance in World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ Iran's World Cup coach said Wednesday
his team's big game with the United States is crucial, not because
of the hostility between the two countries but because both sides
need a win to have any chance of advancing to the next round.
	   Saying his team was looking forward to Sunday's game in Lyon,
Jalal Talebi denied French media reports that Iran was ready to
pull out of the World Cup over the showing of an unflattering U.S.
movie about Iran on French TV.
	   Talebi reiterated comments by Iranian players and soccer
officials that the showing of ``Not Without My Daughter,'' a 1991
movie that stars Sally Field and paints an unflattering picture of
Iranian society, was an insult to his country.
	   ``This was not a good time to show that movie,'' Talebi told
reporters. ``It benefited no one and upset our people. I believe
the film was shown on purpose.''
	   Asked if it was true Iran had considered pulling out of the
World Cup in protest to the movie, Talebi said: ``This is the first
I'm hearing about this.''
	   The Iranian ambassador, meanwhile, put the reports to rest.
	   ``I ask the French media to avoid giving a bad image of a
country which is participating in the World Cup,'' Iranian
Ambassador Hamidreza Assefi said in an interview on TF1 television.
	   ``Of course the Iranian team will take part in the matches and
we hope Iranians will support them.''
	   The head of Iran's soccer federation and three players told a
news conference Tuesday that the movie had hurt morale and was
politically motivated.
	   But Talebi said ``We are going to play our usual soccer. We're
going to go out there to win.''
	   M6, the private French channel that aired the movie, about an
American woman who escapes from Iran against the wishes of her
Iranian husband, said it had received a telephone call from the
upset Iranians.
	   ``It is a shame this happened during the World Cup, but we are
not going to change our programing,'' said M6 director of
communications Michelle Lordelle.
	   As expected, the game between Iran and the United States is
building up to be the most politically charged at this World Cup.
	   It took on a new dimension Wednesday when soccer's top official
said Iranian exiles have threatened action against the match.
	   ``We have received more-or-less anonymous letters from groups of
exiled Iranians who say they will do something to disrupt the match
to show what is going on in their country,'' FIFA president Sepp
Blatter said.
	   He declined to identify the groups or say if any specific type
of action was threatened.
	   The Mujahedeen Khalq, the largest exile group, denied through a
Paris spokesman that the exiles were threatening disruption. It
said the letters were part of a campaign by Tehran to discredit the
group.
	   Both the United States and Iran lost their opening matches, and
the loser Sunday is virtually sure to be eliminated.
	   Talebi said that is why the game is important. He said the media
had blown up the political aspects of the game.
	   ``We are playing against the people of the United States, not
the government.''
	   There have been no diplomatic relations between the one-time
allies since 1979, when Islamic militants overthrew the ruling shah
and took Americans hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
	   In recent months there has been a slight thaw in relations
between Washington and Tehran, accompanied by movement in sports.
	   In Iran earlier this week, hard-line opponents of moderate
President Mohammad Khatami called on the government to prevent any
gesture of goodwill between Iranian and US players after the match.
They said the players should not be allowed to exchange T-shirts.
	   But Talebi said the team would go out of its way to show its
goodwill to the US team. Asked what he would do, he said ``let me
surprise you.''
	   The team practiced late Wednesday morning, but the session was
closed to reporters and the public.
	   Since 1983 Talebi has lived on and off in California, where his
Iranian wife and three sons still live.
	   He has coached at Foothill and De Anza colleges in California,
and says he will bring that experience from U.S. soccer to the
match Sunday.

An angry Nigerian dissident, worn after prison term, returns home 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ His black jeans hang loosely on his hips
after more than two years in prison. His handshake is weak. He
shuffles through his Lagos home like a man much older than his
years.
	   But when Beko Ransome-Kuti reached out Wednesday to hug the
people who had come to congratulate him on his freedom, his eyes
lit up with the intensity of a child, and he pulled his friends
close.
	   Prison was not kind to Ransome-Kuti, a prominent pro-democracy
activist in his early 50s who was never a particularly healthy man.
He left his cell in northern Nigeria battered by his confinement
and by a bout of heart trouble.
	   His bitterness is evident, and he angrily spits out accusations
against Nigeria's new military ruler. But it didn't defeat him
either.
	   ``I muddled through,'' he shrugged, while dozens of well-wishers
danced and sang in his living room, which was plastered with
posters calling for his release.
	   There was plenty of muddling. Ransome-Kuti was held in solitary
confinement for part of his sentence, given only the Bible and the
Koran to read. Visitors were allowed for one hour each month.
Serious heart trouble plagued him for months and he's angry his
32-year-old daughter was forced to start supporting his family and
leading the calls for his release.
	   ``She even had to take care of me,'' he said sadly.
	   Then, when he was ordered freed on Monday along with eight other
political prisoners, the authorities said they did it for health
reasons.
	   ``Health reasons?'' he demands, fury written across his face.
``All these things against me were completely trumped up.''
	   Ransome-Kuti, a doctor who gave up his practice because he was
arrested so often he couldn't keep appointments with patients,
eventually earned his living managing the career of his brother,
the late Afrobeat music star Fela.
	   He was also the head of the Campaign for Democracy, a coalition
of activist groups. In March of 1995, the secret police came to his
door and asked him to come in for a talk.
	   It was six months before his family heard from him again, when
the government announced he'd been sentenced to 15 years in prison.
His crime: sending overseas the text of a courtroom declaration of
innocence from an accused coup-plotter.
	   A number of prominent activists were locked up after the alleged
plot, which is widely believed to have been invented by the
government of Nigeria's late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, to lock up
his critics.
	   But Abacha died last week and a new military leader, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, has come to power. Abubakar has sent out a
string of mixed messages since then: quashing pro-democracy
demonstrations and vowing to proceed with Abacha's problem-riddled
transition to democracy program, but also freeing nine of the
country's most prominent prisoners.
	   Looking thin but exuberant, one of the released prisoners,
former state leader Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, greeted hundreds of
well-wishers on Wednesday just hours after being freed.
	   Another detainee, lawyer Olabintan Durojaiye, also returned
home. The others were being held in far-flung prisons across this
sprawling country and their immediate status was unclear.
	   Ransome-Kuti is suspicious of any real change coming to Nigeria
_ at least as long as the military remains in control.
	   ``They're wavering. They don't know what to do,'' he said,
insisting, though, that democracy would eventually return to
Africa's most populous country, a once-wealthy nation that has been
driven to ruin by years of neglect and corruption.
	   ``They will give up whether they like it or not. People will not
let it go on forever. If they don't do it voluntarily, they must be
made to,'' he said.
	   But his role in that fight remains unclear.
	   ``I'd like to say `yes' I'll be going right back to work,'' he
said. ``But we'll hang around at first and see how things are.''
	   And he dismisses any idea that he's a martyr to the cause of
freedom.
	   ``I'm not doing this for anybody. I'm doing it for myself, my
children. There are no schools, no hospitals, no drugs. Everybody
here is poor now.''

Montenegro distances itself from Milosevic's Kosovo policy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Lawmakers in the Yugoslav republic
of Montenegro on Wednesday condemned federal President Slobodan
Milosevic's policy on Kosovo and demanded a pullout of Montenegrin
soldiers deployed in the province.
	   In a nonbinding but strongly worded resolution passed in
Montenegro's parliament Wednesday, the ruling pro-Western,
reformist majority demanded that Milosevic ``take immediate
measures to stop violence ... in Kosovo.'' It said that until then
``all soldiers from Montenegro who are doing military service in
Kosovo (must) be transferred to barracks in Montenegro.''
	   Montenegro and Serbia make up the Yugoslav Federation in an
alliance that has become increasingly shaky as reformers gained
power in Montenegro. Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic is a
Milosevic foe.
	   Ethnic clashes in Serbia's province of Kosovo have escalated
since the Serbian police and the Yugoslav army launched a crackdown
on independence-seeking ethnic Albanians there. More than 300
people have died in the fighting.
	   Also Wednesday, Montenegro's parliament named a new set of 20
delegates _ all Milosevic opponents _ to represent the republic in
Yugoslavia's federal parliament.

Unseeded Americans oust Kafelnikov, Coetzer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Yevgeni Kafelnikov, No. 7 seed at
Wimbledon next week, tumbled out of the Heineken Open grass court
Wednesday, downed 7-5, 6-2 by American Steve Campbell.
	   The Russian, seeded No. 2 here and coming off a victory in the
Halle, Germany tourney last week, played well below his best in the
second set of his first-round match against the unseeded Campbell.
	   And in the women's WTA event here, American Kimberley Po knocked
top-seeded South African Amanda Coetzer out of the second round in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-2.
	   But the men's top seed, Australian Patrick Rafter recovered from
dropping a set to down Czech Daniel Vacek, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
	   After two days of almost constant downpour, this Wimbledon
warm-up grass court tourney made up for a lot of ground in a packed
day Wednesday, with the men's first round and women's second round
now completed.
	   Another men's seed to perish was the No. 6, Brazilian Gustavo
Kuerten, who was upset in a final-set tiebreaker by Dutchman Dennis
van Scheppingen, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).
	   The women's No. 2 seed Sandrine Testud of France eased through
to the quarterfinals with a straight sets victory over Italian
Laura Golarsa, 6-3, 6-4.
	   But American No.7 seed Corina Moriariu went down to Dutchwoman
Kristie Boogert, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.

Chemicals from ancient sponges may help fight arthritis, cancer AP Medical Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Chemicals from ancient sponges and sea bacteria
hold the promise of powerful arthritis salves and cancer fighters,
marine scientists say.
	   That's not all: An absorbent chemical in oyster shells could
keep diapers drier or help clean up oil spills, researchers told
the nation's biotechnology industry this week.
	   Yet, they said, manufacturers are largely ignoring the ocean's
repository.
	   ``You have a whole sea of microbes whose potential is
unexplored,'' said Linda Kupfer of the National Sea Grant, which
gathered marine scientists to describe new research on ocean
compounds, mostly medicines, that they believe biotech companies
could bring to market.
	   The majority of drugs come from land discoveries such soil
microbes that have yielded dozens of antibiotics, herbs and tree
bark-derived cancer drugs and painkillers.
	   But with discoveries of novel drugs dwindling, the land is about
tapped out, said William Fenical of California's Scripps
Institution of Oceanography.
	   Millions of years of evolution gave ocean animals and microbes
chemical defenses to survive predators and disease, said Shirley
Pompani of Florida's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute. A
sponge killing a parasite's rapidly growing cells is the same
principle as killing human cancer cells, she explained.
	   ``There are over 6,000 species of sponges alone, all with unique
chemical compounds,'' she said.
	   Among the new finds:
	   _Bryostatin, made from moss-like animals that live on pier
pilings, just became the first marine anticancer product to enter
Phase II testing as a possible therapy for deadly melanoma.
Although it's owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb, the National Cancer
Institute is paying for all testing.
	   ``It's still early,'' cautioned NCI's Dr. Anthony Murgo. But
``we're interested in novel agents. It seemed to have anti-cancer
activity that's somewhat different'' than other drugs.
	   _Two rare marine molecules completely block a serious arthritis
inflammation, said pharmacologist Robert Jacobs of the University
of California, Santa Barbara. The molecules could help develop an
alternative to steroid therapy because they ``virtually wipe out''
the cell process that swells joints, he said.
	   _Cone snails emit toxins that paralyze and kill prey, a
neuromuscular block that could help epilepsy, Pompani said.
	   _Scripps just discovered a seaweed fungus chemical named
halimide that killed drug-resistant cancer cells in test-tube
studies. Another Scripps fungal find, halovir, is a
never-before-seen type of antiviral that appears to kill herpes.
	   Money to research ocean chemicals is severely lacking, Fenical
said. Most large drug makers ignore the resource, he said, but some
biotech companies are starting to license promising compounds from
taxpayer-funded scientists. ``We virtually give these things
away,'' he said.
	   The federally funded National Sea Grant, which promotes
academic-industry research partnerships, funds dlrs 8 million a
year in marine biotechnology programs. The NCI spends about that
much screening potentially promising marine compounds.
	   One reason companies hesitate is that some sea compounds are too
complex for laboratories to produce, Kupfer explained. ``Their
question is, `How are you going to get enough to supply a clinical
trial?''
	   So researchers are developing ways to grow ocean compounds much
as today's drug ingredients are produced and are studying just how
these chemicals work so synthetic copies can be made.
	   Consumers shouldn't confuse this research with popular claims
that shark cartilage will cure cancer, Fenical warned. ``There's
just no evidence that shark cartilage has any effect in cancer
whatsoever,'' he said.
	   But the field goes beyond medicine: Those super-absorbent oyster
shells show ocean compounds can lead to bioengineered products.
	   Clemson University scientists discovered that amino acids in the
shells form gels that can absorb 100 times their weight in water.
Analyzing the chemical structure, they created new polymers that
are attracting industry attention because they could help clean oil
spills or speed water treatment.
	   ``They're even talking about it in diapers,'' Kupfer said. ``And
it's biodegradable, ... so there's not a lot of waste to muck up.''

	    &UR; EDITOR'S NOTE _ Violence by English soccer fans at the World
Cup made headlines this week. An Associated Press correspondent
spent time with some of the fans on the streets of Marseille and
found others share the blame. Here is his account.
 &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; By MORT ROSENBLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Not much is uglier than a bar full of
bullet-headed soccer brutes, belching beer, chanting
England-over-all songs and laughing about how they plan to knock
heads and demolish the immediate vicinity.
	   But during two days of mayhem in Marseille, English hooligans
were hardly the only culprits. Local punks helped goad them into
action, and some zealous police splashed fuel on the flames.
	   For a time, the Old Port took on the air of Gaza. Flying bottles
smacked skulls. Troops in combat gear charged behind a haze of tear
gas, swinging heavy sticks at bodies of any nationality.
	   The English, like the French-Tunisian and other local kids who
taunted and helped provoke them, were victims as well as
perpetrators. Yet the English were foreigners preceded by a nasty
reputation, and that made them targets.
	   Whatever else, the Marseille violence showed how useless labels
can be. ``English soccer fans'' is hardly a synonym for hooligans.
On the Canebiere Boulevard, townsfolk cheered young rowdies who
chased down Britons of all sorts like a fox hunt in reverse.
	   ``Are you English?'' a barkeeper asked me, in French, just off
the Canebiere, as I hurried away ahead of a free-for-all.
	   ``Non,'' I told him.
	   ``Because if you were, I'd hide you inside,'' he said. ``It is
shameful how these young thugs are picking on anyone they see. I
tell them, if you hit anyone, you hit me.''
	   I got out a quick, ``Thanks for the offer,'' but did not linger
to chat. Advancing police had just whacked a young French bystander
with a stick, sending him into an epileptic fit, and then left him
writhing on the ground.
	   Later, I talked to an Englishman caught up in the fray.
	   ``I've got nothing to do with this,'' protested the young man in
smart clothes with a posh London accent. He was penned in with 50
other English fans behind a wall of riot cops, who were protecting
them from circling punks. ``I just want to go home.''
	   He had tried to catch a train, he said, but Tunisians with
knives and bats blocked the way. ``We are trapped, surrounded by
police, hounded by Tunisians. I just wanted to see England play
soccer.''
	   But then the problem demonstrated itself. Just as a British
Cabinet minister said, some English soccer fans are ``brain-dead
louts,'' and they overshadow the vast majority who are, if
anything, better mannered than most sports fans.
	   A hulking English goon with ham-sized forearms covered in
tattoos told his young compatriot to stop talking to me. Reporters
get it all wrong, all the time, he said, spicing his conversation
with a familiar bad word that served him as verb, noun and
adjective.
	   I tried to explain the search for truth, when three of his
friends approached. One yelled, ``Grab him.'' I withdrew.
	   After two days in the street, talking to witnesses from all
sides and seeing a lot first hand, I could see how trouble happens.
	   A bunch of normal English fans and a few hard-core hooligans
settled into a Canebiere bar just off the Old Port on Sunday
afternoon for some harmless rowdiness. They sang raucous songs and,
doubtless, a few shouted rude remarks.
	   All afternoon, young French-Tunisians on scooters passed back
and forth for a look at the monsters they had heard so much about.
As they got braver, they drew closer, waving red Tunisian flags.
	   The English got drunker and madder.
	   Finally, someone threw a punch, and bottles followed. In the
words of both footballers and street brawlers, it kicked off.
	   Hooligans overturned a car and smashed windows. Police charged
in with dogs and sticks. Tunisians tossed bottles at the English
over the heads of riot troops. Things calmed and then flared again.
Each side took what revenge it could.
	   The next day, opposing sides joined thousands of Marseille
residents with their families to watch the game on a large screen
on Prado Beach by the stadium. When England scored its first goal,
some Tunisians tossed bottles from the bleachers.
	   It kicked off again, and hooligans charged the Tunisians. Police
fired tear gas only at the English, sending perpetrators and
innocent bystanders alike in frantic flight. And that night, any
Englishman was fair game.

Supreme Court opens case against judge for allegedly mishandling probe of media group finances 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Supreme Court began proceedings
Wednesday against a judge suspected of perverting the course of
justice during his probe into the alleged corporate wrongdoings of
the Sogecable Cable TV company.
	   In a separate announcement the National Court said it had
shelved the case against Sogecable, accused of misusing more than
23 billion pesetas (dlrs 164 million) collected from pay-TV
subscribers.
	   Judge Javier Gomez de Liano said he would appeal the Supreme
Court's decision to question his conduct during his year-long
pretrial investigation of the Sogecable case.
	   The company issued a statement of ``satisfaction'' at both
decisions.	   
	   Sogecable is a subsidiary of Grupo Prisa _ Spain's largest media
conglomerate that also owns French pay-TV giant Canal Plus, the
daily newspaper El Pais and the Radio Ser network.
	   The Supreme Court action against Gomez de Liano is based
primarily on a 200 million-peseta (dlrs 1.3 million) bail order he
slapped on Grupo Prisa's president, Jesus de Polanco, who was also
banned from leaving the country.
	   At the time Polanco claimed the harshness of the measures were
part of a government-backed conspiracy to punish his media group
for its close ties with the Socialist Party of former Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, that was voted out of office in 1996
after 13 years.
	   The governing Popular Party's spokesman for justice, Andres
Ollero, said his party was worried that the Supreme Court action
against the judge ``could undermine confidence in the
administration of justice.''

Dominican leader visiting Haiti: 200 years of bad blood to overcome 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos planned
By JOHN RILEY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DAJABON, Dominican Republic (AP) _ At the river that once ran
red with the blood of slaughtered Haitians, vendors, peasants, mule
drivers and porters wait at the bridge. Impatient ones wade into
the knee-deep water and cross illegally into the Dominican
Republic.
	   Dominican fears of being overrun by Haitians _ the same fears
that led to the 1937 slaughter of some 20,000 people, turning the
Massacre River red _ still are very much alive today.
	   But the two countries that share the Caribbean island of
Hispaniola finally are trying to overcome 200 years of bad blood.
	   On Thursday, Dominican President Leonel Fernandez starts a
three-day visit to Haiti _ the first time a Dominican leader will
have spent the night in Haiti since a 1936 trip by dictator Rafael
Trujillo, underscoring the bitter political and racial animosities.
	   Fernandez and Haitian President Rene Preval, who visited Santo
Domingo in April, will discuss the lax border policing that allows
illegal immigrants and drugs to cross almost completely unimpeded
from Haiti.
	   Washington is fostering the relationship in hopes of a joint
crackdown on cocaine trafficking _ and is offering boats and planes
to help.
	   Colombian traffickers send cocaine by speedboat on the 10-hour
trip to Haiti. The drugs, which are trucked across the border for
shipping to Florida, account for up to 15 percent of the cocaine
that reaches the United States.
	   Fernandez and Preval are expected to agree to a joint fight on
drug trafficking. But they likely will stumble over the issue of
greatest discord: illegal immigration from Haiti, the poorest
country in the Western hemisphere, to its only slightly less poor,
but lush, neighbor.
	   Both countries have about 8 million people, but Haiti has half
as much land. Creole-speaking Haitians are blacks descended from
African slaves and have lived under French colonialism. Dominicans
speak Spanish, and most are of mixed European and African descent.
	   ``They treat us like dogs,'' said Wilfredo Pierre, a Haitian
money changer who does business at Dajabon, a Dominican border
town.
	   The hostilities go way back.
	   The Haitians fought the world's only successful slave rebellion
and became the first black republic in 1804 _ then tried to take
over the eastern part of the island.
	   In 1822, Haiti occupied the Spanish colony and stayed until the
Dominicans rebelled in 1844 and became independent.
	   Haitian rule abolished slavery in what is now the Dominican
Republic _ but it was also harsh: farmers were not allowed to leave
their plots without military authorization and plantation workers
could not leave without risk of forced labor or jail.
	   Now, the tables are turned. Haitians leave their barren farms
for the Dominican Republic, where they can find jobs cutting sugar
cane. They are confined to plantations and deported if they flee
and are caught.
	   Still, a cane cutter makes in three months what a Haitian farmer
makes in a year.
	   Col. Rondon Hernandez, whose 500 troops police the border around
Dajabon, said as many as a million Haitians live illegally in the
Dominican Republic. He said 600 to 1,000 Haitians cross at Dajabon
each day, and his men return about 300.
	   ``We will have a Haitian presence that will overtake our side if
we do not check this intrusion,'' Hernandez said.
	   Still, on market days _ Mondays and Fridays _ controls are
relaxed and Dajabon's population of 15,000 swells by about 7,000
Haitians. They sell secondhand shoes and clothes, sent by
charitable groups in the United States.
	   ``Dajabon without the Haitians would be broke,'' said merchant
Luis Garcia. Twice a week, Haitians buy more than 80 truckloads of
live chickens and eggs, he said. They are carried to Haiti by
mules, porters and on women's heads.
	   ``Dominicans don't have a problem with Haitians (visiting) here.
But we cannot have them live here,'' he said.

Scotland Yard apologize to parents of slain black teenager 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A senior Scotland Yard police officer Wednesday
apologized to the parents of a black teenager slain five years ago
in a race killing that has become the focus of debate over
relations between police and ethnic minorities.
	   Ian Johnston, assistant Metropolitan Police commissioner for
southeast London, told Neville and Doreen Lawrence that he ``could
not justify'' errors in the investigation into the stabbing and
death of Stephen Lawrence, 18, at a London bus stop on April 22
1993.
	   ``I wanted to say to you that I am truly sorry that we have let
you down. It has been a tragedy for you, you have lost a son and
not seen his killers brought to justice,'' Johnston told Mr.
Lawrence at a public inquiry into the teenager's death.
	   Stephen Lawrence's family believe that the police acted slowly
and incompetently in trying to bring to justice members of a white
gang which police believe stabbed Lawrence.
	   Police charged two men with murder but the state prosecuting
agency abandoned the case, saying there was insufficient evidence.
A private criminal prosecution, admissible under English law, also
collapsed.
	   Johnston said that the case had had a severe impact on police
relations with London-based black Britons, saying that the
inability to solve the case had been ``a tragedy for the
Metropolitan Police who have lost the confidence of a significant
section of the community for the way we have handled the case.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in
Kosovo on Wednesday dismissed President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge
to negotiate, saying his powerful forces must halt all actions and
leave the province before any talks can start.
	   Fierce fighting in the embattled province continued, with at
least 12 new deaths reported on both sides by Serb and Albanian
sources.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the four-man Kosovo Albanian team named to
negotiate with the Serbs, spoke after Milosevic promised Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to reopen talks with the moderate
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``What was announced in Moscow is no news, because the problem
is not whether there will be any talks with the Albanians, but the
conditions in which talks should be held,'' chief negotiator Agani
told The Associated Press.
	   ``Two important conditions set by the international community
... have not been fulfilled,'' Agani said. ``Therefore, at this
moment, we cannot say whether there will be any talks.''
	   Previous talks have produced no significant results. Their
failure, along with Serb forces' stepped-up efforts to crush
resistance, have increased public backing for the Kosovo Liberation
Army at the expense of ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose
pacifist policies have accomplished little in the Kosovo Albanians'
push for independence.
	   In a move which should further strengthen the KLA's growing
clout with Kosovo Albanians, the Kosovo government-in-exile
declared Wednesday that it will start organizing resistance.
	   The self-proclaimed Kosovo government, which is outlawed by Serb
authorities and based abroad, made the statement after a seven-hour
meeting in the Albanian capital Tirana with representatives of five
Kosovo political parties. Among them was Rugova's Democratic League
of Kosovo, although it wasn't clear whether Rugova himself backed
their position.
	   ``We will appoint representatives in all the villages that have
suffered the Serb aggression, authorized to organize the
self-defense of the population,'' Bujar Bukoshi, head of the
government, told The Associated Press.
	   In the latest fighting, the pro-Serb Media Center reported that
the Yugoslav army killed at least 10 Albanians in two separate
incidents Tuesday and Wednesday when they tried to smuggle weapons
into Yugoslavia.
	   In both incidents, large groups of Albanian smugglers exchanged
fire with Yugoslav army soldiers as they tried to cross, the center
said.
	   The government sources claimed the army seized a large but
uspecified amount of weapons and that mortar fire was launched
against its units from across the border, from Albania, in apparent
support to smugglers.
	   Meanwhile, Albanian sources said 17 Albanians were killed in the
border violence, calling it ``criminal acts'' by Serbs.
	   Independent observers said the border violence was a clear sign
that Albanian militants and the army were fighting for control of
the stretch of border.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March. The
recent clashes have driven some 60,000 people from their homes,
most within Kosovo. Others have fled to Albania, where some claim
to have been fired on by Serb forces from across the border this
week, or the neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   In a report indicating a new front is emerging south of the
provincial capital Pristina, a Serb policeman and a soldier are
said to have died within minutes of each other in two clashes.
	   A report from the Serbian Media Center said the policeman died
when his car was ambushed by Albanian militants and the soldier
when his unit was attacked.

	   BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) _ Albania's president demanded on
Wednesday that Yugoslavia ``stop the bloodshed'' after what he
described as a series of provocations by Serb forces firing across
the border from Kosovo.
	   One Albanian was reported killed by a Serb sniper across the
border on Tuesday, and more Serb gunfire was reported at the same
site on Wednesday.
	   The Albanian Foreign Ministry formally protested the death,
summoning the Yugoslav charge d'affairs in Tirana and handing over
a note objecting to the ``very grave incident.''
	   ``The Albanian government strongly demands that in the
conditions of systematic violence against the Albanians in Kosovo,
such adventurous acts must be stopped, or they could have grave
consequences,'' the statement said.

Iraq will not apologize to Gulf countries for Kuwait invasion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Iraq is not ready to apologize for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, even if it would help improve relations with
its Gulf neighbors, a senior Iraqi official said Wednesday.
	   ``Iraq has no intention to apologize for the events that
happened in 1990 and will not beg for support from anyone,'' Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan said.
	   There is no step Iraq will take to normalize ties with Gulf
countries, he said.
	   But, he added, Iraq was ready to open a new chapter in those
relations, ``leaving the past behind and considering what had
happened a family dispute.''
	   Ramadan arrived Tuesday in Yemen. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
has recently sent envoys to several countries as part of a
diplomatic drive to muster support for ending the U.N sanctions.
	   Yemen opposed the U.N. Security Council decision that authorized
the use of force against Iraq to expel it from Kuwait. The decision
hurt its relations with its neighbors, particularly Saudi Arabia.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fire sparked by lightning at ammunition depots
killed at least six serviceman and injured 14 others in the Ural
Mountains on Wednesday, officials said.
	   At least seven other servicemen are missing in a blaze, the NTV
television network said citing local officials.
	   The fire, which has also engulfed 180 hectares (445 acres) of
forest around the depots, forced the evacuation of 3,000 local
residents, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The depots contained from 160 to 240 mines, artillery shells and
rockets that belonged to Russian troops withdrawn from Eastern
Germany.
	   Some of them detonated because of the fire, and officials were
concerned that some rockets could fly a long distance and threaten
the population.
	   Firefighting efforts were hampered late Wednesday by a severe
thunderstorm, strong winds and hail, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry was sending an Il-76
plane capable of carrying 40 tons of water to help extinguish the
fire.
	   Blazes at ammunition depots, which are often located in thick
forests, break out frequently in Russia.

World Cup: Italy leads Cameroon 1-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio's World Cup comeback
continued Wednesday as the Italian striker set up Luigi Di Biagio's
eighth minute goal to give Italy a 1-0 lead over Cameroon at
halftime.
	   Baggio, the 1994 Cup star who had played only one game for Italy
since 1995 before France '98, lifted an accurate left cross
straight to Di Biagio, who was left all alone to put home the goal
from 10 meters (yards).
	   Any chance of Cameroon making a second-half comeback was hurt
two minutes before halftime when Raymond Kalla Nkongo was given a
controversial red card.
	   Kalla was dribbing near midfield when Di Biagio slid in front of
him to make a tackle. Unable to stop his momentum, Kalla slid
cleats-first into the Italian midfielder and was instantly showed
the red card by Australian referee Edward Lennie.
	   Di Biagio, taken off on a stretcher, returned before the half
was over to the jeers of the fans at Stade de la Mosson. As the
players walked off the field at halftime, Di Biagio lifted his
right shorts leg to show his injury to Cameroon goalkeeper Jacques
Songo'o and coach Claude Leroy as if to vindicate the referee's
discision.
	   Baggio scored a penalty and set up Christian Vieri's goal in
last week's 2-2 draw with Chile. He wouldn't have started that game
had oncoming star Alessandro Del Piero not suffered a thigh strain.
Del Piero was on the substitute's bench Wednesday night.
	   Should the Italy-Cameroon game not end in a tie, the winner will
be in commanding position in Group B. All of the other three games
in the group, including a 1-1 decision earlier Wednesday between
Austria and Chile, have ended in draws.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Trinidad and Tobago sprinter Ato Bolton
fell short of a world record in the 100-meter race, but posted the
best time of the year in the 200-meter race Wednesday at the
Tsiklitira International Track Meet in Athens.
	   In the 100 meters, Bolton raced through a headwind and crossed
the line in 9.86 seconds, ahead of Namibia's Frank Fredericks. The
winner matched the year's best time, which he posted in April. In
the 1996 Olympics Fredericks won the silver medal and Bolton the
bronze.
	   But Bolton fell short of Canadian Donovan Bailey's world record
of 9.84 seconds.
	   ``I came here to get the world record,'' Bolton said after the
race. ``I ran faster than Ben Johnson did on steroids. This wasn't
a great race ... the wind just didn't cooperate.''
	   Bolton's 19.88-second finish in the 200 meters was the best of
the year.
	   Fiona May of Italy won the women's long jump with a leap of 7.03
meters, beating Germany's Heike Dreschler, who finished second with
6.95 meters.
	   In other events, 1500-meter world record holder Noureddine
Morceli of Algeria finished first in 3:34.44, well behind his
world-record time of 3:27.37.
	   Jean Galfione of France won the pole vault with a 5.97-meter
leap, setting a French record. Ukrainian pole vaulter and
world-record holder Sergey Bubka disappointed the more than 40,000
spectators with his flat fourth-place finish of 5.72 meters.
	   Britain's Colin Jackson won the 110-meter hurdles in 13.15
seconds.

World Cup: Japan's midfield key against Croatia minor edit thruout.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Japanese coach Takeshi Okada calls
it ``image.'' Although he skillfully evades discussing specifics,
he definitely has a plan for Japan's match against Croatia on
Saturday.
	   Using computer graphics that Okada and assistant coach Takeshi
Ono have conjured up, as well as hours and hours of videotape, the
Japanese have been carefully analyzing the Croatian team.
	   What they lack in experience, physical prowess and individual
technique, the World Cup first-timers intend to make up with
planning and team work.
	   If Japan's strategy in its 1-0 loss to Argentina for its
surprisingly impressive Group H opener was based on defense, the
midfield is the focus against Croatia.
	   ``I am impressed that Croatia not only has quality individual
players but also a very organized system,'' Okada said. ``Some of
our strategy will have to change. Otherwise, we'll be giving them
exactly what they want.''
	   Japan's task will be somewhat easier with news that Croatian
midfielder-captain Zvonimir Boban likely will sit out the match
with a leg injury. Okada had viewed Boban as the center of the
Croatian team.
	   ``People always talk about certain players, but it's better not
to think too much about that,'' defender Naoki Soma said. ``There
might be some drawbacks for them. But it's more important for us to
think about playing our own soccer.''
	   The team practiced behind closed doors Wednesday. During open
practices earlier this week, Okada spent most of his time with the
reserves. They obviously hold the key to his plan.
	   Among the possible substitutes Sunday are several aggressive
midfielders with proven scoring power. Japan also has strong
starters in midfield _ Hidetoshi Nakata, Hiroshi Nanami and
Motohiro Yamaguchi.
	   ``I have tried to present to the players an image of what they
must do,'' said Okada, who used his substitutions wisely during
qualifiers. ``The reserves know they're going to be called upon, if
the game is going a certain way.''
	   The players feel exonerated by their valiant showing against
Argentina.
	   ``They're not as threatening as Argentina,'' said defender
Eisuke Nakanishi of the Croat strikers. ``I want to play so hard
they have to respect us.''
	   ``All those players who are supposed to be so fast, they don't
look that fast to me,'' said Masayuki Okano, a substitute forward.
	   ``The coach,'' said defender Yutaka Akita, ``has a plan.''

Grains, soybeans rise on weather fears 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures rose sharply Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade in a continuing rally tied fears
about crop damage from unfavorable growing weather expected to hit
the Midwest next week.
	   Private forecasters are predicting temperatures well above
normal toward the end of next week, bringing unwelcome heat to
crops that recently have seen too much rain and only moderate
temperatures.
	   The wide swing in the weather could have a detrimental effect on
the corn, soybean and wheat crops because their root systems are
shallow and would be unable to reach water farther below the
surface, analysts said.
	   Futures prices also advanced after the Clinton administration
stepped in to support the Japanese yen by selling U.S. dollars. The
action could help Asia out of its economic woes and boost export
demand.
	   Wheat for July delivery rose 6 3-4 cents to dlrs 2.83 3-4 a
bushel; July corn jumped 7 1-4 cents to dlrs 2.44 1-2 a bushel;
July oats rose 1 1-4 cents to dlrs 1.22 a bushel; November soybeans
rose 11 1-2 cents to dlrs 5.98 3-4 a bushel.

Israeli police raid right-wing pirate radio station With Israel-Palestinian 
</HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel police raided a right-wing radio station
Thursday operated by Jewish settlers who charged that Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to silence their protests
against a planned Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Police entered studios and offices of Channel 7 radio in three
West Bank settlements and an advertising office in Tel Aviv.
Israel's Army radio reported that in the next few days the police
would also board a broadcasting ship operated by Channel 7 off the
Mediterranean coast.
	   The police filmed transmission equipment at the studios and
photocopied documents but did not confiscate equipment, Channel 7's
program director Shulamit Melamed told The Associated Press.
	   The station stopped its broadcast for three hours during the
raid and resumed later.
	   The station was set up without government licensing more than
ten years ago during a previous right-wing government and
concentrated programming on Jewish religion and encouragement of
Jewish settlement in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
	   It's evaded orders to shut down by broadcasting from a ship off
the coast and outside Israel's territorial waters. But police
commander Moshe Mizrahi said police had found evidence that Channel
7 is broadcasting from Israeli land. Melamed said reporting from
land was transmitted to the ship and broadcast from there.
	   When the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the dovish Labor
party came to power, the station became a mouth piece for the
settler movement, focusing on news and current affairs.
	   ``We felt the Israeli media were biased against us and there was
a need for more objective news coverage,'' Melamed said.
	   Channel 7 attacked Rabin bitterly, especially after he signed
peace deals with the Palestinians which turned over West Bank land
to Palestinian hands. Settlers now say they are planning to launch
a campaign against Netanyahu's government which is also likely to
cede more land in a promised next troop withdrawal in the West Bank
which may isolate certain Jewish settlements.
	   ```The fact that Channel 7 was closed so soon after the settlers
decided to launch a campaign against the prime minister cannot
escape the notice of any logical person,'' said Michael Kleiner, a
lawmaker who backs the settler movement.
	   Netanyahu denied the raid was politically motivated.
	   ``With all the regret which we feel, we are bound by the ruling
of the court ... but we are taking steps and (getting) council on
how to legalize Channel 7,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Only two state funded radio stations and a small number of local
radio stations are licensed to broadcast. And pirate radio
broadcasts are widespread because the law requires stations to
obtain a government license with only a few available.
	   Some of the pirate stations have an ultra-Othodox religious
orientation while others are simply commercial.

Arabs to revive proposal for upgrading Palestinian status at UN 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Frustrated over the U.S. failure to revive
the Middle East peace process, Arab states have asked the General
Assembly to reconsider a resolution upgrading the status of the PLO
observer mission, diplomats said Wednesday.
	   Nasser al-Kidwa, the PLO observer at the United Nations, said
Arab ambassadors asked the General Assembly to schedule a debate on
the proposal next week, possibly Wednesday.
	   Other diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
that the request had been forwarded to the president of the General
Assembly, Hennady Udovenko, and a decision was expected soon.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization was granted observer
status in the General Assembly in 1974, enabling it to maintain an
office in New York but without the same protocol designations as
missions of U.N. member states.
	   The PLO's status was upgraded in 1988 when the General Assembly
decided to designate the PLO as ``Palestine.''
	   In December, the Arab states submitted a resolution which would
confer ``upon Palestine the same rights and privileges of
participation as those conferred upon member states, with the
exception of voting and candidature'' for office on U.N.
committees, such as the Security Council.
	   Israel and the United States strongly opposed the move.
	   During a debate in December, the European Union used a
parliamentary maneuver to derail a vote. The Europeans proposed
that Secretary-General Kofi Annan study the idea, a move which
would have shelved it indefinitely.
	   Faced with that prospect, the sponsors, led by Egypt, withdrew
the resolution. But with no sign of progress on Middle East peace,
the Arabs decided to bring the measure back before the 185-member
General Assembly, where no state has veto power.
	   The proposed new designation would make little difference in the
daily work of the Palestinian mission. But it would affirm
international support for the Palestinians in the protracted peace
process.
	   Resolutions favoring the Palestinians are routinely approved
with huge margins in the General Assembly.
	   Last December, for example, the General Assembly voted 160-2 to
reaffirm the right of the Palestinians to self-determination, with
only Israel and the United States casting negative votes.

Albanian negotiator dismisses Milosevic's pledge to talk Kosovo government-in-exile agrees to organize resistance; TRIMS. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with more reports of fighting, Kosovo
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in
Kosovo on Wednesday dismissed President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge
to negotiate, saying his powerful forces must halt all actions and
leave the separatist province before any talks can start.
	   Fierce fighting in the embattled province continued, with at
least 12 new deaths reported on both sides by Serb and Albanian
sources.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the four-man Kosovo Albanian team named to
negotiate with the Serbs, spoke after Milosevic promised Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to reopen talks with the moderate
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``What was announced in Moscow is no news, because the problem
is not whether there will be any talks with the Albanians, but the
conditions in which talks should be held,'' Agani told The
Associated Press.
	   ``Two important conditions set by the international community
... have not been fulfilled. And meaningful talks depend on them,''
Agani said. ``Therefore, at this moment, we cannot say whether
there will be any talks.''
	   The failure of previous talks, along with Serb forces' increased
efforts to crush resistance, have turned the support of many ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo from Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who
advocates pacifist policies, to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   On Wednesday, the Kosovo government-in-exile declared that it
will start organizing resistance.
	   The self-proclaimed Kosovo government, which is outlawed by Serb
authorities, made the statement after a seven-hour meeting in the
Albanian capital Tirana with representatives of five Kosovo
political parties. Among them was Rugova's Democratic League of
Kosovo, although it wasn't clear whether Rugova himself backed
their position.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March. The
recent clashes have driven some 60,000 people from their homes.
	   In the latest fighting, the pro-Serb Media Center reported that
the Yugoslav army killed at least 10 Albanians in two separate
incidents Tuesday and Wednesday when they tried to smuggle weapons
into Yugoslavia.
	   In both incidents, large groups of Albanian smugglers exchanged
fire with Yugoslav army soldiers as they tried to cross, the center
said.
	   Government sources claimed the army seized a large but
unspecified amount of weapons and that mortar fire was launched
against its units from across the border, from Albania, in apparent
support to smugglers.
	   Meanwhile, Albanian sources said 17 Albanians were killed in the
border violence, calling it ``criminal acts'' by Serbs.

History of sex abuse in Irish swimming, report finds 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Coaches sexually abused girls seemingly
at will for decades inside the Irish Amateur Swimming Association,
a government report concluded Wednesday.
	   The 155-page report _ published late Wednesday after lawmakers
deliberated behind closed doors for several hours as to whether its
contents would libel any former coaches _ recommended about 100
reforms to ensure that coaches' relationships with their swimmers
would be professionally monitored from now on.
	   ``My thanks are due especially to witnesses who came forward to
reveal, in some cases for the first time, the extent to which they
felt trapped by the abuse they had suffered and how they had felt
unable to complain,'' wrote the report's lead investigator, lawyer
Roderick Murphy.
	   ``Swimmers, whether they had suffered or not, were
understandably initially reluctant to give evidence. As the inquiry
progressed more and more came forward.''
	   The government in February cut off state funds to the swimming
association and authorized Murphy's investigation after the
country's former Olympic coach, Derry O'Rourke, was sentenced to 12
years in prison for sexually abusing 11 teen-age girls under his
authority from 1976 to 1992.
	   ``The association should ensure that clubs have a series of
simple posters so that children of all ages know what constitutes
unacceptable behavior,'' recommended the report, which also called
for the recruitment of more female coaches.
	   The report identified another former national coach, George
Gibney, as having sexually abused young female swimmers from 1967
onwards. Gibney avoided criminal prosecution in 1993 and resettled
first in Scotland, then the United States, where he coached
swimmers for several months in Colorado before being fired when his
unsavory past came to light.
	   It listed scores of cases where O'Rourke and Gibney, exploiting
children too young to know better, made them perform sexual acts in
locker rooms, in cars or during road trips, or be groped as part of
a supposed training regime.
	   The report adds to a wider air of scandal surrounding Irish
swimming, which should have received a huge boost from the triple
gold-medal performance of Michelle Smith at the Atlanta Olympics in
1996.
	   Instead Smith _ often the target of claims she achieved her
victories with the help of banned drugs _ is threatening legal
action against swimming authorities after her most recent urine
sample was determined to have been sabotaged with toxic levels of
whiskey.
	   Smith, 28, has said O'Rourke, her principal coach until the
Barcelona Olympics in 1992, never sexually abused her. But she has
blamed his disorganized training regime for suppressing her Olympic
potential before she moved to Holland.
	   Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, said she had no comment to make
Wednesday.
	   A former coaching colleague of O'Rourke and Gibney, Frank
McCann, was convicted in 1992 of murdering his wife and niece after
fathering the child of a teen-age swimmer.

Albanian negotiator dismisses Milosevic's pledge to talk Kosovo violence 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS 2 grafs at end with Albania protesting the border
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in
Kosovo on Wednesday dismissed President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge
to negotiate, saying his powerful forces must halt all actions and
leave the separatist province before any talks can start.
	   Fierce fighting in the embattled province continued, with at
least 12 new deaths reported on both sides by Serb and Albanian
sources.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the four-man Kosovo Albanian team named to
negotiate with the Serbs, spoke after Milosevic promised Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to reopen talks with the moderate
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``What was announced in Moscow is no news, because the problem
is not whether there will be any talks with the Albanians, but the
conditions in which talks should be held,'' Agani told The
Associated Press.
	   ``Two important conditions set by the international community
... have not been fulfilled. And meaningful talks depend on them,''
Agani said. ``Therefore, at this moment, we cannot say whether
there will be any talks.''
	   The failure of previous talks, along with Serb forces' increased
efforts to crush resistance, have turned the support of many ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo from Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who
advocates pacifist policies, to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   On Wednesday, the Kosovo government-in-exile declared that it
will start organizing resistance.
	   The self-proclaimed Kosovo government, which is outlawed by Serb
authorities, made the statement after a seven-hour meeting in the
Albanian capital Tirana with representatives of five Kosovo
political parties. Among them was Rugova's Democratic League of
Kosovo, although it wasn't clear whether Rugova himself backed
their position.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March. The
recent clashes have driven some 60,000 people from their homes.
	   In the latest fighting, the pro-Serb Media Center reported that
the Yugoslav army killed at least 10 Albanians in two separate
incidents Tuesday and Wednesday when they tried to smuggle weapons
into Yugoslavia.
	   In both incidents, large groups of Albanian smugglers exchanged
fire with Yugoslav army soldiers as they tried to cross, the center
said.
	   Government sources claimed the army seized a large but
unspecified amount of weapons and that mortar fire was launched
against its units from across the border, from Albania, in apparent
support to smugglers.
	   Meanwhile, Albanian sources said 17 Albanians were killed in the
border violence, calling it ``criminal acts'' by Serbs.
	   The Albanian Foreign Ministry formally protested the death of an
Albanian reported killed by a Serb sniper Tuesday by summoning the
Yugoslav charge d'affairs in Tirana on Wednesday and handing over a
note objecting to the ``very grave incident.''
	   Earlier, Albanian President Rexhep Meidani had called on
Yugoslavia to ``stop the bloodshed'' after what he described as a
series of provocations by Serb forces firing across the border from
Kosovo.

Right-wing student election to council seen as victory for extremists killer; ADDS first reference and details on killer; adds background on Bar-Ilan 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS lead and ADDS excerpt from poem glorifying Jewish
By VITA BEKKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A student who wrote a poem glorifying a Jewish
settler who massacred 29 Palestinians was elected student union
chairman on Wednesday at Israel's second-largest university.
	   Meir Lapid, a 25-year-old biology student, won the student union
elections at Bar Ilan University, which notes among its former
students Yigal Amir, the convicted assassin of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
	   Lapid, running on a platform of student unity, won the elections
with just over 50 percent of the vote. He ran as an independent and
said he had no political affiliation.
	   But critics saw his victory as a triumph for the extreme right.
	   ``Bar Ilan University has turned into a hothouse of the fanatic
and racist elements of the Israeli society,'' Ofir Pines, a Knesset
member from Rabin's Labor Party, said Wednesday.
	   Pines called for an emergency meeting of the Knesset education
committee to discuss the consequences of Lapid's election.
	   University spokesman David Weinberg called Pines' comments
``outrageous'' and ``irresponsible,'' and said the election was not
about politics, but about the religious-secular divide.
	   Bar-Ilan offers extra courses on Judaism and religon and is the
country's popular choice for religious students through it also has
a large secular student body. The school came under scrutiny after
the Rabin assassination for being the home of the killer, a female
friend convicted earlier this week of failing to prevent the
murder, and several other suspects in the killing.
	   Lapid is known on campus as a leading proponent of
religious-secular dialogue, Weinberg said.
	   His father and brother were killed by Palestinians in a drive-by
shooting five years ago. Lapid's mother Miriam made an unsuccessful
bid for the Knesset on an extremist right-wing party list.
	   Lapid told The Associated Press he views Baruch Goldstein, the
American-born settler who massacred 29 Muslim worshipers in 1994,
as a brother who committed a horrible act.
	   In a poem Lapid, called Goldstein ``a gold nugget among the
children of Israel.'' The poem goes on to describe Goldstein's act:
``He arose and took a stand, and laid his life on the line, and
sacrificed his life.''
	   Lapid told The Associated Press that he wrote the poem which
appears in a book that paid tribute to the settler, because ``I
want the public and media to wonder how a person in our nation got
into that kind of situation.''
	   Instead of condemning Goldstein's attack, people should learn
from it so it won't happen again, he said.
	   About 2,800 of the university's 25,000 students voted in the
election, Weinberg said. vb-hla-dl

Wiesenthal calls report on Swiss Nazis exaggerated 
</HEADLINE>

By ALISON SMALE

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal on Wednesday
dismissed as exaggerated a report from the Los Angeles-based center
bearing his name that depicts neutral Switzerland as a land of Nazi
sympathizers during World War II.
	   The report, surveying Nazi and pro-Nazi groups in Switzerland
from 1939-45, was the second by American historian Alan M. Schom
who painted a distorted picture of the Swiss role in World War II,
Wiesenthal said.
	   ``Both sides must always be shown,'' Wiesenthal told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview.
	   Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the center, said
Wiesenthal's remarks about the report boiled down to a difference
of opinion.
	   ``Our report is exactly what it is _ a survey of Nazi and
pro-Nazi groups in Switzerland from 1930 to 1945,'' Hier said. ``It
is not a report of democratic institutions in Switzerland, in which
there were many.''
	   The Wiesenthal center is independent of its namesake.
	   Wiesenthal said he obtained the latest report only Tuesday, and
recommended that the center not use Schom again.

Long meek, Nigeria's state-approved parties ask for reforms 
</HEADLINE>
By GILBERT DA COSTA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Three months ago, Nigeria's five approved
political parties were widely accused of being puppets of the
country's late junta leader Gen. Sani Abacha after each unanimously
nominated him for president.
	   On Wednesday, the parties politely urged the new regime led by
Gen. Absulam Abubakar to end Nigeria's tradition of military
meddling in politics and begin implementing visible democratic
reforms.
	   The call followed a meeting Wednesday between Abubakar and
leaders of the five _ which pro-democracy groups have roundly
dismissed as political frauds _ to discuss the repressive political
policies that Abacha swung into gear after taking power following a
1993 bloodless coup.
	   Abdullahi Moggaji, chairman of the National Center Party of
Nigeria said the five parties had recommended, among other things,
that the new regime cancel the results of all local and regional
elections held under Abacha's reign.
	   Abacha died of heart failure 11 days ago _ just a month before
scheduled presidential elections in which he was the sole candidate
appointed by each of the five parties on military orders.
	   Abacha's hastily-appointed successor has given mixed signals to
critics since taking power. Although Abubakar squelched a
pro-democracy protest in the commercial hub of Lagos last week, on
Monday he announced the release of nine well-known political
prisoners.
	   The country's most famous detainee, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not on the list.
	   In addition to calling for the annulment of elections, the
country's state-sanctioned parties also called for an overhaul of
the military's hand-picked National Electoral Commission, which
bans and authorizes political parties.
	   The parties also asked Abubakar to extend Abacha's political
transition to civilian rule for three to 12 months in order to
``seek credibility'' for the program.
	   Many pro-democracy groups have called for for Abacha's political
plans to be scrapped, saying they amount to little more than a
face-lift of the military heirarchy, which during Abacha's rule
summarily jailed, tortured and killed its critics.
	   The pro-democracy movement has also called for the immediate
disbanding of the five political parties, which have received
large-scale funding from the military.
	   By Wednesday afternoon at least three of the nine prisoners due
to be released had returned home. The status of the others, held in
far-flung prisoners across this sprawling West African country, was
not immediately clear.

World Cup: Italy beats 10-man Cameroon 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio's World Cup comeback
surged on Wednesday as the Italian striker set up Luigi Di Biagio's
eighth minute goal in Italy's 3-0 victory over Cameroon, which
played most of the game with 10 men.
	   Christian Vieri added his second and third goals of the
tournament in the 75th and 89th minutes as the Italians moved into
solid position to advance to the second round by producing the
first win in Group B. The group's other three matches, including a
1-1 decision earlier Wednesday between Austria and Chile, have
ended in draws.
	   Baggio, the 1994 Cup star who had played only one game for Italy
since 1995 before France '98, lifted a perfect left cross straight
to Di Biagio, who was left all alone to put home the goal from 10
meters (yards).
	   Vieri, taking a pass from Francesco Moriero, made it 2-0 with a
nice chip over goalkeeper Jacques Songo'o and scored again when
Cameroon defender Pierre Wome failed to clear the ball, leaving the
Italian striker with an easy one-on-one chance against the keeper.
	   Baggio scored a penalty and set up Vieri's goal in last week's
2-2 draw with Chile. He wouldn't have started that game had
oncoming star Alessandro Del Piero not suffered a thigh strain.
	   Del Piero was on the substitute's bench Wednesday night and
entered the game for Baggio in the 65th minute. He nearly scored in
the 81st minute, but his 20-meter effort was batted over the
crossbar by Songo'o.
	   Any chance of Cameroon making a second-half comeback was
hindered two minutes before halftime when Raymond Kalla Nkongo was
given a controversial red card.
	   Kalla was dribbing near midfield when Di Biagio slid in front of
him to make a tackle. Unable to stop his momentum, Kalla slid
cleats-first into the Italian midfielder and was instantly showed
the red card by Australian referee Edward Lennie.
	   Di Biagio, taken off on a stretcher, returned before the half
was over to the jeers of the fans at Stade de la Mosson. As the
players walked off the field at halftime, Di Biagio lifted his
right shorts leg to show his injury to Songo'o and coach Claude
Leroy as if to vindicate the referee's discision.
	   Though down a man, Cameroon pressed forward in the second half
and paid for it at the defensive end. Songo'o made three solid
saves _ on Vieri, Dino Baggio and Del Piero _ to keep the score
respectable until the final minutes.

Israel condemns European resolutions on Mideast 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel ``condemned and rejected'' a European
Union resolution Thursday calling for unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from southern Lebanon and implying support for a
Palestinian state.
	   The resolution was adopted by European foreign ministers at the
EU Summit in Cardiff, Wales.
	   ``The European Council calls for the full and unconditional
withdrawal of Israeli forces from Southern Lebanon,'' the Cardiff
statement said.
	   The Israeli foreign ministry retorted in an official statement.
``Israel condemns and rejects the distorted interpretation placed
by the statement on United Nations Security Council resolution 425
and expresses regret over this irresponsible and harmful
presentation which does not help to promote stability, security and
peace.''
	   Israel occupies a strip of land in south Lebanon to protect its
northern border against cross-border guerrilla attacks and while it
has accepted a U.N. resolution to withdraw its forces, Israel says
it will not leave without security assurances from the Lebanese
government.
	   The EU statement also called on Israel ``to recognize the right
of the Palestinians to exercise self-determination, without
excluding the option of a state.''
	   The Israeli foreign ministry called this ``unhelpful
interference in the negotiations on a permanent settlement in which
the two sides have to negotiate freely, openly and without prior
conditions on all the issues.''
	   Israel is hoping to persuade the European countries not to
support a move by the PLO to upgrade its status at the United
Nations from that of an observer to something approaching that of a
state, Israel radio reported.
	   The PLO observer at the UN, Nasser al_Kidwa, said Wednesday Arab
ambassadors asked the General Assembly to schedule a debate on the
proposal next week.

Iraq will not apologize to Gulf countries for Kuwait invasion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Iraq will not apologize for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, even if it would help improve relations with
its Gulf neighbors, a senior Iraqi official said Wednesday.
	   ``Iraq has no intention to apologize for the events that
happened in 1990 and will not beg for support from anyone,'' Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan said.
	   But, he added, Iraq was ready to open a new chapter in relations
with fellow Gulf countries, ``leaving the past behind and
considering what had happened a family dispute.''
	   Ramadan arrived Tuesday in Yemen. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
has recently sent envoys to several countries as part of a
diplomatic drive to muster support for ending the U.N sanctions.

World Cup: Late Vastic strike earns Austria another 1-1 tie 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Italy-Cameroon result
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ It was the second minute of injury
time and Chile was leading 1-0. The Austrian fans were already
starting to pack to go home. Then, a miracle.
	   Midfielder Ivica Vastic, a substitute who had not seen play in
this or any World Cup, curled a right-footed shot past Chilean
goalkeeper Nelson Tapia, and suddenly the Alpine underdogs, who had
looked almost certain to go out, were still in the World Cup.
	   Underserved? Maybe. Lucky? Perhaps. But it's not how you survive
the World Cup, it's whether you do.
	   The Austrian guardian angel which had given the squad an
injury-time 1-1 draw with Cameroon in it's first World Cup game,
had struck again. Against Cameroon, the angel looked like striker
Anton Polster. This time, Vastic.
	   While nobody was giving Austria odds on winning the World Cup
after the Chile encounter, his late strike did keep them in the
game. It also came after a stunning late save by 'keeper Michael
Konsel stopped the Chileans going 2-0 up with two minutes to go.
	   ``It's no miracle, it's football,'' said midfielder Harald
Cerny, one of the better Austrian players Wednesday. ``We fought
hard for both goals, today and against Cameroon.''
	   With two draws behind them in Group B, the two teams are even
with two points each. Italy downed Cameroon 3-0 later Wednesday to
go top of the standings but can still be overtaken and ousted if
Austria beats the Italians and Chile downs Cameroon in their
remaining games.
	   Chilean coach Nelson Acosta, whose team appeared on course to
win against Italy June 11 until the Italians equalized 2-2 with a
controversial Roberto Baggio penalty, was predictably bitter.
	   ``I do not know what to say, why we have to suffer through
things like this,'' he said. ``I do not know what happened, can't
explain it.''
	   Enough draws, he said Wednesday. ``We will do our utmost to win
our next game'' _ against Cameroon June 23.
	   Again on Wednesday, it was Marcelo Salas who notched Chile's
goal with 20 minutes to go. With his two earlier against Italy, it
made him the tournament's top scorer.
	   It should have been Chile's game, judging from possession, ball
control and scoring opportunities.
	   Hardscrambling midfielder Harald Cerny acknowledged Austria's
shortcomings on the attack, alluding to several chances lost after
the midfield had played the ball to Polster or midfielder Mario
Haas.
	   ``We look good in the backfield, but the game up front is too
stiff, we don't trust ourselves on the attack,'' he said
	   Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska said he was happy with his
squad's defense, but ``offensively we lacked cohesion, we lacked
spontaneity as far as passing is concerned.''
	   After a bland first half, Chile should have gone ahead in the
53rd minute when midfielder Moises Villarroel made the overlap on
the right and ran clear of the Austrian defense. He messed it up
completely.
	   Villarroel took the wrong option, firing at the near post
instead of the far post, and his shot appeared to be going wide
anyway before keeper Michael
	   Konsel blocked it with his left hand.
	   There was an even better chance in the 62nd when Salas got clear
down the right and Ivan Zamorano was unmarked in the center. Salas
aimed for his strike-partner but his cross was far too close to
Konsel who gathered easily, leaving Zamorano frustrated.
	   The Chileans finally got it right in the 70th minute but only
just.
	   Egyptian referee Gamal Ghandour awarded them a free kick just
outside the area wide on the left, Zamorano climbed to head
goalwards and Konsel half stopped it.
	   Salas forced the rebound goalwards from six meters (yards) out
and the Austrian keeper was convinced he had got back to stop the
ball rolling over the line.
	   Ghandour didn't agree and Chile led 1-0 with 20 minutes to go.
	   Three minutes from the end, Zamorano nearly made it 2-0 when he
collected a forward pass and charged clear. His low shot was headed
just inside the post but Konsel got down to finger-tip the ball
round the post.
	   Lineups:
	   Austria _ Michael Konsel; Peter Schoettel, Anton Pfeffer,
Wolfgang Feiersinger, Mario Haas (Ivica Vastic, 74th); Heimo
Pfeifenberger, Harald Cerny (Markus Schopp, 46th), Arnold Wetl,
Roman Maehlich; Dietmar Kuehbauer (Andreas Herzog, 46th), Anton
Polster.
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier
Margas, Moises Villarroel (Cristian Castaneda, 67th); Francisco
Rojas, Nelson Parraguez, Clarence Acuna, Fabian Estay (Jose Sierra,
57th); Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   Referee _ Gamal Ghandour, Egypt.

Two yachts witnessed sinking of Haitian refugee boat, police say 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GRAND TURK, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Police investigating the
sinking of a boat full of Haitian refugees said Wednesday they are
searching for two yachts that were nearby at the time.
	   The Haitian sloop capsized June 8 about 25 miles (40 kilometers)
from the island of Providenciales after a British Coast Guard
vessel fired shots across its bow. At least 30 refugees died.
	   On Wednesday, Turks and Caicos police said that witnesses on two
unidentified oceangoing yachts near the scene may be able to clear
up conflicting accounts of the sinking.
	   Haitian survivors claimed that the coast guard fired upon the
refugees, while government officials have suggested the refugees
panicked at warning shots and fled to one side of the crowded boat,
tipping it over.
	   Only six bodies have been recovered. Autopsies last week showed
they had not been shot.
	   They were buried Monday on Grand Turk, the capitol of this
British dependency in the Caribbean.
	   Most of the 70 survivors will be returned to Haiti by Friday,
police said.

Threats, arrests and another Austrian comeback AP Sports Writer

Eds: UPDATES with Italy-Cameroon
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Street violence, ticket fraud, bickering players
and now political protests.
	   The World Cup can't seem to get away from the real world.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said Wednesday that Iranian exile
groups threatened to demonstrate against the Tehran government at
Sunday's politically charged World Cup match between the United
States and Iran in Lyon.
	   ``We have received more-or-less anonymous letters from groups of
exiled Iranians who say they will do something to disrupt the match
to show what is going on in their country,'' Blatter said.
	   He declined to identify the groups or say if any specific type
of action was threatened. He also said he was certain police and
security forces would be able to deal with any problems.
	   Iran already is upset with a French television network for
Monday night's broadcast of a U.S. film, ``Not Without My
Daughter,'' which paints an unflattering picture of Islamic Iran.
	   An official at the Iranian embassy said the country had
considered pulling its team out of the tournament because of the
film, but decided against it.
	   ``The national team will stay in France and play with the United
States,'' said the official, who refused to be identified by name.
	   In Wednesday's action, Italy took command of Group B with a 3-0
victory over Cameroon, which played most of the game with 10 men.
	   Luigi Di Biagio scored early for the Italians, and Christian
Vieri added his second and third goals of the tournament as Italy
produced the first win in the group. The group's other three
matches, including a 1-1 decision earlier Wednesday between Austria
and Chile, had ended in draws.
	   ``Everything went well, and we showed we have top strikers,''
Italian coach Cesare Maldini said. ``It was a win for the whole
team.''
	   Cameroon's chances were hindered two minutes before halftime
when Raymond Kalla Nkongo was given a controversial red card for
sliding spikes-first into Di Biagio. The call was jeered by the
fans at Stade de la Mosson in Montpellier and was the fourth
expulsion of the World Cup in the 20th game.
	   ``We had a very bad start tonight,'' Leroy said. ``We tried to
play well, but we didn't have many opportunities having only 10
players on the pitch.''
	   The Chile-Austria first match was a poor, blunder-filled game,
ending with Ivica Vastic's second-half injury time goal at
Saint-Etienne. It's the second time in row the Austrians have
pulled that trick: Anton Polster netted in injury time last week in
a 1-1 draw with Cameroon.
	   ``It's no miracle, it's football,'' Austrian midfielder Harald
Cerny said. ``We fought hard.''
	   The Chileans were suitably distraught.
	   ``I do not know what to say, why we have to suffer through
things like this,'' coach Nelson Acosta said. ``I do not know what
happened, can't explain it.''
	   Marcelo Salas scored in the 70th minute for Chile, making him
the first player at France '98 to score three goals.
	   Meanwhile, police sources said the first arrests had been made
in the international scandal that left thousands of fans without
World Cup tickets that had been paid for.
	   French authorities arrested three people, including a consultant
for a subsidiary of FIFA's exclusive marketing partner, ISL Ltd.,
the sources said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. A large
amount of cash and about 100 Cup tickets were found, the sources
said, and more arrests were expected.
	   Player misbehavior was also in the limelight Wednesday.
	   After initially saying he wouldn't discuss the matter, Patrick
Kluivert has told a Dutch newspaper that Belgian defender Lorenzo
Staelens called him a rapist during their World Cup match on
Saturday.
	   Enraged by the alleged comment, the 21-year-old Dutch striker
waved his finger at Staelens then elbowed him in the chest, drawing
an immediate ejection and a two-match suspension.
	   ``Staelens called me a rapist,'' Kluivert told the Algemeen
Dagblad for Wednesday's edition. ``... I heard this I could no
longer control myself.''
	   Kluivert was accused, but never charged, last June in a case
involving an alleged gang rape in Amsterdam.
	   Another disgruntled player is Colombia's Faustino Asprilla, who
went on the radio and said coach Hernan Dario Gomez had
``disrespected'' him by taking him out of Monday's game against
Romania with five minutes remaining.
	   Gomez promptly kicked Asprilla off the team.
	   ``He took himself out of the team with his behavior,'' Gomez
said.
	   In Marseille, where three days of violence surrounded England's
2-0 victory over Tunisia on Monday, more than 100 people remained
jailed. Some have received jail sentences of at least two months,
and others will be kept behind bars until the World Cup ends July
12.
	   In Toulouse, French police are bracing for another round of fan
violence as English supporters make their way to the site of
England's next game against Romania on Monday.
	   While saying he was ``saddened'' by the violence, Blatter said
he hoped it would not take on ``too much importance.''
	   ``It's impossible to make a kind of ghetto out of each city
before each soccer match,'' Blatter said. ``I'm convinced that from
today, we won't have that hooligan problem anymore.''

World Cup: Italy defeats Cameroon 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: optional lead, wrapup optional planned
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Luigi Di Biagio made his first World
Cup start memorable, scoring on an early header and drawing a
controversial red card against Cameroon defender Raymond Kalla
Nkongo to lead Italy to a 3-0 victory Wednesday night.
	   Christian Vieri also scored two late goals for Italy, which now
is likely to qualify for the second round from Group B. More
importantly, the victory gave the ``Azzurri'' a good chance to win
the group and avoid likely Group A winner and defending champion
Brazil in the next round.
	   While in control most of the game, the Italians had problems in
the second half even though Cameroon was down to 10 men. Cheered on
by a sympathetic crowd, the Indomitable Lions pushed forward
convincingly and almost scored several times until Vieri's
75th-minute strike provided a cushion. Vieri scored again in the
89th minute.
	   Italian coach Cesare Maldini called the victory a tough team
effort.
	   ``We have suffered a lot as expected,'' Maldini said. ``Their
forwards played well and kept our defense under pressure.''
	   Asked to single out his best player, he answered: ``I would say
that a good team responded well.''
	   Cameroon coach Claude Leroy said a bad start hurt his team,
which has only one point from its two matches and is last in Group
B.
	   ``We tried to play well, but we didn't have many opportunities
having only 10 players on the pitch,'' Leroy said. He refrained
from criticizing Australian referee Edward Lennie for the red card
against Kalla, but said most of the calls went Italy's way.
	   ``We can still qualify and will give our all against Chile,''
Leroy said.
	   Lennie was strict, booking Cameroon's Pierre Wome in the 6th
minute, just before Italy's Roberto Baggio sent a cross off a
corner that Di Biagio headed from just inside the penalty spot into
the top right of the net.
	   Di Biagio, who came on as a substitute in Italy's opening 2-2
draw with Chile, was playing in his fifth international.
	   Cameroon struggled to recover, rarely penetrating the Italian
box for much of the half. Goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca only faced
two direct shots, both from well outside the box by Samuel Ipoua
and Pierre Njanka.
	   Lennie sent Kalla off in the 43rd minute when the defender
stepped into Di Biagio, who had tackled him at midfield. Kalla
appeared unable to stop himself instead of intentionally spiking
the Italian, and the crowd booed when Di Biagio, who was carried
off on a stretcher, returned a minute later.
	   As the players walked off the field at halftime, Di Biagio
lifted his right shorts leg to show his injury to Songo'o and coach
Claude Leroy as if trying to vindicate the referee's decision.
	   Despite being a man down, Cameroon attacked in the second half
as Italy dropped back and tried to counter. Patrick Mboma, his head
wrapped due to a cut, penetrated in the 13th minute and substitute
Joseph-Desire Job had his drive from the left stopped on a
brilliant hand save by Pagliuca a minute later.
	   Roberto Baggio, continuing his World Cup comeback, went off for
Alessandro Del Piero in the 65th minute. Baggio starred for Italy
at the 1994 World Cup but has played only once for the national
side since 1995 before the current tournament.
	   Vieri's first goal, off a feed from Franceso Moriero, ended the
drama and his second, off a misplay by Wome in the penalty area,
prompted the crowd to begin singing a victory song.
	   The two goals gave Vieri three for the tournament, tying him
with Chile's Marcelo Salas for the scoring lead.

Former commander of Croatian concentration camp is extradited from Argentina 
</HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The former officer of Croatia's
largest concentration camp during World War II was extradited
Wednesday, bound for his homeland to face accusations of wartime
atrocities.
	   Flanked by Croatian police, Dinko Sakic smiled as he boarded a
commercial flight for Frankfurt, Germany. Argentine authorities
said that would be his first stop before changing planes for
Zagreb, Croatia.
	   In Croatia, Sakic faces investigation for crimes allegedly
committed while he commanded the Jasenovac concentration camp in
the early 1940s, when the country was under the pro-Nazi Ustasha
regime.
	   ``Sakic has always wanted to go to Croatia to explain the
facts,'' said Sakic's lawyer, Miguel Angel Rossi, at Buenos Aires'
Ezeiza International Airport.
	   Croatia's Foreign Minister Mate Granic has promised that Sakic's
case would be handled ``impartially and highly professionally.''
	   Thousands of Serbians, Jews and Gypsies died at Jasenovac, the
concentration camp known as the ``Auschwitz of the Balkans,'' but
exact numbers remain in dispute.
	   Croatian president Franjo Tudjman has put the death toll at
35,000, the U.S. Justice Department at 125,000; and camp survivors,
at up to 500,000.
	   Sakic, 76, had kept a relatively low profile since arriving in
Argentina in 1947, but caused an uproar with a nationally televised
interview last April 6.
	   He had lived quietly in the Atlantic coastal town of Santa
Teresita, 165 miles (260 kms) south of Buenos Aires, until the
interview.
	   Speaking with Argentina's Canal 13, Sakic denied any wrongdoing
and said no one was exterminated at Jasenovic while the camp was
under his control.
	   ``It was a work camp where the Jews managed themselves,'' Sakic
said in the broadcast.
	   ``We never put a hand on any of the prisoners in the camp,'' he
added. ``The people died of natural death. There was a typhus
epidemic, for example, but there were no cremation ovens that
killed anybody.''
	   In an unusual move, President Carlos Menem called for Sakic's
arrest a day after the broadcast, even though no formal extradition
request had been filed. Croatia made the request soon afterward.
	   Sakic vanished as police embarked on a nationwide search. He
surfaced nearly a month later when police led him handcuffed from
his home.
	   Compared to past extraditions, this one was swift, in part
because Sakic accepted the terms of the extradition to Croatia,
where critics said he would get a more lenient trial.
	   Since Menem took office in 1989, his government has worked
assiduously to dismantle the country's image as a Nazi hideaway.
	   ``There are gestures from the Argentine government that show
some interest in letting the researchers find the truth,'' Sergio
Widder of the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center said. ``But it
is clear we believe there are more things to find out.''

<TEXT>
	   TANAF, Senegal (AP) _ Rebels in Guinea-Bissau were on the
retreat Wednesday after 11 days of fighting that sent thousands
fleeing and left the capital nearly deserted, Guinea-Bissau and
Senegalese officials said.
	   Guinea-Bissau's foreign minister, Fernando Delfim da Silva, told
The Associated Press in Lisbon that loyalist soldiers had forced
renegade troops to retreat three kilometers (two miles) from an
army garrison to the airport just outside the capital of Bissau on
Tuesday.
	   ``The rebel forces are in retreat,'' Da Silva said. ``The rebels
are pulling back to the airport.''
	   Da Silva, who was in Lisbon due to flight cancellations, said he
was told about the retreat in a phone call with Guinea-Bissau
President Joao Bernardo Vieira. The report could not be immediately
confirmed.
	   The mutineers, meanwhile, insisted on Portuguese state radio
Antenna I that they were ready to hold peace talks, but only within
the army garrison. Although they did not comment on reports that
the garrison had been captured, the statement seemed to contradict
those claims.
	   Senegal's military released a statement signed by its ambassador
to Guinea-Bissau saying loyalists and their Senegalese allies had
captured the Ba military garrison on Saturday. The rebellion began
at the garrison on June 7.
	   ``The morale (of the loyalists) is very good,'' the Senegalese
ambassador Ben Khatab Sokhna said.
	   Senegal's state-run radio station cited Senegalese officials as
saying loyalists had forced the renegades to retreat from several
strongholds. The report did not give details.
	   Rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane, the former head of
Guinea-Bissau's armed forces, has accused Vieira of corruption and
demanded he step down.
	   Vieira came to power in a 1980 coup after winning renown as a
guerrilla fighter in the 1961-74 war against Portuguese colonial
rule. He was elected in the country's first democratic ballot in
1994.
	   Senegalese troops sealed the border Wednesday with their West
African neighbor to contain the conflict in Guinea-Bissau, where
they said fighting had spread to rural areas along the border.
Senegalese troops also continued to pour over the border to
reinforce loyalist and Republic of Guinea forces.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Gambia's foreign minister held talks with
government officials in the nearly-abandoned capital of the former
Portuguese colony in an attempt to mediate.
	   ``We have come to look at the possibilities for a cease-fire,''
Mohamed Sedat Jobe was quoted as saying after the 45-minute
meeting, according to the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   The Gambian minister had been reportedly scheduled to meet later
Wednesday with rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane. It was not
immediately clear whether the meeting took place. The rebels
demanded all peace talks take place at the military garrison.
	   Government troops, backed by soldiers from neighboring Senegal
and the Republic of Guinea, had been bombarding the garrison since
the revolt began.
	   More than three-quarters of Bissau's population of 300,000
people had fled the city during the fighting, witnesses and aid
groups said.
	   The U.N. food agency, the World Food Program, reported some
100,000 refugees near the town of Mansoa, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) from the capital. A Catholic mission put the number at
150,000.
	   ``The situation in Bissau is growing progressively more
desperate,'' WFP representative Sanda Maina said from Rome.
	   Villages in Guinea-Bissau were quickly running out of ways to
feed a growing influx of displaced people, another WFP official
said.
	   ``This is the rainy season, the lean season when there is not a
lot of food around,'' Wagdi Othman said from Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

Beck's back: He hasn't made a cut, but he's in the Open AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ It won't go down in the books as making the
cut _ certainly not winning a tournament.
	   But the fact Chip Beck will tee it up Thursday in the U.S. Open
feels about the same.
	   ``This is the best thing that's happened to me in two years,''
Beck said Wednesday after his final practice round at The Olympic
Club.
	   It's easy to see why.
	   Beck, the last PGA Tour player to shoot 59 hasn't been able to
shoot his way out of paper sack the last two years. He hasn't made
the cut in 36 straight tournaments and withdrew on two other
occasions.
	   The last time Beck made it to the weekend was the Honda Classic
in March 1997, when he tied for 45th. He didn't break 70 the rest
of the year until the final round in Las Vegas, the final
full-field event of the year.
	   Beck, known as the most optimistic player on tour, kept a sunny
disposition. Inside, he was beginning to see the glass as
half-empty.
	   ``I had never struggled with golf before. It always came so
easy,'' said Beck, whose exemption on the PGA Tour is based on his
top-25 ranking in career money. ``This was a different challenge.''
	   The turnaround started during the Florida swing when Beck met
with Jack Nicklaus at Doral. Nicklaus told Beck to come see him the
next weekend if Beck failed to make the cut in the Honda.
	   Beck was at Nicklaus' door on Saturday.
	   ``He has a tremendous eye for mechanics,'' Beck said. ``He told
me what he remembered about my swing from three years ago, when I
was playing well. You don't realize how gifted he is until you
start talking to him.''
	   Beck's problems were off the tee. Nicklaus thinks Beck's
problems were between the ears.
	   ``He's one of the most positive energetic players that I have
known on the tour, and what has happened to him has been a shame,''
said Nicklaus, who played a practice round with Beck on Tuesday.
``I think it's mostly in his head. I don't think there's all that
much wrong with his golf game.''
	   Beck could see the progress even as he was missing cuts at
Greenboro, Houston, Kemper and Buick. He was hitting about four
fairways per round in March and getting up to 12 fairways a week
ago.
	   ``Driving sets up the rest of your game,'' Beck said.
	   It worked nicely for him in sectional qualifying at Summit,
N.J., where he earned a spot in the Open with rounds of 72 and 70.
The first person he called was Nicklaus.
	   ``He was like a little kid,'' Nicklaus said. ``He picked up the
telephone and said, `I qualified!' I think it's a matter of time
until he gets his confidence back to play well again. I don't think
that's very far away.''
	   Beck has come close to winning the U.S. Open twice, finishing
two strokes behind Raymond Floyd at Shinnecock Hills in 1986 and
one behind Curtis Strange at Oak Hill three years later.
	   This is Beck's first major since the 1995 PGA Championship, and
it would seem he's a long shot to even make the cut.
	   By Wednesday afternoon, Beck was hopeful to have an opportunity
come Sunday.
	   ``It's kind of like shooting a 59,'' he said. ``You don't know
it's going to happen until you get there.''
	   Already, it's been quite a journey.

	   BUENOS AIRES (AP) _ Argentina's foreign minister launched
preliminary talks toward a Free Trade Area of the Americas, warning
Wednesday he expected limited progress until U.S. President Bill
Clinton has ``fast track'' authority in hand.
	   Guido di Tella said negotiators can begin broad talks toward an
eventual accord but would have to wait until any U.S. congressional
approval of fast track authority to tackle ``underlying issues.''
	   ``If we don't have fast track by the end of this year or early
next year, the process will begin to stall,'' di Tella said after
his speech to negotiators here. ``Next year, we'll need fast track
to give the negotiations a final push.''
	   Fast track requires the U.S. Congress to approve or reject
outright _ with no amendments _ trade treaties negotiated by the
executive branch.
	   The talks follow an April summit at which the Western
Hemisphere's 34 democracies forged ahead with a plan for duty-free
trade within the region by 2005. Such a free trade area would
combine economies totaling dlrs 9 trillion and encompass nearly 800
million people.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Three heavily armed men opened fire in
a bar early Wednesday, killing 11 people and seriously wounding
four others, police said.
	   The shooting occurred in the Fancisco Morato neighborhood on Sao
Paulo's outskirts about 4 a.m. (0700 GMT) while people were still
celebrating Brazil's 3-0 victory over Morocco in the World Cup,
said Police Chief Eduardo Salles Pitta.
	   Three women were among the dead, Pitta said.
	   Police believe the killings, which they characterized as
execution-style because most of the victims were shot in the head,
were drug-related.
	   Police had no suspects.
	   Pitta said the killings mark the largest number of deaths in a
single shooting in the greater Sao Paulo area.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Colombian President
Ernesto Samper will visit the Dominican Republic late June to
discuss an oil deal, drug trafficking and tourism, foreign
relations officials said Wednesday.
	   The Foreign Relations Secretariat said no date has been set, but
Samper probably would come to Santo Domingo following a June 24
trip to Cuba.
	   Samper and Dominican President Leonel Fernandez will discuss a
proposal to buy Colombian oil for the Dominican Republic's
state-owned refinery.
	   They also will discuss anti-drug efforts. In the past year, the
Dominican Republic has become a popular transshipment point for
cocaine carried by speedboat from Colombia to Haiti and then
trucked across the border for shipping to Florida from Santo
Domingo.
	   ___
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Cuba and Suriname agreed Wednesday
to cooperate on economic development projects, signing the latest
in a series of new pacts strengthening Cuba's ties to Caribbean
Basin countries.
	   The agreement, signed by diplomats in Paramaribo, says the two
countries will cooperate in the areas of health, fishing, natural
resources, commerce, transportation, tourism, telecommunications
and agriculture.
	   The signing followed a three-day visit by a Cuban government
officials to fisheries, hotels, manufacturing plants and Suriname's
bureau of medical drugs.
	   Suriname, a former Dutch colony on the northeast coast of South
America, is one of the poorest countries in the Americas. President
Jules Wijdenbosch has been trying to attract outside investment
despite labor unrest, rising inflation and a growing national debt.
	   Cuba has been aggressively pursuing diplomatic ties with other
Caribbean countries and is trying to cultivate support for possible
membership in regional trade groups.
	   ___
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Prosecutors said Wednesday they
are trying to block early release of at least three of five
national guardsmen convicted of killing three U.S. nuns during El
Salvador's civil war.
	   Douglas Melendez, head of the federal prosecutor's office in
Zacatecoluca, said three of the guardsmen have prison records that
should make them ineligible for early release under a new law meant
to ease prison overcrowding.
	   Roman Catholic nuns Dorothy Kazel, Ita Ford, Maura Clark and lay
worker Jean Donovan were raped and shot to death on a rural road on
Dec. 2, 1980. Five former National Guardsmen were convicted of
killing the women, whom the military saw as sympathetic to leftist
guerrillas.
	   Melendez said Francisco Contreras had a record of weapons
possession and attempted escape in prison; Carlos Contreras was
accused of leading a prison riot and Daniel Canales of bad conduct.
	   He also said none had made restitution to the families of the
victims, which he said was a condition for early release.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The former officer of Croatia's
largest concentration camp during World War II was extradited
Wednesday, bound for his homeland to face accusations of wartime
atrocities.
	   Flanked by Croatian police, Dinko Sakic smiled as he boarded a
commercial flight for Frankfurt, Germany. Argentine authorities
said that would be his first stop before changing planes for
Zagreb, Croatia.
	   In Croatia, Sakic faces investigation for crimes allegedly
committed while he commanded the Jasenovac concentration camp in
the early 1940s, when the country was under the pro-Nazi Ustasha
regime.
	   ``Sakic has always wanted to go to Croatia to explain the
facts,'' said Sakic's lawyer, Miguel Angel Rossi, at Buenos Aires'
Ezeiza International Airport.
	   The public defender's office said Sakic faces prosecution in
Zagreb courts on suspicion that ``he committed crimes against
humanity and international law.''

	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Police investigating the
sinking of a boat crowded with Haitian refugees appealed Wednesday
for help from two unidentified yachts that were nearby at the time.
	   Turks and Caicos police said that witnesses on two unidentified
oceangoing yachts may be able to clear up conflicting accounts of
the sinking.
	   The Haitian sloop capsized June 8 about 25 miles (40 kilometers)
from the island of Providenciales after maritime police fired
shots. A police officer has said that he fired warning shots across
the bow of the boat. Some of the 70 survivors say the shots hit
refugees.
	   Six bodies were recovered, drowned but with no bullet wounds.
Police are investigating survivors' claims that more than 30 others
died.
	   Most of the survivors will be returned to Haiti by Friday,

Bowman does it his way, wins again AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Scotty Bowman has won as many Stanley Cup titles
as anyone in National Hockey League history. Will he go for the
record?
	   Good question. There are no easy answers where Bowman is
concerned.
	   Bowman tied his mentor Toe Blake on Tuesday when the Detroit Red
Wings swept the Washington Capitals, becoming the first NHL team to
repeat as Cup champions since 1992. Blake and Bowman each have
eight Cup titles.
	   With almost the entire team coming back next season, it would
stand to reason Bowman would also want to be back. Still, there are
no guarantees.
	   Bowman has a year remaining on his contract. But he is 64 years
old and has strong family ties that could be tugging him home.
Plus, if there were ever a good time to leave the game, riding out
on a high note, this might be the way to do it.
	   General manager Ken Holland thinks Bowman will stay. Bowman,
when asked, said he was still undecided.
	   ``I'm going to talk it over with Kenny Holland, the manager, who
I made a deal with to sign for two years, and also the owner, Mr.
Illitch,'' Bowman said. ``It's going to be a tough decision not to
come back, I realize that. But I've got to leave sometime.''
	   Still, now might not be the time. Not with the likes of Steve
Yzerman, Brendan Shanahan and Sergei Fedorov returning. The only
key player who might not return is defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov,
who is 40. But even Fetisov has hinted at another year or two.
	   And with Yzerman, the captain, Bowman knows he will never have
any locker-room rebellions. Yzerman plans on being around at least
five more years.
	   ``After last season I thought about how much longer I wanted to
play and that was my 15th season in the league and I want to play
20,'' said Yzerman, the MVP of the finals. ``So I would like to
play five more.''
	   Whether that would be the clincher for Bowman is hard to say.
But whatever his decision, his achievements are extraordinary. He
has a 1,057-483-278 record in 26 seasons and a 194-111 mark in the
playoffs. He has won five titles with Montreal, two with Detroit
and one with Pittsburgh.
	   ``It's quite a remarkable accomplishment, especially in this day
and age,'' said Dave Lewis, an assistant coach. ``He is such a
student of the game and such a student of the history of the game.
He has his finger into every aspect of the game. That's just his
nature.''
	   To be sure, Bowman's methods are not always fun for his players.
He can be manipulative, distant and infuriating.
	   Yet all he does is win.
	   ``At the beginning of the season, everybody was being negative
about the team because we were missing some key guys,'' center Igor
Larionov said. ``But he found a way to balance the team, and that
says a lot about his wisdom. Players know he knows the game.''

World Cup: Italy beats 10-man Cameroon 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: wrapup optional
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio kept up his strong
World Cup comeback Wednesday night, but it was two lesser-known
teammates who sparked Italy to a 3-0 triumph over a 10-man Cameroon
side.
	   Midfielder Luigi Di Biagio scored an eighth-minute header and
drew a red card against Cameroon's Raymond Kalla Nkongo just before
the half, while striker Christian Vieri threatened all night and
was rewarded with two late goals to give him a share of the
tournament scoring lead.
	   The victory gave Italy four points in Group B, two more than
Chile and Austria, who played to a 1-1 draw earlier, and three more
than the Indomitable Lions with one match left. A win or a draw
against Austria next week assures the Italians advance, and more
importantly, means they probably won't have to face defending
champion Brazil in the second round.
	   ``Everything went well, and we showed we have top strikers,''
Italian coach Cesare Maldini said. ``It was a win for the whole
team.''
	   Baggio, the 1994 Cup star who had played only one game for Italy
since 1995 before getting the call for this tournament, lifted a
perfect cross to Di Biagio, who headed the ball home from 10 meters
(yards) past goalkeeper Jacques Sango'o.
	   Di Biagio, making his first World Cup start in only his fourth
international, also made a key tackle on Kalla in the 43rd minute
on the play that got the Cameroon defender ejected. Kalla, who was
on a full run, couldn't stop and went feet first into Di Biagio,
and Australian referee Edward Lennie immediately pulled out the red
card.
	   Di Biagio, taken off on a stretcher, returned before the half
was over to the jeers of fans at Stade de la Mosson. As the players
walked off the field at halftime, Di Biagio lifted his right shorts
leg to show his injury to Songo'o and Cameroon coach Claude Leroy
as if trying to vindicate the referee's decision.
	   Despite having only 10 men in the second half, the Africans
attacked to try for an equalizer and eventually gave up too many
chances.
	   ``I took advantage of the opportunities I had,'' said Vieri, 24,
who also scored in Italy's opening 2-2 draw with Chile. His three
goals ties him with Chile's Marcelo Salas for the World Cup scoring
lead.
	   Viero took a pass from Francesco Moriero and chipped the ball
over Songo'o for a 2-0 lead in the 75th minute, then scored easily
when defender Pierre Wome misplayed the ball in front of Songo'o in
the 89th minute.
	   Before that, Cameroon caused some problems despite being a man
down, with Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca forced to make a
brilliant one-handed save on substitute Joseph-Desire Job's blast
for the top left corner in the 59th minute.
	   ``We had a very bad start tonight,'' Leroy said. ``We tried to
play well, but we didn't have many opportunities having only 10
players on the pitch.''
	   While refraining from directly criticizing Lennie's red card
decision, Leroy said most of the calls favored Italy. He promised a
strong effort by Cameroon against Chile next week, saying the
Indomitable Lions can still qualify with a victory if Italy defeats
Austria.
	   Baggio, playing his 49th international at age 31, had a second
straight big game after scoring a penalty and setting up Vieri's
goal against Chile. He only started last week because oncoming star
Alessandro Del Piero had a thigh strain.
	   Del Piero replaced Baggio in the 65th minute and nearly scored
in the 81st minute when Songo'o batted his 20-meter shot over the
crossbar.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
appointed a staff to begin work on a national referendum on a U.S.
package proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from West Bank
land, a report said Wednesday.
	   Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan said the report on Israel's
Channel 2 TV sounded ``very likely.''
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States to respond to
a proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
The U.S. plan, which has not been made public, also calls for the
Palestinians to crackdown on terrorism and includes a reported
freeze in Israeli construction of Jewish settlements. The plan,
first introduced in January, has been accepted by the Palestinians.
	   Earlier this week, Netanyahu said that he favored public input
into the proposal. ``The prime minister is taking the idea of a
referendum very seriously,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press.
	   Palestinians have called the referendum a stalling tactic by
Israel since Israel's Knesset already approved a deal for the
withdrawal last year.
	   Bar-Illan said he could not provide any further details of a
public vote but Channel 2 reported that a copy of any agreement
approved by Netanyahu would then be mailed to every Israeli
household prior to voting.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu said Israel was no closer to accepting the
deal, which he has said would harm Israel's security. In
Washington, an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had told the Israeli
leader that a decision on the plan was urgent.
	   Bar-Illan blamed the U.S. administration for encouraging
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to adopt a more hard-line in
negotiations.
	   ``The fact that the Americans privately have announced what its
idea of a credible withdrawal would be has encouraged the
Palestinians to be more intransigent because they are not going to
be less demanding than the Americans,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Meanwhile in the West Bank city of Hebron, several dozen
Palestinian youths threw stones at Israeli troops and burned
Israeli flags at the funeral of a Palestinian farmer clubbed to
death by a Jewish settler Tuesday.
	   Abdel Abu Turki was walking home Tuesday when a 16-year-old
Jewish youth apparently leaned out of a van and whacked him in the
head. The youth and another 16-year-old in the van were in Israeli
custody.
	   Some 3,000 mourners turned out for Abu Turki's funeral, which
turned violent when some mourners threw stones at Israeli police
and soldiers. Others chanted ``No peace with settlers'' and ``With
our blood and soul, we will redeem Palestine.''
	   Peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian broke down
16 months ago after Israel announced it would build homes for Jews
on a disputed hilltop in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, which
it captured along with the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war.
	   The Palestinians, who have gained autonomy in eight different
cities as a result of the talks, hope negotiations will lead to an
independent state with east Jerusalem as its capital.

Eds: UPDATES thruout with Albright speech making overture to Iran;
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a major overture after nearly two decades
of distrust, the Clinton administration offered to start a new
relationship with Iran _ even including a role in Persian Gulf
security _ if it abides by international standards of conduct.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held out the olive branch,
responding to openings from Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, in
a speech prepared for delivery Wednesday to The Asia Society in New
York.
	   Already, the Clinton administration has supported cultural and
academic exchanges with Iran, and eased travel to the United States
by many Iranians.
	   ``We are ready to explore further ways to build mutual
confidence and avoid misunderstanding,'' Albright said. ``The
Islamic Republic should consider parallel steps.''
	   Specifically, Albright called for a halt in support for
terrorism, and she criticized Iran's record on human rights. On the
other hand, she praised Tehran's decision to acquiesce to any
agreement Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat works out with Israel.
	   ``Obviously, two decades of mistrust cannot be erased
overnight,'' she said. ``The gap between us remains wide. But it is
time to test the possibilities for bridging this gap.''
	   Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Albright's offer was the
suggestion Iran could be included in ``multilateral efforts to
protect international security.''
	   She said the United Nations and other multinational coalitions
had countered threats to peace in the Persian Gulf War against Iraq
in 1991 and in peacekeeping operations around the world.
	   ``This global network has grown largely without Iranian
participation,'' Albright said. ``But Iran would be welcome if it
is willing to make a constructive contribution.''
	   In her remarks, Albright also credited Iran with already
participating in efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan and with
trying to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
	   As another ``sign of change,'' she cited an improvement in
Iran's record in the war against drugs within its borders, and said
Iran had received ``high marks'' from the United Nations to its
treatment of more than 2 million and Iraqi and Afghan refugees.
	   However, Albright said, the positive developments ``must be
balanced against the reality that Iran's support for terrorism has
not ceased, serious violations of human rights persist and its
efforts to develop long-range missiles and to acquire nuclear
weapons continue.''
	   Turning to other countries, Albright made these points:
	   _China: President Clinton on his visit beginning next week will
express concern about preserving Tibet's heritage and stress
political and religious rights. He will be saying things ``the
people of China cannot say and have not heard.''
	   _South Korea: Hinting the Clinton administration would ease its
sanctions against the communist regime in North Korea, she said,
``We have agreed to coordinate closely'' with Seoul on the issues.
President Kim Dae Jung is calling for an easing of the sanctions to
improve economic conditions on the Korean peninsula.
	   _Indonesia: Praised President B.J. Habibie for promising new
elections, releasing political prisoners and for his approach to
debt and other economic problems. ``It is not too early to reaffirm
America's commitment to do all we can to help the Indonesia
people,'' she said, announcing the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta and
other diplomatic offices were being brought up to full strength.''
	   Earlier, Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk said Iran's
Revolutionary Guard had taken to the streets of Tehran in a
``strong backlash'' to students demonstrating against the country's
militant Islamic government.
	   Speaking at a media seminar, Indyk said ``there is a good deal
of turmoil going on there at the moment,'' with the guard debating
the students.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The former officer of Croatia's
largest concentration camp during World War II was extradited
Wednesday, bound for his homeland to face accusations of wartime
atrocities.
	   Flanked by Croatian police, Dinko Sakic smiled as he boarded a
commercial flight for Frankfurt, Germany. Argentine authorities
said that would be his first stop before changing planes for
Zagreb, Croatia.
	   In Croatia, Sakic faces investigation for crimes allegedly
committed while he commanded the Jasenovac concentration camp in
the early 1940s, when the country was under the pro-Nazi Ustasha
regime.
	   ``Sakic has always wanted to go to Croatia to explain the
facts,'' said Sakic's lawyer, Miguel Angel Rossi, at Buenos Aires'
Ezeiza International Airport.
	   The public defender's office said Sakic faces prosecution in
Zagreb courts on suspicion that ``he committed crimes against
humanity and international law.''
	   ``It was a great shame he was received (in Argentina) and it is
with great joy to send him away,'' Argentine Foreign Minister Guido
di Tella said.

Equipment fracas takes backseat to golf in U.S. Open AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Now that the USGA has decided to leave
clubs alone _ for a while, at least _ the players can put those
evil instruments of destruction to use in the U.S. Open.
	   On Wednesday, the governing body of golf in the United States
said existing equipment was just fine, although it was concerned
about ``what is around the corner.''
	   ``I figured we're playing with nine clubs and we're all going to
have to play barefoot,'' Justin Leonard said about the anticipation
since USGA officials said last month they were concerned that
technology was hurting the integrity of the game.
	   Leonard will be able to use all 14 clubs this week at Olympic
and he can wear alternative spikes or steel ones _ at least for
now.
	   And with issues like determining limits for the ``spring-like''
effect that propels a ball off the club face being decided
somewhere down the road, attention can turn to Thursday's first
round of the 98th U.S. Open.
	   The Olympic Club is known as the Graveyard of Champions because
in past Opens here Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson finished
second in rather excruciating manner.
	   That is perhaps a bad omen for Leonard, defending champion Ernie
Els and Tiger Woods, all of whom come to Olympic among the
favorites.
	   But the fact that the last 14 major championships were won by 14
players could bode well for David Duval, Colin Montgomerie, Jim
Furyk and Phil Mickelson, who come into the Open looking for their
first major championships.
	   If there is a search for this year's Jack Fleck _ the unlikely
winner in a playoff with Hogan at Olympic in 1955 _ it might be
Chip Beck, who qualified for the U.S. Open after missing the cut in
36 consecutive PGA Tour events and withdrawing in two others.
	   And then there is the other qualifier who had the most difficult
road of anyone to this U.S. Open _ Casey Martin.
	   All he had to do was beat the PGA Tour in federal court three
times to win the right to ride a cart because of a circulatory
problem in his right leg and then win a five-way playoff for the
last spot in his sectional Open qualifier.
	   Among the veteran players with major championships challenging
the young stars this week are Davis Love III, if his back holds up;
Fred Couples, who has won twice this year and could have won twice
more including the Masters; Tom Lehman; and Masters champion Mark
O'Meara.
	   ``The old guys never went anywhere,'' said Lehman, who has
played in the final group in the last two Opens but has yet to win.
``It's just that the younger guys played a little bit better.''
	   It's strange to consider Nick Faldo a longshot since he has won
the Masters and the British Open three times each, but he has
played so poorly this year there is no reason to rank him as a
contender.
	   Except for one thing. Faldo is one of the great grinders of all
time and a seventh major championship _ especially a U.S. Open _
would force his name to be mentioned among the best to ever play
the game.
	   So many players are playing so well right now it would be no
surprise if the tournament remained so close that it ended in the
first playoff since Els defeated Montgomerie and Loren Roberts at
Oakmont in 1994.
	   ``You have got to look at players like Justin, Ernie Els, Davis
Love, Monty, Jim Furyk,'' Duval said, clicking off a checklist of
those who should do well here.
	   ``I think Tom Watson will certainly be having something to say
on what happens on Sunday,'' he said. ``I think obviously Tiger
will be involved in it in some manner as well.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ American record-holders Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
Gail Devers and Mary Slaney were granted waivers Wednesday to
compete in the USA Track and Field Championships despite not having
qualifying marks in their specialities.
	   Joyner-Kersee, 36, who said this would be her final year of
competition, was allowed by the Women's Track and Field Committee
of USA Track and Field to declare for the heptathlon in which she
holds the U.S. and world record of 7,291 points. She won the
heptathlon in the 1988 and 1992 Olympic Games and is the five-time
national champion.
	   Joyner-Kersee also will compete in the long jump in the
three-day championships beginning Friday at Tad Gormley Stadium.
She had a qualifier for that event, having finished second in last
year's national championships at Indianapolis.
	   Before that runner-up finish, Joyner-Kersee had won seven
consecutive national long jump titles and eight overall. She also
won the Olympic gold medal in 1988.
	   Devers, 31, who has been plagued by injuries and illness, will
compete in the 100-meter hurdles in which she owns the U.S. record
of 12.46 seconds. She has won four national championships in the
hurdles, but never an Olympic medal, although she was the 1993
world champion.
	   She does, however, have two Olympic golds in the 100-meter dash.
	   The 39-year-old Slaney, the American record-holder in four
distance events, will double in the championships, competing in the
1,500 and 5,000 meters.
	   She had a qualifying mark for the 5,000, but not for the 1,500,
in which she is the national record-holder at 3:57.12.
	   Slaney will be seeking her third national 1,500-meter title, her
first since 1983. She never has won the 5,000 in the championships.
	   With the additions of Joyner-Kersee, Devers and Slaney, the
women's competition in the championships will feature American
record-holders in 12 of 20 events. The others are Jearl Miles-Clark
(800), Amy Rudolph (5,000), Lynn Jennings (10,000), Kim Batten (400
hurdles), Michelle Rohl (10-kilometer walk), Stacy Dragila (pole
vault), Sheila Hudson (triple jump) and Amy Palmer (hammer throw).
	   ``This competition offers the public a chance to see one of the
most outstanding groups of female competitors assembled in recent
times,'' Lynn Cannon, chairman of the Women's Track and Field
Committee, said.
	   In addition, all of last year's champions declared Wednesday,
except discus thrower Lacy Barnes Mileham, but Miles-Clark, winner
of the 400 in 1997, will run in the 800 and Regina Jacobs, last
year's champion in the 1,500, chose to run the 5,000.
	   One notable absentee among the delcarations was Gwen Torrence,
the 1992 Olympic 200 champion and also among the elite in the 100
and 400. She withdrew because of injury.
	   With Michael Johnson preferring to train instead of running the
200, Bob Kennedy injured and out of the 5,000, shot putter Randy
Barnes and triple jumper Kenny Harrison not declaring and Dan
O'Brien skipping the decathlon, the men will have only nine
national record-holders in 20 events.
	   They are Butch Reynolds (400), Johnny Gray (800), Roger Kingdom
and Allan Johnson (co-record holders in the 110 hurdles), Kevin
Young (400 hurdles), Charles Austin (high jump), Jeff Hartwig (pole
vault), Lance Deal (hammer throw) and Tom Pukstys (javelin).
	   Allan Johnson will not defend his title in the 110 hurdles,
preferring to run the 200.
	   Maurice Greene, the American leader in the 100 and the 200 this
year, declared for both events. If he wins both, he would be the
first double champion since 1985, when Kirk Baptiste swept both
sprints.

Westphal succeeding Karl in Seattle AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ It's official. The Seattle SuperSonics confirmed
Wednesday they are hiring Paul Westphal to succeed fired coach
George Karl.
	   ``It feels great. I couldn't be happier,'' Westphal said during
a news conference. ``I was waiting for a great job and this is a
great job.''
	   He said his contract was for four years, but declined to
elaborate on terms. Sonics spokesmen said they could not provide
those figures. He reportedly will receive between dlrs 1 million
and dlrs 1.5 million each season.
	   Five years ago, Westphal took a Phoenix Suns team led by Charles
Barkley, Dan Majerle and Kevin Johnson to the NBA Finals.
	   Sonics management clearly hopes that Westphal, out of coaching
almost three years, can do the same for Seattle, which this season
couldn't get past the second round of the playoffs.
	   Karl, who had the best winning percentage of any coach in
Sonics' history at 71.9, was fired two weeks after Seattle was
eliminated following four consecutive losses to the Los Angeles
Lakers.
	   Wally Walker, team president and general manager, is expected to
sit down with Westphal and overhaul a team led by Gary Payton and
Vin Baker.
	   Although the Sonics were one of the NBA's elite teams during the
regular season, winning 61 games, they looked like an old team at
the end of the season and during the playoffs.
	   Nate McMillan is retiring, Sam Perkins may retire and the
futures of Greg Anthony, Dale Ellis and Jerome Kersey, all key
bench players, are unclear.
	   The Sonics won't get much help in next Wednesday's draft. They
will have the 27th selection in the first round and Nos. 32 and 33
in the second round.
	   In three-plus seasons as coach of the Suns, Westphal had a
191-88 record. He became the winningest rookie coach in NBA history
in 1992-93 when the Suns went 62-20 and reached the NBA Finals,
losing in six games to the Chicago Bulls.

Biggest Big Bertha safe for now AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The Biggest Big Bertha is safe. And that's
probably the case with all the other oversized titanium clubs
jammed into golf bags everywhere.
	   Golf's ruling body decided Wednesday to leave well enough alone
in announcing a new standard to test golf clubs that virtually
ensures the latest and hottest oversized clubs on the market today
will remain legal.
	   ``We are not uncomfortable with what we see in the market
today,'' said David Fay, executive director of the U.S. Golf
Association.
	   In a decision providing big relief to manufacturers in the dlrs
2.5 billion golf equipment industry, the USGA basically decided to
leave current golf clubs alone as it goes forward with a new
standard for testing to regulate future golf club development.
	   Clubs will eventually have to pass tests for a ``spring-like
effect'' that occurs when they deform at impact with the ball, but
Fay said he was confident ``virtually all'' of the current clubs on
the market would pass the proposed test.
	   Manufactures cheered the ruling, saying golfers had slowed their
buying of clubs since word surfaced the USGA might not approve some
of the best selling golf clubs.
	   ``We've had consumers on the sidelines,'' said Donald Dye, chief
executive officer of Callaway, which makes the Biggest Big Bertha.
``Hopefully they'll feel comfortable now going out and buying our
product.''
	   But Dye and others also warned that the USGA could be in for a
battle if its proposed new standards narrow the chances that
manufacturers can continue to come up with new clubs that appeal to
America's golfers.
	   ``The USGA still feels it needs to protect the game from the
equipment manufacturers, and I strongly disagree with that,'' Dye
said.
	   Equipment manufacturers depend on new technology for a turnover
in club sales to keep golfers buying the latest product.
	   Wally Uihlein, chief executive officer of Titleist, said his
company welcomed the decision but would also be looking closely at
any new standards.
	   ``What we're hoping is to work with the USGA to ensure the
protocol ... is believable to 25 million golfers,'' Uihlein said.
	   The USGA had indicated in the months before this week's U.S.
Open that it was concerned that technology was making the game too
easy for professionals and amateurs.
	   But Fay said Wednesday current popular clubs like the Biggest
Big Bertha and the Taylor Made Titanium 2 oversized drivers have
not dramatically altered the game at either level.

Daly leaves driver in closet for U.S. Open AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ John Daly, renowned for his mammoth shots
off the tee, is leaving one of his favorite weapons in the closet
this week.
	   Daly said Wednesday he doesn't plan to have a driver in his golf
bag for the U.S. Open, which is being played on the 6,797-yard
(6,185-meter) Lake Course at The Olympic Club _ a course considered
relatively short.
	   Even on the longer holes at Olympic, such as the 609-yard
(554-meter) 16th, Daly said a driver is not feasible. Instead,
he'll use a 2-iron on such holes.
	   ``That's the way the golf course sets up,'' he said. ``It
doesn't do me any good to have a driver.''
	   Daly said the last time he left his driver at home was during
the first two rounds of the 1993 PGA Championship at the Inverness
Country Club in Toledo, Ohio.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MOVING ON UP: &LR;  When Tom Lehman returned to The Olympic Club
course this week for the U.S. Open, it highlighted the differences
in his life since his first trip to Olympic for the U.S. Open in
1987.
	   Lehman was an assistant golf pro and had not played a
competitive round of golf all year when he arrived for the 1987
Open. And he was getting married the following weekend.
	   He arrived at the Open 11 years ago with his wife and his
brother, who was his caddie, and a close friend.
	   ``We all kind of piled in one hotel room together in the
airport, so we didn't have to spent the extra money,'' he said
Wednesday.
	   Lehman, 39, doesn't have to worry about hotel bills too much any
more. He's become one of the top players in golf, finishing third
twice and tied for second once in the past three U.S. Opens.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FEAR OF FOG: &LR;  The Olympic Club course that is playing host to
the U.S. Open has been bathed in sunshine for the past few days,
relieving fears that months of El Nino's rains would make the
course sloppy.
	   The nice weather is a welcome change for the San Francisco Bay
area, which had 110 consecutive days of measurable rainfall through
May 12.
	   But course superintendent John Fleming, who grew up in San
Francisco and understands its quirky weather, said it's never
possible to be fully confident at a course just a half-mile from
the Pacific Ocean.
	   ``If we have an impact, weatherwise, as a native son that has
lived here all my life, that impact will be from fog and not from
rain,'' Fleming said.
	   Fleming, who has been tending to The Olympic Club course since
1972, remembers times when the morning fog was so thick that people
standing a few feet apart couldn't see each other.
	   But he said such fog is not likely this week.
	   ``If there is any concern weatherwise about what could come in
here, I would think it would be fog,'' he said. ``Speaking
historically, when you get three, four, five days of nice weather
like we have had, I can't see a big, big fog problem, either.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TIGER'S DOUBTERS: &LR;  While Colin Montgomerie was given the most
votes as favorite to win the U.S. Open in an informal survey of
reporters covering the tournament, only one predicted Tiger Woods
would be the winner.
	   That falls in line with the predictions of several of Woods'
peers, including Ernie Els, who have said The Olympic Club course
is not suited to Woods' talents.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  Scotland's Colin Montgomerie was asked about
differences between European and American golfers. ``We have
different accents,'' Montgomerie joked, explaining he did not think
there were any basic differences on the golf course. ... Though
nearby Stanford will get lots of attention at this U.S. Open
because of alums Tiger Woods and Casey Martin, three schools _
Oklahoma State, Texas and Wake Forest _ have six alums apiece
playing in the tournament.

U.N. secretary-general says Turkish demand blocks Cyprus talks 
</HEADLINE>
By ALEX EFTY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Demands by the breakaway government in
northern Cyprus have blocked a resumption of talks on the island's
reunification, the U.N. secretary-general said Wednesday.
	   In a report to the Security Council, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, has called
``for a new approach based on the `acknowledgment of the existence
of two fully functioning democratic states on the island.'''
	   Annan said that President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot
leader, ``reiterated his readiness to resume direct talks.''
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in the north has
been branded illegal by the Security Council and is only recognized
by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The report, which was dated Tuesday and released Wednesday,
coincided with mounting tension following a 24-hour visit by Greek
warplanes to an airbase in the south and a visit by Turkish
warships taking part in a naval exercise to ports in the north.
	   The United Nations has urged a settlement that will reunify the
island in a two-zone federation.
	   But Denktash, backed by the Turkish government, has refused to
return to the negotiating table unless his breakaway state is
recognized and the European Union breaks off membership
negotiations with the Clerides government.

Australian, New Zealand dollars soar on back of U.S. intervention 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY (AP) _ The Australian and New Zealand currencies soared
more than two cents each against the U.S. dollar early Thursday
after rounds of joint intervention by the United States and Japan
to support the yen.
	   At 7:45 a.m. (2145 GMT Wednesday), the Australian dollar was
trading at 61.42 U.S. cents, well up from 59.25 U.S. cents late in
Sydney on Wednesday. It also was at 83.76 yen, below 84.92 yen
Wednesday.
	   The New Zealand dollar jumped to 52.35 U.S. cents in early local
trading, up from 49.78 U.S. cents at the close of local trading
Wednesday.
	   However, shortly after 8:00 a.m. (1800 GMT Wednesday), the kiwi
had fallen back to 51.77 U.S. cents.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve, on behalf of the Bank of Japan and the
U.S. Treasury, entered the market early in the New York session to
sell U.S. dollars, driving the U.S. currency down from near 142.30
yen just ahead of the intervention to a 136.05 yen overnight low.
	   In New Zealand, Bancorp economist Stuart Marshall said the rise
in the local currency was sustainable only as long as the United
States was prepared to intervene.
	   ``It's not sustainable at all,'' he said of the kiwi's rise.

</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW with Wednesday's early games; will be updated
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ John Jaha's three-run homer in the seventh inning
Wednesday gave the Milwaukee Brewers a 6-5 victory over the Chicago
Cubs, who couldn't win despite another home run from Sammy Sosa and
a pair of two-run shots by Jose Hernandez.
	   Sosa's homer across Waveland Avenue in the fourth inning was his
16th homer in 18 games and 25th this year. That ties him for second
in the National League with Atlanta's Andres Galarraga. Mark
McGwire of St. Louis leads the majors with 31.
	   Bronswell Patrick (2-0), relieved in the second inning after
starter Scott Karl strained his groin, and gave up two hits and
three runs in 4 2-3 innings for his second career victory. Bob
Wickman got the final four outs for his fifth save.
	   Kevin Tapani (8-5) gave up 10 hits and six runs in seven innings
for the loss.
 &UR; Giants 6, Rockies 3
	   In San Francisco, Kirk Rueter pitched six strong innings and
Rich Aurilia hit a tie-breaking two-run homer in the sixth as the
Giants rallied to beat the Colorado Rockies 6-3.
	   Darryl Kile (5-10), an offseason free-agent acquisition after a
19-victory campaign for Houston, lost his seventh straight game,
one shy of his career long.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Trinidad and Tobago sprinter Ato Boldon
fell short of a world record in the 100-meter race, but posted the
best time of the year in the 200-meter race Wednesday at the
Tsiklitira International Track Meet in Athens.
	   In the 100 meters, Boldon raced through a headwind and crossed
the line in 9.86 seconds, ahead of Namibia's Frank Fredericks. The
winner matched the year's best time, which he posted in April. In
the 1996 Olympics Fredericks won the silver medal and Boldon the
bronze.
	   But Boldon fell short of Canadian Donovan Bailey's world record
of 9.84 seconds.
	   ``I came here to get the world record,'' Boldon said after the
race. ``I ran faster than Ben Johnson did on steroids. This wasn't
a great race ... the wind just didn't cooperate.''
	   Boldon's 19.88-second finish in the 200 meters was the best of
the year.
	   Fiona May of Italy won the women's long jump with a leap of 7.03
meters, beating Germany's Heike Dreschler, who finished second with
6.95 meters.
	   In other events, 1500-meter world record holder Noureddine
Morceli of Algeria finished first in 3:34.44, well behind his
world-record time of 3:27.37.
	   Jean Galfione of France won the pole vault with a 5.97-meter
leap, setting a French record. Ukrainian pole vaulter and
world-record holder Sergey Bubka disappointed the more than 40,000
spectators with his flat fourth-place finish of 5.72 meters.
	   Britain's Colin Jackson won the 110-meter hurdles in 13.15
seconds.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in
Kosovo on Wednesday dismissed President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge
to negotiate, saying his powerful forces must halt all actions and
leave the separatist province before any talks can start. Fehmi
Agani, head of the four-man Kosovo Albanian team named to negotiate
with the Serbs, spoke after Milosevic promised Russian President
Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to reopen talks with the moderate leader of
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, Ibrahim Rugova. ``The problem is
not whether there will be any talks with the Albanians, but the
conditions in which talks should be held,'' Agani said. Meanwhile,
fierce fighting in the embattled province continued, with at least
12 new deaths reported on both sides by Serb and Albanian sources.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO).
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Hundreds of Eritreans rounded up for
deportation by the Ethiopian government reached their homeland
Wednesday at the end of an arduous, dusty three-day trip aboard
packed buses, Eritrean officials said. ``The Ethiopian government
continues to pursue its witch-hunt of Eritreans with greater
intensity,'' the government said. Eritreans said 800 were expelled,
while Ethiopians put the figure at 500. About 550,000 Eritreans
live in Ethiopia, mostly in the capital and the northern provinces.
The deportations were the latest salvo fired in the nearly
6-week-old border conflict, but no fighting was reported Wednesday.
A delegation of African leaders was scheduled to meet Thursday with
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and with Eritrean President
Isaias Afwerki in a bid to prevent the clashes that broke out May 6
from escalating into full-scale war in the Horn of Africa.
(ERITREA-ETHIOPIA).
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The former commander of Croatia's
largest concentration camp during World War II was extradited
Wednesday, bound for his homeland to face accusations of wartime
atrocities. Flanked by Croatian police, Dinko Sakic smiled as he
boarded a commercial flight for Frankfurt, Germany. Argentine
authorities said that would be his first stop before changing
planes for Zagreb, Croatia. In Croatia, Sakic faces investigation
for crimes allegedly committed while he commanded the Jasenovac
concentration camp in the early 1940s, when the country was under
the pro-Nazi Ustasha regime. Thousands of Serbians, Jews and
Gypsies died at Jasenovac, the concentration camp known as the
``Auschwitz of the Balkans,'' but exact numbers remain in dispute.
Croatian president Franjo Tudjman has put the death toll at 35,000,
the U.S. Justice Department at 125,000; and camp survivors, at up
to 500,000. (ARGENTINA-WAR CRIMES).
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
appointed a staff to begin work on a national referendum on a U.S.
package proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from West Bank
land, a report said Wednesday. Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan said
the report on Israel's Channel 2 TV sounded ``very likely.''
Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States to respond to a
proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
The U.S. plan, which has not been made public, also calls for the
Palestinians to crackdown on terrorism and includes a reported
freeze in Israeli construction of Jewish settlements. The plan,
first introduced in January, has been accepted by the
Palestinians.Palestinians have called the referendum a stalling
tactic by Israel. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   TANAF, Senegal (AP) _ Rebels in Guinea-Bissau were on the
retreat Wednesday after 11 days of fighting that sent thousands
fleeing and left the capital nearly deserted, Guinea-Bissau and
Senegalese officials said. Guinea-Bissau's foreign minister,
Fernando Delfim da Silva, told The Associated Press in Lisbon that
loyalist soldiers had forced renegade troops to retreat three
kilometers (two miles) from an army garrison to the airport just
outside the capital of Bissau on Tuesday. The rebellion began at
the garrison on June 7. Da Silva said he was told about the retreat
in a phone call with Guinea-Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
The report could not be immediately confirmed. The rebels, however,
insisted on Portuguese state radio Antenna I that they were ready
to hold peace talks, but only within the army garrison. The
statement appeared to contradict government claims that the
garrison had been captured. (GUINEA-BISSAU).

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The stock market came roaring back Wednesday
after the United States and Japan staged a coordinated intervention
to boost the failing yen and Japanese economy, and markets rallied
throughout Asia following a two-day pounding. According to
preliminary figures, the Dow Jones industrial average closed up
164.17 at 8,829.46. Broad-market indicators also surged at the
open, especially technology shares, which had also taken a beating
in recent sessions. The bargain-hunting that sparked Tuesday's
advance picked up momentum Wednesday after stocks in Hong Kong,
Seoul, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta posted big gains amid
speculation that Washington would try to prop up the Japanese yen.
Then, shortly before the open of U.S. stock trading, the Federal
Reserve sold dollars to support Japan's currency for the first time
since 1992. The yen, which recently hit an 8-year low against the
dollar, immediately rallied. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three months after firing him, President Boris
Yeltsin brought Russia's most disliked reformer back into the
government Wednesday in an effort to save the country's flailing
economy. Anatoly Chubais, who has now been fired and rehired by
Yeltsin twice, was named deputy prime minister and placed in charge
of relations with international lending organizations. The
appointment coincided with an announcement confirming what the
markets have suspected for weeks _ that Russia is seeking a new
bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund. Chubais's new
job will make him Russia's point man with the IMF and other Western
aid agencies, who laud his efforts to privatize state companies and
reform the still shaky economy. But the same actions have made him
one of the country's most widely reviled politicians.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's financial secretary said Wednesday
the government's earlier economic growth forecast for the next few
years is not attainable as the region's economic troubles show no
signs of abating. ``Because of the economic downturn, and because
of the performance, for instance, in the fast quarter of this year,
I believe it will be unlikely that we will be able to sustain
growth of 5 percent in real terms in the coming few years,'' Donald
Tsang told reporters. The economy shrank 2 percent in the first
quarter this year, the first contraction in 14 years. Officials
have hinted the economy may shrink further in the coming months.
Tsang had said earlier that the forecast annual economic growth of
3.5 percent is unlikely, and he would revise the forecast before
the fourth quarter. Hong Kong has weathered Asia's financial
turmoil better than most countries, but has been suffering from
high interest rates and slumping property and share prices.
(HONGKONG-ECONOMY)
	   DETROIT (AP) _ A top General Motors Corp. executive warned
Wednesday that the United Auto Workers' debilitating strikes at two
Michigan parts plants may cause it to reassess some planned
investments in the United States. Donald C. Hackworth, vice
president of GM's North American Car Group, said the strikes in
Flint were having ``a far-reaching effect on our ability to
compete'' and becoming a drain on GM's cash reserves. As talks
continued, Hackworth said the company was willing to begin
round-the-clock negotiations with the UAW to end the strikes, which
by Wednesday had halted about 80 percent of GM's North American
production. Union leaders have offered previously to negotiate
nonstop. (US-GM-STRIKES)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's fragile currency plunged
more than 9 percent Wednesday, jeopardizing efforts by the
International Monetary Fund to haul the Southeast Asian nation's
shattered economy out of a yearlong crisis. The drop came as a big
blow to the government of President B.J. Habibie, who has pushed an
agenda of democratic reform since the ouster last month of the
authoritarian leader Suharto. A drastic weakening of the currency
could also worsen rising inflation and mass unemployment, problems
that helped spark riots and protests leading to Suharto's downfall
after 32 years in power. Some shopkeepers in Jakarta, the
Indonesian capital, shuttered their stores, fearing that the
rupiah's fall could spur more price increases and ensuing street
violence. The Indonesian currency closed in Jakarta trading at
16,700 rupiah against the U.S. dollar, down from 15,150 rupiah the
previous day. ( INDONESIA-CURRENCY)

<TEXT>
	   SANTA MONICA, California (AP) _ A man convicted of stalking
Steven Spielberg was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison
Wednesday after the director told the judge he feared for his life.
	   ``If he's out on the street, I will live in fear,'' Spielberg
said of 31-year-old Jonathan Norman, convicted in March of plotting
to invade Spielberg's mansion, hold him and his family hostage and
rape the director.
	   ``Had Jonathan Norman actually confronted me, I genuinely in my
heart of hearts believe that I would have been raped or maimed or
killed,'' Spielberg said.
	   Superior Court Judge Steven Suzukawa agreed that Norman is
``obsessive and frightening, and I think he does present a danger
to society.''
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A little more than a year after becoming a daddy
for the first time, 78-year-old Tony Randall is a father again.
	   Randall and his 28-year-old wife, Heather, welcomed 7-pound,
2-ounce (3.2-kilo) Jefferson Salvini Randall into the world on
Monday.
	   The boy was named after two performers of the late 1800s _ comic
actor Joseph Jefferson and Italian tragic actor Tommasso Salvini.
	   Randall, finicky Felix Unger from TV's ``The Odd Couple,''
married in 1995. The couple also have a 14-month-old daughter,
Julia Laurette.
	   ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ Alec Baldwin is being called on to fill the shoes
of former Beatle Ringo Starr, but not as a drummer.
	   The ``Hunt for Red October'' star will narrate and provide the
voice of a friendly train engine in the children's TV series
``Thomas the Tank and Friends.''
	   The series is returning to British airwaves after a four-year
absence. Starr previously narrated and provided the voice of
Thomas.
	   ___
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jimmy Carter was born too late to be
immortalized on Mount Rushmore, but the former American president's
image will soon be chiseled into a cliff in Israel's Negev Desert.
	   The Nakash brothers, owners of the Jordache jeans company, plan
to erect a monument to the signers of the 1979 peace agreement
between Israel and Egypt _ Carter, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat.
	   The sculptures will be on a somewhat smaller scale than the
giant busts carved into the Black Hills of South Dakota, said Avda
Lloyd, spokeswoman of the Ramat Hanegev regionl council. Lloyd said
the actual dimensions have not yet been determined.
	   Avi Nakash said a dlrs 10 million park will be built around the
monument near the grave of former Israeli Prime Minister David Ben
Gurion in the Sde Boker kibbutz. Carter and the families of Begin
and Sadat _ both men were slain by opponents of the peace process _
will attend the cornerstone-laying ceremony in October, Nakash
said.
	   ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British court rejected a sexual-discrimination
lawsuit Wednesday by a male model who sued a college for giving
women preference as nude models for its art classes.
	   George Bond, 54, cited as evidence the 68 hours _ out of a
possible 1,260 _ that he had been employed by Northampton College,
northwest of London.
	   The college denied all claims of sexism and said Bond was
difficult to work with and unreliable. According to one instructor,
Bond was ``always moaning, complaining about the cold and going to
the toilet.''
	   College officials also said they were not comfortable employing
Bond because he had appeared in a pornographic film and in a
documentary about the making of a sex film.
	   Bond said he is deciding where to go from here. He said he may
``just get a normal job to pay the bills.''

Dollar sharply lower in Tokyo, stocks rise 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was sharply lower against the yen
early Thursday in Tokyo, one day after U.S. intervention in
currency markets sent the Japanese currency soaring. Tokyo stock
prices rose.
	   The dollar bought 135.72 yen in early trading, down 6.28 yen
from 142.00 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 136.37 yen overnight.
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it had
sold dollars to support the yen, which on Monday slid to an 8-year
low against the U.S. currency amid worries that Japan's economic
woes are worsening.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 109.79 points, or 0.75 percent, to 14,825.17 points in the
first few minutes of trading. On Wednesday, the Nikkei average lost
5.00 points, or 0.03 percent.
	   On Wall Street, U.S. stocks soared after the intervention on
what investors saw as a hopeful sign that authorities were acting
to keep the Asian financial crisis from worsening.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed 162.67 points higher at
8,827.96, nearly wiping out the rest of Monday's 207-point slide.
The famed barometer of 30 major companies rose 37 points on
Tuesday.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto welcomed the U.S.
intervention, saying his government would accelerate efforts to
revive Japan's economy, the world's second biggest.
	   Japan has been sharply criticized by other nations and
international officials for not taking aggressive steps to prevent
a recession. Japan's fortunes dominate the struggling Asian economy
and are a vital link in the global economy.
	   The cheaper yen was widely seen as threatening the recovery of
crisis-hit Asian economies by undercutting their products in world
markets.
	   The dollar had climbed 15 yen against the Japanese currency
since the end of April, including 6 yen in the four trading days up
to Monday, when it soared to an eight-year high above 146 yen.
	   It had edged down to 142 yen in late Tokyo trading Wednesday as
the market grew wary about possible intervention by monetary
authorities.
	   Initial reaction elsewhere in Asia to the intervention was
positive. Hong Kong leader Tung Chee Hwa said Thursday in
Wellington, New Zealand that he was glad to see the yen had
rebounded. He added the key issue for the world economy was for
Japan ``to move forward.''
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 9.18 points, or 0.79 percent, to 1,166.02. The
TOPIX closed up a marginal 0.37 points the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 192 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.305 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.240 percent, driving its price down to 111.21 yen from 111.70
yen.

Mitchell sworn in as prime minister of St. Vincent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Prime Minister Sir James Mitchell
was sworn in for a fourth term Wednesday over protests by the
opposition that his re-election was rigged.
	   ``I would like to thank Almighty God and the people of St.
Vincent and the Grenadines for giving me and my party a new
mandate,'' said Mitchell, who has led the country's government for
14 years.
	   He was sworn in by Governor General Sir Charles Antrobus, Queen
Elizabeth II's representative in this former British colony.
	   The opposition Unity Labor Party won 27,506 votes in Monday's
parliamentary election to the 23,219 garnered by Mitchell's New
Democratic Party, but the Democrats kept a 8-7 majority in
Parliament by winning more districts.
	   Labor Party leader Vincent Beache accused Mitchell's party of
``fraud, bribery and intimidation.'' On Wednesday he demanded new
elections in six months.
	   Mitchell denies any fraud.

Report: Unidentified body may belong to killer of Guatemalan bishop 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Prosecutors believe an unidentified body
found in Guatemala City late last month could be that of a suspect
in the April murder of a bishop, media reported Wednesday.
	   Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi Conedera was bludgeoned to
death in the garage of his home two days after presenting a report
blaming the army for most of the killings during Guatemala's
36-year civil war. Police have not said whether they believe the
killing was political.
	   Prosecutors said they think the mutilated body, found May 30, is
linked to the Gerardi Conedera case because of the way in which the
unidentified man was killed, the newspaper Prensa Libre reported.
	   However, the prosecutor cited in that report, Otto Ardon Medina,
did not elaborate on those links or how the man died.
	   The body was buried in a common paupers' grave, and Ardon Medina
reportedly wants to exhume it for DNA testing.
	   Prosecutors have cleared one man of involvement in the bishop's
killing but another suspect remains in custody.
	   That man, Carlos Enrique Vielman, 24, was arrested in April in
connection with Gerardi's death but has not been formally charged.
Vielman has said he is innocent.

Argentine president to visit Britain in October 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's president will visit
Britain for six days starting on Oct. 27, the Foreign Ministry said
Wednesday.
	   President Carlos Menem will be the first Argentine head of state
to visit Britain since the two countries went to war over the
Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic in 1982.
	   Menem will meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair and Queen
Elizabeth II.
	   Foreign ministry officials said that London approved the visit
on condition that Menem would not raise the issue of sovereignty
over the islands, which Argentines call the Malvinas.
	   But Menem and Blair will discuss fishing and oil exploration
rights in the waters surrounding the islands, Foreign Minister
Guido Di Tella said.
	   Argentina, which claims the islands as an inheritance from the
Spanish crown, tried to recover them by force but was defeated
after a 74-day war in which nearly 1,000 servicemen, most of them
Argentine, died.

Off-field dramas overshadow soccer AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Somehow the soccer seems just a sideshow.
	   The World Cup rumbles on with so much going on off the field _
ticket fraud arrests, violent fans in court, the threat of
political demonstrations, quarrels between players and one even
kicked off the squad.
	   Oh, and Austria tied 1-1 with Chile and Italy downed Cameroon
3-0.
	   With his team almost certainly tumbling out of the World Cup,
Austrian substitute Ivica Vastic fired an injury-time leveller
against Chile after Marcelo Salas had netted his third of the
championship.
	   Christian Vieri tied Salas atop the scorers list with two late
strikes after Luigi Di Biagio headed the first as the Italians went
to the top of Group B. They also welcomed back Alessandro Del Piero
after a month-long absence through injury.
	   Thursday's games were host France against Saudi Arabia at
Saint-Denis and Denmark against South Africa in Toulouse. Wins for
France and Denmark would put both in the second round and put the
Saudis and debutant South Africans out.
	   Before Wednesday's games kicked off, police sources announced
the first arrests in an international scandal that left thousands
of fans without paid-for World Cup tickets.
	   French authorities arrested three people, including a consultant
for a subsidiary of FIFA's exclusive marketing partner, ISL Ltd. A
large amount of cash and about 100 Cup tickets were found, the
sources said, and more arrests were expected.
	   The fallout continued from the fan violence involving England
and Tunisian fans in Marseille three days ago.
	   More than 100 people remained jailed, some having received jail
sentences of at least two months and others kept behind bars until
the World Cup ends July 12.
	   The political significance of Sunday's United States-Iran game
at Lyon now has two angles.
	   The Iranian government remains upset with the broadcast of a
U.S. film, ``Not Without My Daughter,'' which paints an
unflattering picture of Islamic Iran. It considered pulling Iran
from the championship but then decided against it.
	   Then it was the turn of Iranian exile groups to threaten
demonstrations against the Tehran government at Sunday's game.
	   The Patrick Kluivert-Lorenzo Staelens dispute, which started
with the Dutchman's expulsion from the Netherlands-Belgium game,
took a new twist.
	   Kluivert, sent off for elbowing the Belgian defender in the
chest, reportedly explained their exchange of words during the 0-0
tie at Saint-Denis.
	   ``Staelens called me a rapist,'' Kluivert told the Algemeen
Dagblad for Wednesday's edition. ``... I heard this I could no
longer control myself.''
	   Kluivert was accused, but never charged, last June in a case
involving an alleged gang rape in Amsterdam.
	   While Kluivert was serving a two-match suspension for his
expulsion, Colombia's Faustino Asprilla would take no further part
in the championship after a row with his own coach.
	   The feisty forward was upset at being substituted in Monday's
1-0 loss to Romania, voiced his dismay on the radio and was told by
coach Hernan Dario Gomez not to come back.
	   Comebacks is the name of the game for Austria.
	   For the second game in a row, the Austrians scored an injury
time leveller for a 1-1 tie. Against Cameroon it was Tony Polster,
this time it was Vastic.
	   Midfielder Heimo Pfeifenberger admitted his team was ``lucky ...
to get another point.''
	   ``Now we have to win against Italy,'' he said.
	   The Chileans, who were unlucky to concede a late Roberto Baggio
penalty after leading 2-1, were sickened by another late equalizer.
	   ``I do not know what to say, why we have to suffer through
things like this,'' said Chilean coach Nelson Acosta.
	   ``We really should have six points, but there are only two,''
striker Ivan Zamorano said. ``We are disappointed over the late
tie, but we now have to concentrate on Cameroon. We will give our
all and show everyone that we are great fighters.''
	   At Montpellier, Del Piero entered the field as a second half
substitute for Roberto Baggio with his team already in front
through Di Biagio's eighth minute header.
	   The Juventus star then saw Vieri add two more in the last 15
minutes as Italy became the first Group B team to win a game and go
top of the standings.
	   ``Everything went well, and we showed we have top strikers,''
Italian coach Cesare Maldini said. ``It was a win for the whole
team.''
	   Cameroon lost Raymond Kalla Nkongo for a controversial red card
for a cleats-first, two-footed slide into Di Biagio for the fourth
expulsion of the World Cup in the 20th game.
	   ``We had a very bad start tonight,'' coach Claude Leroy said.
``We tried to play well, but we didn't have many opportunities
having only 10 players on the pitch.''

World Cup: unlikely homeless shelter unites Belgians, Mexicans 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Even in the dlrs 200 billion world of soccer
business, there is still some sentiment and global brotherhood to
be had for a mere dlrs 100,000.
	   Belgium plays Mexico in a crucial Group E qualifier Saturday,
but high in the mountains above Mexico City there might well be
some split loyalties at the Casa Hogar of Toluca.
	   Casa Hogar is a homeless shelter where some 30 Mexican children
are raised on funds from the Belgian soccer federation, all the
result of an unlikely performance of the Red Devils at the 1986
World Cup in Mexico.
	   ``It is our most beautiful accomplishment,'' said Belgian
federation head Michel D'Hooghe.
	   The ``Diablos Rojos,'' as they were known in Mexico, arrived for
the 1986 World Cup as virtual unknowns and settled in dusty,
unfashionable Toluca not knowing what would be in store.
	   After losing to the host nation 2-1 in their opener, they might
as well have been packing, but still they scraped through as a
lucky loser in their group.
	   From then on, from their base in Toluca, they started a magical
ride.
	   Against all odds, they upset the Soviet Union 4-3 in the second
round, before facing even tougher opposition in the quarterfinal _
Spain.
	   Players like Jan Ceulemans and Eric Gerets were at their prime
and youngsters like Enzo Scifo were at the starts of their career.
Belgium came through in a penalty shootout.
	   Eventual champion Argentina, with Maradona excelling, was too
tough in a 2-0 semifinal loss, but by that time enough wonders had
already taken place.
	   The Belgians' happy demeanor in Toluca stood in sharp contrast
with the many miserable streets.
	   ``We were walking there with Ceulemans and Gerets and suddenly
we said, `Why not do something?' '' D'Hooghe said. ``There was this
benign grace about the whole situation.''
	   The idea of the Casa Hogar shelter was born. Over the past dozen
years, over 200 kids have come through the center, some orphans,
many from broken families. Some children have gone on to
university, others became skilled laborers. Mexico's FIFA
vice-president, Guillermo Canedo, who died two years ago, was
honorary president of the Casa.
	   The crop of players from 1986 have continued to support the
cause. In 1989, they came back to Toluca for a benefit match,
collecting funds to build a new center.
	   Every year in Belgium, benefit events led by the players
continue to amass some dlrs 100,000 a year to keep the center
going.
	   Earlier this month, Belgian Prince Philip went to Toluca to open
a new library at the center. At least once a year, D'Hooghe travels
there to see how the center is going.
	   ``We're doing all this out of gratitude for what happened in
1986,'' said D'Hooghe.
	   For 90 minutes on Saturday, it will be all business on the
Bordeaux pitch, with Belgium seeking a win against Mexico to keep
its chances of yet another roll through the World Cup alive.

Chinese upbeat for Clinton visit, but tired of being bashed in U.S. 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a city where American music fills the
airwaves, McDonald's is in nearly every neighborhood and Michael
Jordan and the Chicago Bulls are icons, the Chinese don't need a
visit from President Bill Clinton for a glimpse of the United
States.
	   Instead, many hope Clinton and his entourage of more than 1,000
U.S. government officials and reporters will get an updated picture
of life in China when they visit next week.
	   The mood is mostly upbeat. Chinese are enthusiastic about things
American and want to see the summit strengthen ties. But many also
are annoyed with what they see as excessive American criticism of
China _ particularly of China's human rights record.
	   ``I hear there are American groups who are hostile to China and
who don't understand China in the least,'' said Wei Song, a young
man with longish hair and a slightly torn T-shirt browsing through
history books in the Sanlian Bookstore, a three-story megastore
with best sellers by the front door and a coffee shop upstairs.
	   ``This country is changing so fast that it's different every
year,'' Wei said. ``Compared with 20 years ago, you can't believe
it's the same world.''
	   Certainly, Chinese know much more about the United States than
ever before.
	   Big, diverse bookstores like Sanlian sell translated American
science and fashion magazines, as well as manuals for raising
children the American way and surfing the Internet.
	   By the staid standards of the state-controlled media, the summit
is getting a lot of attention. Newspapers are running features on
searches for downed World War II U.S. aircraft _ to highlight
previous cooperation with the United States _ as well as reports on
criticisms in Congress of Clinton's trip.
	   ``Titanic'' is all the rage in movie theaters. Televisions,
found in nearly every home and offering American fare, broadcast
live coverage of the National Basketball Association's finals to
cater to Chinese sports fanatics.
	   A recent survey by a company under the State Statistics Bureau
named the Bulls' Jordan as the second-most widely known American in
China after Thomas Edison, scoring a 69.3 percent recognition rate.
	   That's only slightly less than the 76 percent of the 1,000
people sampled in the same nationwide survey who said they knew of
Clinton's upcoming visit. Of those, 85 percent thought the visit,
the first by a U.S. president in nine years, would help improve
relations. No margin of error was available.
	   But while many Chinese feel at ease with the parts of American
culture they have chosen to love, they don't feel cross-cultural
understanding works both ways.
	   ``A lot of Americans are prejudiced against China,'' said Xue
Mouhong, a professor of international relations at prestigious
Qinghua University, who grew up attending an American missionary
school before the Communist victory in 1949 and recently was a
researcher at Harvard University.
	   ``But I'm optimistic,'' Xue said. ``As China becomes stronger
and stronger, the United States will pay more and more attention to
understanding China and accommodating China.''
	   Others argue that U.S. condemnation of Beijing since the
military's violent crackdown on 1989 pro-democracy protests has
been counterproductive.
	   Meanwhile, a human rights group claimed Wednesday that Beijing
police had been ordered to stop out-of-town dissidents from
visiting the Chinese capital ahead of Clinton's visit.
	   Word of the ban came from Mou Chuanheng, a democracy activist
from northeastern China, who traveled to Beijing to visit a friend
only to be detained and sent home, the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Yu Zhihong, a Ministry of Public Security spokeswoman, denied
that police had issued such warnings.
	   China's state-run news media have been portraying the summit as
a chance for two world leaders to sit down as equals and discuss
such pressing problems as the Asian financial crisis and Pakistan
and India's nuclear tests.
	   On Wednesday, China announced stricter regulations to control
exports of nuclear technology, an action that appeared to be an
attempt to blunt U.S. criticism of suspected Chinese technology
transfers to such countries as Pakistan and Iran.
	   The summit particularly is being used to show President Jiang
Zemin as statesman. The official view is that Jiang deserves credit
for improving U.S. ties because he visited the United States.
	   China Central Television on Friday will broadcast a new
documentary, ``Crossing the Pacific,'' about the Chinese president
and Communist Party leader's trip to the United States last fall.
	   Also timed to showcase the importance of the summit is the
publication of a photo album about Jiang's trip, due in bookstores
Saturday, less than a week before Clinton arrives.

Cha Bum-kun: South Korea will yet get first World Cup win 
</HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT QUENTIN, France (AP) _ Even though the tough opponents are
yet to come, coach Cha Bum-kun remains confident that South Korea
will get its first-ever World Cup victory at France '98.
	   Despite Saturday's 3-1 loss to Mexico _ the other Group E team
not expected to advance to the second round _ and despite the fact
the team must now face the powerful Dutch on Saturday and the tough
Belgians five days later, Cha is keeping a courageous front.
	   ``We'll get our first victory,'' said Cha, who played for South
Korea at the World Cup finals in 1986 in Mexico, one of the
country's four previous winless Cup appearances. ``Everyone thinks
we have the weakest odds of advancing to the second round, and we
aimed everything on winning against Mexico.
	   ``But now we are doubly determined as our chances of qualifying
depend entirely on our next matches. We still have our chances to
win a game, and we will.''
	   And Cha is willing to push whatever buttons necessary to get his
players to succeed.
	   ``For many players this is their last World Cup tournament,''
Cha said. ``And I will use that to drive them to go all out.
	   ``For the young players, who are all fired up and feel like it
is a dream just to be here, I remind them of the dream to win South
Korea's first World Cup match before hosting the 2002 World Cup''
with Japan.
	   But, to do so, South Korea will have to overcome its
apprehension of European teams, a stumbling block in the past.
	   Cha had earlier indicated that his team's chances against the
Netherlands were slim that Belgium, though ranked lower than Mexico
in the FIFA rankings, was a European team, and therefore dangerous.
	   ``The odds of winning against the Netherlands are very low and
Belgium is still a European team so we'll have to be cautious,''
Cha said last week. ``Asian football has not shown its strength
against a European team.''
	   Only Seo Jung-won, who signed up with the French club Strasburg
four months ago to become the first South Korean to play in France,
seems to feel that facing a European team should not be a problem.
	   ``I don't think South Korean players are inferior to
Europeans,'' said Seo, who has just recovered from the chicken pox
he contracted from his son a week before the World Cup. ``Anything
can happen if we go onto the field with the right attitude.''

World Cup: Late Vastic strike earns Austria another 1-1 tie 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Another late, late strike and
Austrian hopes of making it past the first World Cup round remain
alive.
	   An injury-time goal by Ivica Vastic allowed them to notch a 1-1
draw against favored Chile Wednesday. Just like Tony Polster's
equalizer at about the same time gained a tie with Cameroon a week
ago
	   Vastic, a substitute who has not seen play this or any World
Cup, curled a right-footed shot past Chilean goal keeper Nelson
Tapia.
	   With two draws behind them in Group B, Chile and Austria are
even with two points each. Italy went top of the group by scoring a
3-0 victory over Cameroon but could still go out if Austria and
Chile both win their remaining games.
	   Austria, which shares outsider status with Cameroon in the
group, was predictably happy with the results. Not so Chile.
	   ``I do not know what to say, why we have to suffer through
things like this,'' said Chilean coach Nelson Acosta.
	   His team looked to win against Italy June 11 until the Italians
equalized 2-2 with a controversial penalty shot. ``I do not know
what happened, can't explain it,'' he said.
	   ``Austria played exactly as we expected. We handled the match
well, although we lacked a bit of mobility, especially in the first
half.''
	   Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska said he was happy with his
squad's defense. ``Offensively we lacked cohesion, we lacked
spontaneity as far as passing is concerned,'' he said.
	   Midfielder Heimo Pfeifenberger said his team was ``lucky ... to
get another point.''
	   ``Now we have to win against Italy,'' he said.
	   Marcelo Salas notched Chile's goal with 20 minutes to go. With
his two earlier against Italy, it made him the tournament's top
scorer.
	   But he would have been happy to trade that honor for victory
Wednesday.
	   ``Being top scorer is not the most important,'' he said. ``I
would rather have won today.''
	   His strike partner, Ivan Zamorano, said luck was not on Chile's
side.
	   ``We really should have six points, but there are only two,'' he
said. ``We are disappointed over the late tie, but we now have to
concentrate on Cameroon. We will give our all and show everyone
that we are great fighters.''
	   The Chilean defense and midfield ruled the pitch for much of the
first half. Austria's first chance came in the 42nd minute, when
Nelson Tapia dived to hold the ball at the foot of the post from an
angled cross from Heimo Pfeifenberger.
	   Chile should have gone ahead in the 53rd minute when midfielder
Moises Villarroel made the overlap on the right and ran clear of
the Austrian defense.
	   But he made the wrong move, firing at the near post instead of
the far post, and his shot appeared to be going wide anyway before
keeper Michael Konsel blocked it with his left hand.
	   There was an even better chance in the 62nd when Salas got clear
down the right and Ivan Zamorano was unmarked in the center. Salas
aimed for his strike-partner but his cross was far too close to
Konsel who gathered easily, leaving Zamorano frustrated.
	   The Chileans finally got it right in the 70th minute but only
just.
	   Egyptian referee Gamal Ghandour awarded them a free kick just
outside the area wide on the left, Zamorano climbed to head
goalwards and Konsel half stopped it.
	   Salas forced the rebound goalwards from six meters out and the
Austrian keeper was convinced he had got back to stop the ball
rolling over the line.
	   Ghandour didn't agree and Chile led 1-0 with 20 minutes to go.
	   Three minutes from the end, Zamorano nearly made it 2-0 when he
collected a forward pass and charged clear. His low shot was headed
just inside the post but Konsel got down to finger-tip the ball
round the post.

Hundreds of Eritreans deported from Ethiopia

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea's government strongly condemned
the deportation of hundreds of Eritreans from Ethiopia, the latest
salvo fired in the Horn of Africa countries' nearly 6-week-old
border conflict.
	   Hundreds of Eritreans have been deported from Ethiopia, arriving
in their homeland on Wednesday after an arduous three-day trip
aboard packed buses.
	   ``The Ethiopian government continues to pursue its witch-hunt of
Eritreans with greater intensity,'' Eritrea said Wednesday.
	   No new fighting was reported.
	   A delegation of African leaders was scheduled to meet Thursday
with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and with Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki in a bid to prevent the clashes that broke
out May 6 from escalating into full-scale war.
	   Thirsty and hungry, the deported Eritreans arrived in the border
town of Om Hajer, 190 miles (310 kilometers) southwest of Asmara
and near the Sudanese border, said presidential adviser Yemane
Gebremeskel.
	   Eritreans said 800 were expelled, while Ethiopians put the
figure at 500. About 550,000 Eritreans live in Ethiopia, mostly in
the capital and the northern provinces.
	   The Ethiopian government said the deportees posed security risks
because they had military training or were raising funds for the
Eritrean war effort.
	   Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of expelling thousands of its
citizens, a charged denied by Eritrea.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
rebels overthrow a 17-year military regime in July 1991. Eritrea
gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

``Surfer Dude'' Hejduk to start for U.S. against Iran AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ Surfer Dude will be in the
starting lineup when the United States plays Iran on Sunday.
	   Frankie Hejduk, the guy who does the Bob Marley reggae dance
when he scores, was the only American who came close to putting the
ball in the net during Monday's 2-0 loss to Germany.
	   Hejduk, talking about his role and his past, clearly is
different from his teammates.
	   ``I wanted to be a pro surfer, My parents kind of wanted me to
do the school-college thing,'' he said Wednesday.
	   Hejduk was the 1988 national junior high school surfing champion
and proposed to his wife Kim in the water with his surfboard in his
hand. He surprised some of his surfer buddies by his decision to
play professional soccer.
	   ``They give me plenty of stick,'' he said. ``I have time to do
that stuff when I retire.''
	   With the game against Iran just four days away, he was asked
about his memories of the Iran hostage crisis.
	   ``I was maybe 4 years old, maybe 5 years old,'' he said. ``That
wasn't on my mind. I think that's when I grabbed my surfboard for
the first time, heh, heh.''
	   U.S. coach Steve Sampson said one of the reasons behind his
decision to inject Hejduk into the Monday's game was the team's
lack of personality in the first half. He said he wrote a memo to
the U.S. Soccer Federation about 18 months ago discussing ``the
need for us to seek players who have personality, players like
Frankie Hejduk.''
	   ``Even if that means they may be a bit of a discipline problem
in their teens, that brings personality to the field,'' Sampson
said. ``I'm sure Frankie Hejduk and Eric Wynalda were not model
persons as they grew up, but they bring personality and talent to
the field.''
	   It's clear Hejduk can be trying at times _ like when he missed a
team flight to China last year.
	   ``The alarm was my watch and it didn't go off,'' he said. ``Now
I set like six of them.''
	   Hejduk said Sampson doesn't mind his surfing and that it helps
his soccer.
	   ``He actually likes that I surf. It's conditioning,'' he said.
``You're pulling. You use your legs, your arms, your upper body.''
	   In another sign he's a little different, Hejduk wore his shorts
backward during Monday night's game.
	   Sampson said he never wore his shorts backward when he played
soccer.
	   ``Only when I surf,'' the coach said, breaking into a big laugh.

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Spanish players admit they're not used
to playing against a team whose goalkeeper saves goals and also
scores them.
	   But the way they see it, Paraguay's Jose Luis Chilavert is
taking a chance every time he ventures upfield.
	   ``I've never seen a 'keeper take free kicks, neither in kids'
teams nor youth teams ... never before in my life,'' Spain's free
kick expert, Real Madrid defender Fernando Hierro, said Wednesday.
``Maybe he is their best player when it comes to taking frees, but
they take a risk.''
	   Chilavert, ranked among the world's best goalkeepers, is the
unchallenged star of the Paraguayan squad not just for the security
he promises between the posts but also for his ability to score
goals from free kicks and penalties.
	   With more than 80 caps to his name, the 32-year-old player for
Argentina's Velez Sarsfield has scored more than 40 goals for club
and country.
	   His free kick attempt was the closest Paraguay came to scoring
in its 0-0 draw against Bulgaria on Friday. Had it gone in, he
would have become the first keeper to score in a World Cup.
	   But the Spaniards will not be blind to the opportunities that
this oddity presents when the two sides meet in a Group D survival
game Friday in Saint-Etienne.
	   ``I'm not the one to reveal strategy,'' said Spain's Barcelona
midfielder Luis Enrique Martinez, ``but it is is peculiar that the
goalkeeper should take free kicks, especially if they're near the
opponent's area and leave a lot of space behind with no one in
goal.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ After watching all the Saudi
videos ahead of Thursday's World Cup match, French coach Aime
Jacquet can only come to one conclusion _ let them play in Europe.
	   Saudi Arabia's players haven't performed for clubs outside their
own league so far, and it is only next season that the first will
be allowed to leave.
	   ``They deserve to play in Europe. It will do them good,''
Jacquet said. ``They are very technical players and there is much
quality among them.''
	   Letting the veterans leave for the rich European leagues will
allow youngsters to progress faster within their own league, but
there are fears that with the departure of the stars interest in
the game will diminish.
	   France enters the Group C clash as the overwhelming favorite,
having beaten South Africa 3-0 on Friday. Saudi faces a must-win
situation after losing its first game against Denmark 1-0.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NICE, France (AP) _ German coach Berti Vogts thinks the road to
the World Cup title leads over the flanks.
	   ``Over a year ago, I said that you cannot have success
internationally only if you attack over the flanks. Only there you
have one-on-one situations, while in the midfield you always have
two on one,'' Vogts said Wednesday.
	   His team has been working hard on getting crosses over to
forwards in practice.
	   Vogts said some of the crosses didn't work in the 2-0 victory
over the United States on Monday. ``That's normal, we'll continue
working on them.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Berti Vogts is already looking past the
first round. The German coach wants to avoid the Netherlands in the
second round.
	   ``We want to win the group,'' Vogts said of his team's upcoming
match against Yugoslavia on Sunday in Lens. ``We have to increase
our pace and we can't leave a technically strong team like
Yugoslavia so much open space.''
	   ``We all have a dream but dreams can be destroyed quickly,
especially if we have to play against the Netherlands in the second
round,'' Vogts said.
	   Germany is in Group F, while the Netherlands is in Group E. The
top team in Group F plays the second-placed team in Group E, and
vice versa, in the second round.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHAUMONT, France _ Jamaica coach Rene Simoes said Wednesday that
a TV documentary about the Jamaican team knocked the spirit out of
his players before their opening World Cup match against Croatia.
	   ``The Road to France,'' aired in France on Saturday, contrasted
the lifestyles of highly paid Jamaican professionals who play in
England with those of teammates who struggle to make a living back
home.
	   Morale plummeted as soon as the players saw the hour-long
program, Simoes said.
	   ``Up until Saturday, the team had prepared wonderfully for the
game against Croatia. They were so confident,'' he said. ``Then the
players saw the program and were depressed, they were very down on
Sunday and I had to work hard to lift morale.''
	   Jamaica was defeated 3-1 on Sunday.
	   The problem with the program ``was that it exaggerated
differences between players,'' he said.

World Cup: South Africa needs victory over favored Danes 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ South Africa needs a lot of firsts to
advance to the second round of its inaugural World Cup, starting
with a first victory over a European side when it faces favored
Denmark on Thursday.
	   The Africans were humbled 3-0 by France in their World Cup debut
while Denmark eased past Saudi Arabia 1-0 to join France atop Group
C. That means Denmark virtually ensures itself a second-round berth
if it beats South Africa, which must win to retain any hope of
advancing.
	   ``Even if we drew with France, we'd have a point and Denmark has
three. All along we knew this was a crucial match,'' South African
coach Philippe Troussier said. ``I think the World Cup for us is
starting now.''
	   Denmark has a solid pedigree as winner of the 1992 European Cup
and a nation that made the second round in its only previous World
Cup, in 1986. The Danes are led by Manchester United's Peter
Schmeichel, considered one of the world's best goalkeepers, and
brothers Michael and Brian Laudrup.
	   Michael Laudrup, 34, played his 100th international against
Saudi Arabia and is the only survivor of the 1986 World Cup side.
	   ``It will be an incredibly difficult match against South
Africa,'' the team captain said of the first soccer encounter
between the two nations.
	   Brother Brian, 29, said he expected South Africa to be
``physical and aggressive.''
	   ``It's do or die for them,'' he said. ``They will have to come
out and play, which suits us perfectly because I think we are one
of the best sides in the world on the counterattack. If they come
forward they will leave themselves exposed.''
	   South Africa is still looking for its first World Cup goal, let
alone a victory. Banned from international soccer for 28 years
until 1992 because of apartheid, it has since been unable to defeat
any European nation.
	   In particular, the tight, physical European defenses give South
African attackers trouble, while the taller European players
regularly outperform South Africans in set pieces and aerial
battles.
	   Striker Phil Masinga of Bari, South Africa's tallest attacker,
will miss the match due to a bad ankle, Troussier said Wednesday
night, leaving the scoring onus on young Benni McCarthy of Ajax
Amsterdam and Masinga's replacement, Shaun Bartlett.
	   Against France, South Africa fell back into a defensive shell
and never challenged offensively. Players and coaches say that must
change against the Danes.
	   ``As players, we sat down and talked about it among ourselves,''
defender Mark Fish of Bolton Wanderers said. ``We said we've got to
play our own style, what got us here.''
	   That means regaining the confidence to go forward and carry play
to Denmark.
	   ``This is a turning point for us. If we can beat the Danish
side, then things will be different,'' said midfielder John Moshoeu
of Fenerbahce. ``You have to go out there and attack.''

World Cup: Italian star makes brilliant comeback 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero, Italy's
would-be World Cup star unexpectedly turned a substitute, rose up
from the bench in the second half to give the Italian team the
boost it needed to definitely tame Cameroon's Indomitable Lions.
	   The 23-year-old forward, fielded in the 65th minute to replace
his friend-rival Roberto Baggio, teamed with Francesco Moriero in
feeding Christian Vieri for two late goals which gave Italy a round
3-0 victory and took the ``Azzurri'' one step from qualification
for the second round.
	   Del Piero also went close to scoring when he kicked a soft ball
which Cameroon's goalie Jacques Songo'o managed to nail past the
bar.
	   ``I'm in the World Cup at last,'' Del Piero said following his
25-minute debut in the World competition.
	   ``I have three reasons for being happy tonight. I finally
played, I'm fit, and I started with a victory. It's early to say if
it will be a successful experience,'' he added.
	   The Italian star had missed the opening Group-B match against
Chile because of his uncertain form due to a right thigh strain
which hampered his World Cup preparation.
	   Some soccer analysts had suggested a difficult comeback of Del
Piero into the team as Roberto Baggio was a key to Italy's 2-2 draw
against Chile.
	   Baggio, playing in his third World Cup at 31, also had a good
start against Cameroon, feeding Luigi Di Biagio for Italy's first
goal Wednesday night.
	   He gave way to Del Piero in the second half, looking exhausted
from the tough tackles and the physical play of the African
defenders.
	   Coach Cesare Maldini, in an apparent effort to cool down a
growing rivalry between the two most talented players of the team,
said he had not planned to replace Baggio with Del Piero.
	   ``Del Piero was ready to replace anyone of the teammates when
needed. I substituted Baggio because he was tired and bruised,''
Maldini said.
	   Baggio, taken to France as a substitute for Del Piero, said
after the match he did not consider himself out of the team for the
last first-round match against Austria.
	   The Del Piero-Baggio saga, which stirred nationwide interest in
the days preceding the match with Cameroon, was expected to
continue in the coming days.

Consultant, two others arrested in ticket scam case

	   PARIS (AP) _ Three people, including a consultant for a
subsidiary of the World Cup's marketing agency, have been arrested
in an investigation into ticket fraud, police said.
	   The arrests on Wednesday came after more than 12,000 Japanese
fans were left ticketless for the World Cup.
	   Police arrested the consultant for ISL France at his home Monday
in the upscale western Paris suburb of Rueil-Malmaison, said the
officials, who requested customary anonymity.
	   Investigators found a large amount of cash and about 100 World
Cup tickets at the home of the consultant, identified as Gilles
Favard.
	   ISL Worldwide, which has a minority stake in ISL France and is
the marketing agency for soccer's international body FIFA, said it
was conducting an audit of the French company's books.
	   Two other people were arrested _ Favard's sister and a friend
believed to have helped the consultant sell tickets by fax, police
said.
	   Favard used ISL letterhead to dupe ticket agencies or buyers
into paying him for tickets, said Philippe Margraff, ISL Worldwide
senior vice president.
	   ``He used the name and stationery of ISL France, pretending to
be the director of development, which he wasn't, to convince
clients to buy tickets,'' Margraff said in a telephone interview.
``He used the reputation of ISL to get clients. The money was given
directly to that person.''
	   ISL France and a Japanese agency have filed complaints in the
case. ISL Worldwide denounced the fraud in a letter to French
prosecutors last week, Margraff said.
	   Glen Kirton, ISL Worldwide senior vice president, told a news
conference Wednesday that ISL France ``is an independent company
responsible for its own business and the employment of permanent
and non-permanent persons who operate the business.
	   He said it ``has no relationship with FIFA in any capacity,
either via ISL Worldwide or otherwise.''
	   Judicial authorities were unavailable for comment. World Cup
officials said they knew nothing of the arrests but stressed that
the person involved was a consultant to neither the tournament nor
FIFA, the international soccer federation represented by ISL
Worldwide.
	   The World Cup organizing committee has said it is aggressively
working to track down anyone involved in ticket fraud.
	   It was the latest scandal to hit France's controversial sale of
World Cup tickets.
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.7 million tickets
printed, almost 1.5 million were earmarked for interests in the
host country.
	   Fans were told to deal with 17 approved agencies worldwide to
get those tickets. But officials said many fans arrived in France
to discover tickets they thought would be waiting for them came
from unlicensed brokers and tour operators, especially in Japan.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.

Dollar sharply lower in Tokyo, stocks soar intervention; CORRECTS number of benchmark bond 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with stock prices, ADDS details on currency market
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar traded sharply lower against the
yen early Thursday in Tokyo, one day after central banks intervened
in currency markets to halt the Japanese currency's freefall. Tokyo
stock prices soared.
	   The dollar bought 135.72 yen in early trading, down 6.28 yen
from 142.00 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 136.37 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
jumped 627.13 points, or 4.26 percent, to 15,342.51 in the first
hour of trading. On Wednesday, the Nikkei average lost 5.00 points,
or 0.03 percent.
	   Currency traders estimated that the United States sold around
dlrs 2 billion to buy yen and that Japan did about the same. The
joint effort helped drive the dollar down more than 7 percent from
eight-year highs earlier this week.
	   The United States and Japan agreed to intervene to prop up the
yen amid concern a continued decline could spark a new round of
currency devaluation in the rest of Asia, throwing the region back
into financial chaos.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said in Tokyo
Wednesday that he welcomed the intervention and pledged new efforts
to revive Japan's recession-bound economy.
	   Japan has been sharply criticized for not taking aggressive
steps to prevent a recession. As the world's second-largest
economy, Japan's fortunes dominate Asia and are a vital link in the
global economy.
	   The cheaper yen was widely seen as threatening the recovery of
still struggling Asian economies by undercutting their products in
world markets.
	   The dollar had climbed 15 yen against the Japanese currency
since the end of April, including 6 yen in the four trading days up
to Monday, when it peaked above 146 yen.
	   Initial reaction elsewhere in Asia to the intervention was
positive. Hong Kong leader Tung Chee Hwa said Thursday in
Wellington, New Zealand, that he was glad to see the yen had
rebounded. He added the key issue for the world economy was for
Japan ``to move forward.''
	   On Wall Street overnight, U.S. stocks soared as investors saw
the intervention as a hopeful sign that authorities were acting to
keep the Asian financial crisis from worsening.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed 162.67 points higher at
8,827.96, nearly wiping out the rest of Monday's 207-point slide.
The famed barometer of 30 major companies rose 37 points on
Tuesday.
	   Investors in Tokyo also welcomed the intervention as a signal
Japan's economic woes may finally have hit bottom.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section surged 39.81, or 3.44 percent, to 1,196.65. The TOPIX
closed up a marginal 0.37 points the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.305 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.240 percent, driving its price down to 111.21 yen from 111.70
yen.

Prison and deportation for English and German hooligans

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In a clear message that hooliganism will not be
tolerated at the World Cup, French courts convicted four German and
three English soccer fans for violence that marred the first week
of the competition.
	   Judges on Wednesday ordered two- and four-month jail terms for
the three English fans, after three others were convicted Monday.
Two Germans received three-month sentences.
	   Two other German fans were convicted for attacking a German
television crew before their country's match against the United
States. They were to be deported, and banned from returning to
France for three months.
	   More than 100 people remained jailed in Marseille after three
nights of violence involving English fans, and officials said about
30 would be kept behind bars until the World Cup ends July 12,
Marseille police said.
	   The crackdown followed violence around Monday's match in
Marseille between England and Tunisia. More than 50 people were
injured and 80 arrested in clashes that damaged the Old Port
district.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement signed an order
Tuesday to expel five English fans and a Tunisian. He threatened
more expulsions if soccer violence recurs.
	   The six to be expelled were to first serve jail terms of two to
three months, officials said Wednesday.
	   Authorities took other measures to prevent hooliganism at other
matches in the 10 French cities hosting the Cup, especially those
staging England matches.
	   On Wednesday the Marseille area police prefect, Jean-Paul
Proust, announced that retail alcohol sales would be banned from
Friday afternoon until midnight Sunday ahead of the
Netherlands-South Korea match in town Saturday night.
	   Bars must also close at 11 p.m.
	   Although many bar owners welcomed the move, Paul Schianchi,
president of Marseille's union of hotel, cafe and restaurant
owners, called it ``dictatorial'' and said many bars would stay
open until usual hours.
	   The southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for England's next
match, with Romania on Monday. About 1,000 English fans were
already reported in France's fourth-largest city, prompting
officials to postpone the music festival until July 11.
	   Officials also considered closing bars early and forgoing large
TV screens like the one on a Marseille beach where ticketless
English fans and local youths fought Monday afternoon.
	   In the northern city of Lens, where England is to play Colombia
on Friday, June 26, officials were boosting police presence and
canceled city events including a music festival.
	   The new head of FIFA, the international soccer federation, said
Wednesday he was ``saddened'' by the violence. But Sepp Blatter
said he was satisfied French authorities took appropriate measures
to ensure security.
	   ``I'm convinced that from today, we won't have that hooligan
problem anymore,'' he said.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The former head of Croatia's
largest concentration camp during World War II did not fight
extradition from Argentina because he wants to dispute charges that
atrocities were committed under his command, his lawyer said.
	   Dinko Sakic smiled as he boarded a commercial flight Wednesday
for Frankfurt, Germany. Authorities said he would later change
planes for Zagreb, Croatia.
	   In Croatia, Sakic faces investigation for crimes allegedly
committed while he commanded the Jasenovac concentration camp in
the early 1940s, when the country was under the pro-Nazi Ustasha
regime.
	   ``Sakic has always wanted to go to Croatia to explain the
facts,'' Miguel Angel Rossi, Sakic's public defender, said at
Buenos Aires' international airport.
	   The public defender's office said Sakic faces prosecution in
Zagreb courts on suspicion that ``he committed crimes against
humanity and international law.''
	   The office also said Sakic consented to being extradited to
Croatia, where critics charge he would get a lenient trial.
	   Thousands of Serbians, Jews and Gypsies died at Jasenovac, the
concentration camp known as the ``Auschwitz of the Balkans,'' but
exact numbers remain in dispute.
	   Croatian president Franjo Tudjman has put the death toll at
35,000, the U.S. Justice Department at 125,000; and camp survivors,
at up to 500,000.
	   Sakic, 76, arrived in Argentina in 1947.
	   In a nationally televised interview on April 6, Sakic denied any
wrongdoing at Jasenovac while the camp was under his control.
	   ``We never put a hand on any of the prisoners in the camp,''
Sakic said. ``The people died of natural death. There was a typhus
epidemic, for example, but there were no cremation ovens that
killed anybody.''
	   Sakic was arrested after the interview. Croatia then formally
requested his extradition.

Albania protests cross-border shootings near Kosovo

	   BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) _ The Albanian Foreign Ministry has
lodged a formal protest with Yugoslavia over the death of an
Albanian man killed by a Serb sniper in a cross-border shooting.
	   The Albanian Foreign Ministry formally summoned the Yugoslav
charge d'affairs in Tirana and handed over a note objecting to the
``very grave incident'' Tuesday along the border with Yugoslavia's
embattled Kosovo province.
	   ``The Albanian government strongly demands that in the
conditions of systematic violence against the Albanians in Kosovo,
such adventurous acts must be stopped, or they could have grave
consequences,'' the statement said.
	   Fierce fighting in the embattled province continued Wednesday,
with at least 12 new deaths reported on both sides by Serb and
Albanian sources.
	   Albanian President Rexhep Meidani demanded that Serb-led
Yugoslavia ``stop the bloodshed'' and accused Yugoslav forces of
repeatedly firing across the border from Kosovo.
	   In Tuesday's shooting, Serbs fired on two Albanians riding pack
mules just inside the Albanian border, according to Western
military observers, international monitors and local accounts. One
was killed and the other escaped.
	   Serb forces later exchanged fire with four men, believed to be
the dead Albanian's brothers, as they tried to recover the body.
	   Albanian border police who attempted to reach the site of the
shooting were fired on Wednesday. No one was injured, but it was an
indication that Serb forces show little if any regard for Albania's
tiny military, which is estimated at 4,000 to 6,000 men.
	   ``It is another provocation,'' said Meidani, who was touring the
border to get a first-hand look at the refugee crisis. ``I am not
surprised, when you hear that more than 300 Albanians have been
killed in Kosovo.''
	   Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's
population. Yugoslavia says it is battling the militant Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army, which demands independence for the
province.
	   The clashes have driven some 60,000 people from their homes,
most within Kosovo. Many others have fled to Albania or the
neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   Under heavy international pressure, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic promised Russia this week to reopen negotiations with
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   But a top ethnic Albanian negotiator turned down the invitation
on Wednesday.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the four-man Kosovo Albanian team named to
negotiate with the Serbs, insisted that Yugoslav forces must leave
the province before any talks can start.
	   ``What was announced in Moscow is no news, because the problem
is not whether there will be any talks with the Albanians, but the
conditions in which talks should be held,'' Agani told The
Associated Press in Kosovo. Previous talks have produced no
significant results.
	   Montenegro's Western-oriented parliament demanded Wednesday that
Milosevic send home all Montenegro troops now in Kosovo and take
immediate measures to stop the violence there.
	   The shootings this week have frightened more than 1,000 refugees
hiding in the hills just across the frontier and effectively sealed
the border trails used by gunrunners. None were seen Wednesday.
	   Meidani said that if Milosevic does not begin promised talks
with Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate leader of Kosovo's Albanians,
then NATO and the West should bomb Serb forces in the
Albanian-dominated province without approval from the United
Nations.
	   ``It is the only language understood by Milosevic,'' Meidani
said at a news conference, flanked by the U.S. ambassador to
Albania, Marisa Lino.
	   Meidani pointed to the series of shootings following NATO's show
of force on Monday when more than 80 jets flew over Albania and
near the Kosovo border.
	   In a move that should further strengthen the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army's growing clout with Kosovo's Albanians, the Kosovo
government-in-exile declared Wednesday that it will start
organizing resistance.
	   The self-proclaimed government, which is outlawed by Serb
authorities and based abroad, made the statement after a seven-hour
meeting in the Albanian capital, Tirana, with representatives of
five Kosovo political parties.
	   ``We will appoint representatives in all the villages that have
suffered the Serb aggression, authorized to organize the
self-defense of the population,'' Bujar Bukoshi, head of the
government, told The Associated Press.

	   BOSTON (AP) _ Louise Woodward left for England on Wednesday,
hours after a U.S. judge temporarily barred her from spending money
earned from selling her story about the death of a baby in her
care.
	   Traveling the 15 miles (24 kilometers) from suburban Marblehead
with police escort, Ms. Woodward arrived at Logan International
Airport where seven state troopers escorted her past ticket
counters to a private room to wait for her flight. The plane took
off for London shortly before 6 p.m. (2200 GMT).
	   The 20-year-old former au pair did not speak publicly as she
hurried past scores of passengers and reporters.
	   Defense lawyer Andrew Good bid his client an emotional goodbye
at the airport.
	   ``She said she would miss us and she's obviously excited to go
home,'' Good said. ``I'm relieved and pleased that she's going
home.''
	   Earlier in the day, as Ms. Woodward prepared to leave the United
States and 16 months of criminal problems behind, a federal judge
issued what could be a largely symbolic order temporarily barring
her from spending any money she makes from selling her story.
	   U.S. District Judge William Young ordered Ms. Woodward to notify
the court and the family of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen of any
contract she signs to profit from her sensational case. He also set
a trial date of Oct. 5 in the Eappen family's wrongful death
lawsuit.
	   Legal experts said any civil judgment would be tough to enforce
in England. The United States and Great Britain have no treaty that
would require British authorities to enforce any restrictions
against her.
	   Good cleared the way for her departure Wednesday when he picked
up her passport, which had been held at Middlesex Superior Court in
Cambridge.
	   Good said he and other attorneys for Ms. Woodward had
misunderstood when she could return home to Elton, England. Under
normal procedures, it would take 28 days for the courts to issue
the necessary paperwork, but lawyers for both sides asked that the
process be expedited.
	   It seems no one _ not even the man who prosecuted her for
first-degree murder _ wanted to keep her here any longer.
	   ``I want her out of this country,'' District Attorney Tom Reilly
said.
	   Ms. Woodward had been ordered in November not to leave the state
while her case was under appeal with the state Supreme Judicial
Court.
	   The high court ruled Tuesday, in a 4-3 decision, that a lower
court judge acted within his power when he reduced her
second-degree murder conviction to manslaughter and sentenced her
to the 279 days she had served since her arrest.
	   Prosecutors said she killed the baby by violently shaking him
and slamming his head against a hard surface. Ms. Woodward's
attorneys argued that the baby's brain injuries occurred three
weeks before he was hospitalized on Feb. 4, 1997. He died five days
later.
	   The case, followed by millions around the world, highlighted the
difficult issues of parental responsibility for child care,
especially among two-career parents.

	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Ever since childhood, Paul Sinor's slumber _ and
that of those around him _ has been disrupted by his unusually loud
snoring.
	   On ambush duty in Vietnam, Sinor's fellow officers refused to
let him sleep at night for fear he would give away the unit's
position.
	   Just how loud was it? Sinor, a retired Army colonel,
half-jokingly describes it this way:
	   ``If I was in good form and it was the right time of year, when
I'd wake up in the mornings there'd be a small herd of female moose
in my front yard, and each one had either a rose or a bottle of
wine in their hand because they thought it was mating season.''
	   Says his wife, Jewell: ``I think his snoring was enough to bring
the paint off the walls sometimes.''
	   So last fall, Sinor went to the Northwest Nasal Sinus Center in
Seattle and became one of the first patients in the region to
undergo somnoplasty, a new, permanent, relatively painless and
bloodless way to treat chronic snoring.
	   The results, according to his wife, have been dramatic.
	   ``This week I have slept so good all through the whole night
that I can't believe I don't hear any more snoring. I'm thrilled,''
she said recently.
	   About 40 million Americans snore loudly enough to disturb the
sleep of the person they're with. Snoring happens when the airway
is not fully open; the noise comes from the efforts to breathe
through the narrowed passageway.
	   For many, snoring is a social nuisance with no major medical
consequences. For some, it can be symptomatic of more serious
sleeping disorders such as apnea, a sudden stop in breathing.
	   Somnoplasty was developed by Somnus Medical Technologies of
Sunnyvale, California. The company estimates that more than 1,000
people have been treated since the procedure was approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration last summer for treatment of
snoring. The procedure is being tested, but has not yet been
approved, for treatment for apnea.
	   During the procedure, the patient is injected with a local
anesthetic, as in a dental procedure. Then a handheld device, which
is connected to a radio-frequency generator, is placed in the
mouth. A small needle at the end of the device is inserted into the
soft palate, the soft tissue in the upper rear of the mouth.
	   Unlike laser surgery, which cuts away tissue at high
temperatures, the radio frequency energy directed through the
needle tip ``cooks'' cells through shaking and disruption. Over a
few weeks, the body naturally reabsorbs some of the tissue that's
been treated. The tightening of tissue and reduction of tissue
volume frees space for easier breathing _ and thus, less snoring.
	   The patient is in and out in less than 20 minutes.
	   ``It's no worse than probably having your teeth cleaned. And
afterwards almost no one bothers with any pain medication,'' says
Dr. Ludwig Allegra, who treated Sinor.
	   ``It's hard to argue with essentially a minimally invasive,
painless procedure that really resolves what for many people is a
very big problem.''
	   Allegra estimates that he has treated about 100 cases since his
office got the Somnoplasty machine in November. The success rate
with two treatments is between 85 percent and 90 percent, he said.
	   The procedure costs about dlrs 2,000 to dlrs 2,500 and usually
isn't covered by insurance, since snoring treatments are considered
``cosmetic.'' But Allegra said for chronic snorers, the benefits
outweigh the cost.
	   ``I see this as a very major advance because what it offers for
the first time is a realistic cure for snoring, which can be a very
major, disruptive problem to a lot of people,'' Allegra said.
	   Dr. Derek Lipman, a Portland, Oregon, ear, eye, nose and throat
specialist, writes in his book ``Snoring From A to ZZZ'' that
snoring ``has turned roommates into enemies, cut short the budding
relationship of many a young couple and blasted the bliss out of
the honeymoon for numerous newlyweds.''
	   In a recent interview, Lipman said the majority of the more than
two dozen patients he's treated with somnoplasty report that their
companion is satisfied with the results.
	   ``It truly represents a major advance, and in many cases the
treatment of choice for many people who snore who have not
responded to conservative measures,'' Lipman said.
	   Paul and Jewell Sinor both testify to the success of the
procedure.
	   ``My wife, she's like my mother: `Why didn't you do this a long
time ago?' '' Sinor says.
	   ``I can dream now and it doesn't have this roaring noise all the
time,'' Mrs. Sinor adds with a smile.

Korean unemployment swells; welfare system inadequate PAULINE JELINEK

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Seoul civic group is looking for
someone who lost his job, survived it and is willing to talk about
it.
	   ``It will inspire people ...'' said Lim Jong-son, a social
worker organizing a jobless seminar for the YMCA.
	   If ever South Korean workers needed inspiration, this is the
moment.
	   In a nation accustomed to lifetime employment and years of
rising incomes, many are finding themselves ill-prepared for the
emotional and financial trauma of South Korea's spreading
joblessness.
	   ``They are really at a loss,'' Lim said of men he's counseled at
a YMCA welfare center in Seoul.
	   The currency meltdown last fall _ and resulting economic
restructuring now underway _ drove the jobless rate from 2.1
percent in October to 6.7 percent in April. About 100 companies go
bankrupt and 7,000 people lose their jobs daily.
	   In a nation where the man is still the sole bread winner in the
majority of households _ and his failure a dishonor _ the burden
can be great.
	   Suicides have increased 36 percent over last year to 25 a day,
largely because of the economy, the government believes.
	   Some laid-off men continue to dress in suits and ties and walk
out the door every morning, pretending to go to work, rather than
tell their families the truth.
	   The unemployed hike in nearby mountains, fill chairs in the
Seoul train station waiting room, or visit jobless centers looking
for positions that don't exist.
	   Working women, still a minority in South Korea, worry the
economic crisis is undermining their struggle to be considered
equals in the workplace.
	   Only about 40 percent of working-age women have jobs. And
women's organizations report discrimination against those who do,
with some companies cutting women staffers first.
	   Homelessness and child abandonment, previously rare, also are
reported rising as families lose their homes and workers leave
their families to look for work.
	   ``My family does not know I am staying in the park,''
47-year-old Kim Chin-pal said from a tent in a central Seoul park.
	   ``I miss them very much but I cannot return home until I get a
job to support them,'' said the laid-off construction worker who
two months ago came to Seoul from the southeastern city of Taeju.
	   If people are in an unfamiliar territory, so is their
government.
	   In its scramble to push the country's economy from poverty to
developed status in a mere three decades, the government gave
little thought to creating a social safety net.
	   So when the crisis hit last year, ``economists were at a loss to
make policy recommendations for dealing with the sheer size of mass
unemployment,'' according to a report by the government-funded
think tank Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade.
	   As the number of unemployed swelled from about 400,000 to 1.4
million in six months, civic and religious groups rushed to help,
setting up homeless shelters, soup kitchens and counseling centers.
	   The government in March announced a plan that included
unemployment payments and loans, vocational training and job
creation programs such as public works projects.
	   ``A biscuit in the mouth of an elephant'' is what Koreans are
calling the stipends, which allow, for instance, a one-time payment
of about dlrs 160 to jobless below the poverty line.
	   Procedures for getting the money are too complicated for a
populace unfamiliar with such a system, and the money comes with
too many conditions, critics say. Only one in seven jobless have
received some kind of government benefit so far this year,
according to government statistics.
	   Analysts say that as the number of unemployed swells toward a
projected 2 million of South Korea's 21 million-person work force
by the end of this year, the government will be forced by social
pressure to do more.
	   And even if the economy can be restructured in a couple of years
to be a more efficient global competitor, workers will be forced to
face the probability that job security will never be what it once
was.
	   ``Korean people tend to consider only lifetime employment (as)
jobs,'' said the YMCA's Lim. ``People need to change their
attitudes.''
	   One who already has is Min Ye-dong, a pear farmer in a city
south of Seoul since leaving a failing printing company in the
capital last fall.
	   ``When you lose a job it's not the end of the world,' said Min,
36. ``The most important thing is to have courage and have a will
to make a new beginning.''

Ruling party opens assembly with attack on speculators

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ruling party opened its
annual convention Thursday by accusing foreign currency speculators
of pushing the nation into a perilous slide toward recession.
	   ``Our economy has been rattled because of attacks from
outsiders. Our currency has slid because of attacks from foreign
currency speculators,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in
an opening speech at the general assembly of the United Malays
National Organization.
	   Nearly 2,000 delegates from around the country have gathered for
the four-day meeting of the country's dominant party.
	   Anwar, who is vice president of the party and also the nation's
finance minister, was in effect giving his support to Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's controversial stance that foreigners
were to blame for Malaysia's economic woes.
	   Unlike Mahathir, Anwar has rarely criticized foreign speculators
for the country's economic ills. He said Malaysia was facing its
``most critical test'' since independence from Britain in 1957.
	   Political observers had wondered whether Anwar, who has been at
odds with the prime minister over the proper path to economic
recovery, would rally behind Mahathir at the annual convention.
	   ``UMNO must unite as one front under our leadership headed by
our prime minister,'' said Anwar, in a ringing endorsement for
Mahathir. ``We must put aside our individual interests. The people
must sacrifice. The leaders must also sacrifice.''
	   Toeing the Mahathir line, Anwar said foreign currency
speculators ``who manipulate foreign currencies for their own
greed,'' were to blame for the more than 35 percent decline in
value of the ringgit since last July.
	   ``If there are foreign media or outsiders who try to create
conflict among our leaders, let us not be influenced.''

Researchers say giraffes talk at infrasonic level inaudible to humans 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLUMBIA, South Carolina (AP) _ Be sure to watch the giraffes
talk during your next visit to the zoo. In fact, all you'll be
doing is watching because humans can't hear giraffes communicate.
	   A new study has found that giraffes, long thought to be silent
creatures, really are babbling away at an infrasonic level
inaudible to humans.
	   Sensors can pick up the sounds when giraffes throw back their
necks, pointing their nostrils skyward.
	   The study by Elizabeth Von Muggenthaler and Randy Fulk was
presented recently at the Conservation Research Consortium at
Columbia's Riverbanks Zoo, a regional meeting of zoo biologists,
field biologists and academics.
	   For years, scientists have known that blue whales, elephants and
alligators produce some infrasonic sounds, which have wave
frequencies below the 20-hertz that the most acute human ear can
hear.
	   Researchers recorded hours of giraffe conversations at
Riverbanks Zoo and the North Carolina Zoological Park in Asheboro,
North Carolina.
	   Giraffe researchers found that in a 24-hour period the animals
will make several hundred infrasonic sounds. Variations in
duration, frequency and amplitude seem to indicate the sounds are a
means of communication, not just noise, Von Muggenthaler said.
However, more research must be conducted.
	   Data even shows that the two giraffe groups studied have their
own dialect. The Riverbanks giraffes talk with a South Carolina
accent noticeably different from the North Carolina accent found in
Asheboro.
	   Seeing small heads and hearing no sounds, humans have often
thought giraffes had little intelligence.
	   ``People have always said of giraffes `They are beautiful,
elegant creatures, but, boy, I wouldn't associate them with quantum
mechanics,''' Von Muggenthaler said.
	   ``Well, I don't know about quantum mechanics, but this animal is
communicating an awful lot,'' she said.

Visitors to Las Vegas gamble on love, too

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Casinos aren't the only draw in the gambling
town of Las Vegas. Many who feel lucky head to chapels on The
Strip.
	   One couple says ``I do'' behind closed doors, three sign
marriage licenses in the office, and four others wait their turn to
exchange vows.
	   Meanwhile, a pair of young lovers from Tempe, Arizona, sits in a
Ford Mustang at the drive-through, where Charolette Richards
performs dlrs 30 ceremonies.
	   It's Saturday. It's spring. It's busy at A Little White Wedding
Chapel. And, yes, Elvis is here.
	   This chapel _ squeezed between hotel-casinos Riviera and Circus
_ is one of 26 in Las Vegas, self-proclaimed wedding capital of the
world.
	   ``I do so many weddings, I lost count of the numbers,'' says
Richards. ``Isn't it wonderful?''
	   The city's convention bureau provides the numbers: Some 100,800
couples tied the knot last year, 3,021 on Feb. 14 _ Valentine's Day
_ alone.
	   ``Spring and summer are definitely our busiest times,'' says
Judy Kerness, proprietor of Cupid's Wedding Chapel. Scanning
live-feed video from the adjoining chapel, she smiles. ``And
Saturdays, well, Saturdays can be crazy.''
	   Couples come from across the country and around the world.
``Sometimes,'' Kerness says, ``it's just two people who thought,
`Hey, this seems like a good idea.'''
	   Londoners Lisa Michalski and Graham Potter thought longer.
Michalski is formal, with a full-length white gown and a bouquet of
red roses and babies' breath. Potter is suited in black with a neon
blue dress shirt and matching suede shoes.
	   Michalski walks down the aisle, with Richards and Jason Garon in
attendance. Garon, the Elvis impersonator, sings ``Love Me
Tender.'' Knot tied, bride kissed, Garon tugs his gold jacket,
swivels hips and bursts into ``Viva Las Vegas.'' The newlyweds
dance and sing along.
	   ``We love Elvis, and we love rock 'n' roll,'' says Potter. ``And
this just seemed like the thing to do. It's too boring to marry at
home.''
	   As Elvis, er, Garon leaves the building to pose with bride and
groom near his pink Cadillac, he nods at the chapel's photo Wall of
Fame: Joan Collins, Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Dan Akroyd,
Michael Jordan, plus Bruce Willis and Demi Moore.
	   Down the Strip, at San Francisco Sally's wedding chapel and
rent-all, Nandina Dutta and Partha Dutta try on gowns and tuxedos.
Arriving on the flight from New York City, they have only a few
hours to rent clothes, get married, return the rentals, check into
the New York-New York Hotel and Casino and catch the early-bird
flight home.
	   They will be married at a nearby chapel in one hour. ``It's just
one of those crazy things,'' the groom says. ``We wanted to do
something out of the ordinary. So here we are.'' And the parents?
``They don't even know we're here. I think they'll be shocked, but
I think they'll accept it.''
	   Michelle Emro and John Raybon share a mirror. The couple,
residents of Las Vegas, are shopping early. Their wedding isn't for
several weeks. They are also relaxed, and for good reason. ``We're
actually already married,'' says Raybon. ``We're only doing this
for effect, for my mother.''
	   At Cupid's, manager Linda James chats on the phone with
soon-to-be-marrieds. For dlrs 549, the ``Unforgettable''
top-of-the-line package includes photos, a video, music, cake, the
garter, etched champagne flutes, plus a flood of flowers. For dlrs
139, the ``You Send Me'' economy package is limited to one photo,
music, a short service, and flowers for the bride _ but not her
mother.
	   Regardless of price, James promises a memory. ``I don't believe
couples come here because they want a cheesy wedding,'' she says.
``So we try to make our weddings romantic and special.''
	   And, she says, to let every bride be a Cinderella for a day.

With BC-SCI-Tsunamis-Glance
By RORY MARSHALL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ The next time you visit a Pacific Ocean beach,
you may find a new addition to the signs that warn of dangerous
undertows and rip tides.
	   The blue-and-white signs show a person running from a giant
wave. The message: ``Tsunami hazard zone. In case of earthquake, go
to high ground or inland.''
	   Tsunami is the Japanese name for renegade sea waves up to 100
feet (30-meter) high that are generated by earthquakes or
landslides.
	   And the person on the sign is likely out of luck trying to
outrun the wave looming behind him. While the waves don't maintain
their 500 mph (800 kph) top speed on shore, the pace of 30 mph (48
kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) is more than humans can do on foot.
	   That's why the federal government and the states of California,
Oregon, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii want to improve the
technology used to detect tsunamis and increase civil-disaster
planning and public education.
	   ``We know that we're due for a big one,'' said George Crawford,
earthquake program coordinator for Washington state's emergency
management division.
	   The threat is not new.
	   Most of the 132 people killed in a 1964 Alaska earthquake were
victims of tsunamis. About 20 of the estimated 121 tsunami victims
were outside Alaska as the waves ravaged other parts of the West
Coast.
	   In Hawaii, tsunamis are the deadliest natural threat, blamed for
more than 300 deaths since the 1940s.
	   Over the past century, there has been an average of one damaging
tsunami per year in the Pacific basin, with a 100-year toll of
about 70,000 people. In just three years, from 1992-1994, a half
dozen tsunamis over 15 feet (4.6-meter) tall killed more than 2,300
people.
	   But the threat has taken on new urgency with evidence in the
past 15 years that a coastal earthquake zone from Northern
California to British Columbia _ the Cascadia subduction zone,
where plates of the Earth's crust are colliding _ is capable of
generating giant quakes that could send tsunamis crashing ashore in
a matter of minutes.
	   It really hit home in April 1992, when a 7.2-magnitude quake
struck off the coast of California's Humboldt County.
	   ``It created a massive amount of damage in Northern California
... and it produced a small tsunami'' about 1-3 feet (10
centimeters) high, said Eddie Bernard, director of the Pacific
Marine Environmental Laboratory here and chairman of the National
Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program.
	   ``Now, this was the first time that California had had a
subduction-zone earthquake and an accompanying tsunami,'' Bernard
said. ``That woke up everybody.''
	   Before that, officials had believed there would be hours of lead
time for a tsunami threat.
	   ``Humboldt really turned all of that on its head,'' said Richard
Eisner, regional administrator for the coastal region of
California's emergency-services agency.
	   The U.S. Senate asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration to assess the threat and state preparedness. But as
Bernard began organizing meetings, he found that the federal
officials responsible for issuing tsunami warnings, and the local
officials responsible for dealing with the results, didn't know
much about each other.
	   A steering group of representatives from federal agencies and
the five states came up with a three-pronged approach:
	   _ Hazard assessment. A center was set up last year in Newport,
Ore., to help produce ``tsunami inundation maps,'' showing coastal
areas that would be flooded by tsunamis. Local officials can use
the maps to plot evacuation routes or decide locations for critical
facilities such as fire stations and hospitals.
	   _ Warning guidance. The region's network of seismic stations is
being expanded and upgraded to better track the source and type of
earthquakes for NOAA's tsunami warning centers at Ewa Beach,
Hawaii, and Palmer, Alaska. A series of at-sea buoys that detect
water-pressure changes also is planned, to detect tsunamis and
determine their size. And research and warning centers are
integrating their computer systems, so each can have access to data
from the others' arrays of seismometers.
	   _ Mitigation. The ``tsunami hazard zone'' signs are one example,
along with signs marking evacuation routes, informational
brochures, school-evacuation drills, warning systems such as
sirens, and other local efforts.
	   The ``inundation maps'' offer insights, but aren't intended to
dictate land-use planning.
	   ``What you can say is that in general, if an earthquake occurs
like we envision and if a tsunami is produced like we envision,
then this area will probably be flooded,'' Bernard said.
	   ``If your house is in the middle of it, that doesn't necessarily
mean you're going to get blown away, but I would recommend that you
figure out a way to protect your family in the event this
happens.''
	   Congress appropriated dlrs 2.3 million for the joint effort this
fiscal year and the same amount last year, with the states
contributing as well.
	   ``Our problem is like everybody else: It's resources,'' said Jim
Mackin, mitigation officer for the Alaska's emergency-services
division.

	   ``When they're made available and there's not a lot of strings
on it, it's great,'' he said. ``What we need to do in Alaska is
different from what they need to do in Oregon and California.''
	   From NOAA's standpoint, a major goal of the program is to
eliminate false alarms that cause unnecessary evacuations, such as
one in October 1994, when a magnitude 8.1 earthquake off Russia's
Kuril Islands spawned a tsunami. The wave turned out to be a wash
in U.S. territory _ but not before disrupting life in numerous West
Coast communities.
	   Warnings issued by NOAA's tsunami warning centers now are based
strictly on the size and location of an earthquake _ an
ultra-conservative approach for safety. It's not known whether a
tsunami has actually been generated until the wave reaches one of a
series of tide gauges around the Pacific.
	   If the tsunami is small or nonexistent, the warning is quickly
called off. The planned deep-sea buoys _ a half dozen of them from
Alaska to Chile _ should be able to tell quickly whether _ and how
big _ a tsunami has formed.
	   False alarms are pricey: Hawaii has calculated the cost of a
statewide evacuation at dlrs 40 million per day, mostly due to lost
business, said Barbara Hendrie, spokeswoman for Hawaii State Civil
Defense.
	   ``The more changes that come about in the accuracy of
notification and alerting the public, the better,'' said Hendrie,
who described Hawaiians as ``sitting ducks.''
	   ``These waves are just incredible _ what they can do and how far
inland they can go.''
	   Bernard agrees.
	   ``If we're going to be the nation's warning center we'd better
make doggone sure that when we issue a warning people, one, know
what it means and, two, take the appropriate action,'' he said.
	   ``We can't just stick our head in the sand and say, `Well,
they'll take care of it somehow.'''

Some facts about tsunamis 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-SCI-US-Bracing for Tsunamis
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Some facts about tsunamis, the big sea waves most frequently
generated by earthquakes:
	   THE WORD: Tsunami is a Japanese word that translates as ``harbor
wave.'' The term ``tidal wave'' is inaccurate, since tides have
nothing to do with their formation. The term ``seismic sea wave''
is also misleading, since tsunamis can also be generated by such
non-seismic events as landslides and meteorites. Such tsunamis
generally dissipate more quickly than those that follow
earthquakes.
	   WHAT IT IS: Unlike wind-caused waves, which are fairly short and
only a few seconds apart, a tsunami may stretch dozens of miles
(kilometers) in length, and the time between one tsunami and the
next can be an hour or so. In the deep ocean, where they move
fastest, they can travel at speeds of up to 500 miles (800
kilometers) per hour.
	   EARTHQUAKES AND TSUNAMIS: An earthquake can generate a tsunami
if the quake involves a sudden rising or lowering of part of the
sea floor. That abrupt change displaces the water above, and a
tsunami can form as the water moves to regain its normal surface.
	   HOW TSUNAMIS LOOK: In the deep ocean, a tsunami is imperceptible
to humans. As a tsunami reaches shallower depths near shore, its
height can rise several meters or more. When it reaches shore, it
may appear as a rapidly changing tide, a series of breaking waves,
or a bore _ a high, abrupt wave in a narrow channel.
	   ON SHORE: Tsunamis can inundate areas hundreds of yards past the
normal high-water mark, stripping out soil and crushing structures.
They can reach heights of 100 feet (30 meters).

Researchers find that 3-year-olds can do math 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Children as young as age 3 can add and subtract,
and their socioeconomic background appears to have little effect on
their skills, according to research at the University of Chicago.
	   Researchers, who have studied children at the university's Lab
School, found that toddlers from disadvantaged backgrounds may not
have the language skills to answer verbal math questions. But they
are able to work out problems when teachers use objects instead of
verbal cues.
	   That's according to Susan Levine and Janellen Huttenlocher, both
psychology professors at the university, and Nancy Jordan, a former
colleague.
	   ``All children see sets of objects in the world, and they see
those sets of objects added to and decreased by operations like
eating,'' Levine said. ``What varies among kids is the amount of
talk'' they do and hear about numbers.
	   Levine and her colleagues have found that, as children approach
age 3, they begin to develop nonverbal calculation. For example,
researchers showed youngsters two black discs and then slid those
discs under a box. As the children watched, the researchers then
slid a third disc under the box and asked the children to make an
identical pile of the total number of discs under the box. The
children correctly made piles of three, researchers said.
	   Researchers also found that children as young as 3 can do more
abstract calculations. The children were shown two black discs,
which were then removed. Shown cards with different numbers of
discs, they correctly chose a card that had a picture of two discs
on it.
	   Lastly, the University of Chicago researchers found that, at age
4, children begin to develop even more abstract number concepts.
Upon hearing two drum beats _ but no verbal instructions _ most
4-year-olds who were studied were able to pick out a card with two
objects on it.

 &UR; Nobel gets his own prize, induction into Inventors Hall of Fame
 &UR; Eds: Fergason and Mullis cq in 4th graf, Besides Nobel ...
	   AKRON, Ohio (AP) _ The Swede who invented dynamite and is the
benefactor of the Nobel Prizes was himself given an honor _
induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.
	   Alfred Nobel, who lived from 1833 to 1896, is one of six people
who will be honored at induction ceremonies in September at the
inventors hall in Akron.
	   Officials announced the 1998 class of inductees June 9 in a
joint news conference here and at the Henry Ford Museum in
Dearborn, Mich.
	   Besides Nobel, who made a fortune manufacturing explosives, the
other inductees are: Douglas Engelbart, creator of the computer
mouse; Henry Timken, inventor of the tapered roller bearing
commonly used in the wheels of many forms of transportation; S.
Joseph Begun, a pioneer in magnetic recording who built the first
tape recorder used for broadcasting; James L. Fergason, inventor of
the liquid crystal display; and Kary Banks Mullis, who developed a
process that allows genetic researchers to identify a fragment of
DNA and then reproduce it infinitely.
	   Including this year's class, 141 people have been inducted into
the inventors hall. The honor was first bestowed on Thomas Edison.

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Bacteria in raw oysters and other shellfish
killed one person and sickened 208 others in the United States and
Canada last summer, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
reports.
	   The illnesses were reported in Washington state, California,
Oregon, Utah, Alaska, Maryland, Hawaii and British Columbia in
Canada during July and August.
	   All 209 people tested positive for Vibrio parahaemolyticus,
bacteria commonly found in shellfish that can cause diarrhea,
nausea, stomach cramps and fever. Most patients reported eating raw
oysters; some reported eating mussels, crabs and other shellfish.
	   The oysters had higher-than-normal concentrations of the
bacteria, perhaps because of warmer water in the Pacific Ocean, the
CDC said.
	   The CDC is urging people not to eat raw or undercooked
shellfish. Cooking shellfish will kill the bacteria.

From human rights to cancer, old bones spark congressional debate 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo NY300
By JOHN HUGHES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ For months, the debate about one of the oldest
skeletons in North America has involved scientists, tribal leaders,
lawyers and history buffs. Now it appears Kennewick Man could use a
good lobbyist.
	   He has drawn the attention of Congress.
	   At a hearing last week, the 9,200-year-old bones became a
touchstone for questions about a host of philosophical and
spiritual issues, from religious liberty to human rights and even
to finding what causes cancer.
	   That is a big burden for a man who lived a short life and
apparently died a painful death, with a spear point embedded in his
pelvis.
	   American Indians want to bury the bones of the man they view as
their ancestor. Scientists, and some lawmakers, want to study them
further. For now, the bones _ found nearly intact in 1996 in the
shallows of the Columbia River in Kennewick in southeast Washington
_ remain in a lab in Richland, Washington.
	   ``I feel very strongly that Kennewick Man can provide us with an
absolutely unique insight into the history of human beings in North
America and in the United States,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton of
Washington.
	   Anthropologist James Chatters said studying ancient remains not
only ``enriches, inspires and humbles us, but it also has a
practical side.'' Skeletal studies have shown promise for
understanding two diseases prevalent among American Indians _
rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes, he said.
	   Phillip L. Walker, an anthropologist at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, said the ``battered child syndrome'' he
commonly encounters in forensic work is absent in the skeletons of
ancient American Indian and European children.
	   That might suggest ``some social explanations for the epidemic
of child abuse we are currently experiencing in the United
States,'' he said.
	   Studies could help unravel environmental and genetic causes of
diseases such as cancer and osteoporosis, Walker said.
	   That is fine, American Indians say, but why research us?
	   Armand Minthorn, who belongs to one of the tribes that wants to
rebury Kennewick Man, said Indian remains have been picked apart
because they are not lined up in manicured cemeteries beneath
headstones.
	   ``We never imagined that to preserve our predecessors and to
allow them to remain at peace we would have to be able to point to
a 3-by-8-foot (1-by-2.4-meter) plot of land bearing an inscribed
stone,'' said Minthorn, a trustee of the Confederated Tribes of the
Umatilla Indian Reservation.
	   Eni Faleomavaega, American Samoa's delegate to Congress, said
the Smithsonian Institution is full of native peoples' remains that
have been prodded and probed for generations.
	   If researchers wanted to open the graves of Abraham Lincoln and
George Washington for clues about how people lived, Faleomavaega
said, ``The sentiment would be, `Let these men rest in peace.' ...
This is not just a clash between science and religion, it's about
human rights.''
	   Washington Rep. Doc Hastings Republican has offered legislation
to make it easier to research the remains. Some supporters believe
the Caucasoid features of the skeleton cast doubt as to whether the
remains should go the Indian tribes.
	   But Maurice Eben, a member of Nevada's Pyramid Lake Tribe, said,
``We're not afraid of what is going to be found.''
	   The Indians say their history is decided not in laboratories but
through the oral testaments of their forebears.
	   Meanwhile, as Kennewick Man prompts questions about the roots of
humanity, he could spur changes in the Native American Graves and
Repatriation Act of 1991. The law is intended to ensure that tribes
obtain the remains of ancestors found on federal land.
	   The law may need to be changed to ensure that the Interior
Department, not the Army Corps of Engineers, make decisions about
those remains, some lawmakers said.
	   Alaska Rep. Don Young, chairman of the House Resources
Committee, said that when he helped pass the Repatriation Act, he
had remains from the past few hundred years in mind.
	   ``I did not envision a 10,000-year-old person,'' he said.

Japan trade surplus soars again in May 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world soared 66.6
percent in May as demand for foreign products remained weak amid an
economic slowdown, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus _ a tally of goods the country
exports minus its imports _ soared to 1.219 trillion yen (dlrs 9.03
billion) from 731.98 billion yen (dlrs 5.42 billion) during the
same period last year, the ministry said.
	   Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States also jumped, rising 41 percent to 455.43 billion in May from
the same year-earlier month.
	   Even though exports fell slightly in May, the overall surplus
rose as imports fell faster. It was the 14th consecutive month pf
growth in the surplus, measured as goods clear customs and before
adjustment for seasonal factors.
	   Exports fell for a second straight month due chiefly to slower
sales of computer chips and auto parts. A Finance Ministry official
said the economic slowdown in Asia also contributed to the decline
in exports.
	   Overall, exports decreased 1.5 percent to 4.042 billion yen
(dlrs 29.9 billion).
	   Imports dropped 16.3 percent to 2.823 trillion yen (dlrs 20.9
billion) as falling energy prices meant Japan paid less for
imported oil. Japan also imported less wood as housing starts
slumped.
	   Sales of foreign-made products have been steadily declining _
May marked the fifth consecutive fall _ as consumption in Japan
weakened amid the country's worst economic slump in decades.
	   The finance ministry said it expects an economic recovery will
begin later this summer, thus, boosting imports and slowing growth
in Japan's trade surplus.
	   The government announced a 16.65 trillion yen (dlrs 123 billion)
package of tax-cuts and spending increases in April designed to
stimulate economic growth.

World Cup: Italy beats 10-man Cameroon 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous; repeating for all needing
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio kept up his strong
World Cup comeback Wednesday night, but it was two lesser-known
teammates who sparked Italy to a 3-0 triumph over a 10-man Cameroon
side.
	   Midfielder Luigi Di Biagio scored an eighth-minute header and
drew a red card against Cameroon's Raymond Kalla Nkongo just before
the half, while striker Christian Vieri threatened all night and
was rewarded with two late goals to give him a share of the
tournament scoring lead.
	   The victory gave Italy four points in Group B, two more than
Chile and Austria, who played to a 1-1 draw earlier, and three more
than the Indomitable Lions with one match left. A win or a draw
against Austria next week assures the Italians advance, and more
importantly, means they probably won't have to face defending
champion Brazil in the second round.
	   ``Everything went well, and we showed we have top strikers,''
Italian coach Cesare Maldini said. ``It was a win for the whole
team.''
	   Baggio, the 1994 Cup star who had played only one game for Italy
since 1995 before getting the call for this tournament, lifted a
perfect cross to Di Biagio, who headed the ball home from 10 meters
(yards) past goalkeeper Jacques Sango'o.
	   Di Biagio, making his first World Cup start in only his fourth
international, also made a key tackle on Kalla in the 43rd minute
on the play that got the Cameroon defender ejected. Kalla, who was
on a full run, couldn't stop and went feet first into Di Biagio,
and Australian referee Edward Lennie immediately pulled out the red
card.
	   Di Biagio, taken off on a stretcher, returned before the half
was over to the jeers of fans at Stade de la Mosson. As the players
walked off the field at halftime, Di Biagio lifted his right shorts
leg to show his injury to Songo'o and Cameroon coach Claude Leroy
as if trying to vindicate the referee's decision.
	   Despite having only 10 men in the second half, the Africans
attacked to try for an equalizer and eventually gave up too many
chances.
	   ``I took advantage of the opportunities I had,'' said Vieri, 24,
who also scored in Italy's opening 2-2 draw with Chile. His three
goals ties him with Chile's Marcelo Salas for the World Cup scoring
lead.
	   Viero took a pass from Francesco Moriero and chipped the ball
over Songo'o for a 2-0 lead in the 75th minute, then scored easily
when defender Pierre Wome misplayed the ball in front of Songo'o in
the 89th minute.
	   Before that, Cameroon caused some problems despite being a man
down, with Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca forced to make a
brilliant one-handed save on substitute Joseph-Desire Job's blast
for the top left corner in the 59th minute.
	   ``We had a very bad start tonight,'' Leroy said. ``We tried to
play well, but we didn't have many opportunities having only 10
players on the pitch.''
	   While refraining from directly criticizing Lennie's red card
decision, Leroy said most of the calls favored Italy. He promised a
strong effort by Cameroon against Chile next week, saying the
Indomitable Lions can still qualify with a victory if Italy defeats
Austria.
	   Baggio, playing his 49th international at age 31, had a second
straight big game after scoring a penalty and setting up Vieri's
goal against Chile. He only started last week because oncoming star
Alessandro Del Piero had a thigh strain.
	   Del Piero replaced Baggio in the 65th minute and nearly scored
in the 81st minute when Songo'o batted his 20-meter shot over the
crossbar.

Albright offers new deal to Iran Precede WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous to update with speech delivered
AP Photos
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a major overture after nearly two decades of
distrust, the Clinton administration offered to start a new
relationship with Iran _ even including a role in Persian Gulf
security _ if it abides by international standards of conduct.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held out the olive
branch, responding to openings from Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami, in a speech delivered Wednesday to The Asia Society in New
York.
	   ``As the wall of mistrust comes down, we can develop with the
Islamic republic, when it is ready, a road map leading to normal
relations,'' said Albright.
	   Already, the Clinton administration has supported cultural and
academic exchanges with Iran, and eased travel to the United States
by many Iranians.
	   ``We are ready to explore further ways to build mutual
confidence and avoid misunderstanding,'' Albright said. ``The
Islamic Republic should consider parallel steps.''
	   Specifically, Albright called for a halt in support for
terrorism, and she criticized Iran's record on human rights. On the
other hand, she praised Tehran's decision to acquiesce to any
agreement Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat works out with Israel.
	   ``Obviously, two decades of mistrust cannot be erased
overnight,'' she said. ``The gap between us remains wide. But it is
time to test the possibilities for bridging this gap.''
	   Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Albright's offer was the
suggestion Iran could be included in ``multilateral efforts to
protect international security.''
	   She said the United Nations and other multinational coalitions
had countered threats to peace in the Persian Gulf War against Iraq
in 1991 and in peacekeeping operations around the world.
	   ``This global network has grown largely without Iranian
participation,'' Albright said. ``But Iran would be welcome if it
is willing to make a constructive contribution.''
	   In her remarks, Albright also credited Iran with already
participating in efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan and with
trying to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
	   As another ``sign of change,'' she cited an improvement in
Iran's record in the war against drugs within its borders, and said
Iran had received ``high marks'' from the United Nations to its
treatment of more than 2 million and Iraqi and Afghan refugees.
	   However, Albright said, the positive developments ``must be
balanced against the reality that Iran's support for terrorism has
not ceased, serious violations of human rights persist and its
efforts to develop long-range missiles and to acquire nuclear
weapons continue.''
	   Turning to other countries, Albright made these points:
	   _China: President Clinton on his visit beginning next week will
express concern about preserving Tibet's heritage and stress
political and religious rights. He will be saying things ``the
people of China cannot say and have not heard.''
	   _South Korea: Hinting the Clinton administration would ease its
sanctions against the communist regime in North Korea, she said,
``We have agreed to coordinate closely'' with Seoul on the issues.
President Kim Dae Jung is calling for an easing of the sanctions to
improve economic conditions on the Korean peninsula.
	   _Indonesia: Praised President B.J. Habibie for promising new
elections, releasing political prisoners and for his approach to
debt and other economic problems. ``It is not too early to reaffirm
America's commitment to do all we can to help the Indonesia
people,'' she said, announcing the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta and
other diplomatic offices were being brought up to full strength.''
	   Earlier, Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk said Iran's
Revolutionary Guard had taken to the streets of Tehran in a
``strong backlash'' to students demonstrating against the country's
militant Islamic government.
	   Speaking at a media seminar, Indyk said ``there is a good deal
of turmoil going on there at the moment,'' with the guard debating
the students.

Resolution submitted on Iraq spare parts 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A resolution authorizing dlrs 300 million
in spare parts for Iraq's oil industry was introduced in the
Security Council, despite Baghdad's warning that it will cease oil
exports if it disapproves of the text.
	   The resolution was introduced by Britain, Portugal and Sweden at
a late afternoon session. Council President Antonio Monteiro said
members would discuss the draft Thursday after receiving
instructions from their governments about whether to support it.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended that the council allow
Iraq to purchase the parts with revenues from the U.N.
``oil-for-food'' sales in order to boost its capacity to meet the
new U.N.-authorized export ceiling.
	   But the recommendation has been held up for weeks because the
United States wanted to attach conditions. Washington first wanted
to attach the spare parts deal to changes in the oil-for-food
program to make it last automatically as long as economic sanctions
remain against Iraq.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since 1990, when
the Security Council imposed sanctions after President Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   After U.S.-led forces liberated Kuwait, the council decided to
maintain sanctions until Iraq destroyed all illegal weapons. In
1996, however, the council agreed to allow Baghdad to sell limited
amounts of oil to buy food and medicine.
	   In February, the council increased the export ceiling from dlrs
2 billion to dlrs 5.26 billion over six months.
	   The U.S. proposal to make the oil-for-food program on-going,
rather than subject to six-month reviews, drew little support
within the council. Talks have been underway since then to find
compromise language.
	   On Monday, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Baghdad
would cease oil exports altogether if council members approve any
formula which implies that the oil-for-food program would be
on-going.
	   Although the program enables Iraq to buy humanitarian supplies,
the Iraqis have never liked the arrangement, claiming it is simply
a smokescreen to deflect criticism on the United States and others
for causing suffering among the Iraqi people through sanctions.
	   There was no comment from the Iraqi mission about its reaction
to the latest version of the resolution.

Dollar plunges against yen in Tokyo, stocks rally ADDs, G-7 deputies to address Asian situation Saturday, other details, byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES thruout with morning stocks, dollar, bond prices;

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar traded sharply lower against the
yen Thursday morning in Tokyo, one day after the United States and
Japan intervened in currency markets to halt the yen's freefall.
Tokyo stock prices rallied.
	   The dollar bought 136.16 yen in late morning trading, down 5.84
yen from 142.00 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late
New York rate of 136.37 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
jumped 647.11 points, or 4.34 percent, to 15,362.49 at the end of
the morning session. On Wednesday, the Nikkei average lost 5.00
points, or 0.03 percent.
	   Currency traders said fear of more intervention by Japan's
central bank kept the dollar under pressure as investors awaited
Saturday's meeting of Group of Seven finance deputies in Tokyo.
	   A high-level U.S. delegation, including Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, will join other G-7 officials to
discuss economic troubles in Japan and other Asian nations. Summers
was due to arrive later Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto welcomed the effect of the
intervention, telling reporters Thursday morning, ``I'm quite happy
that the market has received (the joint intervention) favorably.''
	   He told President Clinton by telephone Wednesday that his
government would speed efforts to pull Japan out of a deepening
recession.
	   Japan has been sharply criticized for not taking aggressive
steps to revive its sinking fortunes. As the world's second-largest
economy, Japan is Asia's dominant presence and is a vital link in
the global economy.
	   The cheaper yen was widely seen as threatening the recovery of
still struggling Asian economies by undercutting their products in
world markets.
	   Wednesday's joint intervention, estimated at a combined dlrs 4
billion, helped drive the dollar down more than 7 percent from
eight-year highs earlier this week.
	   The United States and Japan agreed to intervene to bolster the
yen amid concern a continued decline could spark a new round of
currency devaluations in the rest of Asia, throwing the region back
into financial turmoil.
	   The dollar had gained 15 yen against the Japanese currency since
the end of April, including 6 yen in the four trading days up to
Monday, when it peaked above 146 yen.
	   Initial reaction Thursday elsewhere in Asia to the intervention
was positive. Hong Kong leader Tung Chee Hwa said in Wellington,
New Zealand, that he was glad to see the yen had rebounded, adding
the key issue for the world economy was for Japan ``to move
forward.''
	   On Wall Street overnight, U.S. stocks rallied as investors saw
the intervention as a hopeful sign that authorities were acting to
keep the Asian financial crisis from worsening.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed 162.67 points higher at
8,827.96 on Wednesday, nearly wiping out the rest of Monday's
207-point slide.
	   Investors in Tokyo also welcomed the intervention as a signal
Japan's economic woes may finally have hit bottom.
	   ``The trend of the weakening yen has been checked and a euphoric
mood is prevailing on the market,'' said Yasuo Ueki of Nikko
Securities.
	   Among early gainers were shares in banks and trading companies,
which were sold recently due to those firms heavy exposure to other
Asian economies.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 44.20, or 3.82 percent, to 1,201.04. The TOPIX
closed up a marginal 0.37 points the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.285 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.240 percent, driving its price down to 111.36 yen from 111.70
yen.

Arabs to revive proposal for upgrading Palestinian status at U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
&AMP;Eds:
Eds: RECAPS pvs
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Frustrated over the U.S. failure to revive
the Middle East peace process, Arab states are asking the General
Assembly to reconsider a resolution upgrading the status of the PLO
observer mission.
	   Nasser al-Kidwa, the PLO observer at the United Nations, said
Arab ambassadors asked the General Assembly to schedule a debate on
the proposal next week, possibly Wednesday.
	   Other diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
that the request had been forwarded to the president of the General
Assembly, Hennady Udovenko, and a decision was expected soon.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization was granted observer
status in the General Assembly in 1974, enabling it to maintain an
office in New York but without the same privileges as missions of
U.N. member states.
	   The PLO's status was upgraded in 1988 when the General Assembly
decided to designate the PLO as ``Palestine.''
	   In December, the Arab states submitted a resolution that would
confer ``upon Palestine the same rights and privileges of
participation as those conferred upon member states, with the
exception of voting and candidature'' for office on U.N.
committees, such as the Security Council.
	   Israel and the United States strongly opposed the move.
	   During a debate in December, members of the European Union used
a parliamentary maneuver to derail a vote. They proposed that
Secretary-General Kofi Annan study the idea, a move that would have
shelved it indefinitely.
	   Faced with that prospect, the sponsors, led by Egypt, withdrew
the resolution. But with no sign of progress on Middle East peace,
the Arabs decided to bring the measure back before the 185-member
General Assembly, where no state has veto power.
	   The proposed new designation would make little difference in the
daily work of the Palestinian mission. But it would affirm
international support for the Palestinians in the protracted peace
process.
	   Resolutions favoring the Palestinians are routinely approved
with huge margins in the General Assembly.
	   Last December, for example, the General Assembly voted 160-2 to
reaffirm the right of the Palestinians to self-determination, with
only Israel and the United States casting negative votes.

Doctors say foreign brewers risk spreading AIDS in Cambodia 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo planned
By ANYA SCHIFFRIN
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Walk into a Cambodian restaurant or
bar, and here they come _ attractive ``beer girls'' wearing gowns
in colors of some of the biggest brands in brew.
	   Each is vying to sell a particular label _ Foster's, Stella
Artois, Heineken, Carlsberg, San Miguel, Tiger or Singha _ and
hopes the customer will pick her to pour his beer all night.
	   The problem is, the relationship often extends past closing
hours and health officials worry that foreign beer companies may be
inadvertently encouraging the spread of AIDS in Cambodia.
	   There are an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 beer girls, and an
estimated 80 percent have sex with clients, Ministry of Health
officials told Dow Jones Newswires recently.
	   ``We worry so much because the clients always consider the beer
girl is safer than other direct sex workers,,'' said Dr. Tia
Phalla, director of the ministry's AIDS program. ``But it's not
true.''
	   Some companies have strict rules against fraternization with
customers and send inspectors to enforce them. But many beer girls
sleep with clients, sometimes in exchange for money or gifts, or to
encourage sales.
	   The women, who say they are chosen for their good looks,
typically come from rural areas and get caught up in the capital's
night life. At one Phnom Penh restaurant, beer workers said sex
with customers is common. They also said they felt obliged to flirt
and drink with their customers.
	   Some, such as those employed by Australia's Foster's Brewing
Group Ltd., are paid commissions for extra sales. Foster's told Dow
Jones it has no rules on after-hours fraternization.
	   ``We take no responsibility for what the girls may do outside
working hours,'' said Malcolm Paul, the company's Hong Kong-based
regional director.
	   Paul noted that condoms to help prevent the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases are widely available in Cambodia and that his
employees are adults.
	   ``I don't think there is a pressure on the girls to get that
extra bonus, but it's a part of the job to make sure the guys and
the girls have a good time,'' Paul said.
	   Beer company officials say the women are essential to their
marketing efforts and are far more effective than billboards or
print and television advertising.
	   ``If the girls are not present at the point of consumption, all
the money spent on advertising goes down the drain,'' said Peter
Ong, managing director of Cambodia Brewery Ltd..
	   The company, a joint venture of Singapore-based Fraser and Neave
Ltd. and Dutch giant Heineken, has 600 women to market its Tiger,
ABC Stout and Anchor brands, but prohibits fraternizing with
customers.
	   Two years ago, the company, which has a 60 percent market share,
sent its workers to a ministry education course on AIDS and the
spread of the HIV virus that causes it.
	   Other prominent brewers either did not respond to written
requests for information or said they were unaware of how their
product in Cambodia is distributed.
	   Cambodia has one of the highest AIDS rates in Asia. According to
the U.S. aid agency Family Health International, there is a 3
percent infection rate among pregnant woman in Cambodia, compared
to 2 percent in Thailand, and less than 1 percent in China and
India.
	   The threat of AIDS may be greater for beer girls because they
don't consider themselves to be prostitutes and at risk. Only 9.6
percent said they always use condoms, compared with 42 percent of
prostitutes, according to a 1997 Ministry of Health study.
	   No one wants the companies to stop hiring beer girls, since jobs
paying dlrs 50 a month are hard to come by in Cambodia.
	   But the ministry wants beer companies to give safe-sex training
and perhaps free condoms to their saleswomen _ something the
ministry cannot afford to do.

Strawberry home run helps Yankees defeat Baltimore 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Darryl Strawberry hit a 465-foot (140-meter)
homer off Mike Mussina as the New York Yankees defeated Baltimore
5-3 Wednesday night to avert a three-game sweep.
	   Strawberry's 10th homer of the season, a three-run shot to
center in the first inning, was the longest in the seven-year
history of Camden Yards. The drive, which landed at the base of an
ivy-covered wall far behind the playing field, was two feet (60
cms) longer than a blast by Oakland's Pedro Munoz in 1996.
	   Joe Girardi also homered for the Yankees, who had not lost in 24
straight series before coming to Baltimore.
	   Andy Pettitte (8-5) allowed two runs and six hits in 7 1-3
innings. He struck out three and walked two in improving to 6-0
lifetime at Camden Yards and 8-1 overall against Baltimore.
	   Rafael Palmeiro and Joe Carter hit solo homers for the Orioles,
who were vying for their first three-game sweep of the Yankees
since 1991. Mussina (5-4) allowed five runs and eight hits in six
innings.
 &UR; Devil Rays 2, Blue Jays 1 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, with his brother watching him pitch
as a major leaguer for the first time since defecting from Cuba,
Rolando Arrojo got his ninth win.
	   Arrojo (9-4) was making his first home start since his brother,
Roberto, his mother, Uvendolina, and several other family members
fled the communist island earlier this month. Arrojo had left the
team last week to join them in Miami.
	   Arrojo gave up seven hits, struck out four and walked two in
eight innings. He became the fastest pitcher on an expansion team
to reach nine wins. The right-hander got win No. 9 in Tampa Bay's
69th game. Chris Hammond won his ninth game in Florida's 74th game
in 1993.
	   Juan Guzman (3-9) took the loss.
 &UR; Tigers 6, Twins 2 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Tony Clark homered from both sides of the plate for
the Tigers.
	   Clark hit a solo homer batting right-handed in the fourth inning
and a three-run blast from the left side in the seventh for the
Tigers, who won for just the fifth time in their last 17 games.
	   Todd Walker had three hits for the Twins, who had won six of
their previous nine.
	   Bryce Florie (5-2) allowed two runs on seven hits in 6 1-3
innings for Detroit.
	   Eric Milton (3-6) gave up three runs (one earned) on seven hits
in six innings.
 &UR; Red Sox 12, White Sox 5 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Mo Vaughn and Troy O'Leary each drove in three runs
as Boston won for the sixth time in seven games.
	   Vaughn had three hits, including a two-run homer. Nomar
Garciaparra had three hits and two RBIs for the Red Sox.
	   Tim Wakefield (8-3) joined teammate Pedro Martinez as an
eight-game winner. The knuckleballer gave up three hits in six
innings.
	   Tom Gordon pitched the final 1 2-3 innings for his 20th save.
	   Scott Eyre (1-7) gave up six runs and eight hits in 4 2-3
innings.
 &UR; Royals 4, Indians 3 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Jose Rosado won for the third time in four starts
despite being knocked out by a liner off his pitching arm.
	   Rosado (3-5) was in his first serious jam in the seventh when
David Bell ripped a hard liner off his left forearm. He left with a
bruised biceps muscle.
	   Matt Whisenant relieved and served up Kenny Lofton's three-run
homer to cut it to 4-3.
	   But the rally fell short for the AL Central-leading Indians, who
lost two of three to the Royals and stagger into a four-game series
against the Yankees. The teams were rained out twice in New York
last weekend, and Cleveland has lost five of six.
	   Dwight Gooden (1-3) hit two batters and was booed in a shaky
outing. He allowed four runs and eight hits in 5 2-3 innings.

Two airline unions call off strikes; third to walk off as planned 
</HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FACKLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Unions at two Japanese airlines called off planned
strikes Thursday, while the pilots union at a third airline pledged
to walk off June 23 if its demands are not met.
	   The flight crew union at Japan Airlines Co., the country's
largest airline, decided not to strike while it continues talks
with management about wage and safety disputes, a union spokesman
said.
	   The union is protesting a new salary system introduced in April
that cuts supplemental wages paid to attendants for long
international flights by as much as 80 percent, spokesman Akira
Noguchi said.
	   Flight attendants at No. 3 carrier Japan Air System Co. canceled
their strike after union representatives reached an agreement with
the airline over wage cuts, said union spokesman Yoshihiro Harima.
	   The union was planning to begin a strike Thursday that could
have canceled more than half of Japan Air System's domestic flights
and grounded 22,000 passengers, the union said.
	   The strike was averted after the two sides agreed to bonus cuts
that weren't as sharp as the airline had originally sought, Harima
said.
	   Meanwhile, the pilots union at All Nippon Airways, Japan's
second-largest airline, said it will go ahead as planned with a
strike slated to begin Monday at midnight, a union official said.
	   The strike would force flight cancellations on some of All
Nippon's international routes if it goes forward, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The pilots' union is demanding that All Nippon abandon a new
salary restructuring system introduced on April 1 that the pilots
say cuts their pay.
	   ANA pilots went on strike in early April, but suspended their
walkout before Japan's ``Golden Week'' holiday period between April
29 and May 5, a popular time for both international and domestic
travel. The walkout was limited to international routes.
	   During the two weeks prior to the holiday period, a total of
27,000 passengers were grounded or forced to find alternative
flights, and the airline suffered 4.2 billion yen (dlrs 31.8
million) in losses.
	   Labor disputes have flared up as Japanese airlines are forced by
deregulation to cut costs to compete with leaner U.S.-based
carriers.

might earn selling her story about the killing of a baby in her
care.
	   It was the first time she had set foot on her native British
soil since leaving for the United States in July 1996 to work as an
au pair.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Au Pair Louise Woodward arrived at Heathrow
Airport early Thursday from Boston with a manslaughter conviction
and a temporary injunction barring her from spending any money she
might earn selling her story about the killing of a baby in her
care.
	   It was the first time she had set foot on her native British
soil since leaving for the United States in July 1996 to work as an
au pair.
	   The British Airways flight 212 touched down at 4:36 a.m. (0336
GMT) and Ms. Woodward was expected to take a connecting flight to
Manchester Airport, where she was scheduled to hold a press
conference with her father, her lawyer and her local member of
Parliament.
	   Supporters in her home town of Elton, northwest England, were
meanwhile preparing for her return. She was traveling with her
father, first class.
	   Her arrival followed Tuesday's 4-3 ruling by the Massachusetts
high court that a lower court judge acted within his power last
November when he reduced her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had served since
her arrest.
	   Ms. Woodward had been ordered in November not to leave
Massachusetts while her case was under appeal with the state
Supreme Judicial Court.
	   She arrived at Boston's Logan International Airport on Wednesday
evening with a police escort and was ushered by seven state
troopers to a private room where she waited for her flight home.
	   The 20-year-old former au pair did not speak publicly as she
hurried past scores of passengers and reporters.
	   Defense lawyer Andrew Good bid his client an emotional goodbye
at the airport.
	   ``She said she would miss us and she's obviously excited to go
home,'' Good said. ``I'm relieved and pleased that she's going
home.''
	   Earlier in the day, as Ms. Woodward prepared to leave the United
States and 16 months of criminal problems behind, a federal judge
issued what could be a largely symbolic order temporarily barring
her from spending any money she makes from selling her story.
	   U.S. District Judge William Young ordered Ms. Woodward to notify
the court and the family of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen of any
contract she signs to profit from her sensational case. He also set
a trial date of Oct. 5 in the Eappen family's wrongful death
lawsuit against her.
	   Legal experts said any civil judgment would be tough to enforce
in England. The United States and Great Britain have no treaty that
would require British authorities to enforce any restrictions
against her.
	   Good cleared the way for her departure Wednesday when he picked
up her passport, which had been held at Middlesex Superior Court in
Cambridge.
	   Good said he and other attorneys for Ms. Woodward had
misunderstood when she could return home to Elton, England. Under
normal procedures, it would take 28 days for the courts to issue
the necessary paperwork, but lawyers for both sides asked that the
process be expedited.
	   It seems no one _ not even the man who prosecuted her for
first-degree murder _ wanted to keep her here any longer.
	   ``I want her out of this country,'' District Attorney Tom Reilly
said.
	   Prosecutors said she killed the baby by violently shaking him
and slamming his head against a hard surface. Ms. Woodward's
attorneys argued that the baby's brain injuries occurred three
weeks before he was hospitalized on Feb. 4, 1997. He died five days
later.
	   The case, followed by millions around the world, highlighted the
difficult issues of parental responsibility for child care,
especially among two-career parents.

Golden Triangle town becoming haven for Asia's stolen cars 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MAE SAI, Thailand (AP) _ Hundreds of automobiles stolen in
Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore are being smuggled through this
Golden Triangle frontier area into Myanmar for use by drug lords,
army officers and others, Thai police say.
	   The trade enables the rich and powerful living in the remote,
mountainous area _ one of the world's top production zones of opium
and heroin _ to buy a Mercedes-Benz or comfortable four-wheel-drive
vehicles relatively cheaply.
	   Such vehicles would be far more expensive to obtain legitimately
in the main legal port of entry, the Myanmar capital of Yangon, and
would take a beating on the country's cratered roads to reach the
Triangle area hundreds of kilometers (miles) away.
	   A senior Thai officer monitoring the crossing between the towns
of Mae Sai and Tachilek in Myanmar, also known as Burma, told The
Associated Press this week that more than 800 stolen cars have been
registered by Myanmar authorities this year.
	   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that most
of the cars have been bought by high-ranking Myanmar army officers,
along with ethnic minority warlords and drug traffickers.
	   He said the vast majority are four-wheel drive pickups, while a
handful are luxury European cars. Most roads outside Tachilek
itself are extremely rough and virtually impassable in the rainy
season.
	   The officer said there are 20 locations in Mae Sai district
where cars can be surreptitiously driven across the usually shallow
Sai river to Myanmar, one of Asia's poorest countries.
	   Another police spokesman said more than 20 stolen automobiles
have been confiscated in the past year by officers in Mae Sai, some
680 kilometers (422 miles) north of Bangkok.
	   It is virtually impossible to get stolen cars back from Myanmar,
the spokesman said.
	   Myanmar is not the only destination for stolen autos coming from
Thailand. Laos and Cambodia, especially, are also markets for hot
cars. Thai police say that gangs in Cambodia often buy cars stolen
to order in Bangkok, favoring Honda Civics and Accords.
	   Although much legal commerce also take place, the area has been
a major smuggling route for decades. The Golden Triangle, where the
borders of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos converge, produces 60 percent
of the heroin found on the streets of the United States.
	   Though Myanmar's military government has extended its control
over the area somewhat in recent years, heroin production is still
going strong and the ethnic minority armies that make most of it
have branched into amphetamines.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ John Jaha's three-run homer in the seventh inning
Wednesday gave the Milwaukee Brewers a 6-5 victory over the Chicago
Cubs, who couldn't win despite another home run from Sammy Sosa and
a pair of two-run shots by Jose Hernandez.
	   Sosa's homer across Waveland Avenue in the fourth inning was his
16th homer in 18 games and 25th this year. That ties him for second
in the National League with Atlanta's Andres Galarraga. Mark
McGwire of St. Louis leads the majors with 31.
	   Bronswell Patrick (2-0), relieved in the second inning after
starter Scott Karl strained his groin, and gave up two hits and
three runs in 4 2-3 innings for his second career victory. Bob
Wickman got the final four outs for his fifth save.
	   Kevin Tapani (8-5) gave up 10 hits and six runs in seven innings
for the loss.
 &UR; Giants 6, Rockies 3
	   In San Francisco, Kirk Rueter pitched six strong innings and
Rich Aurilia hit a tie-breaking two-run homer in the sixth as the
Giants rallied to beat the Colorado Rockies 6-3.
	   Darryl Kile (5-10), an offseason free-agent acquisition after a
19-victory campaign for Houston, lost his seventh straight game.
	   Kile, whose 10 losses lead the NL, went six innings and allowed
six runs on 10 hits. He walked four and struck out three.
	   Rueter (8-3) settled down to pitch five scoreless innings after
allowing three runs in the first. Rueter, who leads the Giants with
eight wins, gave up five hits _ four in the first _ while striking
out three and walking two in winning for the fifth time in six
decisions.
	   Robb Nen got three outs for his 21st save. He has converted 17
straight and 21 out of 22 opportunities.
 &UR; Phillies 3, Pirates 1
	   In Philadelphia, Curt Schilling allowed only two hits as the
Phillies won their fourth straight, 3-1, over the Pittsburgh
Pirates.
	   Schilling (7-7) struck out 10 and walked one as the Phillies
swept a three-game series with the Pirates, who have lost five of
their last six. Schilling leads the majors with seven complete
games and 157 strikeouts. It was Schilling's 10th game this season
with 10 or more strikeouts and 39th of his career.
	   Schilling, who has gone at least seven innings in 15 of his 16
starts, also contributed at the plate, laying down a two-out bunt
single that scored Bobby Abreu and gave the Phillies a two-run lead
in the sixth.
	   Jason Kendall got both Pirate hits, a single in the first and a
solo homer in the fourth. The Pirates were swept by the Phillies
for the first time since a three-game sweep July 26-27, 1995.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 4, Reds 1 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Jay Bell homered and drove in two runs and Devon
White hit his first right-handed homer of the season as Arizona
beat slumping Cincinnati.
	   The new kids on the block have outplayed baseball's oldest
professional team while winning the first two games of their
series. Arizona will try for the first three-game sweep in
franchise history on Thursday.
	   The back-to-back wins are the first by the Diamondbacks since
June 1-2. They've won as many as three in a row only twice during
their inaugural season.
	   The Reds have lost four in a row and 12 of their last 15,
falling a season-low 12 games under .500 at 30-42.
 &UR; Braves 6, Marlins 2 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Greg Maddux pitched a four-hitter to become the
majors' first 10-game winner.
	   Maddux (10-2) held Florida to a pair of unearned runs as his ERA
dropped to 1.62, second-best in the NL. The four-time Cy Young
winner has allowed two runs or fewer in 10 straight starts and 14
of 16 this season.
	   It was Maddux's fourth complete game of the season and the
Braves' third consecutive complete game, something they hadn't done
since 1995.
	   Florida lost its 11th straight on the road and fell 27 1/2 games
behind Atlanta in the NL East.
 &UR; Expos 5, Mets 4 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Brad Fullmer's RBI single with two outs in the
ninth off Mel Rojas gave the Montreal Expos a win over the New York
Mets.
	   Fullmer's sinking liner fell in front of diving center fielder
Brian McRae to score Shane Andrews and help the Expos snap a
three-game losing streak.
	   McRae had tied it in the top of the inning with a leadoff homer
against Ugueth Urbina (4-2).
 &UR; Astros 6, Cardinals 5 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Jeff Bagwell hit a game-tying two-run homer and Brad
Ausmus capped the four-run, ninth-inning rally with an RBI single.
	   Mark McGwire hit his major league-leading 32nd homer and drove
in his NL-leading 81st run for the Cardinals.
	   The Astros trailed 5-2 before rallying in the ninth against Jeff
Brantley (0-4), who got his fourth blown save in 14 chances.
	   C.J. Nitkowski (2-2) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win.

career mark to 3-1 against Texas, where he played from 1989-95.
	   He took a shutout into the eighth inning before giving up a
two-run homer to Roberto Kelly. Billy Taylor pitched the ninth for
his 13th save.
	   The Rangers have lost six of seven.
