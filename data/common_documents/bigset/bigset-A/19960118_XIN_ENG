<HEADLINE> Algeria Beats Sierra Leone 2-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Algeria beat Sierra Leone
2-0 in the 20th African Nations' Cup group b soccer match at Free
State Stadium in Bloemfontein today.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's two goals were both scored by striker Ali Messabih
in the 45th and 63rd minutes. It is the first time for the north
Africa's desert warriors to defeat the west Africans since 1982
in the cup's history.
</P>
<P>
Both teams attacked the other from the very start, but the
difference between the two was Algeria's ability to finish their
attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Goal shooting is a great problem," said Sierra Leone's coach
Roger Palmgren speaking of his side.
</P>
<P>
"We can play the ball on to the goal line but we cannot
shoot," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Algerian coach Ali Fergani attributed today's victory
to tactics.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is now leading group b with three points from the two
games, ahead of Sierra Leone two points from two games and Zambia
one point from one match.
</P>
<P>
Algeria and Zambia played to a goaless draw in the group b's
opening match on Sunday, while Sierra Leone defeated Burkina Faso
2-1 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 20th African Cup of Nations Soccer Tournament began on
January 13 in Johannesburg. Fifteen African teams took part in
the continent's biggest sports event.

<HEADLINE> TB Resurrects Because Of AIDS, Says WHO Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- About 300 million people will
be infected with tuberculosis (TB) in the next decade, the latest
World Health Organisation (WHO) report says.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 90 million will have developed full-blown disease and
30 million will have died of it, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The report says about three million people will die of the
disease annually, accounting for seven percent of all the deaths
in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It says one person is infected with TB virus per second in the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The report says the resurgence of TB, which has almost been
wiped out with the discovery of anti-biotics, is a result of the
Aids epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The air-transmitted disease accounts for more than 25 percent
of all the adults deaths that could have been prevented,

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Policemen Begin Deploying For Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Palestinian
policemen began deploying this afternoon around almost 1,700
polling stations throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The policemen will police the Palestinian elections on
Saturday. Three uniformed policemen will be stationed at each
polling booth and one of them is armed with a pistol.
</P>
<P>
The deployment has been in coordination with the Israeli
military authorities and will continue through Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most outstanding issues between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority over the elections have been reportedly resolved. It
was agreed at a meeting between Maj.-Gen. Oren Shahor,
Coordinator of Government activities in the Territories, and Abu
Mazen, Head of the Palestinian Central Election Commission, that
local municipal inspectors in Hebron will oversee the voting.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors will not be in uniform, nor will they carry
weapons. They will also be deployed at polling stations in areas
still under Israel's control in the West Bank, as well as in post
offices in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In east Jerusalem, some 4,500 Palestinian voters will cast
their votes in five Israeli-run post offices. The rest will go
voting outside the Jerusalem municipality boundary. The Jerusalem
police will be responsible for security of the elections in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of right-wing groups, who are planning to
protest the elections in east Jerusalem, announced today they
will not disrupt the elections.

<HEADLINE> Polish President Says Integration with EU Is One of Poland's  Primary Objectives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- President of Poland Aleksander
Kwasniewski said here today that integration with the European
Union(EU) has constantly been one of his country's primary
objectives.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the President and the members of the
European Commission(EC) today in Brussels, Kwasniewski said that
EU's enlargement was the way of "securing a greater role for
Europe in global politics and the world economy".
</P>
<P>
In his address, he said that the accession of new countries to
the EU "should be seen as a process of historical and strategic
relevance for the whole of the continent, a process which will
reveal new perspectives and opportunities".
</P>
<P>
The Polish President said that Poland has already met a great
majority of the criteria for membership in the EU, adding that the
EU membership would provide an impetus for further development and
an instrument for strengthening his country's presence in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"It is time... to start bilateral dialogue which will help the
Commission prepare the views for (accession) negotiations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged that EU's principle of transparency of the
integration process "should be extended to the citizens of the
applicant countries".
</P>
<P>
Belgium is the last leg of the new Polish President's tour in
west Europe after visiting France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here in Brussels, President Kwasniewski has
also met with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, the King of

<P>
LUSAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Director-General of
the Food and Agriculture Organization (Fao) Jacques Diouf today
said the world food situation has been deteriorating as 800
million people are experiencing food shortage.
</P>
<P>
While paying a courtesy call on Zambian deputy Foreign
Minister Peter Machungwa in Lusaka, Diouf said his organization
plans to host a world food summit from November 13 to 17, at
which the heads of state can discuss the world food situation.
</P>
<P>
Another meeting will be held in April at ministerial level in
Burkina Faso to devise an African way of solving the food problem
in the continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the world's population is growing everyday, there is
need to find a permanent solution to the food problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Fao chief, who arrived here today for a
three-day visit, said his tour of Zambia will afford him an
opportunity to analyse the food situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped to hold fruitful consultative meetings with
Zambian officials on how to find solutions to the deteriorating
food situation in Zambia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Profile of New Greek Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Costas Simitis was elected new
Greek prime minister today in the ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (PASOK) parliamentary group to replace PASOK leader
Andreas Papandreou who resigned as prime minister on Monday for
health reason.
</P>
<P>
Born in Piraeus in 1936, Simitis followed the family law
tradition by studying law in germany. He went on to study economics
at the london school of economics before returning to Greece in 1965.
</P>
<P>
Following the military take-over in 1967, Simitis and others
jointly founded the the "democratic defense" organization to fight
the military junta.
</P>
<P>
He was persecuted by the junta for, among other things, planting
bombs, and escaped abroad where he joined Panhellenic Liberation
Movement (PAK), the precursor to today's PASOK.
</P>
<P>
He subsequently became a university lecturer in germany. He
returned to Athens in 1974 and was a co-founder of PASOK.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, in the first PASOK government, he was appointed
agriculture minister, a post which he retained until 1985.
Immediately afterwards, he became national economy minister.
In 1993 he took over the commerce and industry portfolio, only
to resign from the ministry and from PASOK's executive bureau
following a clash with Andreas Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
Simitis is renowned for his cool-headedness. He is married to
Daphne Arcadiou and has two daughters.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Flee Fighting in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Rwandan refugees
are fleeing toward Burundi's border with Tanzania today after the
outbreak of fierce fighting in northeast Burundi forced the
closure of their camp, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"As of last night Mugano camp has been closed and doesn't
exist any more because of very heavy fighting in the area," said
Mise Hitoshi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (Unhcr) head in
the Burundi capital of Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
"Only a few hundred refugees remain in the camp and 15,000
refugees are moving toward the Tanzanian border through fear of
fighting," Hitoshi said. The border is six kilometers east of
Mugano.
</P>
<P>
"There are no reports of humanitarian or civilian casualties
so far but we don't know who the fighting is between. Civilians
and refugees are not believed to have been implicated," Hitoshi
said.
</P>
<P>
Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army are fighting a civil
war centred in northern Burundi, which is also the site of most
refugee camps for some 152,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 Rwandan refugees tried to flee insecurity in
northeastern Burundi last April, and their exodus was stopped by
Tanzanian troops deployed on the border to block them.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 refugees however managed to cross into Tanzania,
which argues it is already overwhelmed by 750,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan Hutus fled to troubled Burundi in 1994 during the
genocide of about half a million Tutsis and Hutu moderates by
Hutu troops, militiamen and mobs. Most say they fear being killed
in reprisal for the mass slaughter if they return home.
</P>
<P>
The camp was closed after Unhcr leader Sadako Ogata said she
wanted an urgent mission sent to Burundi to investigate security
measures including deployment of guards to protect UN staff.
</P>
<P>
While reporting to UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali
on her visit to Burundi this month, Ogata also suggested that
military observers from the Organization of African Unity might
serve as liasion between aid groups and the Burundi military.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali, presenting his report based on Ogata's visit,
warned the security council yesterday that there is a real danger
Burundi might again explode into ethnic violence on a massive
scale.
</P>
<P>
"I continue to believe that it is imperative for the
international community to launch a major initiative to prevent
another tragedy in the subregion as well as to promote a dialogue
embracing all elements of the Burundi politicalion spectrum," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief has suggested guards for aid workers as well as a
rapid-reaction military force of 4,000 peacekeepers stationed in
neighboring Zaire. Key security council members such as the US
and Britain have rejected any peacekeeping force at this time but
said they would accept guards.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 people of a population of about 6 million have
been killed in the last two years since the killing of Burundi's
first freely-elected Hutu president by Tutsi troops.
</P>
<P>
Most agencies pulled out of north Burundi last month after a
wave of attacks but some including the Unhcr and the
International Red Cross resumed work in the last two weeks.

<HEADLINE> OAU Makes Early Warning System Recommendation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) today "strongly recommends that the envisaged
early warning system should function under the exclusive control
and responsibility of the OAU and its policy making organs".
</P>
<P>
In a "summary record" adopted at the end of a four-day
seminar, the OAU said that "the seminar recommends close
monitoring of socio-economic indicators in order to plan for
early action".
</P>
<P>
Adverse socio-economic conditions and environmental
degradation have been manifested in many parts of Africa as
serious early warning signals, which require effective short and
long-term strategic planning for sustainable development,
the document said.
</P>
<P>
An early warning system would benefit the continent by
providing a framework for "actual and timeous implementaiton of
appropriate diplomatic and preventive action," according to the
document.
</P>
<P>
The OAU seminar also "recommends that the OAU should consider
publishing an annual survey of conflicts on the continent".
</P>
<P>
The organization appealed to the international community to
continue all possible financial and technical assistance to
ensure the realization of an early warning system in Africa and
other objectives of the OAU.

<HEADLINE> EC to Set Up Representative Office in Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
is going to set up a representative office in Sarajevo to
administer the "Essential Aid Programme" for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference this afternoon, Van den Broek, the EC
Commissioner responsible for foreign affairs in Europe, told
reporters that a EC convoy of vehicles will leave for Sarajevo
tomorrow, carring equipment and personnel to set up the EC's
representative office in the city.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Office will administer the "Essential Aid
Programme" outlined by the First Donor's Meeting on the
Reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina held in Brussels on December
20-21, 1995.
</P>
<P>
At this first donor's meeting, 50 countries and 27
organizations pledged between them some 500 million U.S. dollars
earmarked for use in the first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commissioner, the Office, which will be headed
by Joannes ter Haar, the EC's Special Envoy to Bosnia-Herzegovina,
will help set up a framework of donor coordination, in conjunction
with the World Bank, and will liaise with central and local
authorities to establish medium and long term reconstruction
strategy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Van den Broek said, the office will set up close
coordination with the various agencies involved in the
reconstruction process, and "especially with the International
Management Group and the office of the High Representative, Mr.
Carl Bildt".
</P>
<P>
He said that out of European Union funds up to one billion
ECU(about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars) could be earmarked for
reconstruction purposes in the war-thorn areas of former
Yugoslavia for the four years 1996 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
"This is entirely separate from the humanitarian aid given to
ex-Yugoslavia by ECHO(European Community Humanitarian Office)," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi: It Is Hard to Clear Arab Atmosphere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
said today at Sidi Barrani near the Egyptian-Libyan border that it
is hard to clear the Arab atmosphere and achieve inter-Arab
reconciliation at present.
</P>
<P>
At a brief joint press conference held with Mubarak following
their three-hour meeting at the Sidi Barrani military base, some
80 kilometers east of the border, Gaddafi accused some Arab
countries of calling for division of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He warned the Arab countries of challenges facing the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
Because of the air ban, Gaddafi traveled by land to Egypt
earlier today on his first visit to the neighboring country since
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told reporters that he discussed with the Libyan head
of state the current situation in the Arab world, inter-Arab
cooperation and other Arab issues.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he never stopped consultations with Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps it has been a long time since we last met ... but our
talks were maintained either through the phone or via messages
dispatched by delegates," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said that they could not get into
details during their talks because the time was too limited.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi accused Sudan of sponsoring terrorism though he said
that his country enjoys a normal relationship with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He added that Libya is trying to use the normal relationship to
heal the rift between Sudan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had been expected to discuss the Libya-West
crisis, but neither of them commented on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on
Libya in April 1992 after Libya refused to comply with a Western
demand for extraditing two Libyan nationals, who were suspected of
bombing a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988. A total of 270 people were killed in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain insist that the suspects be tried
in the U.S. or Britain while Libya insists that they be tried in a
neutral country or in the International Court of Justice in the
Hague.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Gaddafi denied there is any problem
related to the Egyptian workforce in Libya.
</P>
<P>
"All Arabs and Libyans in the country live and work together
without any problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian press have accused the Libyan authorities of their
ill treatment to the Egyptians working in Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader told the news conference that Libya has great
potentials in its investments in Egypt, which he said has created
a very appropriate atmosphere for investments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif, who
accompanied Gaddafi from the border to the military base before
the talks, said that the visit by Gaddafi came within the context
of the "strong and close" relations between Egypt and Libya.
</P>
<P>
After the press conference, Gaddafi left for home in his
car, which drove away to el-Saloum border checkpoint on the way to
Libya.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls For Budget Talks Resumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday urged Republican congressional leaders to resume
high-level talks, saying a balanced budget "is clearly within our
grasp".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Clinton said, "My door is open. It is
open. It will stay open. I am committed to continue working with
them until we get the job done."
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders canceled a scheduled White House meeting on
Wednesday, asking for a firm budget offer from Clinton that can
get bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
White House aides said Clinton was considering unveiling a new
budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said a budget deal is still possible because both sides
already have agreed to enough budget cuts. Policy differences,
such as how Medicare is funded, can wait until the election, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We already have agreement on way more than enough budget
savings to balance this budget," Clinton said. "It is wrong for us
to defer this."
</P>
<P>
Both sides said that they were prepared to go back to the
negotiating table when the circumstances were right.
</P>
<P>
Clinton on Wednesday talked on the phone for 40 minutes to
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, Gingrich and House Majority
Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
Dole said the president was "forthcoming" and "did indicate
some flexibility," but adding, "We indicated to the president that
we didn't see any real purpose in going to the White House unless
he had some new proposal to give us."
</P>
<P>
The two sides remain divided over the level of Medicare and
Medicaid savings, the extent of a tax cut and Republican plans to
enact fundamental changes to federal health and welfare systems.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Sign Cooperation Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Israel signed four
agreements on cooperation between them in Aqaba today, completing
the signing of all agreements in accordance with their peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
The agreements, which are the last batch of a total of 13
agreements required to be signed under the 1994 Jordanian-Israeli
historic peace treaty, cover the areas of science and culture,
telecommunications and maritime boundary as well as the
Aqaba-Eilat development program.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, who arrived in Aqaba earlier today, attended the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti and his Israeli
counterpart Ehud Barak signed the science and culture accord,
while communications ministers of both countries put their
signatures on the telecommunications agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two other accords, on maritime boundary and the
Aqaba-Eilat development program respectively, were also signed by
officials from the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The four agreements will pave the way for further cooperation
between the two countries, said Radio Jordan.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, the Crown Prince and the Israeli prime
minister delivered speeches assessing the Middle East peace
process and bilateral relations under the peace treaty. They also
evaluated the importance of the coming phases in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following their speeches, all the participants in the ceremony
went to the neighboring Israeli port city of Eilat for a dinner
hosted by Peres in honor of the Crown Prince and his 250-member
delegation of officials, diplomats and journalists.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on transportation signed Tuesday was widely
acclaimed here as the "linchpin" of all the agreements signed
between the two countries, because it consolidates the eight other
cooperation agreements signed before, including a trade agreement
and an agreement on tourism.
</P>
<P>
The transport agreement permits the flow of goods to the
Palestinian self-rule areas and facilitates the exchange of goods
and tourists between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The other bilateral accords signed last year include those on
health and medicine, energy, environment protection, agriculture,
border crossing points and combating crime and drugs.

</P>
<P>
Emerging from the talks with President Museveni, Moi said from
now on, Kenya and Uganda will work together for the benefit of

He pointed out that their meeting opened greater vision for
East African cooperation both economically and politically.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Publish White Paper on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
today that it will publish a White Paper setting out its stance on
Europe ahead of the Inter-governmental Conference (IGC).
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind is quoted by the BBC
television as saying the Paper would draw together strands of
policy on Europe, but it would not reveal the Government's hand
before the conference.
</P>
<P>
The IGC conference, due to be held in Italy in March, is aimed
at reviewing the operation of the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a significant victory for Euro-sceptic
Tories who are anxious to limit the Government's room in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leading Tory Euro-sceptic Bill Cash has welcomed the
Gvernment's decision to publish the White Paper, saying the move
would "remove a great deal of uncertainty" about its European
policy.
</P>
<P>
Bill Walker MP is quoted as saying that he was delighted
lawmakers would get the chance to debate the White Paper and put
their views on the IGC conference.

<HEADLINE> Ciller Says Turkey Tries to Peacefully Settle Ferry Hijacking in Black Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish caretaker Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller today strongly condemned the violence of the ferry
hijacking in the Black Sea on Turkey's territory and said her
government was trying to settle this incident peacefully.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the CNN, Ciller said that the
Turkish government were working "around o'clock" to watch the
situation that a group of Chechen militants have been hijacking
"Avrasya" ferryboat and taking over 200 Russian and Turkish
passengers as hostages.
</P>
<P>
Two Turkish assault boats have been following the ferryboat,
hijacked Tuesday night in the Black Sea port of Trabzon,
northeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said: "We have taken all possible measures to prevent
the bloodshed. We want to solve this problem through
persuasion. We will not resort to force unless absolutely be
necessary."
</P>
<P>
"We are in constant touch with the Russian authorities to
inform them all the aspects of our efforts" in a bid to solve the
ferry hijacking peacefully, she added.
</P>
<P>
But Ciller feels that what is happening in Turkey is related to
the Chechen situation.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that it would not have taken place if the Chechen
question had been brought to a peaceful and satisfactory end as
well," she said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has historical and cultural ties with Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Muhammed Tokcan, leader of the hijackers, said that they would
release the hostages on board when the hijacked ship reaches
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
However, Ciller pointed out the Turkish government would not
allow the hijacked ferryboat to reach the Bosphorus Strait,
saying that Turkey would persuade the hijackers to stop around
Eregli, about 100 miles east of Istanbul.

<HEADLINE> Britain Makes Surprise Interest Rate Cut by 0.25% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England announced on
Thursday an unexpected cut in its principal interest rate of 0.25
percent to 6.25 percent, the second reduction in two months.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke cited easing
inflationary pressures and sluggish growth as a justification for
the rate cut.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement the decision was made "in the light of
evidence confirming that inflationary pressures have continued to
ease".
</P>
<P>
"The economy is continuing to grow, but at a rate which is
clearly below trend. Activity has slowed more sharply in many of
our major export markets particularly in Europe, and this is
contributing to slower growth at home." Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
The cut came one day after Bank of England Governor Eddie
George held his regular monthly meeting with Clarke on Wednesday,
and barely five weeks after the last reduction on December 13.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed the release of economic figures which
showed that high street spending rose 0.4 percent last month, well
below City analysts' predictions of a 0.7 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The slow economic growth and moderate inflation had made
analysts expected a further cut in interest rate, but few had
expected the cut to come so soon after December's reduction of
0.25%.
</P>
<P>
The move was welcomed by business leaders. "The cut should
underpin a pickup in consumer spending and support business
confidence, which has weakened since the middle of last year,"
said Adair Turner, director general of the Confederation of
British Industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
here today called on all farmers to maintain rice self-sufficiency
in the country.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after presenting awards to farmers and
local officials who have succeeded in implementing the rice
self-sufficiency program.
</P>
<P>
Since rice production is still prone to natural disasters, said
the president, the progress in development process also presents
new challenges.
</P>
<P>
On efforts to increase food production, Soeharto said that it
is not only aimed to meet the demand of the people but also to
increase the income of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian head of state also stressed the importance of
improving the skills of farmers.
</P>
<P>
"The success of agricultural development is determined by the
farmers' skills. So, they should learn and master effective
technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, once the biggest rice importing country in the
world, became rice-sufficiency in 1984.

apartment, forced some panicked occupants to leap from upper
stories of the eight-story Lake Grove Village apartment building
on Chicago's South Side.

<P>
Fire fighters arrived in time to rescue about 60 people from
the burning building.
</P>
<P>
The fire was brought under control in about 90 minutes, but the
cause was still under investigation. Officials believed that the
blaze might have been caused by careless use of smoking materials.

<HEADLINE> Duma's New Speaker Offers Cooperation With Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Communist Gennady Seleznyov, the
new speaker of the Russian parliament's lower house, said today
that he will cooperate with the president and prime minister "in a
constructive way."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the relationship between himself, President Boris
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as "a businesslike
triangle," he said he is obliged to cooperate with the head of
state and government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the information reaching Yeltsin's desk 'is
carefully filtered and for this reason it will be probably
interesting for him to hear the view of not only the house speaker
but also the representatives of the left-wing forces which won the
general elections."
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov was elected Wednesday as speaker of the State Duma
after the Communist Party, led by Gennady Zyuganov, won 157 seats
in the 450-seat Duma elections held last month.
</P>
<P>
The speaker urged the strengthening of economic ties with the
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and stressed
the need to tighten legislative sanctions against terrorists in
response to the recent hostage-takings by Chechen militants within
and outside Russia.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Petroleum Law Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China is quickening its pace of
drawing up its Petroleum Law, in a bid to ensure the sustained and
sound development of the oil industry through legal means.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China National
Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), the Chinese government has all along
paid great attention to the drawing up of the petroleum law and
has empowered the CNPC to work out the draft.
</P>
<P>
Over more than one year of survey and study, the CNPC has
worked out the draft and delivered it to the Bureau of Legislative
Affairs of the State Council for examination.
</P>
<P>
He said that for a long time the country's oil sector has been
governed by administrative means, which can not standardize the
relations between oil enterprises and the state as well as other
relevant departments in the exploration and utilization of oil and
gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
The official mentioned that despite the eight specific
administrative rules the country has laid down in administering
the petroleum sector, many aspects of the sector still have no
rules to abide by.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the existing rules and regulations have proved less
efficient and less compatible with the actual situation of the
petroleum sector.
</P>
<P>
The official said that public security is worsening in the
areas near oilfields. The crude oil and related goods and
materials stolen every year in the country's oilfields cause
losses totalling one billion yuan. Oil enterprises lack a safe and
stable production environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thus, it is imperative for the country to make a petroleum law
that suits the actual development of the oil industry and matches
international practices, the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the petroleum law will be
promulgated at an early date.

<HEADLINE> Largest Women's Organization Calls for More Equality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The equality between men and
women is protected by law and must not be violated, said the title
of a front-page article carried by the "China Women's News"
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In this follow-up story about female college students being
refused jobs by government employers, Chen Muhua, chairperson of
the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF), was quoted as saying that
more policies and laws should be formulated to protect women's
right to work.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is also vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, asked news media to supervise
ministries and departments, saying that to refuse to employ women
or limit their development is against China's basic policy of
equality between males and females and is against the Law on
Protection of Women's Rights and Interests.
</P>
<P>
ACWF vice-chairperson Huang Qizao was quoted as saying that the
ACWF pays great attention to the problem and is preparing active
countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
The "China Women's News" disclosed on January 8 that 27
ministries and departments had refused to employ or placed limits
on employing female college graduates at a talent exchange fair
held by the Ministry of Personnel over the first weekend this year.
</P>
<P>
Huang reaffirmed that action is and will be taken in realizing
equality between men and women. She said that the Chinese
government has made promises.
</P>
<P>
"Made them, and carried them out too," Huang stressed, asking
departments and units, governmental and non-governmental
organizations to work to keep these promise.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Peng Peiyun wrote to Minister of Personnel
Song Defu urging him to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The first female personnel market in China went into operation
recently in Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The market, aiming to give full play to women's talents, has so
far drawn more than 2,000 women to compete for over 800 positions
offered by 50 units. Co-sponsored by the personnel department of
the provincial government and a local company, the personnel
market will provide employment information and handle the
necessary formalities for both job seekers and employers.

<HEADLINE> hke011870 --Indian Opposition Launch Counterattack Over Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- India's major opposition
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) today launched a counter-offensive
against Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao on the multi-crore
rupee Hawala scandal, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Lucknow, capital of Uttar
Pradesh state, Atal Behari Vajpayee, BJP leader in the lower house
of parliament, said that Prime Minister Rao too had received money
from the suspected Hawala dealers.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the entire progress report of the Hawala case
be made public to bring to light the results of the investigation
conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) so far.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the CBI had recorded a statement of one of the
suspects involved in the Hawala case alleging that 30 million
rupees (838,000 US dollars) had been paid to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman of the ruling Congress-I today dismissed
the BJP charges as without any substance, according to PTI.
</P>
<P>
Hawala trade is a system of bypassing the official foreign
exchange channel in India. CBI investigation of a Hawala case in
1991 revealed that dozens of politicians allegedly received
kickbacks for awarding lucrative contracts in the power sector to
foreign companies from a Hawala trader and his brothers.
</P>
<P>
After a prolonged five year investigation, the CBI Tuesday
filed charge sheets against seven leading politicians, including
BJP President L.K. Advani, and sought the president's sanction to
prosecute three sitting cabinet ministers for their involvement in
the 65-crore rupee scandal.

NANJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A heavy snowfall seldom seen in
the past decade has changed east China's Nanjing City into an icy
world, where the traffic, however, was reported normal because of
a citywide snow-clearing drive.
</P>

A cold front from north China brought 10-28 mm of snowfall to
east China from Wednesday morning, including such big cities as
Shanghai, Hangzhou and Wuhan. Data from the meteorological
department of Jiangsu Province showed that it was the heaviest
snowfall since 1984.
</P>
<P>
The city government of Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu, had made a

officials, workers, residents, policemen and soldiers were
involved in sweeping snow this morning. As a result, all major
streets were cleared before 8:00 am.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Explains Delay in Hostage-Freeing Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today said the hostage-freeing operation in Pervomaiskoye took
longer than expected because the Chechen separatists had created a
well-armed stronghold with a warren of underground passages in the
village.
</P>
<P>
"When I said that the operation would take one day, we did not
know that a stronghold of (separatist Chechen leader Dzhokhar)
Dudayev had been created underground (the village) long ago,"
Yeltsin told a news conference today.
</P>
<P>
In the end, it took the Russian forces four days to wipe out
the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said piles of weapons and underground passages linking
houses in the Dagestani village near the Chechen border had
complicated the situation.
</P>
<P>
The president earlier announced the hostage-freeing operation
has been successfully completed and that all the Chechen militants
in Pervomaiskoye had been killed.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 250 Chechens, headed by Dudayev's son-in-law
Salman Raduyev, sneaked into the Dagestani city of Kizlyar on
January 9 and took more than 3,000 people hostage.
</P>
<P>
The militants were stopped at Pervomaiskoye on their way back
to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Russian military launched a full-scale attack on
the Chechen militants, but only finally claimed success in wiping
out the separatists on Thursday after pounding the village with
rockets.

<HEADLINE> All Chechen Militants in Pervomaiskoye Killed: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- All the Chechen militants in the
Daghestani village of Pervomaiskoye have been killed and the next
target for the federal forces will be the strongholds of the
separatists in Chechnya, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
today.
</P>
<P>
All the bandits were eliminated, unless they had gone into
hiding underground, said Yeltsin at a news conference held in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 250 militants headed by Salman Raduyev, the
son-in-law of separatist Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, were
trapped in the village on Monday when the Russian special forces
and Interior troops began their hostage-freeing operation.
</P>
<P>
"We taught Dudayev good lesson and now we have to deal a blow
to his strongholds where there is no civilian population in order
to put an end to terrorism on Russian soil," Yeltsin added.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It (terrorism) has already spread to Turkey. This is
already international terrorism. This cannot be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the hostage-freeing operation was
conducted with "minimal" loss of lives among the civilians and the
federal military.
</P>
<P>
According to Yeltsin, 82 hostages were freed and 18 are
reported missing. The missing were considered alive rather than
dead. The president said: "They could be in hiding or have run
away."
</P>
<P>
He put the Russian military death toll at 26. Two out of the
250 "Alpha" (special forces) commandos were wounded, he said. The
casualty figure came from a report by his Security Minister
Mikhail Barsukov and Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began on January 9 when Chechen militants stormed
into the Dagestani city of Kizlyar and took over 3,000 people
hostage.
</P>
<P>
After releasing most of hostages, the Chechens were allowed to
leave the city. The separatists, however, were stopped at
Pervomaiskoye not far from the Dagestani-Chechen border on January
10.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Russian special forces and Interior troops,
backed by tanks, artillery and helicopter gunships, launched a
full-scale attack against the Chechen militants holding some 100
hostages.

ISLAMABAD, January 18 (Xinhua) -- UN special envoy to
Afghanistan Mehmud Mestiri said in Kabul today that he would
persuade Taliban to stop rocketing the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
Reports coming from Kabul quoted Mestiri as saying, "I am sure
that Taliban cannot take over Kabul militarily."
</P>
<P>
Taliban wanted to frighten Kabul residents to leave the city,
but there were still 750,000 people living in Kabul, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he admitted that most of the 750,000 residents were
the poor who could not afford to leave.
</P>
<P>
Taliban has been rocketing Kabul off and on since its troops
advanced to the areas only five kilometers away from the southern
district of Kabul on October 21, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mestiri left here today for Kabul to meet Afghan current
President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his top commander Ahmad Masood
for finalizing a peace formula for the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the UN office in Kabul, Mestiri said that he also
planned to meet Taliban which vows to overthrow the Rabbani

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Calls for Curbing of Price Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Effective measures must be
taken in 1996 to rein in price rises and ensure a further drop in
the price growth rate all over the country, the "People's Daily"
says in an editorial to be carried tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of social commodity retail prices dropped on a
monthly basis in 1995 in comparison with the previous year -- from
23.2 percent in December 1994 to 8.3 percent in December last
year. The annual commodity retail price rose by 14.8 percent,
reaching the government's price adjustment and control goal of
about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
"These achievements demonstrated the ability of the Party and
government to control the macro-economy in shifting to a socialist
market economic system," the editorial says. "They mark the fact
that China's marco-economic environment has further improved, the
economy has maintained a sustained, rapid and healthy momentum,
thus laying a relatively good foundation for the smooth start of
the Ninth Five-year Plan this year."
</P>
<P>
Although a relatively good job was done of controlling and
adjusting prices in 1995, the price growth rate remained rather
high, the editorial points out. It says that the central
government will map out price control targets for the whole
country and individual localities.
</P>
<P>
"Governments at all levels must stick to and improve the
responsibility system concerning price control, earnestly
strengthen the leadership of price-related work and organize
various departments to comprehensively administer price control,"
it says.
</P>
<P>
Properly tight financial and monetary policies should be
observed in the new year, the scale of investment in fixed assets
must be put under strict control, and the over-growth of
consumption funds be curbed, it says. At the same time, efforts
must be made for the development of production and increase of
efficient supply in accordance with the market demand.
</P>
<P>
It notes that down-to-earth efforts must be made in
agriculture, and provincial governors must be responsible for the
grain production and mayors for "vegetable baskets" to ensure the
steady increase of supplies of grain, cotton, edible oil, eggs,
meat and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
"All localities must earnestly work in the spirit of the
central government's working conference on rural work," it
says. "They must take measures to increase input in agriculture,
improve agricultural production conditions and the ability to
resist natural disasters, stabilize the prices of agricultural
production materials, and alleviate the burdens on farmers."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- the revisions of China's
Criminal Procedure Law will be of great help in cracking down on
crimes and protecting the citizens' rights and interests, a senior
Chinese lawmaker said here today.
</P>
<P>
Major revisions of the law will make a great contribution to
improving China's criminal procedure and judicial systems, said
Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remark at a seminar on the draft amendments to
the Criminal Procedure Law.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments have been made to the law over the past 17
years while drawing on advanced legislative experience in foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
The revisions will further guarantee the interests of citizens
and enhance responsibility, co-operation and mutual supervision
among the country's law-enforcement organs, according to legal
experts.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored by the Law Committee and the
Committee for Internal and Judicial Affairs of the NPC, and the

Li Peng said that after 1997 there will not be a
superior-subordinate relationship between the mainland's
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities and the
departments under the central government on the one side and the
Hong Kong SAR on the other.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's departments, provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities will not interfere in affairs which come under the
jurisdiction of the Hong Kong SAR. This is clearly stipulated in
the Basic Law, he said.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, he said, their contacts and co-operation will be
conducted in accordance with the principle of "one country, two
systems" and the relevant stipulations of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The central government will strengthen its management in this
regard, he said, adding that the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council will exercise overall consideration
and co-ordination.

<P>
Secondly, he said, in 1993 the Chinese government established
the Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which has made
necessary preparations for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR
and laid a good foundation for the work of the Preparatory
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, he said, the NPC Standing Committee also
appointed members of the Preparatory Committee which has been
formed by fully taking into consideration factors and
representativeness of different quarters.
</P>
<P>
Now the work of the Preparatory Committee has entered the
stage of implementation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that the Preparatory Committee will live up to
this heavy duty and play a more important role in implementing the
principle of 'one country, two systems'", he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, he said, maintaining the political stability and
sustained economic growth on the Chinese mainland is also an
important condition and guarantee for the implementation of the
principle of "one country, two systems" as regards Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the belief that, in accordance with the principle
of "one country, two systems", Hong Kong will practise capitalism
after July 1, 1997, and its residents' way for life will remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
This will be beneficial for Hong Kong's playing a better role
as an international financial, trade and shipping center, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Hekmatyar Group Makes New Peace Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, chief of
Afghan Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group), today called for
establishing a combined front for peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Peshawar, Pakistan, Hekmatyar
said, "we are ready to hold talks with any Afghan warring
factions if they agree to our proposals."
</P>
<P>
He said that his proposals offered the establishment of an
interim government in Afghanistan, which should be acceptable to
all the factions.
</P>
<P>
The interim government will be responsible for organizing
elections to decide the future government, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party had held talks with Taliban in this
regard, but he did not disclose the outcome of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Both Hezb-i-Islami and Taliban are representatives of the
Pushtoo people, the majority of Afghan nationals, but they have
not allied each other so far.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar acted as the prime minister of an Afghan coalition
government in 1993 and the leader of four-party opposition
alliance in 1994.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Hekmatyar strongly criticized the
"foreign interference in Afghanistan" and named some of such
countries which supported Afghan current President Burhanuddin
Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his pessimism over the UN peace efforts
launched by the UN special envoy to Afghanistan Mehmud Mestiri.
</P>
<P>
To revive the UN peace mission, Mestiri arrived in Islamabad
last Friday and went to Kabul to meet Rabbani today.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar said, "we have not received any message from Mestiri
concerning the holding of talks."

<HEADLINE> Five Duma Deputy Speakers Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Five deputy speakers of the
State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, were
elected today, new Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, also chairman of the new Duma, said at his first
news conference that Alexander Shokhin, member of the "Our Home Is
Russia" bloc, became the first deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
The other four deputy speakers elected are Svetlana Goryacheva
of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Mikhail
Gutsiriyev of the Liberal Democratic Party led by Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, Artur Chilingarov from the "Russian Regions" group
and Sergei Baburin from the "People's Power" group.
</P>
<P>
All the five were elected this morning by 359 votes for, 56
against and one abstention.
</P>
<P>
The Yabloko faction decided not to nominate its deputy speaker
candidate since its leader Grigory Yavlinsky reportedly objected
to having two communists in the Duma leadership.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov is one of the leaders of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
However, Seleznyov said that one vacancy would be reserved for
the faction. One more deputy speaker is to be elected later, a
Duma source said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets Hong Kong Delegation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China has both the confidence and the ability to
ensure the implementation of the principle of "one country, two
systems" in Hong Kong after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Li made this remark during a meeting with a delegation from the
Better Hong Kong Foundation, which is composed of leading Hong
Kong industrialists including Li Ka-Shing and Tsang Hin Chi, who
are advisors on Hong Kong affairs and members of the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Li said that he hoped that after China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, Hong Kong will continue to
maintain its prosperity and stability, as well as its position as
an international financial, trade and shipping center, and
continue to serve as a bridge linking the Chinese mainland with
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Asked by Li Ka-Shing about the measures the Chinese government
will adopt to guarantee the smooth implementation of the principle
of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong, Li said that this
principle is a great concept put forward by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"Now this has become our country's basic state policy and a
policy of seeking truth from facts by fully taking into
consideration Hong Kong's history and actual situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has both the confidence and the ability
to carry out this principle in Hong Kong after 1997," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
First, he explained, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR has
been formulated.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, he
said, China's National People's Congress (NPC) set up a Drafting
Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
He said that this important law with historical and
international significance was formulated through more than four
years of effort.
</P>
<P>
A series of Chinese government principles and policies toward
Hong Kong have been fixed by this law, he added.

<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing Stresses Education on Jiangxi Inspection Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing called
for more reforms in educational undertakings to boost the ongoing
development of socialist market economy during a recent inspection
tour of east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, urged on local officials
to manage the various types of schools well so as to carry out the
state's strategy of revitalizing the country with science and
education.
</P>
<P>
"The key way out for higher education is to rely on reform,"
the vice-premier said, noting that while there is a lack of funds
for higher education, redundant educational establishments have
led to poor efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"Only reforms can optimize and make full use of educational
sources, and as a result better educational efficiency can be
achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier pointed out that higher-learning institutions
subject to the departments of the central government should help
train large numbers of high-level talented personnel who will
serve local economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of teachers' colleges, Li asked local
officials to create a fine environment in which teachers are well
respected and education is paid great attention to.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection tour between January 15 and 18 in the
province, which used to be an old revolutionary base, Li went to
urban and rural educational institutions, taking with him the
regards of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also heard reports from Jiangxi provincial
officials about the province's progress in the economic, social,
educational, commercial and foreign trade sectors.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Bourse to Greet 1st H-Share of 1996 (by Chang Kefei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's largest textile
machinery manufacturer is making the last dash to go public on the
 Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which will become the first state-owned
 enterprise to issue H-shares in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Jingwei Textile Machinery Company Limited plans to issue a
total of 160 million H-shares, at 1.29 HK dollars per
share. Trading of the shares are expected to begin on February 2,
when the company will be China's 18th state-owned enterprise
listed on the Hong Kong bourse.
</P>
<P>
Public subscription for 40 million stocks will start tomorrow
and last till next Wednesday, and the other 120 million shares
will be offered to institutional investors by way of placing.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong-based Peregrine Capital Limited --
the sponsor and lead underwriter of the issue, institutional
investors are active in the placing of Jingwei H-shares, which
started this morning.
</P>
<P>
Francis P.T. Leung, chairman of Peregrine said today: "It is
lucky for Jingwei to be listed at this time, when the Hong Kong
stock market shows signs of turning up."
</P>
<P>
Entering into 1996, the stock market has ridden on recovery
thanks to the big inflow of foreign funds, and the daily turnover
has stayed high. Prices of H-shares, indicating the performance of
 17 China's state enterprises already listed at the Hong Kong
exchange, have rebounded since the end of last December.
</P>
<P>
The bullish atmosphere on the stock market will help the
promotion of the Jingwei shares, said Leung, who also acknowledged
that the textile machinery builder itself has a good quality.
</P>
<P>
Situated in Shanxi in northern China, the 45-year-old Jingwei
company manufactures a wide array of textile machinery and
supplementary components and special parts. Many of its products
take a dominance at the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Mei Zai-sen, chairman of Jingwei company, said here today at a
press conference that through placing and new issue, Jingwei
expects to raise funds of around 200 million HK dollars (25.6
million US dollars), which will be mainly used to purchase
production facilities and technical equipment, and to expand
production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Jingwei is not worried about its domestic market demand though
China's state-owned textile enterprises have been in predicament
due to a chronic lack of funds and piled-up stocks.
</P>
<P>
According to Mei, business volume of the company reached 710
million yuan (84.5 million US dollars) in 1995, which took a small
 stake of the total market demand of the year, estimated at 30
billion yuan (3.6 billion US dollars). Actually, overseas textile
machinery producers took away a large part of the huge cake;
Jingwei, as the leading textile machinery manufacturer in China,
possessed about 10 percent of the market left. Therefore, there is
 still potential market to explore.
</P>
<P>
China now has 50,000 textile enterprises, including 10,000
large and medium-sized ones. "There is always a big demand for
high-quality products," said Mei. At the beginning each year,
Jingwei gets orders for the coming six months.
</P>
<P>
Besides, overseas demand will keep growing in the next five
years, to make up 25 percent of the company's total sales by the
year 2000. Last year exports accounted for 15 percent of its sales.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the Chinese
government will pump 100 billion yuan (11.9 billion US dollars)
into the textile industry, with 40 billion yuan (4.8 billion US
dollars) earmarked for technical renovations. It is good news for
textile machinery manufacturers, said Mei.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-six Russian soldiers were
killed and some 250 Chechen terrorists were wiped out in the
Kremlin mission to rescue 82 hostages held by Chechen
separatists in the southern Russian village of Pervomaiskoye.
</P>
<P>
Some 18 hostages are reported missing.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said in the Kremlin today that
Russian forces had completed their operation against Chechen
rebels in the village near the border with Chechnya. The operation
to storm the village started on January 15.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had been trapped in the village for about a week
after trying to return to the breakaway republic with some 3,000
hostages captured on January 9 in the southern town of Kizlyar.
</P>
<P>
The incident triggered the second hostage crisis in seven
months involving Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
They were stopped the following day by Russian soldiers at
Pervomaiskoye on their way back home to Chechnya. Most of the
hostages were released, but the situation intensified as Russian
security forces entered the third day of battle to rescue the
remaining 100 or so hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government vowed to punish the "bandits" but
promised not to risk the lives of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
In a gesture of support for their fellow rebels, a group of
Chechen fighters are still holding hostage a Russia-bound ship
with some 200 people on board near the Black Sea port of
Trabzon off the Turkish coast.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ruling, Opposition Parties Hold Conventions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's new Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto told his Liberal Democratic Party annual
convention Thursday it should aim to win back its outright
majority at the next general election.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, currently the dominant party in the three-party
coalition government, lost its majority for the first time in four
decades at the last election in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's speech came a week after the LDP took back the
premiership after a lapse of two and a half years, following the
resignation of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, leader of the
ruling coalition's Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who is the LDP president, was quoted by the
Kyodo News Service as saying at the assembly that the ruling
party's top priority is to put Japan's economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to restore the country's economy by the beginning of
the 21st century with thorough economic and labor reforms.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also pledged openness of information and
clarification of responsibility of those trying to win public
support for the controversial government scheme to use 685 billion
yen (6.85 billion U.S. dollars) of taxpayers' money to liquidate
seven troubled housing loan companies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leading opposition party Shinshinto (New
Frontier Party) Thursday held its second convention since a
December 1994 merger with nine opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Shinshinto President Ichiro Ozawa, elected as party leader last
month, told the assembly he was determined to press the government
to dissolve the lower house for a snap election, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The news service said that Ozawa denounced the government's
liquidation plan, saying it reflected the lack of political
responsibility and capability of former Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama.
</P>
<P>
The liquidation plan was included in the fiscal 1996 budget
drawn up last December by Murayama's cabinet which resigned en
masse earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Trade Increases in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Inter-Korean trade increased by
31.1 percent to reach 299 million U.S. dollars last year, the
National Unification Board (NUB) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Trade between South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) totaled 228 million U.S. dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 total volume breaks down to 228 million U.S. dollars
worth of DPRK commodities exported to South Korea and 71 million U.S.
dollars worth of South Korean items exported to the DPRK,
according to the " '95 Trends in Inter-Korean Trade," according to
the NUB.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's exports to the DPRK in 1995 represented a
180-percent increase over 1994 and the import-export ratio was
reduced from 8:1 in 1994 to 3.2:1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of items traded also increased from 142
in 1994 to 200 in 1995, while the number of firms involved in
trading increased from 160 to 208.
</P>
<P>
Processing-on-commission trade, which began in 1991, registered
26 million U.S. dollars last year, up 56.9 percent over the previous
year. Items handled in the trade, which in the past consisted mainly
of clothes and footwear, expanded to include color TV sets and loud
speakers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the South Korean government approved a direct
investment proposal made by Daewoo Business Group and permitted
six other enterprises to conduct business activities in the DPRK,
but none of these plans have been materialized so far.
</P>
<P>
"Unless tensions between the North (DPRK) and the South (the
Republic of Korea) worsen, we will continue to gradually expand
economic cooperation with the North," a NUB official said.
</P>
<P>
Since the South Korean government took steps for economic opening
towards the DRPK in 1988, inter-Korean trade amounted to 1.11
billion U.S. dollars by the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Opens Airports to Civilian Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese air force has
opened 71 military airports and more than 460 military air routes
to civilian air services and offered 53 reserve airports to
civilian airplanes since 1990.
</P>
<P>
China's civil aviation industry has been developing rapidly
over the past few years, but the shortage and unbalanced
distribution of airports has emerged as a bottleneck.
</P>
<P>
To help solve the problem, the air force has in addition closed
180 military training aerial areas and adjusted the locations of
over 300 aerial training areas, according to military authorities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years the air force has helped 21 provinces
and autonomous regions open civilian air services in remote areas,
handled some 40,000 civilian flights, and transported 2.9 million
tourists and more than 300,000 tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the air force has participated in aerial
prospecting, planting of forests, insecticide spraying, artificial
precipitation, scientific research test flights and rescue work,
military sources said.

<HEADLINE> Ousted S.leonean Leader Accused Of Attempting To Cling To Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Sierra Leonean
offical today accused former Head of State Valentine Strasser
of "manifesting a very serious intention to succeed himself as
head of state after the February 26 general elections".
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the defense headquarters,
Director of Defense Information Karefa Kargbo said: "If this had
succeeded, it would have been a recipe for chaos."
</P>
<P>
Giving a background to events which led to Strasser being
replaced by his deputy, Brigadier Julius Maada Bio, Kargbo said
the Supreme Military Council twice opposed Captain Strasser's
attempt to promulgate a presidential decree which would have
"lowered the age of presidential aspirants from 40 years to 30".
</P>
<P>
"We decided to keep the age at 40 and the decree was passed,"
Kargbo said.
</P>
<P>
Strasser, 29, came to power in an April 1922 coup. Reports
said Strasser and his wife arrived in Conakry, Guinea, on Tuesday
following the palace coup.
</P>
<P>
Kargbo said Strasser had called on the presidential candidate
of the National Unity Party "to step down as he would want to
lead the party".
</P>
<P>
"On Tuesday, we decided that we needed a change in leadership
and Strasser was informed and Brigadier Bio was chosen to replace
him," Kargbo said.
</P>
<P>
He said the February 26 elections "will bring Sierra Leone
into an era of peace", stressing that the military government
"will not align itself with any contesting political party".
</P>
<P>
The elections were pledged mid last year by Strasser as a way
to end the civil war, which was started by the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) in 1991. The civil war has wrecked Sierra
Leone's mining-based economy and driven more than a third of the
country's four million people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
Kargbo stressed that the army had increased its security
measures to ensure a peaceful election and called on the RUF "to
change his mind not to disrupt the elections.''
</P>
<P>
He said the government had already signed a decree for the
proclamation of elections to be held on February 26.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast to the nation after being sworn in as the new
head of state yesterday, Brigadier Bio appealed to RUF leader
Foday Sankoh to hold dialogue with the new government and
"formally present his case for our people and the international
community to hear".

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Meets Hong Kong Delegation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the issue of the legal system, Lu said both the interior and
Hong Kong should steadily improve it and act accordingly.
</P>
<P>
He said that after 1997 Hong Kong is sure to be an area with a
legal system. Therefore, all the people from the interior and the
Chinese-funded institutions there must comply with the law of Hong
Kong. The military forces stationed in Hong Kong will also be
required to abide by the law of the SAR, besides the national laws.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Basic Law is not merely limited to Hong
Kong, but of nationwide significance, adding that all people and
all cities and provinces of the interior must also abide by it
when handling affairs involving Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR
is to make preparations for and organize the SAR government as
well as handle the relevant affairs, including the forming of the
first SAR government, legislature, judicial institutions and
regional organizations, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
In solving the issue of Hong Kong, he said, The Chinese side
will adhere to the principle of "taking ourselves as the mainstay"
and strive to get co-operation from the British side while
catering to the Hong Kong people and relying on them. "However, we
cannot pin our hopes entirely on the British side," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
means that the permanent Hong Kong residents will govern Hong
Kong, whereas "a high-degree of autonomy" has already been
embodied in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He said the "political reform program" introduced by the
British Hong Kong authorities unilaterally sabotaged the "through
train".
</P>
<P>
In view of many issues concerned with the transfer of power
that need to be legislated, it is imperative to form the
legislature, he noted, but there will be some restrictions on its
authority.
</P>
<P>
After the officials to be appointed are in place, Lu said, they
will set out to do some preparation work for a working institution
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the institution will hinge on how well the British
side co-operates, he said. If the two sides co-operate properly
the institution will be a smaller one; otherwise, a larger one
will be formed.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no matter how large the institution is it will
be entirely composed of Hong Kong people, without a single
official from the interior.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office will remain a body under
the State Council, which takes charge of Hong Kong and Macao
affairs, and its principal task is to make the Basic Law
implemented to the letter in Hong Kong, Lu Ping said.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Meets Hong Kong Delegation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said here
today that the policy of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
and "a high degree of autonomy" is in no way an expedient measure,
but it will help maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong and benefit the whole country as well.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a delegation from the Better Hong Kong
Foundation, which is composed of well-known Hong Kong
industrialists including Li Ka-Shing and Tsang Hin Chi, he said
that there will never be another power above the Hong Kong SAR
government after 1997, and the guideline of "one country, two
systems" will be firmly carried out.
</P>
<P>
He said it is groundless to take a pessimistic view about Hong
Kong's future, adding that both the people and the funds that have
moved abroad are welcome to return to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the issue of permanent Hong Kong residents, he
said that the permanent residents include Chinese citizens and
non-Chinese citizens, according to the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) of the Preparatory
Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
has agreed that Hong Kong permanent residents with Chinese
citizenship will retain their status as permanent residents if
they return to Hong Kong before 1997; those to return with foreign
citizenship after 1997 can enter Hong Kong and reside and work
there without the need to get visas.
</P>
<P>
He added that China will handle the issue in a lenient way if
it is incorporated into the Basic Law and the Nationality Law of
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Hong Kong SAR passport is available only to
permanent Hong Kong residents with Chinese citizenship, noting
that the passport can only be issued by the Hong Kong SAR
immigration department, with no other department in hinterland
involved and nobody from the interior able to obtain it through
any other channel.
</P>
<P>
In the case of loss of a Hong Kong passport, Lu said, a new one
may be obtained from a Chinese embassy or consulate abroad, but
the applicant's personal data must be verified by the Hong Kong
SAR immigration department.
</P>
<P>
He said that after obtaining an SAR passport in 1997 Hong Kong
people can maintain their CI, which is effective for traveling
abroad, together with the BN (O) and SAR passports. In short, this
is to provide convenience for Hong Kong people, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Property Market Expects Bottoming Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's property market
is showing signs of recovery from the dismal buying sentiment
which started in mid-1994.
</P>
<P>
In the first days of the new year, response to the forthcoming
sale of new apartments was fairly encouraging and official sources
 claimed that results of recent government land auctions are quite
 satisfactory as well.
</P>
<P>
People from the property circles believed that property prices
had bottomed out and an improvement in the market is expected this
 year. Many developers even suggested that it's time for both
sellers and buyers to take action.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the Vickers Ballas Investment Research attributed
 the improvement to better lending terms, improved affordability,
tight property supply and favorable demographics.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's property prices experienced years of upward
climbing and peaked in early 1994. But since mid-1994, when the
local government adopted restrictive measures, the property market
 began to plunge sharply and continuously.
</P>
<P>
Data show that prices for new flats averaging around 1,000
square feet in size have dropped from the peak level of 10,000 HK
dollars per sq.f. to less than 6,000 HK dollars. Prices for
secondary market have also declined from 10 to 15 percent on
average.
</P>
<P>
The downturn gradually stopped at the end of last year when
many developers abstained from cutting prices further, predicting
that the property market would stabilize or even recover at the
beginning of the new year.
</P>
<P>
Recent transactions in the property market have proven this to
be true.
</P>
<P>
Wheelock Properties lifted the list price of its Parc Royale
development by 10 percent on Wednesday, while Cheung Kong Holdings
 reported that its latest group of 64 flats was 3.7 times
oversubscribed on the second day of registration. Other large
developers said that they will continue to raise list prices for
new developments in the near-term.
</P>
<P>
Cheung Kong said it will release more flats this week to meet
the growing demand, for which the list price will be increased.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predicted that this year the property transaction
 volume will increase some 30 percent and the prices will also
rise 10 to 15 percent, while some more cautious ones held that
the property market will stabilize but prices will not increase
much.
</P>
<P>
Many developers held that the bullish sentiment of the property
 indices in the stock market is a clear evidence of the recovery
in the property market.
</P>
<P>
Led by property stocks, the local bourse began a major rally at
 the end of 1995, with the Hang Seng Index breaking the
10,000-point barrier on the last trading day, and continued its
gaining mood so far this year.

<HEADLINE> 95 Percent of LD Salons Closed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China has closed some 95
percent of all commercial laser disc (LDs) salons within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 5,000 LD salons across the country have closed
their doors since the government began, on January 1 this year, to
ban the commercial showing of feature film compact discs (CDs) and
LDs in an effort to bring an end to rampant infringement upon
copyrights in this field and eradicate pornographic publications.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wenyuan, a Ministry of Culture official, said that 20
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have completely
banned the commercial showing of LDs. Ten other provinces have
closed most of their commercial LD salons.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that provincial regulations were mapped out soon
after the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Radio, Film and
Television asked to ban the commercial showing of LDs.
</P>
<P>
Due to positive teamwork among and joint efforts from relevant
departments, the banning work has been done very efficiently and
within a short period of time, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"We've achieved what was expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
The work will be continued to bring about a regulated market of
good-quality and non-pirated CDs and LDs. The relevant departments
have decided to set up four audio and video publication markets in
Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and central China's Wuhan City,
respectively, to eradicate piracy of video and audio materials and
the spread of pornography.

<HEADLINE> Former Cyprus Government Spokesman Jailed for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Former government spokesman
Akis Fantis was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment today by
Nicosia District Court for fraud.
</P>
<P>
A second accused facing the same charges, Charalambos
Socratous Charalambous, was jailed for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Fantis and Charalambous, who is a businessman, were found
guilty on 16 counts of fraud, conspiracy to commit a crime, abuse
of trust and receiving money under false pretences during Fantis'
term in office.
</P>
<P>
Fantis was appointed government spokesman in 1988 by former
President George Vassiliou and resigned in November 1992, when a
House of Representatives committee launched an investigation into
allegations of mishandling of public money from the enlightenment
fund.
</P>
<P>
The amount misappropriated is estimated at 85,000 Cyprus
pounds (around 170,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
During his term in office, Fantis was chairman of a commission
administering funds aimed to project the views of the government
on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Reading the sentence, Judge Georgios Aresti said Fantis
misused the trust former Cyprus President Vassiliou showed in him
while Charalambous exploited the high ranking post Fantis had in
the public domain.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the sentence must serve as a general
deterrent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fantis' defense lawyer Kikis Talarides said he would consult
with his client to decide on an appeal against the conviction and
the sentence which were passed today. Should such an appeal
be successful, Fantis will be freed, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer has 10 days to appeal against the
conviction or the sentence from the date the conviction was
announced.

URUMQI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Five new travel programs
launched by tourism authorities in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region has been packaged into a promotion drive
sponsored by China National Tourism Administration (CNTA).
</P>
<P>
Specially designed for '96 China Holiday, the new itineraries
include floating on the Yarkant, Tarim and Hotan rivers, hunting

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila to Encourage Dispersal of Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
establish two pilot "nucleus estates" within the year in a bid to
encourage the dispersal of industries outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the Board of Investments (BOI), the projects,
eligible to receive a package of fiscal and tax incentives, will
serve as "magnet centers" in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Senior BOI officials today invited interested investors to
submit their project proposals for consideration.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Melito Salazar noted, "to
attract major investors in the countryside, we will need to
provide not just industrial estates but housing, medical,
educational and recreational facilities, retirement villages and
commercial areas,"
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors, particularly the Japanese, have complained
that there were no residential villages, hospitals or recreational
parks near certain industrial parks in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Modeled after "townships" in Malaysia, the proposed industrial
communities will be established in partnership with local
government units. Each township is estimated to cover an area of
over 100 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The Japan International Cooperation Agency has agreed to
undertake a feasibility study to identify sites for the proposed
industrial communities.
</P>
<P>
According to Salazar, the "technopolis" must be established
close to ports and proposed growth areas far from urban centers,
such as those in northern Luzon and Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
An inter-agency committee currently drafting the investment
priorities plan for 1996 includes the setting up of a
"technopolis," hospitals and technical institutes as among the
priority areas for investment.
</P>
<P>
Projects in preferred areas are entitled to a package of
incentives, including a six-year income tax holiday, duty-free
importation of capital equipment and tax credit on domestic
capital equipment.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 investment priority project (IPP) includes 43 priority
investment areas, compared with 66 in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Among these sectors are shipbuilding and ship repair, mass
transport, precision engineering and mining.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Has No Hand In S. Leone's Coup, Says Defence Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian soldiers in Sierra Leone
have no hands in the overthrow of that country's leader,
Captain Valentine Strasser, said Nigerian defence spokesman
Frederick Chijuka.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen here yesterday, Chijuka said that the change
of leadership in Sierra Leone was that country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Nigeria believes in the sovereignty of every
nation in the continent, Nigeria is not like some nations which
are always concerned about interfering in the internal affairs
of other sovereign nations."
</P>
<P>
Chijuka described as "unfair and wicked" accusations that
Nigerian soldiers may have master-minded the palace coup in
Sierra Leone on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
His defence was triggered by hearsay that Nigeria may have
influenced Strasser's ousting, following Abuja's
disenchantment with his anti-Nigeria stance at the November
summit of the Commonwealth in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Nigeria was suspended from the membership of the
world body over the November 10 hanging of nine Ogoni activists
for murder in south Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
As per a memorandum of understanding between the two countries,
Nigeria now has less than a battalion soldiers in Sierra
Leone, helping to protect that country's major public installations
and less than 100 men to train Sierra Leonean army.

LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus

</P>

"It's better to catch the boat than swim after it," he said.

The German foreign minister also reaffirmed the German

Kinkel called for a "fundamental" review of the working methods
of the EU commission at the forthcoming Inter-Governmental

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is expediting
the creation of a 300 million US dollar growth fund for the
Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines - East ASEAN Growth Area
(BIMP-EAGA).
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo today said that
consultations are being held between the private sector and the
government for the incorporation of the fund.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the growth fund will be launched by the fourth
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The BIMP-EAGA growth fund is envisioned to be a catalyst for
the growth of the area.
</P>
<P>
It is supposed to be an investment fund for developmental and
commercial enterprises in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
It is also supposed to be incorporated as a limited company
with an authorized capital of 300 million dollars and an initial
target capitalization of 180 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The mother fund of 180 million dollars would be contributed to
by Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines to the amount
of 30 million dollars each which would also be country sub-funds.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Spokesman on Supervision of Foreign Wire Services for Economic Information (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After taking over the management of foreign economic
information release, Xinhua News Agency will discuss with foreign
wire services and their information organs about releasing
economic information with more advanced technology, so as to raise
the timeliness and reliability of the information, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign wire services and their subsidiary information organs
are not allowed to directly recruit economic information
subscribers within China. The spokesman said this means
foreign wire services and their subsidiary information organs can
not sign agreements directly with clients, and vice versa. The
Xinhua New Agency will universally sign agreements with approved
foreign wire services and their subsidiary information organs
about releasing economic information in China.
</P>
<P>
Clients in China who want to obtain economic information from
foreign wire services can go through the necessary formalities at
Xinhua News Agency. "This will not affect client expansion of
foreign wire services," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua will hold business talks with foreign wire services and
their subsidiary information organs to decide the fees for
different types of information in China. The charging will be
justified, which means clients in China will pay reasonable fees
while foreign wire services and their subsidiary organs can get
appropriate profits, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he believed that Xinhua, based on its good
co-operative relations on news exchanges with nearly 100 foreign
wire services, will develop new co-operation with them in terms of
spreading economic information, such as increasing the number of
economic information users in China and offering services to the
users. Xinhua will soon announce the specific details of the
measures to implement the circular issued by the General Office of
the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Further Economic Ties With Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to set up a branch of
its development arm in Cuba to boost bilateral economic relations
despite the continuing U.S. economic embargo against the Caribbean
nation.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), a government
arm for development and finance which operates in more than 50
countries announced the decision today.
</P>
<P>
British companies are already active in sugar harvest
financing, agrochemicals, cigarette manufacturing, investment and
oil exploration in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
But a CDC spokesman said the operation in Cuba would act as a
model and catalyst for future British investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Electricity, financial services, agriculture and industry are
believed to be promising target sectors.
</P>
<P>
The CDC will hold talks with Cuban government officials over
the next six months to identify sectors in which detailed
investment proposals can be drawn up.
</P>
<P>
British-Cuban relations have been boosted over the past year
and a half through a series of high-level visits as well as an
investment promotion and protection agreement.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Spokesman on Supervision of Foreign Wire Services for Economic Information (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Xinhua News
Agency made a speech here today expounding on some issues relating
to the agency's being authorized by the State Council to supervise
foreign wire services and their organs selling economic
information in China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the supervision is for the purpose of
establishing a standardized information market in China in the
course of building a socialist market economy, further
standardizing China's futures, securities and foreign currencies
information release system, promoting the development of an
orderly economic information market, and providing an environment
for equal competition among both Chinese and overseas
information organs.
</P>
<P>
The supervision will also help protect intellectual property of
foreign wire services and help domestic information organs protect
their own intellectual property, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
It will better serve the opening-up policy, and not the other
way around, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the move is a normal one for a sovereign
state to exercise its sovereignty. Some Asian countries and a
number of other developing countries supervise the entry of
economic information from foreign wire services, he said, and
therefore it is also an international practice.
</P>
<P>
He said that Xinhua has experience in administering the foreign
wire services' recruitment of subscribers in China, and will
indubitably do a good job of managing the economic information
release by them and their economic information organs. He noted
that the move will affect neither the users' efficiency in
receiving the information nor the quality of technical services,
and the subscribers can go on getting information in a rapid and
comprehensive manner.
</P>
<P>
To ensure normal transition, he said, for a period of time, the
users' equipment and methods for receiving the information will
remain unchanged, and the technical services and equipment
installation will remain as they are. The technical means provided
by foreign wire services and their information organs will remain
in use at present in such on-line trading systems as financial
systems approved by Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
What Xinhua will do is to apply synchronic examination of the
economic information released by the wire services and their
information organs, instead of examining the information before it
is released, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, if contents which slander China and jeopardize
China's national interests are found, Xinhua, with departments
concerned, will deal with it," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Township Residents Electing New Congress Representatives (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To ensure that every voter can exercise his or her democratic
rights, local People's Congresses at all levels have done
painstaking work.
</P>
<P>
Election meetings are held in constituencies where voters can
easily assemble, while mobile ballot boxes are provided for voters
who have no easy access to the election meetings.
</P>
<P>
The election committee of Maqiu Township in Nanchang County,
Jiangxi Province, set up mobile ballot boxes in Wuhan, capital of
central China's Hubei Province, where 40,000 of the villagers are
working.
</P>
<P>
There are over 600 ships' crew members from the 90th
constituency of Jiangyan Town, Jiangyan County, Jiangsu Province,
working in Zhejiang Province, Shanghai Municipality and southern
parts of Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
The constituency has sent five groups with mobile ballot boxes
to the ships.
</P>
<P>
A mental patient living in Yongle Village, in northeast China's
Jining Province, was also registered as a voter after his illness
proved to be of an intermittent nature.
</P>
<P>
In order to make sure that candidates are known to the voters,
election committees across China offer timely introductions in
written or oral form.
</P>
<P>
The candidates, however, have also bade farewell to the
traditional Chinese habit of "just doing things without telling
others." They have begun to face the voters directly and canvass
for votes.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Youxiang, director of a woolen mill in Jiangning County,
Jiangsu Province, said, "I think I am responsible and capable
enough to be a spokesman for general public, and can represent the
voters in participating in and discussing political affairs."
</P>
<P>
The City Election Committee of Gao'an City, Jiangxi Province,
asked its candidates to introduce themselves in their
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The candidates are requested to make speeches on such topics as
"If I were elected, what I would do for the voters?"
</P>
<P>
Chinese law authorizes the representatives of the TPCs at the
grassroots level the following rights: to make decisions on major
political, economic and social issues of their regions, supervise
the daily work of the government and the judicial organs, and
appoint and dismiss government officials of the corresponding
level.
</P>
<P>
With the development of China's construction of democratic
politics and the improvement of the people's democratic and legal
understanding, it is believed, the elections of representatives of
people's congresses at the grassroots level will play an
increasingly important role in China's political life.

<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- In an outlying village in east
China's Jiangxi Province, more than 300 villagers assembled to
elect the new Township People's Congress (TPC) representatives.
</P>
<P>
A woman called Xu, 82, insisted on voting by herself while
sitting on a bamboo chair on which she was carried to the election
site by her two sons.
</P>
<P>
She said, "It's my right to choose a representative whom I
believe in, and I want someone who really represents us peasants."
</P>
<P>
This is only one scene of many in the ongoing election for new
TPC representatives.
</P>
<P>
Covering 50,000 townships nationwide and involving 760 million
voters, this is the first election held since the amendment to
China's Election Law was made last February.
</P>
<P>
The term for the representatives chosen through the election,
expected to be accomplished by the end of 1996, will be three
years.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics available from townships
across China, to date, over 90 percent of the voters have turned
out for the election. In addition, about 85 percent of the
candidates for TPC representatives have been jointly nominated by
voters, while the number of candidates nominated by parties and
organizations, which used to account for the bulk of the total, is
now reduced to one sixth of the total.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the National People's Congress
(NPC) who is in charge of the election, "The changes should be
attributed to the improved awareness of Chinese farmers of the
importance of participating in and discussing political affairs."
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaohong, 20, a woman worker in a garment factory in
Jiujiang City, Jiangxi Province, said, "I will vote for a

BONN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people, including
three children, died today in a fire in a hostel for asylum
seekers in northern Germany, police said.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 others were injured and several people are still
missing in the worst arson attack yet against asylum-seeking
foreigners in the country.
</P>
<P>
Firemen would not rule out the possibility of finding more
deaths as they dug into the debris of the hostel in the port city

</P>
<P>
Police have already detained two men suspected of arson. The
two, from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in eastern Germany, were caught
100 meters from the burning hostel which housed asylum seekers
from Africa, Asia and Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It took 110 firemen several hours to control the fire which
spread throughout the four-storey building early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners have been the main target of a three-year wave of
violence by German far-right extremists in which at least 30

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets with Gaddafi near Egyptian-Libyan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
met with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi this afternoon at a
military base at Sidi Barrani, some 80 kilometers east of the
Egyptian-Libyan border.
</P>
<P>
Because of the air ban, Gaddafi traveled by land to Egypt
earlier today on his first visit to the neighboring country since
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
The libyan leader first arrived in the Egyptian border town of
Saloum and then was accompanied by Egyptian Information Minister
Safwat el-Sherif to Sidi Barrani in the western desert, the
official Middle East News Agency (MENA) said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Gaddafi were expected to discuss bilateral ties,
the latest developments of the Libya-West crisis and a number of
other issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on
Libya in April 1992 after Libya refused to comply with a Western
demand for extraditing two Libyan nationals, who were suspected of
bombing a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988. A total of 270 people were killed in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain insist that the suspects be tried
in the U.S. or Britain while Libya insists that they be tried in a
neutral country or in the International Court of Justice in the
Hague.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, Gaddafi will also brief
Mubarak on the current situation in the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU)
and the ongoing efforts to contain the present crisis between
Algeria and Morocco in the wake of the latter's decision to freeze
its membership in the AMU.

<HEADLINE> Five Ex-generals Arrested in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 18 (Xinhua) - South Korean prosecutors
have arrested five retired military generals over the 1979
coup headed by former president Chun Doo-Hwan and the
subsequent massacre of pro-democracy protestors in Kwangju.
</P>
<P>
The five generals arrested early Thursday are Yoo Hak-Seung,
Hwang Yung-Si, Lee Hak-Bong, Chang Sae-Dong and Choi Sae-Chang.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul District Criminal Court approved their arrest on
mutiny charges relating to the 1979 coup and the 1980 suppression
of pro-democracy demonstrations in the southern city of Kwangju in
which more than 200 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
They were the first former army officers to be arrested in
connection with the coup, which ex-president Chun is charged with
masterminding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Chun has appealed to the Seoul District Criminal
Court, challenging the legality of a special law passed by the
South Korean parliament last month to allow him and his former
aides to be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Chun claims the law violates the constitutional prohibition of
retroactive legislation.
</P>
<P>
The law cleared the way for the prosecution of Chun and his
colleagues by extending the time limit for their prosecution.
</P>
<P>
As well as indictments over the coup and the Kwangju massacre,
Chun also faces corruption charges for amassing a 910 million
U.S. dollar slush fund while in office between 1980 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
His presidential successor and mutiny coconspirator, Roh Tae-Woo,
is already on trial on charges of accepting bribes from business
tycoons.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors on Wednesday said they will also soon seek arrest
warrants for four or five other men in connection with the coup,
including four incumbent lawmakers.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government
should take measures to crack down on the terrorist acts of
Zimbabwean dissidents operating in Mozambique in order to
safeguard the country's sovereignty, a senior Mozambican official
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of Parliament Eduardo Mulembwe was reacting to the
mounting armed attacks by Zimbabwean dissidents on coaches and
passengers in Sofala Province. The Zimbabweans committed two
attacks on travelling vehicles on the No.I Highway last week,in
which two people were killed and three others wounded.
</P>
<P>
These criminal activities have posed a threat to peace and
stability in Mozambique, Mulembwe said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean dissidents, who are reportedly members of
ZANU-Ndonga led by Ndabaningi Sithole, infiltrated into
Mozambique's Manica Province and camped there a few years ago.
They often slip back into Zimbabwe to carry out subversive
activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
called for further reform of light industry at a recent national
work conference on the sector held here, so as to meet the
public's growing demands.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the sector maintained a 12 to 13 percent increase rate
of output value during the period 1991-1995, with its export value
exceeding 40 billion US dollars last year, and the output of
certain products ranking among the first in the world.
</P>
<P>
Most enterprises in the sector are small-sized and belong to
the collective economy, Wu said. They have made substantial
progress in market-oriented reforms. The large enterprise groups
have also played a leading role in the sector's development.
</P>
<P>
Creating brand names with nationwide reputations is one of the
effective measures to increase the variety and quality of the
sector's products, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that light industry should strive to explore the huge
potential of the rural market, while attaching the same importance
to consolidating the urban and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises with nationwide reputations in the eastern part of
China are also encouraged to join hands in production with their
counterparts in the country's middle and western regions, in order
to speed up the development of these localities.

MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Sales of 21 key industries in
the Philippines reached 299.8 billion pesos (11.99 billion US

billion pesos (10.50 billion dollars) in the same period of 1994.

Top gainers in terms of sales value and volume include pulp and
paper, plastics, cars, electronics, agriculture, chemicals and
metallic mining.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Forest Tour Programs Promoted in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Luntai Park is one of the 22
forest parks in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region since the
remote northwest China region started to build forest parks in
1992 as a new tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Located at the northern fringe of the Taklimakan Desert, the
park has an alluvial lake with poplars around it, inhibited by
swans, red deers and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to easy access to the park with the completion of a
522-km-long Tarim desert, Luntai Forest Park has been attracting
more and more travelers.
</P>
<P>
China's largest autonomous region, Xinjiang boasts of large
expanses of deserts and rolling mountains, which are strewn with
forests and rare animal and plant species. These, along with the
region's unique ethnic folk culture, have made Xinjiang one of the
most popular tourist regions in China over recent years.
</P>
<P>
Forest tourist programs, including grasslands and desert
expeditions, have become a key part of the development strategy of
Xinjiang's its tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
The parks have provided new job opportunities for local ethnic
minority herdsmen, who treat travelers to folk singing and dancing
as well as handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth has also made an increasing number of local
forest tour fans. Statistics show more than 600,000 travelers
visited the forests in Xinjiang in 1995, and the figure is
expected to grow to 10 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the healthy development of forest tour in the future,
local forestry departments draw up regulations to preserve the
forests' ecological environment, besides their routine work of
preventing forest fires and cleaning away garbages left by the
travelers.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Exam System for Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing to launch
its first nationwide qualification examination for teachers and
would-be teachers next year.
</P>
<P>
Any of the 10 million-plus people who are teachers currently
may be dismissed if he or she does not pass the exam.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission (SEC) is working on the rules of
the examination, and it has just issued a set of interim measures
concerned with recognizing requisite qualifications of teachers.
</P>
<P>
The SEC stated that a teacher would not be given credentials if
he or she could not discharge his or her obligation and did not
pass the exam.
</P>
<P>
China announced the Qualification Rules for Teachers last
month, which is considered an important step to perfect China's
legal framework for education.
</P>
<P>
This is the third professional qualification rule made by the
Chinese government. The other two are related to lawyers and
registered accountants.
</P>
<P>
To improve the quality of teaching is one of the determinations
of the Chinese government as the 21st century approaches.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics issued by the SEC, only eight percent
of all college teachers, 40 percent of all senior middle-school
teachers, 36 percent of all junior middle-school teachers and 13
percent of all elementary-school teachers are qualified.
</P>
<P>
According to the Teachers Law, college teachers should
have received four years of college education or graduate school
education. High-school teachers should have received at least two
years of college education.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, teaching is becoming a more popular profession in
China as the government is promoting the idea of respecting
teachers and improving their treatment.

AMMAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli diplomat said here
that the Jordanian-Israeli relations will be boosted after the two
countries signed the last part of bilateral agreements in Jordan's
Red Sea port city of Aqaba today.
</P>
<P>
Shalom Tourgeman, spokesman for Embassy of Israel in Jordan,
told Xinhua this morning in a telephone interview that following
the conclusion of all agreements required in the Jordanian-Israeli
peace treaty, the two countries will implement all the accords
and strengthen their cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the development of bilateral relations
during the past year, he said: "It is getting better and better."
</P>
<P>
On King Hussein's visit to Israel on January 10, he said
the visit expressed Jordan's aspiration to peace with Israel and
Israelis' admiration of the King as a King of peace-makers.
</P>
<P>
The visit indicates that Israel welcomes more and more Arab
leaders to visit the Jewish State, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Tourgeman said that no one can force others to make peace and
one cannot expect a nation that suffered a lot from conflicts will
forget the phantoms of wars "in one day or a year," a reference to
the opposition by some Jordanians against the normalization with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
It is normal that there are some Jordanians who oppose peace,

<HEADLINE> Iran's Top Officials Support Pluralism in Parliament Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen Iranian ministers
have issued a statement in support of the president's call for
pluralism in the upcoming parliamentary elections, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Akhbar said that the 16 cabinet ministers signed
a joint letter to Iran's President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani,
calling for a wider participation of different groups in the
Majlis elections slated for March 8.
</P>
<P>
"It would be wrong and unjust if the parliament became a
monopoly of certain groups that represent only a fraction of the
resources of the nation," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Rafsanjani told a meeting of high-ranking
officials that the country had nothing to fear if people with
diverse ideas were elected into the new Majlis.
</P>
<P>
"It would be natural to find people with different political
tastes. We should not be worried about the presence of different
ways of thinking in the parliament," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 candidates will be vying for a total of 270 seats in
the Fifth Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech on November 24 last year, Rafsanjani
called for the establishment of a multi-party system, a move
warmly welcomed by the Iranian media.
</P>
<P>
So far, Hizb-e Mardam-e Iran (Iranian People's Party), formed
by pro-Rafsanjani parliamentarian Qassem Sho'leh Sa'di, is the
only party which has declared its formation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Rafsanjani's call for wider participation
of different groups in the upcoming elections has received the
approval stamp of some of the major political and religious
figures here.

BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A modern system of land, sea
and airport customs has taken shape in this capital of China
following the opening of two customs posts last year, according
to an official of the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
"The Chaoyang highway and Fengtai railway customs posts, which
started operation last year, and the Capital International Airport
customs have laid a sound basis for the capital's modern customs
system, which will be officially completed by the end of the
century," said Zhao Yizu, director of the Beijing Municipal
Customs Office.
</P>
<P>
The Chaoyang highway customs post in eastern Beijing, through the
Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu expressway, has linked Beijing with Tianjin
port, 150 km away at the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Fengtai railway customs post, 5.5 km east of the new Beijing
Western Railway Station, can handle import and export cargoes
bound for Shenzhen in south China as well as Hong Kong or Macao. It
handled 160,000 tons of cargo last year.
</P>
<P>
The Capital International Airport, the largest airport in the
country, handled 310,000 tons of cargo last year and registered a

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Capital Market
Supervisory Agency (Bapepam) issued 83 regulations to support the
implementation of the newly introduced capital market law.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the House of Representatives (DPR) here today
hailed that the issuance of the regulations marked the full
implementation of the capital market law, which was approved by
the DPR late last year.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the issuance of the regulations Wednesday
is in a bid to make the country's capital market more efficient
and transparent.
</P>
<P>
According to Bapepam chief Putu Gede Ary Suta, the regulations
are aimed at making Indonesia's capital market more
market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations were mostly taken from the agency's
existing capital market rulings, covering almost all issues in
stock and bond trading activities, including licensing procedures
and capital requirements of a stock exchange operator and its
supporting agencies.
</P>
<P>
The new elements in the regulations include the increase of the
foreign ownership portion in listed companies to 85 percent and in
listed mutual funds to 100 percent from 49 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
The other new aspects also include the issuance of detailed
guidelines on the transactions of shares of mutual funds and the
improvement of the regulations on the activities of a stock
exchange operator, stock clearing and settlement agencies.
</P>
<P>
The new capital market law, which replaced the outdated 1952
capital market regulations, contains 16 chapters and 123 articles,
covering all activities in the capital market.

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi Arrives in Egypt for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
today arrived in the Egyptian town of Saloum near the Egypt-Libya
border to meet with President Hosni Mubarak, the Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif greeted the
Libyan leader at the border and then accompanied him to Sidi
Barrani in the the western desert, where he will hold talks with
Mubarak later today, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state are expected to discuss bilateral
relations, the latest developments of the Libya-West crisis and a
number of other issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on
Libya in April 1992 after Libya refused to succumb to a western
demand for extraditing two Libyan nationals, who were suspected of
bombing a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988, in which 270 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain insist that the suspects be tried
in the U.S. or Britain while Libya insists that they be tried in
a neutral country or in the International Court of Justice in the
Hague.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, Gaddafi will also brief
Mubarak on the current situation in the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU)
and the ongoing efforts to contain the present crisis between Algeria
and Morocco in the wake of the latter's decision to freeze its
membership in the AMU.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Maghreb Union groups Algeria, Libya, Mauritania,
Morocco and Tunisia.

CHA-AM, THAILAND, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese delegates have
expressed support for the conclusion of total ban on testing of
nuclear weapons within 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the Fourth Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum (APPF) annual
meeting, Chinese delegates called for nuclear powers to reach,
through negotiations, a treaty, under which each country
undertakes not to be the first to use of nuclear weapons against
one another, and not using or threatening to use nuclear weapons
against non-nuclear countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, led by Zhu Liang, Chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress of
China, stressed that banning nuclear testing is not a final goal,
but an important step to realize the total ban on nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation's position won the understanding and
support of participants during the meeting which opened Monday in
Cha-am, a seaside resort in Petchaburi Province, some 160

<HEADLINE> 4th APPF Meeting Calls For Closer Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHA-AM, Thailand, January 18 (Xinhua) -- parliamentarians from
Asia Pacific countries today adopted a joint communique, calling
for further strengthening political, security and economic
cooperation among legislative bodies in the region.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique, issued at the end of the Fourth Asia
Pacific Parliamentary Forum (APPF) annual meeting today,
highlighted a number of resolutions adopted on nuclear weapons
testing, anti-terrorism, anti-drug, protection of women's and
children's rights, environment protection, and legislative
interchanges.
</P>
<P>
The communique urged all participating countries of the APPF to
give their support to the conclusion as soon as possible and no
later than the end of 1996 of a truly comprehensive and
internationally verifiable test ban treaty as an essential step to
prevent nuclear weapon proliferation and attain the ultimate goal
of total elimination of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The communique noted that the problem of terrorism is a
flagrant  violation of human rights and they called for APPF
member countries to make concerted efforts to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
On environmental issues, the participants at the meeting agreed
that there should be efforts to put an end to the unfair practice
of natural resources exploitation, particularly by countries with
more advanced technologies in countries with less advanced
technologies without due consideration for the environmental
impact from such exploitation, the communique said
</P>
<P>
Regarding social issues, the communique stressed APPF countries
would take appropriate measures to protect women and children from
all forms of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Expressing serious concern over organized international crimes,
including international drug production, trafficking and
consumption, the communique called for APPF governments and
parliaments to enhance law enforcement structures and capabilities
to tackle these problems.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Marshall Islands was accepted as the 24th
member of the APPF at today's meeting, while the Philippines and
Peru were elected as new members of the APPF executive committee.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Controversial
businessman in Tanzania, an Indian national, Vidyadhar
Girdharlal Chavda flew out of the country on Tuesday evening
under a deportation order issued earlier that day by Home affairs
Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported here today that a notice from the
Tanzanian immigration services headquarters to Chavda said his
continued presence in Tanzania "is in the opinion of the
President undesirable".
</P>
<P>
Chavda, whose alleged misuse of more than 900 million Tanzanian
Shillings (about 1.5 million US dollars) in the Debt Conversion
Program (DCP) funds has made headlines in the last two years and
prompted a parliamentary probe, "successfully resisted" an
earlier order to leave the country in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The government had declared him persona non grata but was
restrained by the High Court, which ordered that Chavda should
not be deported until the main application challenging the order
was heard. The government withdrew the order in February, last
year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Expiration of Nomination Deadline Worsens Political Situation in Bangladesh (by Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The political situation in
Bangladesh has been worsening with the passing of the deadline at
05:00 PM Wednesday for filing nomination papers for the upcoming
general elections.
</P>
<P>
All efforts by the political and diplomatic circles appeared
abortive as the ruling party and the opposition in the country
failed to resolve the 21-month-old standoff over the issue of
holding the elections under a neutral caretaker government, local
press said in their comments.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have to go ahead with the elections in the country and
the election rules do not allow us to reverse the proceedings of
the nomination," the Election Commission (EC) said last night,
adding that the EC even did not receive any request from any
political party till 05:00 PM Wednesday to further change the
election schedule.
</P>
<P>
However, in their liaison meeting Wednesday, the three
mainstream opposition parties -- the Awami (people's) League, the
Jatiya (national) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami -- decided to
boycott the upcoming general elections and resist them at any
cost.
</P>
<P>
The combined opposition no longer demanded polls. "Rather, from
now on, our campaign will be directed towards the formation of a
caretaker government with the fall of the ruling party," an
opposition leader warned.
</P>
<P>
The election schedule was first announced on December 4, fixing
January 18 as the voting date. It was then deferred to February 7.
On January 2, the EC made a partial change in the schedule, fixing
January 8 and 9 as the last dates for filing nomination papers.
Then on January 8, the EC again revised the schedule, fixing
January 17 and 18 as nomination filing and scrutiny dates. The
polls date was shifted to February 15.
</P>
<P>
There were widespread speculation this time that nomination
filing date would be rescheduled once again because there had been
efforts till Tuesday to remove the government-opposition standoff.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) has recently proposed a formula under which the country's
president will head an advisory council to be constituted with
equal representation from both sides and the president will also
enjoy the power of the prime minister. But the opposition
disagreed with the proposal and suggested that there must be a
neutral chief advisor who will enjoy the power of the prime
minister as the head of the caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Up to now a total of 1,987 nomination papers were filed for the
February 15 elections. Almost all of them are from the BNP
nominees and its dissidents who filed the nomination papers as
independent candidates. All three mainstream opposition parties
have refrained from filing nomination papers.
</P>
<P>
People worried that if the ruling party go ahead with the
elections, the political situation in the country may be more
violent as the opposition has set for all-out agitation.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have announced that they would siege the
election commission offices throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, six western envoys led by US ambassador David Merrill
mediated between the ruling party and the opposition. Although
they tried in vain to persuade the two sides to reach a consensus,
their efforts may continue.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of continued contacts between the BNP and the
opposition with the mediation of political and diplomatic circles
will not be ruled out, but it may be difficult for the two sides
to heal their quarrels over the power-sharing of the
opposition-demanded caretaker government to conduct the national
elections, analysts here said.

<HEADLINE> Berlusconi Trial Adjourned until January 26 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The first day of hearing on the
corruption trial of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi closed Wednesday, and the next session is to open on
January 26.
</P>
<P>
The trial opened in the morning. Berlusconi appeared in the
Court of Milan stormed by reporters under the accompany of his
lawyer Carlo Taormina.
</P>
<P>
The opening session was adjourned for a while at mid-morning
after judges ruled out live television coverage but allowed video
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The judges brought down a demand by Taormina that proceedings
of the case be changed.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi left the court room about 3:40 p.m. before the
hearing ended.
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old media magnate, his younger brother Paolo and
nine others are charged with corruption over alleged bribes made
by his Fininvest empire to tax police of Milan for easy audits
between 1989 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
But only Berlusconi appeared in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Documents provided by detained Francesco Nanocchio, a former
Milan tax policeman, showed that between 1989 and 1992, three
Fininvest companies -- insurer Mediolanum Vita, television
producer Videotime and publisher Mondadori -- had paid a total of
330 million lira (about 206,000 U.S. dollars) to Milan tax police
in three bribes.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi denied he had been aware of this, saying he was just
an "outsider".
</P>
<P>
In today's hearing, Berlusconi and Taormina claimed the trial
is "for political purposes".
</P>
<P>
The trial has heavy political overtones as the caretaker
government of Lamberto Dini is in crisis after Dini announced
resignation on January 11.
</P>
<P>
Italy has been without an elected government since Berlusconi's
coalition government collapsed in December 1994 only after seven
months in office.

MACAO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Macao will hold bullfights to
entertain local citizens to celebrate the coming Chinese lunar New
Year, organizers said today.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese style of bullfights will be held between
February 17 and 25. A bullfighting team of 55 people, including

<HEADLINE> More Scientific Research Activities Urged in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Education
Minister Najib Tun Razak today urged the government to step up the
level of research activities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Najib said at
present, Malaysia's financial allocations for research work
accounted for less than two percent of its gross domestic product
(GDP). Efforts must be made to increase the research fund to five
percent of the GDP, he added.
</P>
<P>
Najib said his ministry would grant 100,000 Malaysian Ringgit
(about 40,000 US dollars) to each local university beginning from
this year to carry out the research work.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to step up research activities, Najib said, his
ministry was also trying to increase the number of graduates
pursuing their education to master's level to 20 percent from 10
or 11 percent currently.
</P>
<P>
Besides that, efforts were also being made to increase the
number of master degree and Ph.D. degree holders, he said.
</P>
<P>
Owing to its rapid economic development, Malaysia now needs
more professional personnel in its economic activities.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Second Largest Pyramid to be Reopened in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's second largest pyramid, a
Pharaonic monument built about 4,600 years ago, will be reopened
to public as of April 10 after a six-month restoration work.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of restoration will amount to 1 million Egyptian
pounds (about 294,118 U.S. dollars), Abdul Halim Nour Eddin,
Secretary General of Egypt's Higher Council for Antiquities, was
quoted as saying today by the Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
The pyramid was built for the fourth dynasty pharaoh Chephren,
who ruled ancient Egypt in the 26th century BC. It is slightly
smaller than the nearby Great Pyramid of earlier pharaoh
Cheops.
</P>
<P>
The Chephren pyramid has been closed to visitors since October
10 last year due to the serious cracks in the limestone walls of
the pyramid.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, moisture produced in the breath of
visitors caused, over a long period of time, the appearance of
fissures extending from the inner walls to the main doorway and
the burial chamber.
</P>
<P>
They said that the breath of a visitor inside the pyramid
carries 20 grams of water, which is turned into salt and
humidity. The pyramid, the only one that was affected by the
strong earthquake in Egypt in 1992, had been visited daily by
about 3,000 tourists.
</P>
<P>
As part of the restoration work, an integrated ventilation
system inside the pyramid would be installed.
</P>
<P>
Nour Eddin said that the cracks on the inner walls would be
mended and repainted with the same original materials.
</P>
<P>
Great pyramids and other pharaonic monuments are Egypt's main
historical attractions, which drew more than 3 million foreign
tourists in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry is one of Egypt's four major sources of
foreign currency. The other three sources are overseas
remittances, tolls on the Suez Canal and oil exports.

CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is

The two leaders are expected to discuss bilateral relations,
the latest developments of the Libya-West crisis and a number of

</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on

bombing a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988, in which 270 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain insist that the suspects be tried
in the U.S. or Britain while Libya insists that they be tried in
a neutral country or in the International Court of Justice in the
Hague.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, Gaddafi will also brief
Mubarak on the current situation in the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU)
and the ongoing efforts to contain the present crisis between Algeria
and Morocco in the wake of the latter's decision to freeze its
membership in the AMU.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar tumbled
against major currencies due to unfavorable imports figures
released today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar slid to 74 US cents from 74.34 US cents
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The downturn of the local currency happened after the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced that monthly
merchandise imports continued to grow by a robust five percent in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
The imports figures fueled fear that the country's annual
current account deficit might surpass the target of 21 billion
Australian dollars (15.5 billion US dollars) set by the government
for 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The local currency exchange market responded negatively to the
figures, because it expected only a modest 1.5 percent growth in
imports in the month.
</P>
<P>
The Australia dollar slid neck by neck with the US dollar in
cross rates against the Japanese yen. It ended at 78 yen from
78.97 yen Wednesday, while the US dollar dropped to 105.42 yen
from 106.15 yen on last close in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was also weaker against the German mark,
ending at 1.0857 marks from 1.0908 marks on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local currency brokers expected the Australian dollar to remain
within the range between 73.85 and 74.25 US cents in overseas
markets in the next 24 hours.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Corruption Team Pointed In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A nine-man commission
headed by former Premier and first Vice-President Mr. Joseph
Sinde Warioba has been appointed in Tanzania to look into how
best the government and its institutions can fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa told a press conference at the State
House in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday that the commission was
expected to report back to him within nine months.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission would collect opinions from
individuals, professional associations and other interest groups
and present a broad, analytical, and open report taking into
account the obtaining situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa identified two strategies on how to fight corruption.
The first strategy was to expose the culprits and deal with them
according to the law. He asked the people -- workers, civil
servants, -- to expose such people as they were enemies of
justice and the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the second strategy was to look afresh into the
law, regulations, and the whole government and public sector
working system with a view to plugging loop holes contributing to
the growth of corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
The president listed some of the areas where such loop holes
existed such as commercial and non-commercial agreements, civil
service regulations, licensing, tax collection, tender awards,
auditing and in the very system of service dispensation.
</P>
<P>
He said there was need also to review the Corruption
Prevention Act of 1971 and how to go about implementing the
Leadership Code Act of 1995. To this end, he asked the commission
to present to him a specific report on this within three months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Mkapa said all those who owed public
finance institutions should be cornered and made to pay according
to the existing laws. "If you borrow, you must pay, that's the
practice," he said.

JERUSALEM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli ruling Labor
Party is preparing for the possibility of early Knesset (Israel's
parliament) elections being held in May if a decision is taken to
move them forward, Israel Radio said today.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Prime Minister Shimon Peres has called on
Interior Minister Haim Ramon to reduce to a minimum the time to
prepare for early elections.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party is expected to make a decision on the issue in
Mid-February following the next round of peace talks with Syria
and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's next shuttle
mission to the region.
</P>
<P>
The elections will then take place no more than three months
later and the Labor primaries will also be moved forward to March
if the decision calls for early elections.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset elections are originally scheduled for November,
while the Labor primaries were initially due to be held in June
and have been moved forward to Mid-April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio quoted National Supervisor for
Elections Ehud Shilat as saying that the Interior Ministry can
prepare for voters registration within 50 days in the event of
early elections. He made the assessment following a request by
Ramon.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Knesset Wednesday defeated a bill submitted
by the Tsomet party calling for the early dissolution of
the Knesset and elections in July by a vote of 52-31.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: With Europe's "Engines" in Trouble, Single Currency Meets Red Light  (By Kang Xinwen) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- As European integration moves
ahead after EU leaders renewed their resolve at last month's
Madrid summit, gloomy economic prospects in Germany and France
signalled a red light on the road to a single currency.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that France, the self-proclaimed political
leader of the European Union, will see growth of only 1 percent to
1.5 percent in 1996 and, therefore, may find it impossible to
qualify for the 3 percent deficit-to-GDP criterion by 1997.
</P>
<P>
And Germany, usually Europe's economic front-runner, only
witnessed 1.9 percent growth in 1995. Its deficit-to-GDP jumped
from 2.9 percent to 3.6 percent, depriving it for the first time
of its right to preach to others.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that by 1997, when EU members will begin talks on
who can join the single currency, Germany's deficit-to-GDP may
further jump to between 4.6 percent and 5.1 percent as its growth
may dip to a new low.
</P>
<P>
German Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt recently predicted
that his country's economic growth in 1996 would be below 2
percent and more pessimistic economists have predicted the rate
will be no higher than 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
earlier estimated that if Germany's economic growth failed to
reach 3 percent, every 0.5 percent decrease in growth will be
coupled with a 0.5 percent deficit hike.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the deficit's upward trend, France and Germany have
to either adopt budget-cutting policies or to stimulate economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
But a budget-slashing program in France to cut the deficit and
to qualify the country for the Euro sparked off crippling strikes
nationwide, the worst since the 1968 worker-student uprising.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Germany, where the jobless make up 10 percent of
the population, any budget-slashing plan may also trigger massive
social unrest.
</P>
<P>
The other alternative, stimulating economic growth, may bring
lower deficits in the long term. But it may also fuel inflation
and a temporary deficit climb in the short term and, therefore,
cannot prepare the two countries for the criterion by 1997.
</P>
<P>
The consensus among press commentators is that without France
and Germany, Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will make no sense
as the two "European engines" have been the initiators and
vigorous backers of European integration.
</P>
<P>
The late French President Francois Mitterrand and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1990 jointly proposed the creation of
the EMU as well as a political union.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two countries have repeatedly suggested that a
Franco-German monetary union be created first to spur the creation
of the EMU.
</P>
<P>
The EMU, agreed upon in the Maastricht Treaty in 1991, was
originally set to be launched in 1997 when members should meet the
criteria for 3 percent deficit-to-GDP and 60 percent public
debt-to-GDP.
</P>
<P>
But EU leaders, fearing that most member countries would not
recover from their economic slump and meet the convergence
criteria, approved a blueprint to launch the Euro on January 1,
1999, at last month's Madrid summit.
</P>
<P>
In the face of widespread recession across Europe, some experts
have put forward two other approaches to a single currency -- to
put off its creation again or to lower the criteria.
</P>
<P>
But the EU Commission stressed that the launch date would
tolerate no delay, saying that otherwise the creation of a single
currency will be pushed further and further away.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that people would lose faith in the EMU,
the first step towards a united Europe, if it was delayed again
and again.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission did not say a definite no to the idea
of lowering the criteria, though it has hesitated to say yes for
fear that it might lead to limitless deficits among EU members.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the Euro, whether or not it is born
on time, will bring more troubles to the 15-nation EU before its
birth.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Machine Building Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Over the next 15 years, China
will exert great effort to improve its machine building industry
as a pillar of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the Ministry of Machine-building
Industry show that during the 1991-1995 period, the sector's
annual growth in output value reached 21 percent, with pre-tax
profits totalling 141.7 billion yuan, up 72.2 percent over the
1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
The five years witnessed the use of 7.15 billion US dollars in
overseas funds, earning 86.5 billion US dollars in foreign
exchange, an annual increase of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), more effort will
be put into improving machine products, maximizing enterprises'
efforts and ability to develop new products.
</P>
<P>
The industry is set to promote 1,000 name-brand products, and
set up 100 large-scale, profitable and competitive enterprises,
and will establish 300 technology development centers.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, the auto industry will set up three
to four enterprises each with annual sales exceeding 40 billion
yuan, and the motorcycle sector will set up 10 enterprises each
with annual sales of more than five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Five enterprises will have annual sales of 10 billion yuan
each, 20 enterprises each will have sales of five billion yuan,
and 60 enterprises each will have sales of two billion yuan, in
other machinery sectors.
</P>
<P>
The industry's total output value is expected to reach about
1.5 trillion yuan by the year 2000, and increase more than 100
percent over that year's figure by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The industry's output value will rise from one-fourth of the
country's industrial total in 1992 to one-third by 2010.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, the industry will get 34 billion US dollars in foreign
exchange, with its portion in the country's total export volume
climbing from 1992's 14.9 percent to more than 20 percent, which
will make the industry the country's No.1 foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
Also in 2010, the industry will earn 130 billion US dollars in
foreign exchange, with its proportion of the country's total
exceeding 25 percent. The industry will be among the world's top
10 in export volume.
</P>
<P>
Numerically-controlled machine tools will account for 70
percent of the domestic market by 2000, and 80 percent by
2010. Priority will be given to hydraulic, pneumatic, sealed
products, and low-voltage equipment, moulds, bearings,
instruments, and meters.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period, about 146.2 billion yuan will be
needed for automotive investment, 141.2 billion yuan of which will
be for autos and the rest for motorcycles.

<HEADLINE> Schools Spread Marriage, Child-Bearing Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGDONG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- "I have learned a lot about
child-bearing and other matters from this school," Tuo Yuzhong
said while walking out of the school gate with his newly-wed.
</P>
<P>
The Marriage and Child-bearing School of Baitu Township in
Gaoyao City in south China's Guangdong Province is one of the
thousands of such schools in the province, according to Li
Liqiang, director of the Baitu Family Planning Office, who is also
the only full-time teacher of such a school in Baitu.
</P>
<P>
Founded by Deng Aitong, head of the township, in 1987, it was
the first of its kind in the province.
</P>
<P>
"We used to have classes in a small room where the only
equipment we had was a slide projector," Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Now it has moved into a large classroom which is equipped with
a tv set and a video cassette recorder.
</P>
<P>
Deng invites Li and six part-time teachers from a local
hospital, the women's federation and the judicial department to
give lectures on sex, eugenics and the country's family planning
policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The school also invites local pregnant women, young mothers and
senior women to give listeners advices about motherhood and child
care and regular lectures on sex to local middle-school students.
</P>
<P>
It sponsors courses for local newly-weds once a month, he said.
</P>
<P>
They are so popular that many newly-weds from the nearby
villages ride motorcycles to attend classes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li, in his 30's, has been in his post for more than 10
years. He used to be unwelcome among local young people, but now
he has become their friends, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't work to rely on administrative measures and
economic sanction only," he said. "We must let the farmers
understand the advantages in having fewer children."
</P>
<P>
Due to the efforts of Deng's school, 95 percent of the couples
who have attended the classes have not violated family planning
policies, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Family Planning Associations Help Farmers Prosper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- "I don't want to have a son
as long as I can earn enough money," Chen Fangqiang, owner of a
grocery store in Gaoyao City, Guangdong Province, said.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remark when told that he could have the second
child according to the local family planning policy which permits
rural couples at the child-bearing age to have the second child if
their first child is a girl.
</P>
<P>
More and more farmers like Chen in Gaoyao in south China's
Guangdong Province are now favoring a one-child family due to the
efforts of local family planning associations which are helping
them achieve prosperity, according to Liao Daqing, director of the
Gaoyao City Family Planning commission.
</P>
<P>
"My work will be easier if all local farmers enjoy tangible
benefits from the family planning policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The city now has 1,020 family planning associations at all
levels, with a total of 54,800 members, all of whom are farmers,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The associations are organized by government officials in
charge of family planning. All farmers implementing the family
planning program can apply for joining the associations.
</P>
<P>
Most associations have set up businesses to help members plant
fruit trees and vegetables and raise fish, bullfrogs and chickens,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The businesses also provide to the members chemical fertilizers
and fodder at reduced prices, as well as information, consulting
and technical services.
</P>
<P>
Part of the profits made by the businesses are used to buy
old-age pension insurance policies for one-child families and
families with two daughters only, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Guangsheng, 37, member of a local family planning
association who is good at raising fish, used to live on his 0.13
ha plot as he did not have enough money to own a fish pond.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the association, he contracted a 3.3-ha fish
pond with a 20,000 yuan loan (about 2,410 US dollars) from a
credit co-op in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"I repaid the loan plus interests the following year and in
1995 I earned more than 70,000 yuan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The associations have enabled farmers break away from such
traditional ideas as "more sons mean greater blessings to the
parents," Miao said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Qunsen, a father of two daughters, intended to have a
son. But his mother strongly objected to his idea, saying: "With
three mouths, how can you give a good education to your son?"
</P>
<P>
He attended an evening class sponsored by a local family
planning association to learn how to grow vegetables.
</P>
<P>
"I believe I can also get rich like others," he said.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang's Underground Irrigation System Reopened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Karez, the
largest underground irrigation system with a history of about
3,000 years, has made a comeback in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, after years of disuse.
</P>
<P>
The crystal clear, cool water is once again flowing from
hundreds of the Karez which dried up in the 1980s in the Turfan
and Hamin basins. The Turfan Basin, 60 km from the Tianshan
Mountains, is famous for its grapes and melons.
</P>
<P>
The snow of the Tianshan Mountains produces underflow into the
karezes of the two basins, which are 1,400 meters lower than the
mountainous areas. The Turfan Basin is 154 meters below sea level,
and the sticky soil of the desert has a lot of calcium that keeps
the structure of the karez strong and difficult to cave in.
</P>
<P>
The karez, extending three to five km, consists of an
underground channel, a ditch on the surface, and a well and
cistern that give access. The well is used to clear, repair, or
ventilate the karez underground which runs between wells for a
distance of from 20 to 70 meters.
</P>
<P>
Patar, an old master of karez construction in Turfan City who
changed jobs in the 1980s, has been asked by farmers and local
officials to take up his old trade again.
</P>
<P>
With his help, hundreds of dry karezes have come back to life
after farmers in the two basins launched a campaign to dredge,
strengthen, or extend karezes in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
With a total length of 3,000 to 5,000 km, some 1,000 karezes
have been used to irrigate hundreds of thousands of hectares of
farmland in the two basins and an increasing part of the desert is
being turned into oases.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jingui, agriculture division chief of Turfan Prefecture,
says that karez water contributes a lot to the prefecture's "grape
economy".
</P>
<P>
The prefecture produced a record 270,000 tons of grapes, worth
600 million yuan, giving farmers an average of 800 yuan (nearly
100 US dollars) from grape production each year, or about half of
an average farmer's annual income, Ma noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is said that annual raisin output in Turfan accounts for
five percent of the world's total," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although modern irrigation systems are available in Xinjiang,
no irrigation system is comparable to the karez for its low cost
and cleanness. Farmers point out that it needs no power for
water-flowing since the mountain is 1,400 meters higher than the
basins. Also, little water is lost to evaporation and the volume
of water is fairly stable all year round.
</P>
<P>
Yao Jian, a local water conservation official, said the average
annual rainfall in Turfan Prefecture is only 16 mm and evaporation
is as high as 3,000 mm.
</P>
<P>
Average annual groundwater runoff totals 1.07 billion cu.m. in
the Turfan but the total volume of annual consumption of water
reaches 1.2 billion cu.m, the official said, attributing the
disparity to the repeated use of water from the karez.
</P>
<P>
The karez serves as a natural air conditioner for people in the
Turfan Basin, where it is usually hotter in the summer than in
other parts of the country. Inside the karez, it remains cool in
summer and a bit mild in winter.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou's Garbage to Be Used to Generate Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian company is set to
help Hangzhou, capital city of east China's Zhejiang Province, to
turn its garbage into electric power.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of Environmental Technologies Inc. of
Calgary, Canada, a garbage power plant, the first of its kind in
China, will be set up to make use of methane.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for six generating units with a total installed
capacity of 6,000 kw. to be built. The first unit will be
assembled in the second quarter of the year and is expected to
produce power by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Waste materials have generally been buried in Chinese cities,
but accumulation of methane can trigger an explosion if the air
contains five to 15 percent of methane.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, an explosion occured at a garbage dump in Yueyang City
of central China's Hunan Province, destroying nearby facilities
and sending more than 20,000 cubic meters of debris into the air.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, another explosion occurred in Chongqing, in
Sichuan province, because of similar conditions, that left six
people dead.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that methane can also damage crops and the ozone
layer. It can, at the same time, be a fine form of energy. One ton
of garbage can produce 220 cubic meters of methane, and one cubic
meters of methane can produce 1.5 to two kwh of power.

<HEADLINE> Canada Calls for Restraint in Chechnya Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada today called for
restraint and the resumption of negotiations in the Chechnya
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I urge all parties to exercise restraint and resume
negotiations toward a lasting political settlement," Foreign
Minister Andre Ouellet said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The call came when Russian Interior Ministry troops are engaged
in the third day of attacks on the southern Russian village of
Pervomaiskoe to resolve the hostage-taking crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Chechens seeking independence from Russia seized up
to 3,000 Russian hostages in a town of Kizlyar but released most
of them the next day and headed for Chechnya in buses. They were
stopped by Russian forces at Pervomaiskoe.
</P>
<P>
Ouellet expressed deep concern over the situation in
Pervomaiskoe. "President (Boris) Yeltsin faces a difficult
situation, but further bloodshed can only complicate the search
for a durable solution to the conflict in Chechnya," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ouellet condemned the use of force in settling political
disputes and called for the immediate release of all hostages.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- More strict crowd control
moves are to be taken for future soccer matches set for the Hong
Kong Stadium, according to a soccer meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The moves were worked out after an on-field brawl, which
happened last Saturday here and involved players and an official
of local First Division clubs South China and Uhlsport Rangers.
</P>
<P>
Among the moves, about five extra policemen will be deployed
for matches, aimed mainly at controlling the crowds near the fence
at the end of the games. And extra police are to be brought in to
escort players from the ground.
</P>
<P>
A temporary barrier would be erected behind the teams' reserve
booths on the pitch sidelines to separate players and officials
from fans.
</P>
<P>
In addition, stewards had been told to tighten security at the
main gate by increasing bag checks for bottles and cans.
</P>
<P>
The moves were approved at a closed-door between stadium
managers Wembley International, the Hong Kong Football Association
(HKFA), the Urban Services Department and local police.
</P>
<P>
"This arrangement will be in place for the next three to four
soccer matches," said Chief Inspector Fung Tak-yin, divisional
police commander of Happy Valley where the stadium is located.
</P>
<P>
"These measures are only a short-term change and we will see
how it goes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Steward Lee Leung-nang, chairman of the HKFA, said, "I agree
that Hong Kong spectators are very well behaved, but we still have
to take precautions to ensure a similar incident doesn't happen
again."
</P>
<P>
The disciplinary committee of the HKFA is to meet Monday to
discuss the incident and some penalty decisions against offenders
are thought to be taken.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds in China to Develop Offshore Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China has received 5.1 billion
U.S. dollars' worth of foreign investment to develop its offshore
oil and gas, accounting for 58 percent of the country's total
input in this sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the China National Offshore Oil Corporation
(CNOOC), China has signed 109 contracts and agreements with 62 oil
companies from 16 countries and regions for joint efforts to tap
China's huge offshore oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
Sino-foreign cooperative exploration has verified offshore oil
reserves of 1.25 billion tons and 235 billion cu m of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Some 17 offshore oil and gas fields are operational, with an
annual crude output of 9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that CNOOC has turned over to the State a total
of 4.13 billion yuan in taxes over the past 13 years since its
inauguration and has developed total assets worth 1.7 billion yuan
in 1983 to the present 32.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC officials noted that the country's annual offshore
oil and gas output is expected to top 13 million tons and 3.15
billion cu m, respectively, in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
An authoritative source revealed that major breakthroughs are
forecast for this year for utilization of offshore oil and gas,
including construction of an 8-million-ton oil refinery and a
450,000-ton ethylene project.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China's Farmers Busier in Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- It is a world of ice and snow
with the temperature as low as 30 degrees centigrade below zero in
Northeast China Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
However, cucumber, beans, melons and other vegetables are
growing luxuriantly in the plastic sheet-covered fields in
Zhaodong City.
</P>
<P>
While packing up fresh vegetable for a nearby market, Zhang
Weiyan, a farmer of Haicheng Town, said the old days of staying at
home idly to pass the freezing cold winter season has gone.
</P>
<P>
"Most of us have built warm-up houses to plant vegetables and
melons, and we have to get up earlier to learn market information,
grow vegetable and melons, and sell them to the market," he noted
and disclosed that farmers nowadays earn more than before.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fu is a 41-year-old farmer from Shuangshan Village of
Zhaodong City.
</P>
<P>
After driving more than 600 sheep to the field to eat maize
stalks, he went to households specialized in raising cattle to
collect manure, and then ship them to his contract field to
prepare for spring farming.
</P>
<P>
The farmer with a background of senior middle school felt "a
bright prospect in growing grain" because the state has raised the
grain-purchased prices, and relieved all burdens for farmers
except the agricultural tax.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that he earned 350,000 yuan last year, and has bought
five tractors. He plans to plant 47 hectares of land this year.
</P>
<P>
Liu Mingjiu, a farmer at Songzhan Town, is specialized in
raising pigs.
</P>
<P>
Pointing at the rows of tide pigpens, Liu said happily that he
is raising 600 pigs valued at 480,000 yuan. "All of them are
growing well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers living along the banks the Songhua River in Zhaodong
city have turned out to dig ice and catch fish with drill steel
and fishing tackles, and then sell them to urban districts.
</P>
<P>
According to Tian Fengshan, the provincial governor, some 20
million farmers are making use of the slack winter season to learn
scientific farming skills.
</P>
<P>
A meeting room of Jucheng Village is often squeezed with crowds
of farmers, old and young and male and female, watching
documentary films about agro-techniques.

<HEADLINE> NATO General Satisfied with Peace Mission in Bosnia  (By Jiang Yaping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO peace mission has been
carried out smoothly in Bosnia and the Dayton peace accord will be
implemented, IFOR commander Leighton Smith told Xinhua today at
the IFOR headquarters in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"I have inspected a lot of troops and I think they are
extraordinarily professional and they are exactly what I expected
to see," the U.S. Admiral said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he is "particularly impressed by the leadership"
of the IFOR troops and also satisfied with the soldiers who know
precisely what their job is.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord officially signed last month in
Paris, a 60,000-strong NATO-led multinational peace implementation
force (IFOR) will be deployed in Bosnia to enforce the accord.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 troops have already arrived in the war-torn
country since they formally took over from the U.N. peace-keeping
forces on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Smith said his troops' priority at the moment is to dissuade
the Serbs from leaving Sarajevo, which under the Dayton accord
will be unified and put into the control of the Muslim-led
government as from March 19.
</P>
<P>
"What I am trying to do now is to project correct information
about what the peace process is, correct information about what
IFOR is doing and will do, so that all the people in Sarajevo will
be able to make a choice to go where they want."
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old general complained that the Bosnian government
has not made enough efforts to calm the Serbs' fear and make them
to stay.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, thousands of Serbs have left their homes
in Sarajevo, and some even torched their houses before
leaving. According to Serb sources, the Serb-controlled areas in
Sarajevo have a population of more than 120,000.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government has been working on an amnesty law which
will be distributed particularly to the Sarajevo Serbs who plan to
leave for fear of possible retaliation, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that IFOR troops are only responsible for the
military aspects of the peace accord, not the civilian ones. "It
is not my job to be the final arbiter in all potential peace
non-compliance issues."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the failed exchange of POWs on January 15
and 16, which was scrapped by the Bosnian government on the ground
that the Serbs refused to release 4,000 detained civilians and war
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
If the conflicting sides fail to exchange all the POWs by
January 19, it will be a first heavy blow to the implementation of
the Dayton accord.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR commander said he strongly favors an integrated police
force comprising both Muslims and Serbs to patrol the Serb
Sarajevo areas after the Serb troops' withdrawal on January 19.

<P>
WELLINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Consumers Price Index
rose by 0.6 percent in New Zealand during the December 1995
quarter, bringing the 1995 calendar year's figure to 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics New Zealand said today the 0.6 percent increase
compares with increases of 0.2 percent and 1.0 percent in the
September and June quarters.
</P>
<P>
Economists blamed the booming housing market in the country's
largest city Auckland for pushing the index higher. The average
house price in the city has climbed one third in the past two
years to 200,000 dollars (130,000 U.S. dollars), 50,000 dollars
higher than the national figure.
</P>
<P>
But apart from housing which increased by 1.2 percent in the
quarter, Statistics New Zealand figures also showed a 0.9 percent
rise in grocery food prices, including those for milk, bread and
bread rolls, aerated soft drinks and potato crisps and snack food.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter, prices also went up for newspapers, writing
paper and refills, women's clothing, furniture, used cars and
vehicle insurance, as well as long-distance bus, rail and ferry
fares and domestic airfares.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
has decided to educate 800,000 headmasters of middle and primary
schools, or 80 percent of the total number of principals, over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan released here today, the principals will be
asked to learn modern educational concepts and improve their
management skills.
</P>
<P>
Each of them will have to spend at least 200 hours at a special
training center or teacher training school before he or she is
accredited.
</P>
<P>
The commission's statistics show that more than 35 percent of
the middle school teachers have not yet acquired academic
credentials as prescribed by law, and the proportion in primary
schools is 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
A headmaster of a Chinese school was in most cases in the past
a former teacher at the school.
</P>
<P>
The commission urged provincial governments to draw up detailed
plans for a training program. There is already a national teacher
training center as well as more than 2,000 teacher training
schools in the country.

</P>
<P>
Li Jingmou, chairman of the Zhengzhou Commodities Exchange,
China's first futures exchange founded in 1990 in central China's

KAMPALA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Tourism is one the fastest
growing sector in Uganda's economy, with an annual average growth
rate of 20 percent, the local daily "the New Vision" reported

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Hangzhou, the provincial
capital of Zhejiang Province, has been successful in banning the
use of styrofoam fast food boxes.
</P>
<P>
Paper food boxes have been used since September of last year to
replace the styrofoam ones, which are difficult to dispose of.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou is the first city in China to outlaw the use of
styrofoam boxes. It is a famous tourist attraction that is known
as the "Heavenly Paradise".
</P>
<P>
In the past, about 200,000 styrofoam fast food boxes were used
every day in the city, accounting for 40 percent of the city's
plastic waste materials.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it takes about 500 years for styrofoam to
decompose. According to public health officials, Hangzhou will
continue efforts to look for environmentally-friendly substitutes
for plastic packaging materials and agricultural-use plastic
sheeting.

<HEADLINE> China to Lower Investment in Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China plans to use 90 billion
yuan of fixed assets investment in postal and telecommunications
project this year, which is almost the same volume as that in
1995, today's "China Daily" quoted Wu Jichuan, minister of the
postal and telecommunications industry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts attribute this a lot to the government's
tight money policy and strict control over foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
The sector is expected to get a total of 125.6 billion yuan in
revenue this year, up 28 percent over 1995, and to have a total of
130 billion yuan in traffic volume, an increase of 34 percent over
1995, according to Wu Jichuan.
</P>
<P>
Wu also announced the sector's strategic development targets
for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000):
</P>
<P>
The sector's traffic volume will grow at an annual average rate
of 25 percent, while the revenues will rise at a rate of 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 500 billion yuan will be invested in the sectors'
fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
The country's long-distance telephone switching capacity will
be added 2.5 million lines, bringing the total up to 6 million
lines.
</P>
<P>
The country's public phone switching capacity will also rise
from the present 91 million lines to 170 million lines by the year
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The subscribers of telephones, including that of mobile phones,
will climb from the current 44.3 million to 123 million.
</P>
<P>
As a result, there will be 30 to 40 telephones for every 100
people in the country's urban areas, and an average of 10.5
telephones for every 100 people in the countryside by the turn of
this century.

</P>
<P>
Pierce, 21, seeded fourth in the tournament, dropped to the

The French woman beat Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in last year's

<HEADLINE> Indian Court Asks CBI to Submit Papers on Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian special judge V.B.
Gupta Wednesday asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to
submit documents and other relevant papers in support of the
charges filed Tuesday in the 65-crore rupee Hawala racket, the
Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The court directed the CBI to submit these documents by January
29.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the CBI Tuesday filed charges
against seven leading politicians, including Bharatiya Janata
party (BJP) President L.K. Advani, and sought the president's
sanction to prosecute three cabinet ministers for their
involvement in the Hawala scandal.
</P>
<P>
The move has led to the resignation of all the three ministers
-- Agriculture Minister Balram Jakhar, Human Resources Development
Minister Madhavrao Scindia, and Water Resources and Parliamentary
Affairs Minister Vidya Charan Shukla -- Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
In a related report today, the Times of India said it has got
photocopies of six charge sheets filed against the seven
politicians.
</P>
<P>
The papers showed that the politicians had received huge bribes
from the suspected Hawala dealers (persons involved in illegal
trading of foreign exchange). The bribes had been paid under
three categories -- departmental expenses, political expenses and
other expenses.
</P>
<P>
According to the papers, the Hawala dealers had paid six
million rupees (about 168,000 US dollars) to BJP leader Advani, 10
million rupees (about 279,000 dollars) to former deputy prime
minister Devi Lal, and 1.05 million rupees (about 29,000 dollars)
to All India Indira Congress (breakaway faction of the ruling
Congress Party) Working President Arjun Singh.

<P>
KIEV, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The commander of the Black Sea
Fleet, Eduart Baltin, has been removed from his post, the press
center of the fleet announced here today.
</P>
<P>
His removal reportedly complies with an agreement signed
between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma, who visited Russia on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Baltin was removed because of his strong
attitude over the Black Sea Fleet, which was commanded and manned
mostly by Russians but based in independent Ukraine after the
breakup of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Baltin's attitude became the main factor hindering the
solution of problems between Russia and Ukraine over the Black Sea
Fleet, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Years of negotiations have brought agreements under which
Russian owns half the fleet outright and rents another quarter
from Ukraine, giving Russia 669 of the fleet's aging ships and the
Ukrainian navy 164.

<HEADLINE> Conspirators of Bomb Plot Get Stiff Sentences in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A blind Egyptian cleric and
nine followers convicted of plotting a "war of urban terrorism"
in New York were sentenced here today to long prison terms despite
their professions of innocence.
</P>
<P>
They were convicted of plotting to blow up the United Nations,
the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in
Manhattan, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels and the George
Washington Bridge in New York in a single day of terror.
</P>
<P>
Under high intense security, the Manhattan federal court
sentenced Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, 57-year old Muslim cleric and
the spiritual leader of the conspiracy, to life imprisonment
without parole for plotting to kill Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
One of his followers, El Sayyid Nosair, was also sentenced to
life in prison for his role in the bomb plot and for killing the
anti-Arab militant Rabbi Meir Kahane in a New York hotel in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The other eight defendants received prison terms of 25 to 57
years for what the prosecutors called a "war of urban terrorism"
aimed at altering U.S. policy in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Their convictions represented the biggest terrorism trial in
the U.S. history and were related to the bombing of the World
Trade Center in New York on February 26, 1993, which killed six
people and injured more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, a large group of police officers wearing
bulletproof vests and armed with semiautomatic weapons guarded the
federal courthouse and two bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled with
federal agents.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece today formally opened its
liaison office in the Macedonian capital of Skoplje, a move hailed
as a major step in improving ties between the two former foes.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of liaison offices by Greece and Macedonia
in each other's capitals is an important event," reports reaching
here quoted Aleksander Malas, first director of the Greek office,
as telling a ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The event will increase the momentum that has been gained by
the signing in New York in September of a temporary agreement on
the normalization of their relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Macedonian Foreign Ministry described the
establishment as the first step in implementing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the agreement, Greece lifted its trade
sanctions on Macedonia which was imposed in 1993 after the latter
refused to change its name and national flag. On its part, the
former Yugoslav republic revised the design on its national flag.
</P>
<P>
The two countries failed to reach agreement on the name of
Macedonia, which Greece says implies Macedonia's territorial
claims for one of its provinces of the same name, at the latest
talks last week. But the two sides agreed to continue their
negotiations.

MANAGUA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Ernesto Leal described Honduran navy chief's statements on
Honduras' readiness to use force in a maritime dispute between the
two countries as "deplorable" and "out-of-place."
</P>
<P>
"I have read the statements supposedly made by Bruno Fontana,
the commander of Honduras' navy, and frankly they are deplorable
and truly out of place," said Leal who was quoted today by the
newspaper La Tribuna.
</P>
<P>
In his statements, Fontana said that the Honduran navy does not
rule out the use of force in a maritime dispute in the Pacific
Ocean between the two countries, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper today quoted the Nicaraguan foreign minister as
saying that his country may lodge a protest over Fontana's
statements and "we are in contact with the Honduran foreign
minister to talk about this matter."
</P>
<P>
Leal and his Honduran counterpart Ernesto Paz Aguilar will meet
today to discuss the maritime boundary dispute which has sparked
several incidents between Nicaraguan naval forces and Honduran
fishermen in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Fonseca.
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, Nicaraguan navy captured three Honduran
fishing boats and 90 crewmen. One Honduran crew member was wounded
in an exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
Leal said the two sides will try to establish a "zone of
tolerance" between the two countries "while we establish the
limits of the Caribbean Sea."

The meeting between the two foreign ministers was agreed upon
during a meeting between Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro and
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina in Guatemala City when
they attended the inaugural ceremony of Guatemala's new President

million US dollars of foreign investment in 1995, some 61.4 percent
less than the previous year, the Foreign Investment Supervisory
Office said today.
</P>
<P>
It said the decrease of foreign investments was attributed to
the its economic situation and the problems that many companies

Spain was the major foreign investor in Venezuela in 1994,
followed by Holland, the Cayman Islands, the United States, Canada

In 1995, the Virgin Island was the leading investor with 61
million dollars, accounting for 25 percent of the total, and
followed by Aruba with 30 million dollars, the United States 26
million, Switzerland 16 million and Chile 12 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 99 million dollars, or 40 percent of the total foreign
investments registered in 1995, was channeled to the manufacturing
industry.

commerce 32 million dollars, transportation 28 million dollars and

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission warned
UEFA on Wednesday to accept the decision of European Court of
Justice on the football transfer system or tough sanctions will be
taken.
</P>
<P>
The Commision would write to UEFA in the days ahead telling it
the judgment had to be obeyed, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
UEFA and FIFA reaffirmed their opposition to the EU judgment,
but expressed their willing to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
Last month the court abolished the existing limits on
three-foreigners in a team, allowing as many foreign players in
European Union clubs as wanted. Transfer fees for out-of-contract
players were also scrapped, due to the Bosman issue.
</P>
<P>
Both FIFA and UEFA responded in a joint statement Wednesday,
confirming their stance to maintain the existing restrictions.
</P>
<P>
But the Commission insisted that "reasonable propositions"
should be forwarded by UEFA in conformity with EU labour laws, or
it would take supplementary measures, including fines.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, the Commision may skip UEFA to contact directly
with European leagues, reports said.

BRUSSELS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski said today that NATO's implementation force (IFOR)
enforcing the Bosnian peace treaty could use Polish military
facilities if necessary.
</P>
<P>
He made the offer during his meeting with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana and members of the Council of
Permanent Representatives at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Solana said he appreciated the offer and would consider it,
adding that NATO laid great stress on deepening cooperation with
Poland, "one of the most active partners of NATO."
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski noted that Polish soldiers, who will soon start
their peace-keeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, were
fulfilling Poland's obligations as a NATO partner and promoting
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bosnian peace agreement signed in Paris on December
14, Polish soldiers will join the 60,000-strong NATO-led
multinational peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Solana, the Polish president repeated the
"strong wish" of his country to become a NATO member at an early
date. He urged NATO to map out its Eastern Expansion timetable
soon and to open talks with Poland before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"It is both in keeping with the interests of Poland and the
demands of a new security mechanism in Europe," he said, adding
that its entry would not affect the security of Russia and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Poland would be loathe to see a new dividing line appear in
Europe," he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
Orphans and disabled children are not the only ones benefitting
from Hangzhou residents.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 a local newspaper reported that Zhao Qiangying, a
uremia patient in critical condition, could not afford an
operation that could possibly save her life. Local residents
donated 63,000 yuan to her within one week.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma Shiyong, president of the Hangzhou Charitable
Society and deputy Hangzhou mayor, the charity undertaking is
intended to help childless senior residents, orphans, deserted
infants, families living under the poverty line and other people
in financial difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou's social welfare institutes, homes for the aged,
children's welfare institutes, and factories run by welfare
organizations have helped a large number of the needy people, Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the local social welfare system is now taking care of
the childless old people, raising orphans, helping the disabled,
aiding the poor and assisting those in financial difficulty.
</P>
<P>
All sectors of society are being encouraged to carry forward
humanitarianism and give more assistance to those people, he said.
</P>
<P>
While preparing for its establishment, the Hangzhou Charitable
Society opened ten charity bazaars, and organized benefit
performances and donation collection.
</P>
<P>
Within one year, 71 enterprises and institutions and thousands
of individuals contributed money and materials totaling 4.27
million yuan, Mao said.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou-based Chunsili Cosmetics Company donated 60,000
yuan to the society. "Enterprises should help those in financial
difficulty. Only a society full of compassion is a fine one," the
company Manager Jin Guifu said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Hangzhou City Charitable Society has sent 380,000
yuan worth-of tonics, washing machines and pianos to the
Children's Welfare Institute, the Social Welfare Institute and
low-income families, Mao said.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that the society plans to spend 20 million yuan
building a charity center in Hangzhou. The center will have such
facilities as a 200-bed apartment building for senior residents, a
50-bed charity hospital and a charity service agency to provide
professional training and advise to the disabled and low-income
people.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou Residents Support Charity (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- "We are grateful to the
Hangzhou City Charitable Society and the numerous uncles, aunts,
brothers and sisters who have cared for us." With tears in their
eyes, two little deaf-mute girls used sign language to express
their heartfelt thanks to those who helped them return to
school.
</P>
<P>
Li Beizhi and Zheng Suliang, both ten years old, made the sign
at the end of 1995 at a meeting to mark the establishment of the
Hangzhou City Charitable Society in Hangzhou, the capital of east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
They dropped out of the Hangzhou School for Deaf-Mutes in 1994
because of financial difficulties. Last March the Hangzhou City
Charitable Society fetched them from their rural homes 100 km
from Hangzhou and paid their tuitions, enabling them to continue
their studies.
</P>
<P>
Li and Zheng, both fourth grade students now, are among the
best students in their class.
</P>
<P>
Li said in sign language, "I have three homes now. One is the
true one where my parents live, another is my school and still
another is the charitable society."
</P>
<P>
In recent years the charity undertaking has enjoyed support
from all sectors of society in Hangzhou, a beautiful city which is
best known for the picturesque West Lake.
</P>
<P>
An editorial in a local newspaper said, "More and more Hangzhou
residents are practicing charity, one of the traditional Chinese
virtues, in their everyday life."
</P>
<P>
Charitable campaigns, such as the campaign to help orphans and
disabled children to recover and the orphan adoption campaign
launched in 1994, are still under way.
</P>
<P>
To date, nearly 3,000 families and 30 enterprises have donated
a total of one million yuan to the Hangzhou Children's Welfare
Institute, according to Mao Tianyu, secretary general of the
Hangzhou City Charitable Society.
</P>
<P>
The money has been used to provide medical help to dozens of
orphans and disabled children in the institute suffering from
congenital heart diseases, cleft palate or other defects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ding Hao, an orphan suffering from infantile paralysis, was
enrolled into Hangzhou University last year, with financial
assistance from a local enterprise.
</P>
<P>
He is China's first university student to come from a
children's welfare institute.

<HEADLINE> China Neither Expansionist Nor Aggressive, Keating Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
Paul Keating said here today that China is neither an expansionist
nor aggressive power and will not become one in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe China is an expansionist or aggressive power,
or that it is likely to become so," Keating said at the Singapore
Lecture on the theme of "Australia, Asia and the New Regionalism."
</P>
<P>
Noting that China is an essential and central part of the
regional community, he said the sheer size of its population and
economy raised questions for the rest of the world about how China
should be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping and
President Jiang Zemin had brought profound benefits for the
international community as a whole, not just for China. Therefore,
Keating said, there was little doubt about what the broad approach
should be.
</P>
<P>
"Above all, the answer is to ensure that China is engaged
comprehensively in global and regional institutions. This has been
a major aim of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) and the
ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) Regional Forum to
engage China, not to contain it or attempt to isolate it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Keating, who arrived here from Malaysia this morning on a
one-day visit, met his Singapore counterpart Goh Chok Tong soon
after his arrival and left for home this evening.

<HEADLINE> Former Mayor Convicted in Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Court of Appeal of Turku,
about 100 kilometers southwest of Helsinki, convicted a former
mayor and two other persons of corruption today.
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor of Turku Juhani Leppa and Director of the Turku
Tax Bureau Erkki Jaaskelainen were both sentenced to serving a
nine-month term outside prison. Businessman Heikki Elia was
sentenced to one year in jail.
</P>
<P>
The three convicts sold, in January 1993, to the Finnish
Central Savings Bank the building of a real estate company, which
they jointly owned and which was to go bankrupt. They illegally
took five million markkas (about 1.02 million U.S. dollars)
from the sale as commissions.
</P>
<P>
Elia and Leppa each pocketed 1.2 million markkas (246,761
dollars) and Jaaskelainen took 800,000 markkas (164,508 dollars),
thus transferring the assets of the real estate company to
personal accounts in an effort to avoid paying debts and
inflicting huge losses on creditors.
</P>
<P>
Leppa was removed from his post last May when the Turku
District Court first handed down its ruling.

<HEADLINE> Australian Imports Up in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia's merchandise
imports continued to rise in December after a strong surge in the
previous month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The monthly merchandise imports increased by five percent to
6.59 billion Australian dollars (4.88 billion US dollars) in
December on a seasonally adjusted basis, said the ABS.
</P>
<P>
Today's figures indicated that growing domestic demand
continued to suck in imports at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise imports rose by four percent to 6.302 billion
Australian dollars (4.663 billion US dollars) last November over
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Growing imports in the past few months indicated that
Australia's economy is regaining strength faster than expected.
This will inevitably blow up the country's trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Treasury last December revised the forecast of
current account deficit for the fiscal year of 1995-96 from 27
billion Australian dollars (20 billion US dollars) to 21 billion
Australian dollars (15.5 billion US dollars). But the latest
figures indicate that the trade deficit for 1995-1996 could be
higher than forecast.
</P>
<P>
The accelerating economic growth, combined with a strong trend
of wage growth and the impact of a prolonged budget crisis in the
United States, is expected to force the Reserve Bank of Australia
to raise interest rates before the next federal election, which is
due by May.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Drops in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Albania dropped to
7.5 percent in 1995 from 400 percent in 1991, an Albanian
economist said here today.
</P>
<P>
Economist Fatos Gogoli said that the inflation rate is expected
to decline further this year with the increase in investment and
national economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Gogoli attributed the decline to the increase of investment in
production and commercial sectors, the government's strict control
on money supply and the recovery and development of agricultural,
animal husbandry and food processing industries.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the investments made by Albanians, foreigners and
overseas Albanians totaled 120 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the remittances sent by Albanians working in foreign
countries, about 400 million dollars every year, also played an
important role in the economic development.
</P>
<P>
There are 450,000 Albanians working abroad, accounting for 14
percent of the country's total population.

<HEADLINE> Chamber Pots Becoming A Thing of the Past in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Every morning, before the sun
came up, wives or husbands living in the older parts of downtown
Shanghai would step outside carrying the family's chamber pot to a
cart parked in the lane.
</P>
<P>
For generations, most residents of China's largest city lived
without the luxury of flush toilets in their houses or apartments,
but had to keep a smelly wooden pot in their livingroom or
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past decade, at least 250,000 families have bid
farewell to the embarassing chamber pots," Shanghai's Jiefang
Daily reported earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
"There are about 300,000 families living in the Huangpu
district, and almost every family used to have a chamber pot," the
report explained, noting that, "after about 10 years of renovation
and reconstruction, only 50,000 families in the district are still
using chamber pots."
</P>
<P>
Most of the families who don't have flush toilets live in
rundown houses built around the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
In a "wipe out chamber pots campaign," the municipal government
in recent years has sped up efforts at rebuilding old houses or
levelling old ones and building new ones, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents of Nanshi District in the old part of
Shanghai still live in ramshackle houses and use chamber pots. But
over the last two years, the local government has rebuilt 900,000
square meters of housing and 50,000 families now enjoy the comfort
and convenience of flush toilets, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"By the year 2000, when the reconstruction project of
Shanghai's old town is complete, the last chamber pot will
hopefully be sent to be an exhibit in a history museum," the
newspaper concluded. enditem.

GUANGZHOU, January 18 (Xinhua)-- China's right to develop a
part of the Pacific Ocean bed that is rich in metallic mineral
resources, sufficient to satisfy Chinese needs for many years, has
been recognized as by the UN, according to Chinese oceanographers.
</P>
<P>
An announcement was made by Chinese officials about China's
right to develop the piece of sea bed, that covers 105,000 sq.km,
was recognized by the United Nations for China's pioneering
exploratory work on a 300,000-sq.-km patch of the Pacific Ocean
bed.
</P>
<P>
Four Pacific scientific expeditions have been carried out by
the China Ocean Society (COS) since the early 1980s. The latest
one finished its work late last year after a five month survey of
the ocean area.
</P>
<P>
COS was set up in 1990 with the approval of the Chinese

<HEADLINE> Brazil Announces Targets for 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government's
most important goals in 1996 are to generate investments, spur
economic growth and ensure fair income-distribution, President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Other goals include the recovery of bank interest rates and the
consolidation of the Real Plan, he told a press conference in the
Planalto Palace.
</P>
<P>
Brazil changed its currency from the cruzeiro to the real in
July 1994 in a bid to bring down the inflation, and the efforts
paid off in cutting the rate of inflation to 6.9 percent in July
1994 from 46 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Resolving social problems would also be a government priority
this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the work accomplished by his government in 1995,
the president highlighted efforts in the areas of health and
education.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said that 42,000 families had been resettled last year
through the agrarian reform program, which had benefited the
country as a whole, not only landless peasants.
</P>
<P>
He denied any plans for a cabinet reshuffle and stressed the
unity of the political alliance formed during the 1994
presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Bright Future for China's Ship Repairers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The world's fourth largest
shipbuilder, China hopes to take advantage of its existing
infrastructure and know-how to advance its ship repair sector,
today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The report says China State Shipbuilding Corp. (CSSC), the
country's leading ship repairer, earned 1.5 billion yuan last
year, dwarfing its 1.2 billion yuan earnings of 1994.
</P>
<P>
It quotes Li Junfeng, an official with the CSSC as saying that
the volume included 85 million US dollars reaped through repairing
foreign vessels. Of those deals, nearly 60 percent of ship owners
came from abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Greece has replaced Hong Kong by taking the lion's share of
last year's orders, with more than 100 vessels to be repaired."
said Li.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rising momentum to the completion of two big
repair docks, which have now been open for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
One is the Chengxi floating dock in east China's Jiangsu
Province, able to handle payloads up to 100,000 DWTs (dead weight
tonnage). The other is Wenchong dry dock in Guangzhou, bearing
payloads up to 100,000 DWTs.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these, construction is underway for two more
repair docks, including a 80,000-DWT floating dock at the
mainland's southernmost port city of Beihai, and a 150,000-DWT dry
dock at Shanhaiguan along the Bohai Sea in north China.
</P>
<P>
"This year, our company has aimed for a new high, to earn 1.8
billion yuan from repairing business," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The backbone of the national repair dock layout also includes
an additional Nantong dock operating under the Ministry of
Communications, and some shipbuilders such as Jiangnan and Hudong
of Shanghai, Dalian in Liaoning and Xingang in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Now CSSC's total capacity for repairing has been lifted to more
than 500,000 DWTs.

<P>
BONNE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- German legal authorities had no
intention to end their investigation into allegations of tennis
superstar Steffi Graf and her father's tax evasion case, according
to a report on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The authorities made a clear that there was no truth to reports
by ZDF televison of Garmany they would drop their inquiries if
Graff paid a multi-million-dollar fine.
</P>
<P>
Also, Mannheim state prosecutor Peter Wechsung said Tuesday the
case would need court approval if the payment was done. The final
assessment would be based on the result of the investigation and
the final report of tax investigators.
</P>
<P>
Wechsung said prosecutors had from the start taken into account
the diminished responsibility, considering that the first alleged
offense took place when she was under 18. It followed that the
case should not be dropped in return for a fine.
</P>
<P>
However, the 26-year-old world nmuber one has already deposited
more than 13.6 million U.S. dollars (20 million marks) to cover
possible back taxes and has no reason to be detained from

<HEADLINE> New Leads Discovered About Fugitive Cali Drug Lord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Police discovered
new clues that could lead to the recapture of Jose Santacruz
Londono, the third highest-ranking drug lord of the Cali Cartel,
who escaped from prison here six days ago.
</P>
<P>
Three telephone calls to Santacruz intercepted by the police
indicated that the drug lord is holed up at a ranch in a rural
area where the weather is hot and that he is in poor health, eager
for treatment for his arm.
</P>
<P>
According to a police intelligence report, Santacruz sent a
letter on Tuesday to the media in the capital, saying that during
the six months in the La Picota prison he was questioned neither
about drug trafficking nor over the death of Antioquia Governor
Antonio Roldan Betancur.
</P>
<P>
The letter, faxed from a factory in northern Cali, was
delivered by a man and a woman, young in appearance. Police are
making effort to identify and locate the two persons.
</P>
<P>
The drug lord said in the letter that he was only interrogated
on January 11 about illegal enrichment. "They asked me about two
armored vehicles owned by two very well-known people in the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he accused the prosecutor's office and the
"faceless" justice system of violating the law for not granting
him requisites for his health and pointed out that "I couldn't let
myself die because of that."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police sources said that in spite of the fact that
the letter has the signature and fingerprints that would supposedly
identify Santacruz, the letter has not been established as
authentic.
</P>
<P>
The government is offering a 2 billion-peso reward (about 2
million U.S. dollars) for the recapture of the drug trafficking
boss.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican, U.S. to Start Talks on Lingerie Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican government
will take a firm stand against U.S. restriction on lingerie export
in their talks scheduled to begin in Geneva Thursday, said Deputy
Foreign Trade Minister Francisco Chacon.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants to restrict exports if Costa Rican
manufacturers do not use U.S. fabrics to produce lingerie
items.
</P>
<P>
But the Central American country is unwilling to accept the
restriction. Jose Rossi, Costa Rica's foreign trade minister is
currently in Washington to seek a solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica requested a round of consultations within the
framework of World Trade Organization (WTO) following the failure
to resolve the controversy with U.S. trade authorities.
</P>
<P>
The government of Costa Rica holds there exists no such proof
as required by WTO dispositions that the country's sales are
affecting U.S. manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, textiles producers in Costa Rica have showed their
intention to accept the U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
Jaime Guardia, president of the textile and apparel industry
chamber, said they prefer to accept a quota of 40 million dozens
of articles made with U.S. fabrics than keep a quota of 14.4
million that only indicates an increase of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The industry is capable of producing 24 million dozens of items
of lingerie for women, according to the chamber.

<HEADLINE> Vegetable Preservatives Used for Animal Semen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Preservatives used for keeping
vegetables have been used successfully for keeping oxen and sheep
semen in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and a
breakthrough has been made in impregnating female animals using
the sperm preserved in this method.
</P>
<P>
Research on preserving livestock semen by using the vegetable
preservative was a major project for the region during the Eighth
Five-Year Plan (1990-1995), the first instance of such use both in
China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The preservative comes from 87 chemicals extracted from 18
different plants, and has many advantages over other kinds of
preservatives. Frozen sperm protected with this method can survive
for 50 hours at 38 degrees Celsius after being thawed out.
</P>
<P>
The sperm kept in this way are effective on 78.5 percent of
cows and 68.3 percent of sheep.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that there is still much room for research in this
field because there are thousands of cold-resistant plants that
exist in nature but only 18 kinds have been used in making the
preservative.

<HEADLINE> Divorce School for Saving Endangered Marriages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- "How do you save an
endangered marriage?" or "How can the rights of women and children
in divorce cases be protected?" and "What are the negative effects
of divorce on children?"
</P>
<P>
These are the kinds of questions that are now being answered in
courses offered at a special "pre-divorce school" at Renqiu City
in the central part of north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 couples applying for divorce have come here since
the school opened in July, before deciding to take the matter to
court, to learn how to properly handle such matters as division of
property and custody of children.
</P>
<P>
In the process, some couples have dropped their lawsuits and
even kept their marriages from falling apart, while those who
divorced have learned to handle matters in accordance with the
law, say school administrators who come from the city's courts of
justice and the city's Federation of Women.
</P>
<P>
The number of disputes that are the result of divorces have
also dropped after "students" learned more about the marriage law.
</P>
<P>
With a divorce rate rising from 1990's 5.9 per thousand to 7.1
per thousand last year, the number of property and custody
disputes in China has increased, and the number of criminal cases
involving the children of single-parent families' has been also on
the rise.
</P>
<P>
Similar divorce schools have been established in Beijing and
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.

URUMQI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Some farmers in Shawan County in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region who have become
affluent are making efforts to help other villagers prosper.
</P>
<P>
These farmers earn an average annual income of over 100,000
yuan (about 12,044 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
At lectures organized by the local government, these skillful
farmers have been willing to share their experience with others.

Wang Zuoyi, who earned some 9,000 yuan by planting a small plot
of cucumbers last year, advised people to choose proper seeds and
not to water the plants until the first fruit on the main stem is
picked.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to worry because there's a huge market for fresh
vegetables," he said when asked why he revealed his secrets to
others who earned only about 2,000 yuan from the same acreage.
</P>
<P>
Feng Dingwang, a villager in Sandaogoucun, who is in his early
50s, reaped an average of 7,500 kg of wheat per ha last year, much
higher than the region's average figure of 4,500 kg. At a lecture
he also introduced his experience in growing wheat.
</P>
<P>
"Such lectures are well-received by local farmers as they are
much easier to understand," said Wang Delin, deputy director of
the county, which has plans to invite agronomists to share their
farming expertise with local villagers.

LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Arthur Scargill, leader of the
new Socialist Labor Party, said that more than half of the
national executive committee of the Rail Maritime and Transport
Union (RMT), have applied to join his party, according to press
reports here today.
</P>
<P>
Scargill said that Bob Crow, assistant general secretary of the
RMT, had also joined his new party in a personal capacity.
</P>
<P>
This proved that the new Socialist Labor Party could attract
trade unionists.
</P>
<P>
Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM),
announced his breakaway from the Opposition Labor and the setting
up of the Socialist Labor Party on January 13.
</P>
<P>
He accused Labor leader Tony Blair of betraying socialism and
he vowed to challenge Labor candidates at the next general
election due to be held on May 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
But Scargill denied today that his party received financial
support from the RMT.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 17 (Xinhua) - The newly established
peacekeeping operation in Croatia will cost an estimated 128.5
million dollars for the first six months, according to a report of
the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali has said that the six-month cost estimate will cover
spendings on 5,000 troops, 600 civilian police, 469 international
civilian staff and 681 locally recruited staff.
</P>
<P>
The operation, called the U.N. Transitional Administration for
Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES), is to
oversee the return of the last Serb-held area of Croatia to
Zagreb. The lastest peace-keeping program was authorized by a
unanimous Security Council vote on Monday.
</P>
<P>
UNTAES will govern the region for an initial 12 months, with an
option of additional 12 months, under an agreement signed last
November by Croatia and the local Serbian community.

<HEADLINE> Major Offered Eurosceptic Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major has been sent a message that his Tory government would be
continuously pressed to move in a sceptical direction on Europe,
reported the Financial Times newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results of the Conservative party's ever biggest
consultation process launched by Major himself in the middle of
last year showed that party members generally were increasingly
disenchanted with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In the process, about 800 meetings were held by local Tory
parties, many of which were attended by government ministers and
senior Tory party officials.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results showed that the vast majority indicated
that they were unhappy with the interference from Brussels in
Britain's domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
And a small minority even called for the U.K. to withdraw from
the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The findings will make it difficult for the embattled prime
minister to respond to the concerns of pro-European party members.
</P>
<P>
However, Major is comforted by widespread support for his
decision to keep options open on whether sterling should join a
single European currency in 1999, the report said.

<P>
NEW YORK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average plunged 21.32 to 5,066.90 today.
</P>
<P>
The New York Stock Exchange ended a volatile session,
responding to the release of sluggish economic data.
</P>
<P>
All technology stocks took a nosedive today. The market has
some concern about the personal-computer stocks and recession
fears began to impact some of the stocks, according to some market
analysts.
</P>
<P>
The country's leading indicator of future economic activity,
which was released earlier today, fell 0.3 percent in November.
Economists had expected the leading gauge to remain stable or rise
slightly.
</P>
<P>
In a quarterly report, the Federal Reserve (Fed) said the
economy grew modestly at the end of 1995, as Christmas sales were
weak and the pace of manufacturing industry declined.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Fed report may influence the central bank to
cut interest rates for a third time, possibly at their next
meeting beginning January 30.
</P>
<P>
In a third report, the Commerce Department reported that
America's trade deficit narrowed by 2.5 percent in October, as
both imports and exports declined.
</P>
<P>
Bonds kept their gains despite an afternoon announcement from
Washington that a budget meeting between President Clinton and top
Republicans had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
But technology stocks were hit hard after a disappointing
earnings report from Intel.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks rose with bonds and in reaction to continued
positive earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
Transportation stocks were mixed as airline stocks rose but
trucking and rail stocks declined.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter will lead a 40-member delegation to observe the Palestinian
general election to be held in the West Bank and Gaza on Saturday,
organizers said today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which comprises elected officials, academics
and international democracy advocates, will arrive in Israel
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based Carter Center and the National Democratic
Institute for International Affairs (NDI) are sponsoring the
mission.
</P>
<P>
"The purposes of the mission are to demonstrate international
support for democracy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip," Carter
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
And the purposes are also to "promote public confidence in the
electoral process, and to access the electoral process in relation
to Palestinian law and international norms," Carter added.
</P>
<P>
There are dozens of other U.S. and international observer
groups that will assist Palestinians during the election and
monitor it for inconsistencies.
</P>
<P>
During the last three months, representatives from the Carter
Center and NDI have been monitoring preparations for the election,
including voter and candidate registration, media coverage, and
the role of security forces.
</P>
<P>
The NDI said in a recent report that the preparations had been
"conducted in an open and conducive environment."

WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed
to accept as refugess 214 Bosnian Muslims held in Bosnian Serb
camps under poor conditions, the U.S. State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press
briefing here that 50 of them are expected to arrive in the

The 214 are among nearly 800 Muslim refugees who were driven
out from the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in northeastern Bosnia by
the Serb forces last July and fled to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The United States joined the International Committee of the
Red Cross in pressing for the release of the Muslims refugees.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that in addition to the 214 to be settled down in
the U.S., Australia had agreed to accept 103, France to take 70

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Observatory Fire Kills Three Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A fire raged through the
world's largest and most expensive observatory on a Hawaiian
mountain top Tuesday, killed three construction workers trapped in
its dome, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The fire, apparently started by a cutting torch, also injured
23 others at the Subaru Telescope Project, a 400-million-dollar
observatory under construction on top of Mauna Kea, Hawaii's
highest mountain.
</P>
<P>
The three workers trapped in the upper level of the dome were
succumbed to toxic fumes generated by burning insulation, fire
officials said. Another worker stranded on top the dome was
rescued by a county helicopter fighting a brush fire nearby.
</P>
<P>
Twenty of those injured were treated at and released from a
local hospital. But three remained hospitalized today for smoke
inhalation. They were listed in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
The observatory is expected to house a 315-inch telescope,
known as the Japan National Large Telescope and billed as the
largest and most expensive single-mirror telescope in the world.
</P>
<P>
Construction at the observatory, Japan's first major science
facility built outside the country, began in 1992 and was expected
to be completed in March.
</P>
<P>
The extent of the damage caused by the fire and its effect on
the timetable for completion were not immediately known. Twelve
other observatories are atop the 13,796-foot mountain.

<HEADLINE> Perry Justified Russia's Military Attack on Chechen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry today justified Russia's use of military forces in
response to hostage-taking by Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
"We reject the right of any group to take hostage as a means of
implementing their policies, so therefore we believe the Russian
government is entirely correct in resisting this hostage-taking
effort and resisting it very strongly," Perry told reporters at a
picture-taking session at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
After two days of bombarding Pervomayskaya with artillery and
helicopter-fired rockets, the Russian troops today reportedly
fired salvo after salvo from powerful rocket-launchers on a
village in southern Russia near the border of breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
But Perry said that the U.S. military would not have launched
an artillery assault in the event.
</P>
<P>
"We would have, to be sure, had we been asked to conduct such
an operation...chosen a surgical operation rather than the
massive, frontal use of force," the Pentagon chief said.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't want to put myself in the position of
second-guessing the Russian military. It's a very difficult
situation there, and I wish them well," Perry added.

<HEADLINE> US Budget Talks Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Scheduled negotiations
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Republican congressional
leaders were canceled on Wednesday with Republicans asking Clinton
to submit a new offer.
</P>
<P>
House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole and House Majority Leader Dick Armey informed
Clinton of the decision in a 40-minute phone call after a
closed-door Republican strategy session.
</P>
<P>
In a statement they said they were prepared to resume talks
with Clinton, "once he proposes a firm budget offer that moves in
the direction of the bipartisan common ground our proposals have
established."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the statement described the phone conversation as
"frank and useful."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton was
"disappointed" and maintained that the budget process "is not
dead," but he said its vital signs are "very faint."
</P>
<P>
Clinton had offered a plan that would balance the budget in
seven years but the Republicans say it did not go far enough to
meet their demands for trimming spending on social programs,
turning more power over to the states and cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
Major controversies include how far to go in reducing the rate
of growth of the Medicare medical insurance plan for the elderly
and the size of a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was scheduled a week ago when talks went into
recess to give both sides time to reassess their positions on
differing budget plans.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton and the Republicans planned future phone
conversations and it was hoped a meeting would occur soon.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had so far held more than 50 hours of talks.

NEW YORK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Three of the defendants who
were convicted of plotting a "war of urban terrorism" in the
United States were sentenced here today to 25 to 35 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Victor Alvarez, 29, and Mohammed Saleh, 39, each received a
prison term of 35 years and Fadil Abdelghani, 33, was sentenced to
25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The Puerto Rican-born Alvarez was convicted of helping make
bombs and providing the plotters with weapons. The other two
defendants were convicted of a crime called seditious conspiracy.
They were found guilty of trying to use force to oppose the
authority of the United States.
</P>
<P>
All the three men said during the hearing that they were
innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
Also sentenced today will be seven other defendants including
Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the spiritual leader of the group which
were charged with planning the bombing of the United Nations, FBI
offices, bridges and tunnels in New York.
</P>
<P>
Their convictions represented the biggest terrorism trial in
U.S. history and were related to the bombing of the World Trade
Center on February 26, 1993, which killed six people and injured
more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The sentencings, which took place under intense security at
Manhattan federal court, will last for the whole day.

MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian joint forces continued
their attack against Chechen terrorists still holding several
dozens of hostages in the Daghestani village of Pervomaiskoye
today, ccording to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the headquarters in charge of the hostage
rescue operation in Pervomaiskoye near the Daghestani-Chechen
border told reporters that 41 hostages had been rescued by this

</P>
<P>
The Russian forces lost 13 men killed and over 40 injured.
</P>
<P>
Russian forces' artillery and helicopters made a number of
strikes on "well-fortified" terrorists positions in the center

</P>
<P>
The spokesman confirmed that the Chechen terrorists in
Pervomaiskoye were 250 to 300 men strong when the fighting
started on Monday.

The terrorists are reportedly equipped with grenade launchers
and big-calibre machine-guns with piles and piles of ammunition.
"They can hold on forever. They will not leave anyone alive.
They will show mercy for neither themselves nor anyone else,"
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Urges "Adequate Response" to Chechen  Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The newly elected State Duma,
the Lower House of the Russian Parliament, today urged the
government to think of "an adequate response" to the increasing
Chechen terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a statement circulated here tonight, the lower chamber said,
"The last actions by (Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar) Dudayev
and his hirelings in the North Caucasus where they used the
extreme forms of terrorism necessitate an adequate response to and
measures to stop these crimes."
</P>
<P>
The statement, adopted after a discussion of the situation in
the Daghestani village of Pervomaiskoye and the Chechen conflict
in general, calls on the government "to prevent unjustified
actions which may put at risk or lead to the death of innocent
people."
</P>
<P>
The statement, adopted by a 301-24 vote with eight abstentions,
said that the Lower House "has taken the tragedy in the North
Caucasus with deep concern." The events in the Daghestani city of
Kizlyar and in Pervomaiskoye and the terrorist act against the
passengers of the Russian ferry "Avrasya" in Turkey "have shaken
Russia and the international community," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers condemned the manifestations of political and
armed terrorism and called on the Russian people to show wisdom
and restraint.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the need to "study, in the near future, the
entire set of issues associated with the struggle against
terrorism and measures to ensure the safety of people and Russia's
territory."

ANKARA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ankara-based Caucasian,
Chechen Solidarity Committee today Called for a peaceful solution
to the Trabzon ferry hijacking by pro-chechen militants.
</P>
<P>
Dursun Bolat, humanitarian aid representative of the committee,
said in Istanbul that his organization disapproves of the
hijacking and the using of passengers as hostages, which he fears
may cause friction between Turkey and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Bolat said he hopes for an immediate bloodless end to the
crisis, saying "if they reach Istanbul, being a Chechen I may go
to meet them."
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, the Caucasian, Chechen Solidarity
Committee said that the Trabzon hijacking was "a response to the
genocide being perpetrated on the Chechen people by Russia."
</P>
<P>
It said that this act of protest was similar to the one by
Chechens in Kizlyar.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "We know that those who carried out this

<P>
A group of pro-Chechen rebels hijacked the "Avrasya" passenger
ship in Turkey's Black Sea port city of Trabzon Tuesday night and
the ship was heading westward for another Turkish Black Sea port
city of Samsun this morning.

<P>
The ship was to sail from Trabzon to Russia's Sochi harbor,
some 200 people on board, most of them Russians, are held as
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Muhammed Tokcan, head of the pro-Chechen rebels, has reportedly
said that they would free the ship if Russian troops stopped
fighting against the Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
He called for the release of their friends at their Chechen
villages besieged by Russian troops.

<HEADLINE> Unita Resumes Sending Guerrillas to Assembly Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The opposition National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita) today resumed
sending its guerrillas to an assembly point at Vila Nova in the
central Huambo Province, a UN official said tonight.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Paulo Rodrigues Do Nascimento, spokesman
of the UN probe team, to reporters here.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that 116 Unita fighters are quartering at Vila
Nova town today while the government's rapid intervention police
force too started massing in Uige city in northern Angola today.
</P>
<P>
The quartering of soldiers began on November 20, 1955, one
year after the two sides reached agreements on peace in the
country.
</P>
<P>
But Unita stopped the process on December 4, complaining that
its troops were attacked the previous day by government soldiers
near Soyo, an oil producing town in northern Angola.
</P>
<P>
Nascimento, however, accused Unita of failing to quarter
its soldiers at three other assembly points at Huambo, Uige and
Bengo provinces as scheduled.

<HEADLINE> US Concerned About Missile Deployment In South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
expressed its concerns about missile proliferation in South Asia
and urged India or Pakistan not to deploy ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
"The United States believes that the deployment or the
acquisition of ballistic missile delivery systems by India or
Pakistan would be destabilizing," State Department Nicholas Burns
said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We think it would undermine the security of both countries and
of the region as a whole," Burns added.
</P>
<P>
Indian defense officials said in New Delhi yesterday that India
would deploy its medium-range Prithvi missile, which is capable of
delivering nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department warned yesterday that deployment of
this medium range missile would "go in the wrong direction and
create new tensions" in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have made our concerns about missile proliferation in South
Asia well known in both India and Pakistan," Burns said, "we have
strongly encouraged both governments not to deploy ballistic
missiles."

<HEADLINE> Pro-Chechen Militants Still Hijack Ferryboat in Black Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Pro-Chechen militants who
hijacked a Black Sea ferry to oppose the Russian attack on Chechen
rebels today appeared ready to release some of the 200 hostages on
board, showing signs that the hostage crisis could be brought to
an end without bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers claimed their struggle was for the freedom of
their homeland, but it became increasingly apparent that they
would be content with the publicity they created.
</P>
<P>
The militants seized the 3,383-ton Panama-registered ferryboat
Avrasya at the Turkish Black Sea port of Trabzon Tuesday night,
taking the 144 passengers, most of them are Russians, and 55 crew
members as hostages.
</P>
<P>
A local police official was reportedly injured in a skirmish
with the masked militants. They later forced the ship, operating
between the Crimean port of Sochi and the Turkish port, to head
for Istanbul, 1,200 kilometers west.
</P>
<P>
Muhammed Tokcan, leader of the hijackers, denied the reports
that they had used violence on the passengers and there were
scores of wounded.
</P>
<P>
"The reason why we have commandeered this ship is very
simple: I do not know what the world is thinking, but what we are
after is saving our homeland, living with our own culture ... and
we do not think there is a force which can prevent that, because,
our only choice is between freedom and death. This struggle will
go on until the Russians withdraw and a confederation of Caucasus
peoples is established," Tokcan told the Anatolia news agency in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He said they would take the ship to Istanbul, and decide the
next step there.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tokcan told a television that they would act "in
accord with people's wishes" in Istanbul, thus hinting a peaceful
end to the episode.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials reportedly said some of the passengers would
be freed in the port of Sinop, about 600 kilometers further west.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Deniz Baykal said although preparations could
have been made for all contingencies, "the important thing is to
bring the incident to a conclusion without leading to a clash or
bloodshed."
</P>
<P>
Baykal confirmed that Moscow had handed a note to the Turkish
Embassy in Moscow, "containing a justified call for measures to
ensure the safety of the Russian hostages."
</P>
<P>
But, Foreign Ministry spokesman Nurettin Nurkan dismissed
Moscow's allegations that Turkey was training Chechen fighters on
its territory and providing medical treatment to the wounded
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Nurkan said the hijackers will be tried in Turkey, adding that
it was unknown yet whether the ferryboat will be allowed into the
Bosphorus, one of the world's busiest waterways.
</P>
<P>
The recent crisis with the Chechens in Russia began on January
9, when rebels slipped past border guards and seized hostages in
Dagestan to dramatize their demand for a Russian troop withdrawal
from Chechnya. Russian troops blocked the Chechens from returning
to Chechnya with their hostages.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops entered into Chechnya, a largely Moslem republic
in Caucasus Mountains seeking to breakaway from Russia, in
December 1994.

<HEADLINE> New Duma Speaker Pledges Impartiality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The newly-elected Chairman of
the State Duma (the lower House of the Russian Parliament),
Gennady Seleznyov, told reporters today that he would "stand above
party interests and will not lobby the interests of one faction in
prejudice to other factions".
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, 48, nominated by the Communist Party, was elected
Duma speaker by 231 votes this afternoon in the third round of the
secret ballot thus surpassing the required number of 226 votes
necessary for the election.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters here soon after the voting,
Seleznyov denied assumptions made by some politicians, in
particular members of the Liberal Democratic Party of Vladimir
Zhirinovsky and the pro-government "Our Home Is Russia" bloc, that
the Communist Party faction, which has the majority in the lower
House, would talk to other factions "from a position of strength".
</P>
<P>
"That's totally untrue," he pointed out. "On the contrary,
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov has from the very
beginning proposed that everyone work constructively." "There is
no position of strength in the faction's conduct and any
corresponding reprimands are groundless," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the issue of no-confidence in the government,
Seleznyov, former editor of the Communist Party daily Pravda and
deputy speaker of the previous Duma, said that his party does not
intend to raise the issue, stressing, "At least not tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
"We will see which proposals the government headed by (Viktor)
Chernomyrdin will introduce after the shifts which have taken
place within it" recently, the new Duma speaker said.
</P>
<P>
The new Duma was elected on December 17, 1995, with the
Communist Party winning over one third of its total 450 seats --
157.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Head Activates "Poverty Clock" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- James Gustave Speth,
the Administrator of the the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), started a "poverty clock" in the northern lobby of the
U.N. building today.
</P>
<P>
The clock ticks every time another person joins the ranks of
the poor, some 47 a minute or more than 67,000 every day. It was
set up in the U.N. lobby to recognize 1996 as the International
Year for the Eradication of Poverty.
</P>
<P>
"We must never forget that behind every tick of the clock
there is a face, a person, a life," said Speth.
</P>
<P>
Three of the people whose lives have been touched by poverty
but who are working their way out of poverty traveled to the U.N.
from Zimbabwe, Bolivia and Harlem of New York and told their tales
of fighting against poverty in their communities:
</P>
<P>
-- Betty Bangira, a Zimbabwean mother of four, found her life
changed when her community joined with five others to create an
irrigation project in one of the country's desertified provinces:
</P>
<P>
-- Luis Ticona Mamani, an indigenous Aymara of the Bolivian
highlands, is now the director of an association of alpaca
herdsmen which has tripled incomes of families in the region.
</P>
<P>
-- Lenore Cola, a mother of three and a Harlem resident whose
family was homeless for four years, became involved in 1989 in a
street library program for children and their parents.
</P>
<P>
"This event is a cause for both alarm and optimism," said UNDP
Administrator Speth.
</P>
<P>
"Alarm because we are turning on a poverty clock which will
remind us that each day another 67,000 people join the ranks of
the poor. That's about 25 million people a year, most of whom will
be in the developing world, and 70 per cent of whom will be
female.
</P>
<P>
"Optimism because the international community now recognizes
the urgency of this problem, realizes what must be done and is
taking steps to halt, indeed reverse, this grim trend."
</P>
<P>
He said that UNDP has made poverty eradication the overarching
goal of its programs, working through 135 offices in developing
countries, and building its expertise in the area.
</P>
<P>
The agency is supporting developing countries as they build or
strengthen national poverty eradication strategies, setting timed
targets for progress, he added.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Reports Economy Growing Modestly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) said today that the U.S. economy was "growing at a generally
modest pace" at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's report, known as the "Beige Book" report from the
color of its cover, tracks economic activity in the 12 Federal
Reserve districts.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the economic slowdown is widespread,
both geographically and across sectors.
</P>
<P>
The report said retail sales were below expectations, with
heavy discounting. Retailers in some regions in the South and
Midwest reported moderate growth, while reports from either coast
indicated mixed results.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing activity was also mixed, the report said. Output
has slowed in the Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia and Richmond
regions. Manufacturers in the Boston, Chicago, Cleveland and
Kansas City regions continued to operate at high levels.
</P>
<P>
Most regions reported a seasonal slowdown in single-family home
sales. Commercial real estate was improving in most districts.
</P>
<P>
Most manufacturers reported modest wage and salary increases.
"Prices remain generally stable," according to most accounts.
</P>
<P>
The "Beige Book" is released about every seven weeks. The
latest report was prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
based on information collected before January 8.
</P>
<P>
Today's report came two weeks before the Fed's Open Market
Committee meets to consider possible changes in monetary policy.
Many analysts expect the Fed to lower interest rates again in the
first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Urges Full Compliance of Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
reilerated here today there is no change in Dayton agreement and
called on the warring parties to fully comply with the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
"We are insisting on the full compliance with the Dayton accord
that was signed in Paris at all times," said Holbrooke, who flew
in to Sarajevo earlier today to see whether the local parties were
sticking to the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there are two problems facing the hard-brokered
peace deal: Bosnian Serbs' struggle to delay the handover of five
Sarajevo suburbs to government control, and the government's
refusal to free Serb prisoners of war (POW). Both acts are seen as
breach of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy, the chief architect of the Dayton agreement,
said he was in Sarajevo just to see the ongoing peace process at a
crutial moment.
</P>
<P>
"On the eve of the first significant deadline, we try to assess
where we are," he said.
</P>
<P>
Midnight on Friday (23:00 GMT) is the first real test to the
implementation of the peace accord, by that time all the warring
armies are supposed to withdraw two kilometers each from the
frontline to carve out a zone of separation (ZOS). IFOR ground
troop commander Michael Walker said today at a press conference
that the parties have been cooperative so far in that aspect.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke also said the Muslim-led government should release
the Serb POWs by the deadline which also falls on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The prisoners exchange issue and the full account for missing
people are not linked issues," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The government suspended a mass exchange of POWs early this
week by demanding information and release of about 4,000 Muslims
instead of only 200 listed by the Serb side, thus posing a threat
to the full compliance of the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke held talks with IFOR commander Admiral Leighton
Smith, High Representative Carl Bildt, representatives of the
five-nation Contact Group as well as Bosnian Muslim leaders Alija
Izetbegovic and Haris Silajdzic. He is scheduled to fly to
Belgrade tonight to meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
on the issue of Serb Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, thousands of Serbs have fled their homes in
Sarajevo Serb districts which will be reverted to the rule of
Muslim-led government. A mass exodus is possible if a solution on
that issue is not found.

LUANDA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- US Ambassador to the UN
Madeleine Albright, after her arrival here today, warned Angolan
leaders the international community would withdraw support unless
they keep Angola's peace process moving.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council is running out of patience over
Angola's rocky progress toward ending its two decade-long civil
war, she warned.
</P>
<P>
"I bring from the President of the Security Council a warning
that the process has to keep moving or the international
community will simply say 'enough,'" Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who becomes President of the Security Council next
month, urged Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos and Unita
leader Jonas Savimbi to take chances in bringing last peace in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos and Savimbi will meet in Gabon on Saturday, but
people consider that the talks are in jeopardy because of the
slow pace of demobilizing the rival armies.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she is looking forward to meeting Savimbi and
Dos Santos to deliver letters from the security council and US
president Bill Clinton and to discuss practical aspects of
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(Unita) and Luanda reached peace agreements in Lusaka, Zambia in
November 1994, but the pacts are months behind schedule with each
accusing the other of frequently violating the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions
displaced in Angola's civil war which started on independence
from Portugal in 1975.

<HEADLINE> IGADD Sub-Region Has Another Year Of Good Cereal Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The food aid needs in the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD)
region has droped 50 percent to 0.6 million metric tons thanks to
another year of good harvest.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by a food situation report distributed
today here by IGADD Early Warning and Food Information System.
</P>
<P>
The report said, cereals production in the IGADD sub-region in
1995 is estimated at 18.2 million tons, slightly lower than the
bumper harvest of 1994/95.
</P>
<P>
The report contributed the good harvest to favourable rainfall
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The report also attributed the high food production in 1995 to
increased input supply, particularly in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, cereal production is 13-30 percent
above average in Kenya and Ethiopia, two-four percent above
average in Sudan and Uganda, and below average by as much as 50
percent in Eritrea and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that "the good harvests of the past two
successive years will contribute significantly to the
sub-region's recovery from acute food shortages caused by the
1993 drought, when cereal production fell to 14.6 million metric
tons, 11 percent below normal".
</P>
<P>
It said, "the sub-region's net food deficit is expected to
drop by 16 percent from last year's level to 1.6 million mt".
</P>
<P>
The IGADD includes Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Somalia, Sudan and Uganda. enditem
