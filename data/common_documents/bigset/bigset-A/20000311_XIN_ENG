DHAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investment from the
United States in Bangladesh rose to 700 million U.S. dollars in
three years from a paltry sum of 25 million dollars following the
opening-up of gas and oil sector to foreign companies for
exploration and production, officials of the U.S. embassy in Dhaka
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The embassy officials estimate that U.S. investment in
Bangladesh would go up to 2.3 billion dollars within two to four
years if the pipeline projects were completed.
</P>
<P>
The officials said investors from the United States have ranked
the oil, gas and mineral exploration as the number one field for
investment, considering the prospects of the non-agricultural
sector.
</P>
<P>
President of American Chamber (AmCham) in Bangladesh Forrest
Cookson said Friday that the country may receive another 600
million dollars in the next year if Bangladesh opens up more of
its sectors,allowing gas export to India.
</P>
<P>
The AmCham president earlier said he expected that U.S.
President Bill Clinton would propose Bangladesh to open up its gas
sector for export during his talks with Bangladeshi leaders.

<HEADLINE> WRITETHRU: Bomb Blasts Rock Colombo as State of Emergency Extended By Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, the motion to extend the state of emergency for
another month was passed in Parliament Friday evening with a
majority of 28 votes.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attacks occurred near the Ayurvedic hospital at
Borella area, the commercial center of Colombo, on a route to
Parliament where lawmakers were meeting for a monthly vote on
extending the state of national emergency and to discuss the
Defense Ministry budget.
</P>
<P>
Police believed suicide bombers set off the explosions
prematurely and had intended to target a motorcade of government
ministers and political leaders who had been expected to pass by
later after Parliament debate.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte and several high-
ranking government officials were in Parliament at the time of
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Ratwatte, who is in charge of Sri Lanka's war effort against
the rebels, is widely seen to be high on the hit list of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Over 25 of the injured persons are reported to be in serious
condition and there is the possibility of the death toll rising.
</P>
<P>
Several buses and cars were severely damaged in the explosions,
the television broadcast said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of security forces cordoned off Borella area soon
after the explosions.
</P>
<P>
Two more suicide bomb kits were discovered in the vicinity and
later defused by the military.
</P>
<P>
A massive dragnet has been launched to capture LTTE rebels
after the explosions.
</P>
<P>
Following the blasts, a shoot-out between government soldiers
and suspected LTTE rebels continued for some time, informed
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Three out of the eight LTTE rebels were killed in the shoot-out
while the others reportedly escaped, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting a 17-year-old war to carve out a
separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east since 1983,have been blamed for several bomb explosions and
suicide bombings in Colombo and other cities over the years.
</P>
<P>
The government and the main opposition United National Party (
UNP)are currently discussing constitutional reform proposals to
end the long-running ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
Norway is playing the role of a facilitator in a bid to bring
the government and the LTTE rebels to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The bomb explosions came as people worried about the influence
of fall of the Norwegian government on Sri Lanka's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek visited Sri Lanka
last month to undertake the "challenging task" of bringing the
LTTE and the government to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
However, Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik Thursday
announced his government's collapse after losing a confidence vote
in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said the talks between the government
and the LTTE rebels could be delayed by at least several months
because of Norwegian government's change and LTTE's repeated bomb
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Finds Offshore Oil in Decades of Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10, (Xinhua) -- Ghana has discovered an offshore
oil field at its west coast in its decades exploration, which
confirmed the oil potential in the oil thirsty western African
country.
</P>
<P>
Dana Petroleum Plc, a British company, and the state-owned
Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) announced on Friday
that they have discovered offshore oil in the Western Tano
Contract Area, about 32 kilometres off the coast, with an output
of 1,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
According to Ghana News Agency report reaching here, John
Craven, Exploration Manager of Dana, told a press conference in
Accra that the oil well won't be operational until a comprehensive
evaluation is done.
</P>
<P>
The drilling of the well, christened WT-IX, began last December
and reached a total measured depth of 10,414 feet (about 3470
meters) and subsequent testing proved that hydrocarbons were
present.
</P>
<P>
Tom Cross, Dana's Chief Executive, said the discovery confirms
the belief that there is considerable potential in the Western
Tano area.
</P>
<P>
Dana holds 90 percent ownership while GNPC has 10 percent in
oil well but can increase to 25 percent after commercial
development.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is now spending about 30 percent of its hard-earned hard
currency to import oil every year, with Nigeria being its
principal supplier.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Hit Southern Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains fell in southern
Mozambique on Friday for the second day, affecting relief
operations for the southern African country's worst flood in the
past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Disasters Management Institute
(INGC), relief flights from Maputo to the towns of Chibuto and
Xai-Xai in Gaza province were unable to land because of poor
visibility since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The INGC does not believe there is any risk of renewed flooding
in the southern provinces following last month's unprecedented
flooding.
</P>
<P>
But the INGC describes the situation in the center of the
country as " worrying" because of the heavy rains in Malawi and
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Rains in Malawi could swell the Shire river, which feeds in to
the Zambezi, thus posing a threat to the lower Zambezi valley.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mozambican Television reported on Thursday night
that around 20,000 people were stranded at Combumune on the upper
reaches of the Limpopo in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The relief effort in Gaza has so far concentrated on the middle
and lower Limpopo Valley. The more sparsely populated districts
further north have been isolated and out of communication.
</P>
<P>
The people at Combumune are said to have been isolated for the
past 25 days, and only now are efforts under way to provide them
with relief supplies.

<HEADLINE> OAU Donates $200,000 to Madagasca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) on Friday donated 200,000 U.S. dollars to help
Madagascar flood victims.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim said in a statement
that he expected the modest contribution to assist the ongoing
relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
The recent cyclone Gloria and the cholera epidemic have claimed
many lives in Madagasca, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim urged all the OAU member states and the donor community
to provide all the necessary assistance to contain the effects of
this natural disaster and the cholera epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Madagasca is the third African country that has received OAU
donations within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
At the end of February and early this month, Mozambique and
Zimbabwe were respectively offered half million and 100,000
dollars as relief fund after they suffered from the devastating
floods and cyclones.

<P>
BEIRUT, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The 113 Arab Foreign Ministers'
Conference concluded here on Saturday, voicing support to Lebanon
and calling for suspension of normalizing ties with Israel which
have been launching attacks against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The final resolutions of the conference, which were read by Arab
League Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid, urged countries
involved in multilateral negotiations to reconsider their
participation until bilateral peace talks achieve substantial
results.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions also denounce Israel for its continued
occupation of southern Lebanon and aggressions on Lebanese
territory.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the conference, Abdel-Meguid and all
member states spoke with nearly the same words, showing Arab
solidarity and their support to Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinians
to take back all occupied lands by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid expressed the bloc's support to Lebanese resistance
aimed at recovering south Lebanon, which has been controlled by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Israel carved out an area of 850 square kilometers as
a "security zone" in south Lebanon to protect settlements along its
northern borders from attacks by anti-Israel groups in the Arab
country.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese guerrilla groups, mainly the Syrian and
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, have been fighting to oust Israeli
soldiers out of the occupied zone, which comprises 10 percent of
the Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid also urged Arab countries' political and financial
support to Lebanon that suffered several large-scale aggressions by
Israel in decades.
</P>
<P>
The latest one took place on February 8 when Israel destroyed
three Lebanese power relay stations and wounded 30 civilians in its
air raids as retaliation to Hezbollah's attacks.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has offered 100 million U.S. dollars in soft loans
and a donation of 30 million dollars to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Kuwait signed an agreement with Lebanon to grant 8.5
million dollars to Lebanon for its rehabilitation of three power
relay stations.
</P>
<P>
In the session, Arab countries unanimously agreed on the
simultaneity of Lebanese and Syrian tracks in the peace
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers also expressed support to Palestine's
declaration of an independent state within this year with east
Jerusalem as its capital, with or without a peace agreement with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Arab world is endeavoring to
reconstruct the Arab solidarity which vanished after the Gulf War
in 1991 when Iraq invaded its Arab neighbor Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The 113th Arab Foreign Ministers' Conference is the first which
has been held in Lebanon since 1975 when the civil war erupted in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League decided to shift the venue of the conference
from Cairo to Beirut to show Arab solidarity with and the bloc's
support to Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> NATO Naval Exercise in Aegean One After Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The NATO annual naval exercise in
the Aegean Sea off Turkey's southwest coast, which started earlier
this month, ended on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The manoeuver was code-named "Disciplined Warrior 2000", said a
written statement issued by the Press and Public Relations Office
of the NATO Southeast European Cooperative Commandership.
</P>
<P>
The wargame was joined by forces from the NATO Command, Control
and Consultation Authority, the Special Manoeuvers Department of
the European Strategical Commandership, the Cooperative Interior
Region Commandership Headquarters and the Rapid Reaction Army Corps
of the European Allied Commandership.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, which jointed NATO last year, provided reinforcements
for the manoeuver.
</P>
<P>
Another NATO naval exercise, code-named "East-Mediterranean
2000", is to follow in the Aegean Sea from April 12 to 22.
</P>
<P>
An announcement from the Office of the Turkish Chief of General
Staff said that all the NATO countries, commands and headquarters
have been invited to participate in the April exercise to be hosted
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In reference to press reports that Greece, a NATO member, had
decided to withdraw from the exercise, the statement said that as
Greece has made no official application to participate, so there
could be no talk of its pullout.
</P>
<P>
The media had earlier claimed that Greece intended to send one
frigate but then withdraw their offer on the pretext that the
proposed exercise area covered part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Cyprus issue, there also exist territorial disputes
between Turkey and Greece over some islands in the Aegean Sea.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Calls for Resumption of Vote-Recounting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani on Saturday called for the resumption of vote recounting
for the February parliamentary polling to remove all ambiguities.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Secretary of the conservative Guardian Council
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, Rafsanjani said that suspending vote-
recounting in Tehran has led to many rumors, innuendo and
speculation.
</P>
<P>
To preserve the right of the candidates and prevent the loss of
public trust, the people have to be informed of the latest
developments regarding the recounting process, the Islamic Republic
News Agency quoted the letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reformists, main supporters of the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, won a landslide victory in the polling held on
February 18, dealing a severe blow at the powerful conservatives,
who dominate most of the sensitive state organs of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian Council, the top elections watchdog in the country,
on March 1 confirmed certain riggings in vote-counting in Tehran
constituency and ordered to recount 1,000 ballot boxes, one third
of the total in the constituency to ascertain accuracy of the
polling result.
</P>
<P>
However, the vote-recounting was suspended on Wednesday after no
significant changes were found in 527 boxes recounted and the
supervisory boards assigned by the Guardians Council announced no
need to continue vote recounting.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, currently chairman of the advisory State Expediency
Council, narrowly entered the Iranian legislative body with his
name at the bottom of the list of 30 candidates elected in the
Tehran constituency.
</P>
<P>
However, Ali Akbar Rahmani, who ranked 31st in the Tehran
constituency, doubted the accuracy of the vote counting and claimed
that his seat might have been unjustly taken by Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who was the Majlis speaker from 1980 to 1989 and the
president from 1989 to 1997, posed as a centrist in the elections,
but he is widely believed to be close to the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Interior Minister Ali Mohaqar also called for
resumption of vote recounting, saying if all the 1,000 ballot boxes
were recounted, there would be some changes at the bottom of the
list of the 30 winners.
</P>
<P>
Even if this leads to Rafsanjani's absence from the Majlis,
definitely the effect of the transparency would be better for both
history of the Islamic revolution and the personality of Rafsanjani
rather than shrouding the election in a cloud of ambiguity, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges World Cooperation in Fighting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President Vladimir
Putin on Saturday called on the world community to combine their
efforts in fighting international terrorism and extremism.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in St. Petersburg following his meeting
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Putin said Russia would
absorb Britain's experience "on the political and professional
level."
</P>
<P>
Blair, who arrived in the second largest city of Russia to
attend the premiere of an opera entitled "War and Peace" at the
Mariinsky Theater, said London understands Russia's difficulties
in countering rampant terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, the approach should be proportionate to the situation
and international norms and human rights must be observed in the
North Caucasus, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Putin said Blair had expressed concern over humanitarian
problems and human rights in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian leadership and I personally must understand what
triggered this position. I must admit that Russia is making
adjustments after such meetings. Russia is paying particular
attention to the opinion of its foreign partners, especially such
esteemed politicians as Tony Blair," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, for his part, said the dialogue with Russia on the North
Caucasus problem should be continued and that any accusation of
human rights violations must be carefully studied.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, Putin said that by improving and expanding
relations with Britain, Russia is giving an impetus to its ties
with Europe and Northern America.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's position is unique. It is a Eurasian country but it
is more of a European state in its culture," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He described Britain as "a natural partner," noting that
bilateral ties have not expanded as actively as they could have in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have "an enormous potential in the economic
sphere. British businesses have significant potential for
investing in the Russian economy," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Blair promised to recommend British businessmen's
active participation in the development of the Russian economy and
not only in the oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
British investment in Russia totals 3.5 billion U.S. dollars,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Prikhodko, deputy chief of staff of the Kremlin, said
the talks between Putin and Blair have demonstrated the two
leaders' mutual desire to revitalize the dialogue between their
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue between Putin and Blair "is proceeding in a very
business-like atmosphere," he said. "This is a very energetic and
open conversation between two very energetic and open leaders."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the situation in the Balkans and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Putin urged the international community to maintain its
relations with Yugoslavia in keeping with U.N. Security Council
resolution 1244.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to reaffirm once again Yugoslavia's
territorial integrity," Putin said.

<HEADLINE> Peres Urges Syria to Rein in Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel will hit back harder at
Lebanon it the guerrilla group Hezbollah launches attacks against
the civilian targets in northern Israel after its troop withdrawal
from south Lebanon, said a senior Israeli official Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres made the remarks over
a report in which Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh said Friday
Syria will not guarantee Israel's northern security after it
withdraws its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"If the settlements and other civilian targets in northern
Israel were hit by the Lebanese Hezbollah after Israeli pullout
from south lebanon, Israel will take tough measures against Lebanon
and Syria's interests in that country," Peres told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is the major power broker and has large economic
and military interests in Lebanon, is the country which can rein in
the military activities of Hezbollah against Israel, Peres said.
</P>
<P>
So, if Hezbollah attacks northern Israel after the pullout,
Israel will take military actions not only against the Hezbollah,
but also against other Lebanese targets and Syria's interests
there, he warned.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet voted unanimously last Monday to withdraw
the troops from south Lebanon by July with or without a peace
agreement Syria. But the cabinet prefers to act to ensure that the
withdrawal will be carried out within the framework of an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy has warned that if Hezbollah
attacks northern Israel, the Lebanese soil "will burn."
</P>
<P>
As arranged by the United States, Lebanon will join in the later
stage of the peace talks between Israel and syria to discuss
Israel's troop withdrawal from the security zone, which Israel set
up in 1985 with a self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its
northern security.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting against Israeli
occupation of south Lebanon along with other military groups since
then.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed peace talks in the United States on
December 15, 1999, but the talks have been stalled since January.
</P>
<P>
Syria wanted the two sides to discuss the issue of borders
before addressing other issues in the talks, while Israel wanted to
discuss water, security arrangement and normalization of ties.
</P>
<P>
Syria also requested Israel to write down its commitment to
returning the entire Golan Heights to Syria as a condition for the
resumption of further peace talks, but Israel rejected the request.
</P>
<P>
Barak, at a cabinet meeting on February 27, did not spell out
his readiness to withdraw to the June 4, 1967 lines, but maintained
that four of his predecessors had agreed to such a withdrawal and
said he does not want to "throw away the past."
</P>
<P>
Syria has expressed its welcome to Barak's remarks, saying it
could pave the way for both sides to return to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights during the 1967 Middle East
War.

CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen protesters were arrested

<HEADLINE> Iranian Workers Block Highway for Arrears of Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Over 270 workers on Saturday set up
barricades on a highway and hampered traffic in Karaj, west of
Iranian capital city of Tehran, to protest against a delay in their
salaries over the past 20 months.
</P>
<P>
The workers of a furniture company Mobliran staged the protest
rally after the company's board of directors failed to fulfill
their promises made last week to pay the arrears.
</P>
<P>
The angry workers have been blocking the road since 0830 hours
local time (0500 GMT) Saturday morning and two out of the road's
three lanes are blocked by iron barricades, forcing highway police
to direct cars to other nearby roads, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The protesting workers said that they have not been paid for the
past 20 months, which has caused many problems for them and their
families.
</P>
<P>
In a similar move last week, the workers blocked the road after
electricity was cut off at their factory due to its heavy debts to
a power company. About 300 workers of the Mobliran company also
staged a protest gathering in front of the Labor Ministry last
month, calling on officials to meet their demand.
</P>
<P>
The Mobliran company was ceded to the private sector in 1992 and
the present 270 workers of the company are only a small portion of
the larger staff, who had been either been fired or paid some
compensation before being dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says 8 Injured in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes
attacked civilian installations in southern Iraq on Saturday,
injuring eight people, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the spokesman said that at the local time of 14:
15 (1115 GMT), the U.S. and British warplanes, in 17 formations,
made 28 armed sorties from Saudi Arabia and 12 from Kuwait, flying
over the Iraqi southern provinces of Basra, Thi-Qar, Muthana,
Qadissiyah, Najaf and Misan.
</P>
<P>
The enemy warplanes bombed civilian installations and wounded
eight people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that earlier in the day, eight formations of
U.S. and British jets made 16 armed sorties from the Turkish
airspace, flying over the three northern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's air-defense artillery confronted with the enemy planes
and forced them to flee back to their bases in Turkey, Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched the four-night air strikes
against Iraq in December 1998, their warplanes have made a total of
19,469 armed sorties over the two no-fly zones in southern and
northern Iraq, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has never recognized the no-fly zones.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Easily Win Utah, Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Governor George W. Bush easily won their respective
Democratic and Republican primaries Friday in Colorado and Utah
after they sealed their parties' nomination in the Super Tuesday
contests on March 7.
</P>
<P>
In Colorado, Bush had 65 percent of the vote, and Arizona
Senator McCain 27 percent. Bush was leading for 28 delegates, and
McCain for 12.
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, Gore won 71 percent of the Democratic
vote to 23 percent for Bradley. Gore led for 44 Democratic
delegates to 7 for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
In Utah State, Bush polled 63 percent, taking all 29 Republican
delegates, and McCain 15 percent. For the Democrats, Gore had 81
percent of the vote to Bradley's 19 percent. Gore won 21 delegates
to Bradley's three.
</P>
<P>
Although McCain and Bradley have dropped out of the race, they
remain on the ballots.
</P>
<P>
Wyoming Republicans also held county caucuses throughout the
state Friday. These county conventions did not bind the 22
delegates, but Bush won 19 of them, McCain two and another
contender Allen Keyes one.
</P>
<P>
After Friday's primaries, Bush had 701 of the 1,034 delegates
needed to win the nomination. Gore had 1,587 of the 2,170 needed
for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
Friday's primaries push Bush and Gore closer to majorities
needed for their parties' presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
Both men won overwhelmingly in the decisive 16 contests of the
Super Tuesday. Gore swept, and Bush won all but four Republican
contests, almost locking up their nominations.
</P>
<P>
After the Super Tuesday blowout and the near-guarantee of a
Bush-Gore match up in November, many Western states' voters
considered Friday's contests anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
"It's like shouting after the game is over," said a voter in
Utah.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHEFFIELD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Evgenia
Radanova of Bulgaria further proved her strength on ice rink at
the world short track speed skating championships, winning the
women's 500m event Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Radanova, who set the world mark of 43.873 seconds in Lake
Placid, the United States, at the Goodwill Games last month, won
here at 44.626 seconds.
</P>
<P>
China's Yang Yang (S) was second at 44.704 and An Sang-mi of
South Korea finished third at 46.523.
</P>
<P>
Women's 1,000m winner Yang Yang (A) and her Chinese teammate
Wang Chunlu failed to make the finals in the race, which might end
Yang Yang (A)'s bid for a successive fourth all-around title at
the world championships.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's event, Eric Bedard of Canada sprinted to the
first at 42.009 seconds. He was followed by American Daniel
Weinstein and Japanese Satoru Terao, at 42.068 and 42.157
respectively.
</P>
<P>
For South Korean men's skater Kim Dong-Sung, it was a tragic
afternoon when he crashed with Chinese rival Li Jiajun in the semi-
finals.
</P>
<P>
With two laps to go in the 500m, Kim Dong-Sung forced his way
at a curve from inside to overtake Li Jiajun. Both skaters were
banged to the board and Li's blade cut Kim's right arm.
</P>
<P>
Li was disqualified for impeding, but television replay showed
Kim fell by himself.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team made an appeal but the decision could not be
altered.
</P>
<P>
The injury will force Kim to pull out of remaining races
including the men's 5000 relay.

accepted principles to guide the necessary humanitarian action.
</P>
<P>
The Council debate, which opened Thursday, came as the first
anniversary of the NATO air strike on Yugoslavia is drawing near.
The U.S.-led NATO, beginning March 24 last year, launched military
action against Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent member,
without the authorization of the Security Council. The use of
force, under the pretext to end the alleged humanitarian crisis,
has severely violated the U.N. Charter and international law, and
indeed created serious humanitarian crises for Serbs and non-
Albanian residents in Kosovo, a Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yingfan, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, told the 15-nation Security Council that "relevant
humanitarian organizations, either governmental, international or
non-governmental organizations, need to fully respect the views of
the recipient countries, adopt a just, equitable and unbiased
position toward all recipient countries or parties so that the
humanitarian work cannot be politicized."
</P>
<P>
"All parties concerned should be conscious that they are
carrying out humanitarian activities in a sovereign state and
therefore they should give full respect to the laws as well as
customs of the country concerned," he said. "When it comes to the
internal affairs of the country, they should not point fingers in
spite of the humanitarian assistance they have provided. Nor
should they interfere in the internal affair of a sovereign state
in the name of humanitarian assistance."
</P>
<P>
"More important, humanitarian responses should not be employed
as a pretext under which to use force against a sovereign state,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador's statement was echoed by Sergey Lavrov,
the Russian permanent representative to the United Nations, who
said that the intervention to stop humanitarian crises was
unacceptable unless the Council authorized it.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the Security Council has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security in the
world at large. In other words, any military action against a
sovereign state should get the approval of the Council.
</P>
<P>
"Humanitarian assistance should not be used as an instrument
for exerting political influence," he said. "It must be used in
accordance with the principles of neutrality and neither violate
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of host states, nor
interfere with political process."
</P>
<P>
"Experience showed that the settlement of humanitarian crises
affected regional stability, but humanitarian law could not be
enforced in actions that contradicted international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Said Ben Mustapha, representative of Tunisia, said that
humanitarian activities were necessary in armed conflicts, but
humanitarian assistance must comply strictly with the principles
of state sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, when providing humanitarian assistance, the
consent of the parties concerned, including governments, must also
be secured," he said. "That was important because it would ensure
greater success for the delivery of services to victims and the
safety of persons delivering those services."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shamshad Ahmad, representative of Pakistan, agreed
that humanitarian action must be studied within certain parameters.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects of State sovereignty and non-interference in
the internal affairs of States must be respected," he said. "Also
for humanitarian action to find general acceptance, it must have
legitimacy under international law, conform to the (U.N.) Charter
and be undertaken only with the Council authority."
</P>
<P>
 "Distinction must be maintained between humanitarian crises
as a result of wars and disputes, which constituted threats to
international peace and security, and other human rights issues,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
 "International humanitarian action as a preventive measure is
credible only if applied without discrimination," he said. "The
Council had not always acted on the basis of objective
requirements."
</P>
<P>
 Gelson Fonseca, representative of Brazil, also took the floor
at the Council debate, saying that interrelation of humanitarian
affairs and security issues should not entail the automatic
involvement of the Council.
</P>
<P>
 "The Council must take action only on issues that posed real
threats to international peace and security," he said. "If the
Council is to preserve credibility while dealing with humanitarian
issues, it must avoid selectivity. The focus of its attention must
not be determined by the level of media exposure, but by the real
humanitarian and security situation on the ground."
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who opened the debate,
said, "The experiences of the past decade, from Africa to the
Balkans to Asia, have taught us that our humanitarian mission
holds both greater promise and greater peril than almost any other
part of the U.N.'s work."
</P>
<P>
 He stressed that efforts must be made to "ensure that the
legal and principled basis of humanitarian action is respected and
strengthened."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Punish Companies Assisting Angolan Rebels: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- South African companies
involved in supplying Angolan rebels with cash and arms would face
the full extent of the law, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Ronnie
Mamoepa on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa was reacting to the partial release of a United Nations
report which named several African countries violating sanctions
by financing and arming Angola's anti-government rebels, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has obeyed sanctions imposed by the United Nations
against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), Mamoepa said, adding that the South African government
would wait for the official release of the report on Wednesday
before making a more comprehensive statement.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma
would address the matter in her budget speech scheduled for
Wednesday, Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed an arms and fuel embargo on
Angola's UNITA in 1993, followed later by a ban on the rebel
group's diamond exports.
</P>
<P>
The violations described in the report included providing fuel
and arms to UNITA, allowing UNITA planes carrying banned items to
refuel in their countries, and dealing in banned UNITA diamonds.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki on Saturday launched the Bray Housing Development in
the North-West Province, pledging to build more houses for the
people.
</P>
<P>
The project would ensure that in spite of limited resources,
the housing needs of the Bray community, especially the poor,
would be met, said Mbeki, quoted by South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
 "It is of importance that every household will also be able
to have individual access to water and electricity supply," said
Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
 The scheme, like the housing project, was a co-operative
project between the community, business and government, through
which people were becoming involved in farming.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, rural areas must have developed sustainable economic
and social development, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the government has funded a large
number of housing projects that has provided houses for more than
one million people with lower income.

<HEADLINE> International Tourism Fair Opens in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Tourism
Exchange Fair (ITB) opened in Berlin Saturday with German
Economics Minister Werner Mueller appealing to tour operators to
include more environmentally friendly vacations in their
catalogues.
</P>
<P>
Mueller said at the opening ceremony of the ITB that people
must pay more attention to protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
Some 8,808 exhibitors and 92 additionally represented firms
and organizations from 177 countries around the world are expected
to take part in the fair, the biggest one in the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
Tourism got a rapid growth worldwide and the income of tourism
reached 455 billion U.S. dollars last year, an increase of 3.2
percent in comparison with 1998. The number of tourist arrivals
registered worldwide rose more than 3 percent to 657 million.
</P>
<P>
About three quarters of the exhibitors at the ITB -- 6,382 in
all -- come from abroad. The fair will end on March 15.
</P>
<P>
The ITB comes at a time when Berlin is enjoying a tourism boom.
The city received 4.17 million visitors last year, 16.3 percent
more than the year before. Overnight stays increased by a million
to 9.3 million.
</P>
<P>
Some 60,000 visitors will take part in the ITB. "The tourism
sector is becoming increasingly aware of the enormous potential of
the senior citizen market," said Jochen Martin, managing director
of the Berlin Exhibition Center.

<HEADLINE> Chad Asks France to Re-Call Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chad asked France on Saturday to
recall immediately its ambassador in N'Djamena, Chad's capital,
after a series of disputes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted French diplomats in the Chad
capital as saying that the Chad Foreign Ministry has asked for "an
immediate recall" of French ambassador Alain du Boispeau.
</P>
<P>
No motive was given by Chad, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and Chad became cold after the Elf-
Aquitaine oil group decided to pull out of an exploration project
in Chad last November.
</P>
<P>
Chad has also protested a map of Chad, published by the French
embassy, in which the border line between Chad and Libya in the
northern desert strip of Aouzou -- claimed by both countries --
was drawn with a dotted line, indicating France's neutrality in
the territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chad suspects that France is sympathetic with the
country's rebellion, the Movement for Democracy and Justice, based
on the desert of Tibesti, which rose up against the government of
President Idriss Deby in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
France supported Chad during its war with Libya in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Berlin's "Museum Island" Added to UNESCO heritage list </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The famous "Museum Island" in
Berlin was formally recognized by United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a world cultural
heritage site on Friday, the German news media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The island, which belongs to the Prussian Foundation of
Cultural Possessions, received the award for its unique and
authentic cultural monuments.
</P>
<P>
The island consists of five interlocking temples: the Alte
Museum, the Bode Museum, the National Gallery, the Neue Museum and
the Pergamon-Museum, with its altar of the same name. It attracts
many visitors from all over the world each year, with 630,000
visitors last year.
</P>
<P>
Some of the museum treasures were stored at scattered
locations across Europe for safety during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Even before World War II, the Spree Island complex,
incorporating the Pergamon Museum and its historic 150 BC Altar
and Pilgrims Trail, as well as the old National Gallery in the "
Mitte" borough, was regarded as one of the most impressive museum
complexes in the world.
</P>
<P>
American and British warplanes nearly destroyed "Museum
Island" during World War II. No one believed it would ever
recover.
</P>
<P>
Germany spent two billion marks (one billion U.S. dollars) on
renovation of the complex with British architect David Copperfield
as the mastermind, but a lot of work still needs to be done,
according to officials in Berlin.

"NATO's enlargement to the east envisages moving the bloc's
military component close to Russia's borders and poses a potential
threat to our country," Manilov said.

<P>
He said Russia would "act toward this threat with means and
methods that are inherent in our national policy and possibilities,
" the Itar-Tass news agency reported.

"These measures may be asymmetrical, but in any case they will
be effective," Manilov said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa beat the
visiting Ghana 1-0 thanks to a simple second-half goal by Stanton
Fredericks in a tense Olympic Games Group B qualifier in Boksburg
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Victory took South Africa to the top of the standings with 10
points, one more than Cameroon, who are likely to regain first
place Sunday after a home match against lowly Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, bronze medalists in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, cannot
qualify but could decide who does as they host Cameroon in the
final round on March 26 while South Africa play Guinea away.
</P>
<P>
The only goal came after 69 minutes when Jabu Pule dispossessed
sluggish George Blay and Lebogang Kukane headed his cross into the
path of midfielder Fredericks, who made no mistake with a five-
meter shot.

<HEADLINE> hke031130 --Singapore Resolved to Press for Restructuring in Electricity Industry: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government is
resolved to press on with restructuring in the electricity
industry, to step up further deregulation in power generation and
to tighten monopoly in the grid sector, a minister told the
parliament Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Mistier George Yeo outlined some substantial
changes to be implemented in the restructuring of the electricity
industry while making a speech in the parliament which is sitting
for ten days from Tuesday for debate on the 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
The government will press on with further deregulation and
obtain the full benefits of competition through structural reforms,
Yeo said.
</P>
<P>
This requires a clear separation at the ownership level of the
contestable and non-contestable parts of the market, he added,
noting the grid is a natural monopoly and should not be owned by
the same company that owns generation companies or retail
companies.
</P>
<P>
Under this guideline, Yeo said, the Singapore Power would
divest its ownership of its ownership of its generation companies
and retail business both by April 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the generation and retail sectors, Yeo underlined, the
grid will be therefore tightly regulated as the transmission and
distribution network is a natural monopoly and it is "neither
practical nor cost effective to have competing grid companies
duplicating power lines on our small island."
</P>
<P>
On structural reform in Gas industry, Yeo said the gas industry
will be restructured in a similar way by separating the ownership
of the gas transportation business, which is a natural monopoly,
from the contestable sectors of gas import, trading and retailing.
</P>
<P>
Singapore now has four generation companies with three of them
owned by the Singapore Power and the other set by Temasek Holdings
as a wholly owned subsidiary.

<HEADLINE> 28 Killed in Colombo's Blasts, Shoot-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 28 people, including
eight Tamil Tiger rebels' suicide bombers, were killed in the Sri
Lankan capital of Colombo during the last twenty-four hours, the
Defense Ministry said Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that six police constables
were killed and six others wounded in the operation which started
Friday evening near the Castle Street- Kotte Road roundabout at
Borella, the commercial center of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Those suicide bombers of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
hiding in a bush near the roundabout "had given up their original
plan" and withdrew after their hideout being brought to light,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the suicide bombers may have been trying to
target Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte who was due to
pass by the roundabout after a debate on a state of emergency in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ratwatte, who is in charge of Sri Lanka's war effort against
the rebels, is widely seen to be high on the LTTE's hit list.
</P>
<P>
The ministry statement said one of the LTTE suicide cadres
exploded himself while withdrawing, injuring a large number of
civilians and damaging a lot of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The advancing troops of Quick Reaction Teams managed to kill
two suicide bombers who along with five other suicide bombers had
fired on to the vehicles and civilians who were returning home
after work.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "14 civilians were killed and 74 civilians
were wounded due to the terrorist fire."
</P>
<P>
Troops pursuing the remaining LTTE rebels cordoned the "C"
block of the Serpentine flats at Vanathamulla in eastern Colombo
where the rebels had hidden after staging bombings and a shooting
spree.
</P>
<P>
The commandos launched a dawn attack on Saturday, killing one
LTTE rebel, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that the four other suicide bombers committed suicide
by exploding themselves in the flats.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting a 17-year-old war to carve out a
separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east, have been blamed for several bomb explosions and suicide
bombings in Colombo and other cities over the years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry said Saturday in another
statement that government troops had killed 18 LTTE rebels in
fresh conflicts in the north and east of Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> India Disagrees with Clinton's Perception of Subcontinent </HEADLINE>

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- India Saturday expressed its
disagreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton's description of the
South Asian subcontinent and the Line of Control in Kashmir as "
the most dangerous" place in the world.
</P>
<P>
"What President Clinton had said was in a different context,"
Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said here on
Saturday. "In any case, it is a perception that he has. We have a
different perception."
</P>
<P>
Clinton reportedly said in Washington on Thursday that the most
dangerous place in the world today, in his personal view, was the
South Asian subcontinent and the Line of Control in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Singh also ruled out any possible U.S. role in bringing India
and Pakistan on the negotiating table, saying that it was
important for India to "get itself out of the Pakistani prism."

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

Vice President Gore and creates a new campaign issue only days

scrambled to put together a case against him under a U.S. anti-

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- An embargo ordered by the United Nations two years ago to
stop Angolan rebels from using diamonds to pay for their war has
been undermined by several African nations and the "extremely lax

, who traveled to Beijing for the show.
</P>
<P>
"The debut of Cartier jewelry in Beijing marks an important
milestone in Cartier's development in the region, demonstrating
our determination to expand operations further into Asia's Premier
Market in China," said Nebot, adding that the increasing demand in
China for luxury items prompted Cartier's appearance here.
</P>
<P>
Cartier currently has 36 boutiques in the Asia-Pacific region,
and nine outlets for products other than jewelry in Chinese cities
including Beijing, Shanghai and Ningbo in the east, Guangzhou and
Shenzhen which are close to Hong Kong, Zhuhai next to Macao,
Kunming and Chengdu in the southwest, and Dalian in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to explore the potential Chinese market, Cartier
is working on opening its first China branch next year in Shanghai,
once known to foreigners as the "Paris of the Far East."

Cumhur Ursumer has signed a document enrolling Turkey in the
Interstate Oil and Gas Transportation Program (INOGATE) umbrella
agreement, reported Turkish Daily News on Saturday.

</P>
<P>
The INOGATE agreement has been signed by 16 countries from
Central and Eastern Europe to date, including the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The arrivals in all categories of travellers to
Cyprus in January reached 107,622, 10.7 percent up against the same
month last year, local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists rose from 57,740 in January 1999 to 63,
553 in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
There were 1,069 long-term immigrants arriving on the island in
January, and 1,790 short-term immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The top five tourist sources for Cyprus were Britain, Germany,
Greece, Russia and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Kaderoglu Aydinlatma Group is set to establish a "
Turkish Bazaar" in Kuwait's free trade zone, reported Turkish Daily
News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was learned from the Turkish Economic Development Agency that
the bazaar will begin operation in April on a 10,000-square-meter
slice of land.
</P>

A wide range of goods such as automobiles, textiles,

ANKARA -- Jordan has imposed a duty of 424 U.S. dollars per
metric ton on its cookie, water and cocoa imports from Turkey,
reported Turkish Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the largest market in the Middle East for Turkish
cookie exports, and the Karaman company's Jordanian cookie exports
alone are worth 10 million U.S. dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
Cookie producers said that the duty affects only Turkish imports
since cookies from the United States and European Union countries
are exempt.
</P>
<P>
Turkish producers said that this will destroy their exports'
share in the Jordanian market and in Iraq's as well.
</P>
<P>
Jordan imposed the duty on the ground that Turkish producers
tend to dump their exports in the country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi FM On Maintaining World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad Saturday said at the airport that United Nations
Security Council has the primary responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister returned from New York where he presided
over the formal meeting of the Security Council on March 9 on a
thematic debate titled "Maintaining Peace and Security:
Humanitarian Aspects of Issues Before the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Azad said the Security Council, which is charged with
addressing humanitarian issues relating to conflicts and
corresponding appropriate actions, often noticed that flagrant
violations of international laws give rise to conflict, and peace
becomes difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the council should adopt a broad and pro-
active approach for peace as part of its responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Azad said Bangladesh which assumed the Security Council
presidency on March 1 was making vigorous efforts in the world
body to contain conflicts and maintain peace globally.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh became a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council for the second time in last October for a two-year term (
2000-2001).

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Wants More Export Quota to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers
and Exporters Association (BGMEA) wants the government to seek a
raise of 30 percent export quota to the United States during the
Clinton-Hasina official talks on March 20, its president said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I expect that the U.S. president will certainly agree to the
Bangladeshi proposal in recognition of the fulfillment of
international calls for upholding labor rights by the country's
garment sector," BGMEA President Anisur Rahman Sinha said.
</P>
<P>
The association of about 3,000 manufacturers and exporters also
expects that the United States will allow merger of some 15 single
quota categories into combined categories with a view to extending
more benefit to the Bangladeshi exporters.
</P>
<P>
Sinha said the ready-made garment sector has successfully
fulfilled all international calls, including total elimination of
child labor, establishment of trade union and launching of a host
of welfare programs for workers.
</P>
<P>
The sector, widely regarded as the life-line of the country's
economy, fetches about 70 percent of the country's total export
earnings.

<HEADLINE> Official: NATO Expansion Threatens Russian Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian military official
said here Saturday that Moscow remains staunchly opposed to NATO
expansion and views it as a threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leadership "has not changed its position regarding
NATO's enlargement," said Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of
the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's enlargement to the east envisages moving the bloc's
military component close to Russia's borders and poses a potential
threat to our country," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia would "act toward this threat with means and
methods that are inherent in our national policy and possibilities,
" the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"These measures may be asymmetrical, but in any case they will
be effective," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Russia and NATO sank to a record low when the
transatlantic military alliance started a 78-day bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia on March 24 last year.
</P>
<P>
Their ties, which thawed somewhat with the recent visit to
Moscow by NATO Secretary General George Robertson, remain strained.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Call for Enacting Law on Border Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of deputies of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) from the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, which neighbors Russia and seven other nations
in central, south and east Asia, have proposed enacting a specific
law for the administration of border areas.
</P>
<P>
The deputies, who submitted a proposal on the issue to the
ongoing annual session of the Ninth NPC, are of the view that the
law should be drafted to cope with the complex situation in the
border areas in the wake of the development of a market economy in
China.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the law will be of great importance for China to
handle bilateral relations with neighboring countries and
safeguard state sovereignty, they held.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputies, local officials in charge of border
administration are currently working in strict compliance with the
relevant provisional regulations on the administration of national
boundary and border area formulated by the regional people's
congress of Xinjiang in April 1989.
</P>
<P>
A national law should be drafted to govern the issue in an
effort to cope with the requirements from the rapid growth of
socialist market economy and the increase of exchanges with other
countries, they proposed.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which boasts a border line of
more than 5,400 kilometers with Russia, Kazakstan, Kirghiztan,
Mongolia and four other countries, has opened up 15 land ports to
foreigners. Last year, Xinjiang's border trade amounted to a total
of 1.03 billion U.S. dollars, or 58 percent of its total import
and export value in the year.
</P>
<P>
China boasts a total of 20,000 km border line, around which
live more than 22 million people, mostly the people of ethnic
minorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), urged the
Chongqing Municipality in southwest China to make efficient use of
relocation funds and attach great importance to the resettlement
of residents in the reservoir area of the Three Gorges Project,
the biggest water control project in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Li made the call at a meeting attended by Ninth NPC deputies
from Chongqing. While acknowledging the progress Chongqing has
achieved since it became a centrally-administered municipality in
1997, Li said Chongqing still faces difficulties in the re-
employment of laid-off workers, poverty reduction, and the
resettlement of residents for the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Li called for a better use of relocation funds, saying "The
Party Central Committee has high hopes for resettlement work."
</P>
<P>
Urging local governments to seize the opportunity created by
the central government strategy of prioritizing the western areas
in economic development and the Three Gorges Project, Li said
economic restructuring needs to be furthered for better growth.
</P>
<P>
Large state-owned enterprises and military enterprises in
Chongqing need to step up technological innovation and further
adjust their product mix, he added.
</P>
<P>
The top legislator also stressed that urban residents should be
guaranteed basic living necessities and that highway construction
in ethnic minority regions should be stepped up.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Focuses on Desalination to Meet Water Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Trade
and Industry George Yeo indicated Saturday that desalination based
on new technologies will meet his country's water needs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament that is in a ten-day session for budget
debate, Yeo said that the government plans to build a 30-million-
gallon per day desalination plant by the year 2005 and the Public
Utility Board (PUB) has mounted on efforts to choose a technology
which can provide large quantity of fresh water with the lowest
prices.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Singapore could have three desalination
plants by 2011 with a combined capacity of producing 400,000 cubic
meters of fresh water a day.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the government has agreed to allow the
private sector to participate in the supply of desalinated water
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Yeo's statement came two days after Singapore Foreign Minister
S. Jayakumar told the parliament that the package negotiations on
outstanding bilateral issues between Singapore and Malaysia have
grounded to a halt and that Malaysia has not given any indication
that it is prepared to accommodate Singapore's requests on various
issues especially on the supply of raw water to Singapore after
the expiry of the water agreements.
</P>
<P>
Currently Singapore relies on Malaysia for its fresh water
supply to meet its various needs. Malaysia supplies 55.64 million
gallon of raw water daily to Singapore under two existing century-
long water supply agreements signed in 1961 and 1962 respectively.

<P>
Juma explained the commitment of the ruling Revolutionary Party
(Chama Cha Mapinduzi) in safeguarding the union while addressing a
public rally on Thursday during his two-day tour of Tanzania's
northern Kilimanjaro Region, newspapers here reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned citizens not to be swayed by some opposition
politicians trying to create hatred among Tanzanians on the union
issue.
</P>
<P>
There are some individuals who are encouraging people to
support the creation of a three-government system of the Union,
Zanzibar and Tanganyika contrary to the present two-government
system, which the people themselves preferred, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on opposition leaders to stop issuing threats during
the coming election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania after a revolt in 1964 that ousted the sultan
and Omani Arabs who ruled the island.
</P>
<P>
It is a semi-autonomous state with its own government and
parliament.

ADDIS ABABA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Saturday began

Borena and Bale regions for weeks with the assistance of South

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Loses 26 Million U.S. Dollars in Sugar Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government is
losing about 21 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 26 million U.S.
dollars) a year in tax revenue from local illegal sugar importers,
the African newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
These illegal traders evade import duties and value added tax by
routing their imports via the Zanzibar port which does not charge
suspended duty on a broad range of imports including sugar, the
report quoted Executive Secretary of Tanzania Sugar Producers'
Association Reuben Naburi as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Tanzania's annual sugar production
capacity is 120,000 tons, while the demand stood at 300,000 tons.
Traders are allowed to bring in 180,000 tons to fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
However, Naburi said some importers use the opportunity to
evade tax and flood the market with cheap sugar.
</P>
<P>
If such unchecked trend continues, all sugar factories in
Tanzania will have to be closed down, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government started to impose a suspended duty of
30 percent on all sugar imports in 1998, ostensibly to protect
local industries.
</P>
<P>
But sugar importers began channeling consignments through
Zanzibar, then transport them to mainland Tanzania through
unofficial entry points on the country's porous 1,000 kilometer
coastline.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial on Conclusion of CPPCC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, publishes an editorial Sunday, calling the
Third Session of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) a meeting
featuring democracy, truth-seeking, unity and confidence boosting.
</P>
<P>
The session upheld the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and
implemented the spirit of the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China and the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15
th CPC Central Committee as well as principles expounded by Jiang
Zemin in a speech he made marking the 50th founding anniversary of
the CPPCC, according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Adhering to the two top themes of unity and democracy, the
CPPCC session performed its functions of political consultation,
democratic supervision and participation in the running of state
affairs, with focus placed on matters of vital importance to the
state and economic work, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the CPPCC National Committee members
examined a report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National
Committee and other import work reports of the top advisory body,
and discussed the government work report delivered by Premier Zhu
Rongji at the current session of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the CPPCC National Committee members, with a
high sense of political responsibility, held discussions and put
forward lots of constructive opinions and proposals on major
issues including the rule of law; rejuvenating the nation through
science, technology and education; sustainable development;
developing the western region in a big way; state enterprise
reform, the poverty-eradication campaign, social security,
democratic supervision, the anti-corruption drive, and the
maintenance of social stability.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee members showed their great concern
on the Taiwan issue, urging the Taiwan authorities to obey the
will of the people and the law of history, by returning to the
principle of "one China", the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily speaks highly of CPPCC National Committee
members for their stronger sense of, and their greater ability to
participate in, the running of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
In the new historic period and under new historic conditions
featuring fundamental changes in the relations of different
classes and major social contradictions, the united front is still
an important part of the general line and policy of the CPC and a
magic weapon for overcoming difficulties and achieving victories,
the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC, as the most extensive patriotic united front
organization, shoulders a glorious historic mission in realizing
socialist modernization, safeguarding unity of the motherland, and
promoting a grand solidarity among people of different ethnic
groups, the editorial says.

<HEADLINE> Hoss Urges Arab Unity at Arab FMs Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
Saturday called for Arab spiritual and material support for Lebanon
as well as Arab solidarity in confrontation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hoss made the appeal at the 113th Arab League Foreign Ministers'
Conference that opened here Saturday, with the participation of all
22 members of the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Hoss stressed that Israel must address Syrian demand for the
return of the occupied Golan Heights and solve the Palestinian
refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
The Golan is at the heart of Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations
that ran into impasse again in January due to Israel's objection to
a Syrian demand to commit itself to hand back the strategic
plateau, captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
There have been 367,000 registered Palestinian refugees who fled
their their homes since the establishment of Israel in 1948 living
in Lebanon. And Beirut has been opposing to settle them within
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But so far Israel has objected to the return of the over 3
million Palestinian refugees scattered in Arab states to their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf, chairman of the
112th foreign ministers meeting, chaired opening session of the
two-day convention.
</P>
<P>
He also transferred the chairmanship of the current session to
his Omani counterpart Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting that was due in Cairo was decided moved
to Beirut shortly after Israeli air campaign against Lebanon on
Feburary 8, in which three Lebanese power plants were destroyed and
22 civilians injured, in a strong show of Arab solidarity with
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched the punishing raids on Lebanese civilian targets
in retaliation for earlier guerrillas attacks on Israeli occupation
troops in the security zone Israelis carved out in southern Lebanon
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The session is also being held at a time when the Middle East
peace process, especially on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-
Israeli tracks, has entered crucial stage. Coordination and efforts
to form a common stand among the Arab states towards Israel are
apparently neccessary.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers conference is the first that was held
in Lebanon since 1975 when the civil war erupted in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hoss described Friday the gathering as "a message to Israel that
any further attacks on Lebanon would be viewed as directed against
the entire Arab world."
</P>
<P>
All Arab countries are attending the meeting at or above the
ministerial level but Somalia that was represented by its permanent
ambassador to the Arab League in Cairo because of the civil war in
the Horn of Africa nation.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has sent a delegation headed by its crown prince, having
the highest-ranking representation.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has also sent a
delegate as an observer to "show their support" to Lebanon.

particular at this critical juncture of both Sino-U.S. relations
and the relations across the Taiwan Straits.

warning at a regular press conference Thursday when asked to
respond to a recently-issued U.S. report on arms sales to Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Moussa Expects U.S. Move to Revive Syrian Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has expected the U.S to take moves soon to revive the
stalled Syrian,Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa voiced the expectation in Beirut in an interview with
Lebanese daily Almusaqbal published Saturday. He is in Beirut to
attend the Arab League foreign ministers meeting that will be held
on March 11-12.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is moved from originally-planned venue Cairo to
Beirut to show Arab solidarity with Lebanon in face of the Israeli
attacks on the Arab state recently.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the proposal has been discussed Thursday at a
tripartite summit in Egyptian Red Sea Resort Sharm el Sheikh among
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Barak told participants at the summit that he
is seriously interested in pushing forward the Syrian track and
said " we affirm that we cannot accept anything that embarrasses
our Syrian brotheres, so the movement should lead to a real
progress, since we have a clear image about what is going on and
about what can happen on the different tracks."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks that resumed last December bogged
down in January only after two rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister expected that the U.S, the major
mediator in the Mideast peace process, will address the Syrian
track during the next two or three weeks, adding that Syria has the
right to demand the pullout from occupied Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Erekat, Eran to Discuss Transitional Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat will meeting Saturday morning his Israeli opposite number
Oded Eran to discuss the implementation of the transitional issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two chief negotiators will be the first
since Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak agreed Wednesday to resume their stalled peace talks in
Washington later this month.
</P>
<P>
The transitional issues include the third-phase Israeli troops
redeployment in the West Bank, opening the northern safe passage
linking Gaza Strip and the West Bank, the release of more
Palestinian prisoners and the transfer of certain amount of tax
revenues to the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian chief negotiator for the final status
talks Yasser Abed Rabbo said more Palestinian prisoners will be
released before the Islamic Eid al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice,
which starts on March 15, and that third-phase redeployment will
start within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Voice of Palestine radio, Abed Rabbo also
denied earlier press reports that the Israeli government will hand
over only 50 percent of the West Bank to Palestinians in exchange
for its recognition of the future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official stressed that the creation of the
Palestinian state is a tangible fact and that it will be
established on all Palestinian lands occupied since 1967, including
Jerusalem as its eternal capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The 113th Arab Foreign Ministers'
Conference opened here at 12:08 local time (1008 GMT) on Saturday
to show solidarity with Lebanon in confrontation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf, chairman of the
last conference, presided over the opening session and made a short
inaugural speech, saying that the Arab countries should support
Lebanon's resistance movement against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Then he transferred the chairmanship to his Omani counterpart
Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
All the 22 member states of the Arab League (AL) attended the
two-day meeting at the prime ministry in this mediterranean city.
The AL decided to hold the meeting in Beirut instead of the bloc's
headquarter in the Egyptian capital of Cairo to show Arab
solidarity and the organization's support to Lebanon against the
February 8 Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched the punishing raids on Lebanese civilian targets
in retaliation for earlier guerrillas attacks on Israeli occupation
troops in the security zone Israelis carved out in southern Lebanon
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The session is also being held at a time when the Middle East
peace process, especially on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-
Israeli tracks, has entered crucial stage. Coordination and efforts
to form a common stand among the Arab states towards Israel are
apparently neccessary.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers conference is the first to be held in
Lebanon since 1975 when the civil war erupted in the country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Al Hoss described Friday the
gathering as "a message to Israel that any further attacks on
Lebanon would be viewed as directed against the entire Arab world."
</P>
<P>
All Arab countries are attending the landmark meeting at or
above the ministerial level except Somalia that will be represented
by its permanent ambassador to Arab League in Cairo because of the
civil war in the Horn of Africa nation.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has sent a delegation headed by its crown prince, having
the highest-ranking representation.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has also sent a
delegate as an observer to "show their support" to Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Hunts for Tamil Rebels after Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's security forces on
Saturday mounted a large-scale cordon and search operation in the
capital Colombo and nearby suburbs to flush out Tamil Tiger rebels
after bombings and shooting.
</P>
<P>
Bomb explosions and shooting which were carried out by Tamil
Tigers rebels rocked Colombo Friday evening, killing at least 23
people including six policemen, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said four rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) blew themselves up on early Saturday after being
surrounded by security forces.
</P>
<P>
These rebels were surrounded by hundreds of troops at an
apartment complex in Colombo where they had hidden after staging
bombings and a shooting spree at a route near the Ayurvedic
hospital at Borella, the commercial center of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the rebels may have been trying to target
Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte who was due to take
that route after a debate on a state of emergency in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ratwatte, who is in charge of Sri Lanka's war effort against
the rebels, is widely seen to be high on the LTTE's hit list.
</P>
<P>
London-based human rights group Amnesty International has
condemned the indiscriminate killing of civilians and urged LTTE
and Sri Lankan government to take measures to prevent civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting a 17-year-old war to carve out a
separate homeland for minority Tamils in the north and east of Sri
Lanka, have been blamed for several bomb explosions and suicide
bombings in Colombo and other cities over the years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga said
Saturday that there were signs that the LTTE rebels want to return
to the negotiating tables.
</P>
<P>
She told a live interview on the state television that the long-
running war would only continue if negotiation would not happen.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Agreement on Oil Production Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran has denied reports that Iran
has reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia to increase oil outputs
to hold rising prices, local daily Tehran Times reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The false reports on Iran's acceptance of oil production
increase is nothing but personal interpretations made by news
agencies, the daily quoted Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, senior
advisor of the Oil Ministry, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi also confirmed
that "there has been no change in Iran's stance on the issue and
increase in oil production is not the policy of the Islamic
Republic of Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh and his Saudi
counterpart Ali Ibn Ibrahim Al-Naimi on Wednesday reached an
agreement on an agreement on "adequate and timely" oil supply.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement following their talks in Riyadh, the two
ministers said that oil producers should provide "adequate and
timely oil supplies" to balance the market in order to reach
sustainable price levels conductive to world economic growth and
market stability.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices dropped slightly soon after the statement was
released, which was seen as a change in Iran's stance from its
previous opposition to an increase in oil production ceiling in the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Western consuming countries, primarily the U.S., have urged oil-
exporting countries to raise production in the second quarter of
the year to pull down the rising oil prices since OPEC members
decided to cut down their outputs last spring.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been a main opponent of an immediate supply increase, a
move advocated by OPEC's Saudi Arabia and Venezuela and non-OPEC
Mexico. Iranian Oil Ministry claimed on Monday that the demand for
crude oil has started to drop by 3 million barrels per day (bpd)
for the second quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the statement, Ardebili said what Iran meant by
this statement was the sufficient production of oil aimed at market
stabilization.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this principal, Iran has not agreed to any increase
or decrease in oil production and any decision about this matter
would be left to the OPEC meeting in Vienna on March 27, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran has not issued any statement about
increase or decrease of oil production, adding that the joint
statement issued with Saudi Arabia has only emphasized the need for
sufficient and timely supply of oil.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the second biggest OPEC producer with a quota at 3.6
million bpd and is currently producing about 3.3 million bpd after
OPEC decided last year to cut down outputs aiming at raising oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Iran's producing capacity was announced at 4 million bpd,
fearing to lose its current share in the OPEC when the 12-nation
oil-producing block raised production ceiling.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Military Force Determined to Defend Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian military force has vowed
to defend the nation's nascent democracy at all costs, saying that
it can no longer tolerate wanton destruction of lives and property
in the country, according to a newspaper's report here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the media in the capital Abuja on Friday, Chief of
Defense Staff Ibrahim Ogohi made the pledge in an open response to
the recent riots in some parts of the country which claimed
hundreds of lives.
</P>
<P>
The present military force in Nigeria would fight to defend
democracy at all costs and nobody should have faint impression
that the armed forces would ever again abandon its traditional
role of defending the people and the nation, he was quoted by The
Post Express newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ogohi reaffirmed that the military function in a democratic
set-up is explicit and "we are prepared to assist other security
agents to maintain peace, law and order at any time."
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, the military force hardly speaks
directly to the public, especially due to certain contingencies of
their profession, he said, adding that one could not continue to
be silent at such a time when wanton destruction of lives and
property happened in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to officers not to allow themselves to be used by
any group of people or individuals to destabilize the government,
saying the government must stand no matter what happens.
</P>
<P>
He urged all military men not to take side irrespective of
their religious inclinations in the discharge of their duties,
stressing that "we have one objective and we must achieve that
objective."

<HEADLINE> China's "Silicon Valley": A Long Way to Go (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Zhongguancun Science Park in
western Beijing, renowned as China's "Silicon Valley", is expected
to be turned into a world-class hi-tech development zone in
accordance with a 10-year blueprint mapped out by Beijing
Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some people said the park still has a long, long
way to go to achieve the goal, and one of them is Duan Yongji,
general manager of the Zhongguancun Science &AMP; Technology
Development Co. Ltd., who is a member of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), currently attending its third Session.
</P>
<P>
"The Silicon Valley of the United States boasts the most
sophisticated technologies and hi-tech firms in the world, and
contributes tremendously to transregional economy. The emergence
of American booming economy is attributable largely to the valley,
" Duan said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, however, Zhongguancun is playing a much less role
in local economy, and still less in national economy, Duan said.
But he is convinced that the park will certainly be built into
China's technological innovation and translation center in the
new century.
</P>
<P>
"The park's greatest value rests, in this regard, on boosting
national economy through technical innovation and translation of
research findings into production, or to make fortunes out of
knowledge-based economy and technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
Duan, ex-president of the famous privately-owned Stone Company
and a tycoon in China's IT sector, has been hired to assume the
existing post. In June of 1999, the State Council, China's cabinet,
approved a proposal by the Beijing Municipal Government to speed
up the park's development, expecting it to become the country's
flagship in the sector of high technologies.

<TEXT>
<P>
A saying that "China will look to Zhongguancun in the 21st
century as it did to the south China open city of Shenzhen in the
1980s and Shanghai's new Pudong area in the 1990s" has become very
popular and is on lips of most residents across the country.
</P>
<P>
Duan, known far and wide as "village head" of the park, now
concerns himself greatly with matters pertaining to personnel,
capital and culture business. "We have a force of 500,000 talents
in the park, more qualified personnel than in the Silicon Valley.
But why don't we make as many accomplishments?" he queried
</P>
<P>
Noting that "the crux of the matter concerns mainly policies,"
he said that "to fill and imbue the qualified personal with new
vitality for creations, the most important thing is to enable them
to take control of their of returns that have been earned from
his innovations and pioneering work."
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech development is based on powerful economic strength. "
The park's total output value is expected to exceed 600 billion
yuan (72.3 billion US dollars) in 10 years' time. It means that
the same amount of money should be injected into accordingly to
breakdowns made by economists," he said, "But where does so much
money come from?"
</P>
<P>
Duan suggested that special tax should be initiated and
collected and relevant fund-pooling policies be adopted to attract
private investment, in addition to the establishment of a risk
investment system.
</P>
<P>
"It is also very important to have a pioneering culture in the
course of developing the park into a worthy silicon valley," he
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Duan submitted a proposal to the CPPCC session, calling for
beefed up, joint efforts to turn the Chinese capital of Beijing
into a center of innovations, and Shanghai into a center for
translation of research findings into the relevant products,
whereas Hong Kong is to serve as a center of banking business.

<HEADLINE> Laws on Compulsive Law Enforcement, Human Organ Transplant Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress (CPC), in session here since last Sunday,
submitted proposals calling for enacting a law on compulsive law
enforcement and a law on human organ transplant in China.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of many court verdicts has proved to be hard and
difficult in recent years and this has harmed the legitimate
interests of parties involved and aroused strong resentment from
such parties, a proposal from Heilongjiang and Anhui deputies says.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee has in recent years enacted a series
of laws and regulations relating to economic and financial
activities, and courts have intensified efforts to enforce laws
and acquired much experience in this regard. It is, therefore,
time to enact a law on compulsive law enforcement, the proposal
says.
</P>
<P>
In the proposal for the enactment of a law on human organ
transplant, NPC deputy Wang Weizhong said that many people in
China volunteer to donate their organs to save lives or alleviate
the pains of patients but often fail to do so simply because of a
lack of related legal definitions.
</P>
<P>
Only four cities including Beijing and Shanghai have begun
organizing organ donations. China now has approximately two
million blind people in need of cornea transplant operations, but
only a little more than 1,000 of them have the chance every year.
</P>
<P>
Patients of uremia are another example. Fewer than 2,000 of
them are treated with a kidney transplant annually, compared with
a total of 300,000 that need such a transplant across the country.
</P>
<P>
"A law on human organ transplant should enshrine the principle
of voluntary donation on the part of the donator," the proposal
says.

MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) will
resume its direct flights between Cebu and Hong Kong later this

</P>
<P>
PAL said the three-a-week service would be the airline's third
international link from Cebu as it gradually builds up a presence
in its main southern hub.
</P>
<P>
PAL already flies five times weekly between Cebu and Tokyo, and
four times weekly between Cebu and Osaka.
</P>
<P>
The national flag carrier will also add an extra flight per
week to its popular Manila-Hong Kong service starting March 26,
bringing the total frequency on the route to 25 times weekly, it

Manila and Cebu, making the territory the most frequented
destination in its international network.
</P>
<P>
PAL first operated the Cebu-Hong Kong service in December 1992,
but was forced to suspend the service in June 1998 after financial
and operational difficulties affected the flag carrier.

<HEADLINE> EU Vows to Help Tanzania Solve Refugee Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has
pledged to sustain its share both financially and politically to
help Tanzania solve the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
It will find a solution to the problem through the on-going
Burundi peace talks and international operations in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Guardian newspaper reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to regional authorities and humanitarian agencies at
Lukole Refugee Camp in Tanzania's western Kagera Region on Friday,
visiting EU Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid Poul
Nielson said the world has not abandoned Tanzania to cope with the
problem of refugees alone.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner urged Tanzania to stay on track, to continue
acting as a moral leader and as a guarantor of refugee rights in
accordance with international standards.
</P>
<P>
Hosting refugees, he said, is not only important but also
positive for the image of Africa in the world.
</P>
<P>
The EU, through its European Community Humanitarian Office,
would this year provide 27 million euros (about 27 million U.S.
dollars) to the United Nations system and international
non-governmental organizations for the upkeep of refugees.
</P>
<P>
It has, through the European Development Fund, provided over 34
million euros (about 34 million U.S. dollars) to assist Tanzania
in covering the costs caused by refugees on the country's
infrastructure, social services and environment.
</P>
<P>
At least 300,000 refugees, mostly from Burundi and the DRC, are
now residing in refugee camps in Tanzania's western Kagera,
Kigoma, Tabora and Rukwa regions.

NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- More than eighty people have died

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Sign Protocol to Deal With Erring Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries have signed a protocol to deal with
erring doctors, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, which was already in effect, was aimed at
stopping doctors facing disciplinary charges at home from working
or training in other countries in the region, Zambian Health
Minister David Mpamba was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"You don't expect to misbehave in your country and go to work
elsewhere in the SADC region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC protocol was designed to ensure that the medical
personnel would uphold professional ethics, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said for any Zambian doctors to work within the region, the
Medical Council of Zambia (MCZ) has to clear them.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 doctors from the University Teaching Hospital, the
 biggest hospital in Zambia, were recently fined by MCZ for
walking out of the hospital, some of them with their full
registration suspended for one year.
</P>
<P>
These doctors abandoned work in December last year after
failing to resolve differences with the government. They were
demanding for equipment and drugs.

<HEADLINE> Seven Million Tanzanians Face Chronic Food Insecurity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- About seven million
Tanzanians or 23 percent of the total population are facing
chronic food insecurity at household level due to adverse weather
conditions and poor agricultural management, newspapers reported
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop on agricultural research on Friday,
Director of Tanzania Food and Nutrition Center Wilbald Lorri said
40 percent of the population in Tanzania also experienced periodic
food insecurity.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed to low agricultural production caused by
droughts, floods, lack of inputs, poor processing and storage
methods, he was quoted by the Guardian newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the food insecurity is the fact that
Tanzanian food base has shifted from the use of traditional crops
such as millets, sorghum and cassava to maize, rice and beans, he
said.
</P>
<P>
People prefer maize, rice and beans which need more rain than
drought- resistant crops like millet, sorghum and cassava, Lorri
said.
</P>
<P>
This reduction of the food base has aggravated quite
considerably the food insecurity situation as communities have
nothing to fall back on when rains are not adequate for the
preferred crops, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
report, Tanzania could face a food shortage of up to 190,000 tons
before mid this year due to erratic rains, reduced use of inputs
and an outbreak of army- worms.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 300,000 farmers living
along the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River are now
prospering thanks to a fruit production project.
</P>
<P>
The project, launched ten years ago with funding from the World
Bank, has turned huge areas of barren hills into 15,000 hectares
of orchards, bringing job opportunities to tens of thousands of
people in 31 cities and counties in Hubei and Sichuan provinces
and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The project involved a total investment of 130 million U.S.
dollars, 64 million of which was from World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Caijian, official in charge of the project, told Xinhua
that the project has not only benefited people living around the
area, but has also helped to prevent soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
In Chongqing alone, the planting of fruit trees and land
reclamation for orchards have reduced soil erosion in the city by
50 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city also produced an additional 308,000 tons of
fruits, earning 776 million yuan in output value.

<HEADLINE> China to Amend Marriage Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior law maker said here
today that the National People's Congress, China's legislature,
has decided to put amending the Marriage Law on its legislative
agenda this year.
</P>
<P>
The decision to amend the law comes at a time when the Chinese
society is increasingly troubled by such social problems as
proliferating concubinage and worsening family violence.
</P>
<P>
"During the past 20 years, big changes have taken place in the
economic and social picture, and people's way of thinking. Some
people, after they have become rich or acquired positions of power
and, under the influence of feudal thinking, start having
concubines. Family violence such as wife beating is also rising as
a result of resurgent male chauvisim," said Hu Kangsheng, a deputy
director of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
All these new social problems necessitate an amendment to
Marriage Law that would facilitate the formation of a more
civilized marriage and family system in the nation, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The existing Marriage Law was enacted in 1980, which provides
for free marriage, monogamy, and an equal status between husband
and wife. Bigamy, family violence and the abandoning family
members are banned by Marriage Law.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also urged better study into and greater effort at
eliminating family violence.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong SAR Obligated to Legislate Against Treason, Secession, Subversion: Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is obligated, in accordance with the
Basic Law of the HKSAR, to legislate against the crimes of treason,
secession, sedition, subversion against the central government,
said senior lawmaker Qiao Xiaoyang here today.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, deputy director the Legislative Affairs Commission under
the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (
NPC), made the remark at a press conference held by the ongoing
NPC session.
</P>
<P>
Article 23 of the Basic Law stipulates: "The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any
act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the
Central People's Government, or theft of state secrets, to
prohibit foreign political organizations or bodies from conducting
political activities in the Region, and to prohibit political
organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with
foreign political organizations or bodies."
</P>
<P>
"None of the prohibited deeds mentioned above is allowed in any
country and region in the world by law, and a similar law existed
before Hong Kong was returned to China," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the Basic Law, the HKSAR must enact a law on
relevant issues," he said. "But legislation takes time; and it is
up to the HKSAR to decide when to enact. But it won't do not to
legislate."
</P>
<P>
When questioned whether or not HKSAR is obligated to consult
the Central Authorities when it enacts such a law in accordance
with Article 23 of the HKSAR Basic Law, Qiao said that since
issues involved in legislation concern national sovereignty,
unification and territorial integrity, it would be "only
reasonable" if the HKSAR consults the Central Authorities in the
process of legislation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's National News Agency Workers Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- About 120 workers including
journalists from Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency and Community
Newspapers Group went on strike Friday, demanding salary increase,
 the daily Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They asked for an 80 percent salary increase and another 200
percent increase on allowances which they say were supposed to
have been paid by the end of January this year.
</P>
<P>
Workers vowed not to return to work until their grievances are
resolved, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Editor-in-Chief of the national news agency Henry Muradzikwa
said management was still waiting for intervention from the
Ministry of Information, Posts and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is at a standstill and it is most regrettable that
our clients are not being served," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chimutengwende, minister of Information, Posts and
Telecommunications, told The Herald Friday that the Ministry of
Finance was looking into the issue.
</P>
<P>
The national news agency sells news to various newspapers and
the strike by the workers has resulted in the agency failing to
acquire and distribute news.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ex-Fighters Allowed to Remain On Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ex-combatants can
remain on the commercial farms they invaded as long as they are
peaceful, said President Robert Mugabe in Gweru of central
Zimbabwe on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a one-day meeting for chiefs, Mugabe admitted that
there were contradictions between his statement issued last week,
supporting the invasions, and another one by Minister of Home
Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa, ordering the ex-fighters to leave the
farms by Sunday or face unspecified action.
</P>
<P>
The president explained that when Dabengwa gave the directive,
the government had been informed that the ex-fighters were turning
violent at some commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
"But the issue has now been resolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was agreed that they can remain on the farms as long as
they are peaceful," he told more than 200 chiefs and government
officials at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The president accused some white commercial farmers of
influencing their workers to vote against the draft constitution
during last month's referendum.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers ferried their workers to polling stations with
instructions to vote "no", he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss with the ex-combatants to have the land they
occupied demarcated. But we want the whites to learn that the
land belongs to Zimbabweans," he said.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters have occupied over 200 white-owned
farms over the past month.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe urged Zimbabweans to remain united in the face of
economic problems worsened by a fuel crisis which, he said, would
be over in the next two weeks when more fuel supplies arrive.
</P>
<P>
Some enemies of the country were using the fuel crisis to
discredit the government, he said.

BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Deputies from the ethnic
minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang at the on-going session of the 9

China's economic growth, and implementation of the development of
its west and establishment of highly-efficient, clean government.
</P>

Kuala Lumpur, with a designed capability of producing 2,100
megawatt (mw) of electricity.
</P>
<P>
The project to be financed from local and foreign loans is
expected to be fully operational in September 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Perak state is the biggest contributor to Malaysia's power
need with various power plants including the hydroelectricity dams,
meeting one third of the country's power-generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
According to Bernama News Agency, Energy, Communications and
Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie said at the launching that the
project to be undertaken by Tenaga Nasional Berhad (National
Energy Company) subsidiaries is vital because the country's demand
for electricity is expected to increase to 21,000 mw in 2010 from
8,990 mw at present.
</P>
<P>
The government has approved the power plant project using coal
for fuel as a strategic move to diversify energy sources, he said,
adding the country does not want to rely on just one form of fuel
in its efforts to set up a national electricity supply system.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the government would restructure the
country's electricity supply industry to enhance its
competitiveness, thus helping to intensify further economic growth.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Carrier Raises Air Fares, Others Yet to Follow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Continental Airlines, the
fifth largest carrier of the United States, Friday attempted to
impose a new fare increase of up to 40 dollars per round trip,
blaming the rising cost of fuel, Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
But the hike is left in doubt as other major carriers did not
follow suit as of Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Continental boosted domestic round-trip fares by 20 dollars on
flights of up to 500 miles (800 kilometers), by 30 dollars on
flights between 500 miles and 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), and
by 40 dollars on flights of more than 1,000 miles. One-way fares
will rise by 10, 15 and 20 dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Continental led the industry in a 20-dollar fuel surcharge
on domestic round-trip fares in January, but had to back off on
second increase of 30 dollars in late February.
</P>
<P>
Generally when airlines raise fares, the hikes will remain in
place if their competitors also raise fares. Otherwise, the fare
hikes are repealed.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Dallas-based Southwest Airlines said the
carrier does not plan to raise fares.
</P>
<P>
"To be sure, fuel prices are a terrible, terrible thing for the
entire industry," said Ed Steward. "But the news with Continental
is just news with us. We are obviously trying to watch costs and
govern ourselves accordingly."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Airways also did not follow Continental Friday, but was
silent on what actions the carrier may take.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for United Airlines, the largest carrier in the U.S.
, said they were studying the matter and had not made a decision.
</P>
<P>
Reactions from other major carriers were not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
Fuel prices remain at historically high levels, threatening
airline profits. April crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange
ended Friday at 31.76 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, despite recent fare increases, airlines remain
embroiled in a fierce fare war taking place almost exclusively on
the Internet, where consumers can still find bargains, said Tom
Parsons, an airline industry observer for Bestfares.com, an online
discount travel service.
</P>
<P>
Major airlines are all offering coast-to-coast flights for 198
dollars round-trip, with purchases by March 22 and travel
completed by August 5, in most cases.

<HEADLINE> "La Nina" Weather Overwhelms U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The warm, dry weather
associated with the "La Nina" weather phenomenon had brought the
warmest winter in U.S. history, and could bring a rough fire
season to the southeastern part of the country, according to two
separate reports released Friday.
</P>
<P>
All-time high average temperatures had been recorded for the
December-through-February season across the United States, said
the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).
</P>
<P>
The 50-state average temperature during the three-month period
was 38.4 degrees Fahrenheit, 0.6 degrees above the previous record
that was set last year, said the NCDC, which also measured the
season as the 16th driest U.S. winter in 105 years of record-
keeping.
</P>
<P>
Only areas of the northern Rockies and Midwest experienced
relatively wet winter weather, with many areas -- especially the
southeast -- well below average rain and snowfall, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
"La Nina" is the nickname for a weather phenomenon where
unusually cool water in the Pacific Ocean affects weather
conditions on a nearly worldwide basis. "La Nina" often brings
warmer, dry weather to most of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The high average temperatures and low average precipitation
marks this winter were set in spite of a few notable periods of
cold weather, and an unprecedented heavy January snowstorm that
blanketed several southeastern states.
</P>
<P>
This marked the third consecutive year that record warmth was
recorded in the United States during the winter months. Since 1980,
more than two-thirds of U.S. winters have been warmer than average,
according to another report by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
Both reports heightened concerns that "La Nina"-inspired
drought could plague the southeastern part of U.S. this spring and
summer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service reinforced that concern by
issuing a 13-state "fire advisory" for a region stretching from
Texas to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there have already been 14,151 wildfires
across the United States so far this year, compared to 18,805 for
all of 1999. Some 13,186 fires across the southern states have
charred 258,690 acres. The fire season in southeast runs from mid-
March to mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The current "La Nina" system is also believed to have been
responsible for the rainy conditions and catastrophic flooding in
Mozambique. Experts noted that while "La Nina" rarely lasts longer
than two years, the current system shows little sign of letting up.

<HEADLINE> Hakkinen Grabs Pole Position for Australian Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Mika Hakkinen
of Finland won the pole position in Melbourne on Saturday for
Sunday's Australian Formula One Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen, in a Mercedes-Benz for McLaren, clocked one minute 30.
556 seconds in the qualifying session which saw David Coulthard of
Britain crashed in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
However, the Briton still managed for a one-two finish for
McLaren in 1:30.910, ahead of former double world champion Michael
Schumacher of Germany for Ferrari in 1:31.075 and his Ferrari's
teammate Rubens Barrichello of Brazil in 1:31.102.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard and Jenson Button for Williams were both unhurt in
their accidents at the Albert Park track in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
It was a hard hit for Schumacher who is aiming for Ferrari's
first title in 21 years, as his flying lap had to be aborted
because of Coulthard's crash.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's two racers took the fifth and sixth places through
German Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Italian Jarno Trulli.

<HEADLINE> Wind Power Station to Be Built in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China is to build a wind power
station in northwest China's Gansu province, sources with the
provincial government said.
</P>
<P>
Gansu, with abundant wind power resources, will build the
station in the town of Yumen in Hexi Corridor on the ancient Silk
Road. The total installed capacity of the station is 50,000
kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the initial phase of the project will start
soon; its generating capacity is 7,200 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The initial phase is expected to be completed by the end of
July next year, and the second and third by 2005, the officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
Electricity generation from wind has a rosy future in China
because it's pollution-free and cheap. China reportedly has wind
power resource potential of 253 million kW.
</P>
<P>
Gansu plans to build at least three other wind power stations
in the Hexi Corridor.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Sees Higher Telephone Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Telephone coverage in southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region increased last year, especially in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official figure, there were 26
telephones for every 100 urban Tibetans by the end of 1999. The
average telephone coverage in the whole region was five out of 100,
up 1.4 percentage points over 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the regional capital of Lhasa, 45 out of every 100 had
telephones, ranking highest in the autonomous region, the
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, the plateau region saw a total of 36,646 new
telephone users, among them were 16,261 mobile telephone users.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Tibet had some 80,000 telephone users,
a rise of 34.5 percent over 1998. The number of mobile phone users
was close to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
To meet the increasing demand of local people, the regional
telecommunications department expanded its switchboard capacity by
over 7,000 lines to more than 156,000 lines by the end of last
year.

<HEADLINE> HK-Interior Cooperation Urged to Face Challanges after WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and interior areas
should join efforts to seize opportunities and face challenges
brought by the interior's expected entry into the global trade
body, according to Hong Kong members of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Members from Hong Kong business circles said during their panel
discussions that accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
will not only have great influence for economic development in the
inland areas, but also produce favorable conditions for economic
growth in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Upon its entry into the WTO, China will face competitions
involving personnel, foreign-financed enterprises and businesses
and acute employment pressure, said Luk Chung-lam, adding that
Hong Kong should further increase its cooperation with the
mainland, taking the advantage of being a long-standing WTO member
and other favorable conditions in standing to the challenges.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and its
business circles are acquainted with international trade rules and
WTO regulations. So it can share such experience with the inland
areas, Luk said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the interior can pool funds and obtain banking
services as well as related technology from Hong Kong, according
to Leung Tim-pui.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, enterprises in Hong Kong, Taiwan and in interior
areas can work in cooperation to develop bartering centers in
coastal cities of the interior, so that transportation, storage,
stock management, packing, and value-added services can be handled
in a concentrated way in a bid to lower marketing costs, said Mun
Kin-chok, a noted economist from Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Violence to be Curbed by Peaceful Means: Nepali Home Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Home Minister Purna
Bahadur Khadka said the government is making efforts to solve
ultra-leftist guerrillas problems through peaceful talks.
</P>
<P>
Khadka briefed a National Assembly meeting Friday about the
country's present law and order situation and the loss of life and
property caused by violence of guerrillas, adding that violence
and murder further complicates the problems rather than solving
them.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has been making appeals for giving up
violence, murder and terrorist activity and is engaged in the task
of ensuring national interests by arriving at certain conclusions.
</P>
<P>
Khadka told the assembly that a separate unit of armed police
will be formed to deal with the guerrillas and a task force has
already been set up to make a report along with suggestions about
the form and duties of such a body.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,13 people including 146 police personnel have been
killed and property worth 110 million rupees (1.06 million U.S.
dollars) damaged since the guerrillas began their movement in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved a credit of 7.2 billion U.S. dollars for
Argentina on Friday to support the government's economic program.
</P>
<P>
The three-year standby loan, passed by the IMF board at an
afternoon meeting, replaces a previous credit worth some 2.8
billion dollars, and will give financial support to the South
American country if it is hit by economic crisis or factors beyond
its control.
</P>
<P>
"The new Argentine government has embarked on a strong economic
program aimed at promoting the recovery and sustained growth of
the economy, with continued price stability, and an external
current account maintained within financeable limits," said IMF
Acting Managing Director Stanley Fischer.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the IMF published last month, Argentina promised
a string of reforms designed to prevent its economy from sliding
back into recession or going deeper into debt.
</P>
<P>
The two sides forecast economic growth averaging 4 percent over
the coming years in Argentina, with 3.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The loan is one of the 10 largest in the 55-year history of the
international financial organization, though much smaller than the
multi-billion dollar credits it  extended to Brazil, South Korea
and Indonesia during the world economic crisis of 1997-1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese triple Olympic champion
Fu Mingxia returned to the national team, targeting at the women's
synchronized springboard title at the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Fu, currently No. 2 in the 3-meter springboard on Chinese women
's rankings, will pair up with Guo Jingjing, the top diver in
China, for the Sydney Olympics which will see debut by
symchronized diving.
</P>
<P>
Former national head coach Xu Yiming said: "The duo have clear
advantage because they have the same style of diving, compact and
muscular grace. The only thing they need is to train together."
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Fu, who had retired to study in the prestigious
Qinghua University in 1996 and resumed training last July with the
university's diving team, had never tried synchro diving before.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Swimming Sports Association (CSSA) had named Guo's
trainer Zhong Shaozhen to supervise Fu, while Fu's long-time coach
Yu Fen remained her position as a head coach in the university
team.
</P>
<P>
Shi Tianshu, director of CSSA, said: "As a possible member to
qualify for the Olympic Games, it is necessary that Fu returns to
national team and trains synchro event with top diver."
</P>
<P>
Guo had edged Fu for the 3-meter springboard title by less than
five points in the World Cup diving competition in Sydney on
January 28. But later Guo lost the synchronized title when she
paird with Liang Xiaoqiao for the runner-up, five points behind a
Russia duo.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Deng Yaping Hungers for English </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- After collecting 18 world table
tennis titles, what she is hungry for are no longer gold medals
but fluent English.
</P>
<P>
Having been invincible in her sport, can she remain unbeatable
against hardships of language learning?
</P>
<P>
Deng Yaping, women's table tennis legend and now a student in
Britain's Nottingham University, takes the challenge with
confidence and perseverance -- her assets which had carried the
diminutive player to the career climax.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who had to start from scratch, is racing against time,
just as she tried to rebound to beat her opponents in table tennis.
</P>
<P>
"I seldom go to bed until midnight and get up before 4 or 5 a.m.
," said the 26-year-old Deng. "Sometimes I really feel heavy
pressure."
</P>
<P>
She shows fully the making of being a world-class athlete in
taking up a new enterprise, working hard while others at rest and
being bold to defy the challenge while others withdraw.
</P>
<P>
"She studies English as diligently as she plays table tennis,"
said Yao Zhenxu, chairman of the technical committee of the
International Table Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
Her efforts have paid off as Deng, who had trouble in daily
conversation at the very beginning, no longer needs the tutor and
has become a student in the intermediate class of the Foreign
Language Training Center of the Nottingham University.
</P>
<P>
English, however, is a means not end to her.
</P>
<P>
"I have made up my mind to take the Master Degree on
International Relations, but the English is my first barrier,"
Deng said.
</P>
<P>
"Here maybe the starting point of my new life," added Deng.
</P>
<P>
The degree is not the only objective of the prolific world
champion. She is set to run for the membership of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
He Zhenliang, an IOC Executive Member from China, said on
Monday that Deng is eligible to run for the 10 spots allotted for
the summer sports at the 110th IOC session last December when IOC
decided to recruit 15 sports members to its membership, with other
five left for the Winter sports."
</P>
<P>
The athletes members for the Summer sports will be elected
during the pending Olympic Games slated for September in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
He Zheliang said that Deng, who was nominated to the IOC
Athletes Commission by President Juan Antonio Samaranch in 1997, "
has expressed her readiness to run for the IOC membership."
</P>
<P>
Deng has competed in the world table tennis championships from
the 40th to 44th editions and the 25th and 26th Olympic Games,
reaping a harvest of 18 world titles, including twice double
champions in the Olympic Games during her 10-year-long sports
career.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Deng was voted as the Chinese Sports Personality of
the Century, an award co-sponsored by the Chinese Olympic
Committee, the Sports Association of China and the Henry Fok
Sports Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Textile Industry in NE China Province Sees First Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- State-owned textile mills in
Liaoning province, one of the oldest industrial bases in northeast
China, saw a total profit of 21 million yuan (2,530,120 US dollars)
last year, putting an end to the nine-year deficit.
</P>
<P>
"Though it is not a large sum of money, it does bring us
confidence and hope that the State-owned enterprises will have a
bright future because of their reform," said Zhan Huizhen, chief
director of the textile industry management office of the province.
</P>
<P>
After years of deficit, China's textile industry, along with
the coal industry, became a burden to Liaoning's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, under the central government's general plan, Liaoning
started reform of the industry. So far, the province has discarded
439,000 outdated textile spindles, optimized the industrial
structure, and strengthened the competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Zhan believes this year's profit is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
The demand of the domestic and international markets is
expected to rise this year, which will offer a special opportunity
for Liaoning textile producers, especially those in the fields of
garments and related materials, Zhan said.

<HEADLINE> Thick Haze Shrouds Towns in Sumatera, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Thick haze from forest fires
shrouded several towns in Indonesia's Sumatera island on Friday,
according to reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Haze Monitoring Center at the Meteorology and
Geophysics Office, the thick haze spread over Pekanbaru, capital
of Riau province, regencies of Bengkalis, Indragiri Hilir and
Indragiri Hulu in Riau, and Padang, capital of West Sumatera
province.
</P>
<P>
Thick haze kept Pekanbaru mostly in the dark during daylight
hours, the Jakarta Post said, adding that by 09:00 a.m. most homes
in the provincial capital were using lights and vehicles on the
roads were forced to turn on their headlights.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers and city employees handed out cotton surgical masks
to commuters and pedestrians to help reduce the potential of
respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Impact Management Agency said there were 515
hot spots in Riau.
</P>
<P>
Despite the assistance of emergency fire-fighting teams,
hundreds of hectares of national parks and plantations in West
Sumatera are up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
Although the haze has darkened parts of Sumatera since last
week, hospitals have yet to report any major increase in health
problems, particularly patients seeking treatment for respiratory
disorders, the Jakarta Post said.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires in Sumatera and Kalimantan are causing fears of a
repeat of the 1997 disaster when neighboring Singapore and parts
of Malaysia were engulfed in thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid has promised to do everything
possible to prevent another ecological disaster on the scale of
three years ago, and Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab reiterated on
Friday that the government would take stern measures against
errant firms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
has put into operation its fire suppression mobilization measures
in Riau to contain the spread of forest fires and smoke haze.
</P>
<P>
"These mobilization measures are part of the broader action
plan for the prevention and control of land and forest fire and
haze in the whole of Sumatera and West Kalimantan," a press
release issued by the ASEAN Secretariat here said on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Ruling Party Votes to Support Access to Euro Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Swedish Social
Democratic Party (SDP) voted Friday to support Sweden's bid to
enter the 11-nation European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
After a seven-hour heated debate, delegates attending the
party's extraordinary congress voted overwhelmingly to approve a
proposal of the SDP executive committee that Sweden should join
the EMU, also known as the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
But the congress did not discuss when Sweden will participate
in the euro land.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh announced
that in accordance with widespread requests among SDP members, the
party's executive committee has decided to leave to the Swedish
people rather than the parliament to vote on whether the country
should join the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
But the committee has not yet set a date for the proposed
nationwide referendum, she said, adding that Sweden should enter
the euro zone at a time which is suitable for its economy.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the congress, Swedish Prime Minister and SDP
chairman Goran Persson expressed his strong support for the
country's bid for EMU membership, saying EMU membership is the
best shield against potential international financial disturbance.
</P>
<P>
Delegates will also discuss the country's economic growth and
social welfare at the two-day congress which opened here Friday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Considers Increasing Troops at Border With E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is considering
increasing its troops at the border with East Timor following
reports of increasing activities of former pro-integration
militias, according to Indonesian Military (TNI) spokesman Rear
Marshal Graito Usodo.
</P>
<P>
He said TNI chief Admiral Widodo had discussed the idea with
the chief of the intelligence unit and the chief of the Udayana
regional command who oversees the border between West and East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in East
Timor (UNPKF), Lt. Gen. Jaime de los Santos, and the head of the U.
N. Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), Peter
Gailbraith, had raised the issue during a meeting with Widodo at
the TNI headquarters here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Graito said Widodo expressed full understanding about the
situation and concern about the militias' activities.
</P>
<P>
"The commander fully understood the situation and was concerned
about it so that we need to take a firm and clear stand internally
as well as externally," he was quoted by Antara News Agency
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Graito said the number of security personnel at the border now
only totaled 689 which was considered insufficient to secure the
135-km-long border line.
</P>
<P>
Udayana Commander Major General Kiki Syahnakri admitted that
some ex-militias had launched attacks but they were not as serious
as had been reported by the foreign media.
</P>
<P>
The TNI had tightened its border watch, taken firm actions and
carried out operations at camps suspected of being used by ex-
militias, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab Friday said President
Abdurrahman Wahid has ordered Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono to
take concrete action to stop reported ex-militias incursions into
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"The president was not happy to hear about the events and has
called on the defense minister to take concrete actions and, if
necessary, to disarm the militias," Alwi was quoted by Antara as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that U.N. peacekeepers in East Timor came under
fire four times in 24 hours on Wednesday. A helicopter on a border
reconnaissance mission was also fired at from West Timor.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman said the attacks were carried out by pro-
integration militiamen who fled to West Timor last September
following the overwhelming vote for independence in a U.N.-
sponsored referendum.

<HEADLINE> 30 Killed in Fresh Violence in Indonesia's Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Bloody violence has broken out
again in Halmahera island, North Maluku province about 2,600
kilometers northeast of Jakarta, leaving at least 30 people dead
and dozens more injured, reports reaching here Saturday said.
</P>
<P>
By Friday, tensions were still gripping the atmosphere in the
northern part of Halmahera and Bula sub-district, Seram island, in
Central Maluku in the wake of recent communal clashes in those
areas, a local military leader said.
</P>
<P>
Bloody sectarian clashes erupted on Wednesday, and continued
through Thursday after several weeks of relative calm on the
island, the largest in North Maluku province and scene of many of
the worst clashes of the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
A total of 146 houses were also burned down during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Maluku military commander Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela said
authorities were still gathering information on the motives behind
the latest violence.
</P>
<P>
The rival camps engaged each other in man-to-man duels with
sharp weapons in open spaces, making it difficult for security
forces to take control of the situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
To anticipate a possible spread of the unrest in the areas,
Tamaela said, he had sent reinforcements to the locations.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people have been killed in the long-standing
religious violence in the region. The fighting was triggered by a
minor traffic accident involving a Christian and a Muslim in the
Maluku provincial capital of Ambon in January last year.

<HEADLINE> Demand For Real Estate Declining in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Demand for real estate is
declining now in Myanmar, according to the latest issue of the
Myanmar Times.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Myanmar Housing Department was quoted as
saying that developers should not take up new housing projects for
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
U Arnt Kyaw, director-general of the department, added that the
realty market could make a rebound in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Real estate prices in Myanmar collapsed in mid-1998 and the
sale of property remained stagnant through the rest of that year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 1999 became a tough year for the real estate
players as property did not return to its status as a "tangible
asset" considered worthy of investment.
</P>
<P>
There are now many finished buildings remaining unoccupied and
some housing projects are incomplete in the country.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the situation, housing developers here are
attempting to put life back into the property market again by
using all marketing ploys such as real estate trade fairs,
generous discounts and hire purchase.
</P>
<P>
More than five years ago, Myanmar initiated modern housing
schemes in the capital, jointly implemented by the Housing
Department, the Yangon City Development Committee and the private
construction entrepreneurs, aimed at improving the living
standards of city dwellers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Help Colombia Destroy Coca Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming U.S.
assistance under its so called "Colombia Plan" will be mainly
concentrated on the destruction of coca plant cultivated in
Colombia, a high-ranking police officer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ismael Trujillo, director general of the Colombian anti-drug
police, said that local anti-drug campaigns will receive the
largest part of the aforementioned U.S. assistance, which obtained
the preliminary approval of the U.S. Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Allocations Committee has
authorized 1.6 billion U.S. dollars for the "Colombia Plan," a
project to help the anti-drug efforts and the domestic peace
process initiated by Colombian President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
Local anti-drug campaigns, especially those in Putumayo, a
province bordering Ecuador and Peru, will benefit the most from
the U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
According to Colombian official figures, a total of 110,000
hectares of land in Putumayo are now used for coca cultivation,
yielding half of the total coca output in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
"We must not forget that the country has now 26 provinces
affected by the cultivation (of coca plants or opium poppy)," said
Trujillo to the press.
</P>
<P>
Also included in the U.S. aid are some 60 modern helicopters to
support the swift deployment of Colombia's anti-drug police.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Seeks Consensus to Raise Crude Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government is
seeking a consensus with oil exporting and importing countries to
raise oil output from April 1, said Energy Minister Luis Tellez on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tellez told a local television network that "Mexico has said
that it is convenient to have a slight production increase to
establish inventories and to have a much more ordered market than
the one existing right now."
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that "we are convinced that production
must be increased. We are not the only country that has said this,
there are some more."
</P>
<P>
He said that if no consensus is reached, Mexico will make a
decision on its own. "We are independent, and the most convenient
decision for the country will be taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico now exports 1.525 million barrels of oil a day compared
with more than 1.8 million barrels about two years ago, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia also sent signals of stabilizing world
oil prices on Wednesday when their oil ministers met in Riyadh.
Experts believe that OPEC will agree on an output hike to lower
soaring international petroleum prices during an OPEC meeting
scheduled for Vienna, Austria, on March 27.
</P>
<P>
Tellez stressed that Mexico needs price stability in crude, one
of its economic mainstream, as oil prices have rocketed worldwide,
with those in the U.S. climbing over 34 dollars a barrel this week,
the highest since November 1990.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela led an effort to streamline
supplies by about 5 million barrels a day beginning in March 1998
to salvage collapsing oil prices. The accord expires on March 31
this year. A new one may be worked out in Vienna, experts
speculated.

<HEADLINE> China and South Korea Shares at Short Track Speed Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEFFIELD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Sprinters from China and South
Korea took a lion's share on the first day of the world short
track speed skating championships Wednesday evening, winning the
women's and men's 1500 meters respectively.
</P>
<P>
World champions Yang Yang (A), from China's Heilongjiang
province, moved up from the squeeze of three South Korean rivals
to win the women's event at a time of two minutes and 32.707
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Park Hye-won and Joo Min-jin, both from South Korea, finished
second and third at 2:32.829 and 2:33.175 respectively.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's distance, South Korean teenager Min Ryong
won through perfect strategy in two minutes 23.098 seconds. Eric
Bedard of Canada had the silver at 2:23.200 and Satoru Terao of
Japan bronze at 2:23.286.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang (A), 24, had been lonely in the final after her
teammates failed to make finals. Wang Chunlu finished third in
the semi-final while Yang Yang (S) was disqualified for push en
route to the final six.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang (A), who was sandwiched by the three South Koreans
right from the start, only managed to find a occasion to
oversprint her rivals in the final curve and dashed to touch the
finish line first with an advantage of spade tip.
</P>
<P>
"I am really excited," she said. "I don't know how to express
my feeling after finishing the distance."
</P>
<P>
Chinese team coach Xin Qingshan added: "I should say it was a
hard-fought victory. If Yang Yang (S) had qualified for the final,
Yang Yang (A)'s road to gold would not be such tough."
</P>
<P>
It is a no-better start for Yang Yang (A) who is now biding for
her fourth successive all-around gold medal at the world
championships.
</P>
<P>
The men's and women's 500m events are scheduled for tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Arab Foreign Ministers' Conference Concludes, Voicing Support to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The 113th Arab Foreign Ministers'
Conference concluded here on Saturday, voicing support to Lebanon
and calling for suspension of normalizing ties with Israel which
have been launching attacks against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The final resolutions of the conference, which were read by Arab
League Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid, urged countries
involved in multilateral negotiations to reconsider their
participation until bilateral peace talks achieve substantial
results.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions also denounce Israel for its continued
occupation of southern Lebanon and aggressions on Lebanese
territory.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the conference, Abdel-Meguid and all
member states spoke with nearly the same words, showing Arab
solidarity and their support to Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinians
to take back all occupied lands by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid expressed the bloc's support to Lebanese resistance
aimed at recovering south Lebanon, which has been controlled by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Israel carved out an area of 850 square kilometers as
a "security zone" in south Lebanon to protect settlements along its
northern borders from attacks by anti-Israel groups in the Arab
country.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese guerrilla groups, mainly the Syrian and
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, have been fighting to oust Israeli
soldiers out of the occupied zone, which comprises 10 percent of
the Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid also urged Arab countries' political and financial
support to Lebanon that suffered several large-scale aggressions by
Israel in decades.
</P>
<P>
The latest one took place on February 8 when Israel destroyed
three Lebanese power relay stations and wounded 30 civilians in its
air raids as retaliation to Hezbollah's attacks.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has offered 100 million U.S. dollars in soft loans
and a donation of 30 million dollars to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Kuwait signed an agreement with Lebanon to grant 8.5
million dollars to Lebanon for its rehabilitation of three power
relay stations.
</P>
<P>
In the session, Arab countries unanimously agreed on the
simultaneity of Lebanese and Syrian tracks in the peace
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers also expressed support to Palestine's
declaration of an independent state within this year with east
Jerusalem as its capital, with or without a peace agreement with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Arab world is endeavoring to
reconstruct the Arab solidarity which vanished after the Gulf War
in 1991 when Iraq invaded its Arab neighbor Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The 113th Arab Foreign Ministers' Conference is the first which
has been held in Lebanon since 1975 when the civil war erupted in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League decided to shift the venue of the conference
from Cairo to Beirut to show Arab solidarity with and the bloc's
support to Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Damage in Earthquake Near Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Heavy damage but no casualties were
reported after two earthquake tremors ripped through an area in
the mountainous upper reaches of the Aniene river southeast of
Rome Saturday, the Italian news agency Ansa reported.
</P>
<P>
"I was writing a letter in my office when the tremor shifted
everything on my desk," said Mayor Giorgio Fubelli of Gerano,
south of Rome.
</P>
<P>
In the small town of 1,200 people, a major crack can be seen in
the wall of the Carabinieri police station, the roof of the
recently restored church of Sant Maria Assunta collapsed and a
number of ancient buildings showed signs of damage.
</P>
<P>
The first tremor at 11:35 a.m. hit 4.1 on the Richter scale and
6 on the Mercalli. A second tremor reaching 3-4 degrees on the
Mercalli scale hit at 1:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
At the village of Canterano, one of the two near the epicenter
in the mountainous zone leading towards the higher peaks of the
Abruzzi mountains, about 80 percent of all the buildings were
declared to be dangerous, including the town hall and the school.
</P>
<P>
Some streets in the old center were closed off. Because of the
risk of further tremors and the possible collapse of ancient
buildings, the local mayor has requested a tent camp for 500 on
the sports field.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the office in Rome of Franco Barberi, the
undersecretary responsible for civil protection, said teams of
engineers and technicians have been sent in to check out damaged
buildings.

<HEADLINE> Lagos Assumes Chile Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VALPARAISO, Chile, March 11 (Xinhua) -- New Chilean President
Ricardo Lagos took his post Saturday at a brief and solemn
ceremony at the National Congress in Valparaiso, a city 120
kilometers northwest of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was presided over by Chilean Senate President
Andres Zaldivar, who declared open the plenum of the National
Congress according to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing President Eduardo Frei took off the presidential
insignia and sash and handed them over to Zaldivar, who put them
on new President Ricardo Lagos immediately.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Lagos won the presidential elections in the second
round of voting held on January 16 as the candidate of the
Concertation made up of his Socialist Party and the Christian
Democracy Party, among others.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's ceremony signals the third consecutive presidential
period of the Concertation. Lagos, 62, the third Chilean
consecutive civil president after the return of power by the
military in 1990, will govern for a six-year period.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by some 1,200 persons who included
the Chinese government special envoy, Vice Foreign Minister Yang
Jiechi, and other foreign guests. The delegations led by heads of
state or government stood out among those attending the
presidential changeover.
</P>
<P>
However, lifetime senator Augusto Pinochet and senator for the
Center Union Francisco Javier Errazuriz did not attend the
ceremony as the first was in delicate health and the second had
been deprived of his senatorial privileges by a judicial process.
Former presidential candidate Joaquin Lavin was not present on the
occasion either.
</P>
<P>
A little after the presidential mandate changeover, and in the
same hall of honor of the National Congress, the 16 new ministers
will also be sworn in.

<HEADLINE> Riot in Brazilian Prison Leaves 13 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, Mach 11 (Xinhua) -- A riot in a Brazilian
prison left at least 13 persons dead and three seriously injured,
police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, a group of interns started Friday night a
quarrel to distract the attention of the wardens while others
tried to escape in what would be the second attempt of mass escape
in the last days in the penitentiary center in southern Mato
Grosso state.
</P>
<P>
Neither the identity of the assassins nor that of the dead
interns had been determined because the prisoners barred the
entrance to the coroners who were called to pick up the bodies and
start the pertinent procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Mata Grande prison holds 1,200 interns but has room only
for 700, causing the start of protest demonstrations of the
prisoners.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agrees to Nicaragua-Appointed Military Attache </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Department of State has
authorized Nicaragua to present a request of placet about the
appointment of a military attache to the Nicaraguan embassy in
Washington, said Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Eduardo Montealegre
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Montealegre described the U.S. decision as "the first step to
normalize the relations" between the armies of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army broke relations with the Nicaraguan army in the
eighties, when the Sandinista Front for National Liberation was
governing that Central American country.
</P>
<P>
The process for the resumption of bilateral relations between
Nicaragua and the United States started two years ago with the
exchange of information between the civilian authorities of the
two countries for the fight against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Jose Antonio Alvarado and the present
commander of the army Javier Carrion visited last week the U.S.
Army Southern Command at the invitation of the U.S Department of
Defense to analyze strategies in the war against drugs.

BOGOTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The National Liberation Army (ELN)
guerrilla of Colombia Saturday announced the release in the next
hours of two 14-year-old girls it had kidnapped some days ago.

country.

soon and that Kenya's image had been enhanced by his recent visit
to the United States.

that Kenyans continue living as a united people once he leaves
office.
</P>

which can uplift the welfare of Kenyans instead of spending too
much time discussing the presidential succession.
