<HEADLINE> 1 Dies in San Francisco Bank Heist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A shootout at a Bank of American branch  
Friday evening left a suspect dead and two police officers and a 
customer wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was shot in the head after a gunbattle with pursuing  
officers, police spokesman Sherman Ackerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were hospitalized in fair condition and the  
customer was in neurosurgery in critical condition with a gunshot 
wound to the head, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attempted robbery during rush hour was in the heart of the  
city's financial district. 
</P>
<P>
	Two suspects, one armed with a gun, came into the bank and  
ordered everyone onto the floor. The customer was shot trying to 
subdue one of the suspects, Ackerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	An employee managed to hit the alarm, and one of the suspects  
shot at two officers about a block away from the bank, Ackerson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bike messenger Jason Hopson said he saw the suspect briskly  
walking down busy Market Street, taking off his mask. When the 
suspect turned the corner, ``there was an eruption of gunfire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was chaos,'' he said. ``Dozens of people were running.''  
</P>
<P>
	Nick Queja, who works at a parking garage nearby, said the  
suspect crouched by a car and fired at officers until he was shot 
and killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were still searching for the second suspect.

<HEADLINE> Man Nabbed in $5 Million Art Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frank DiSanto told police that he took five  
antique silk prints from a Kennedy Airport lounge because he 
thought they were being tossed out with the trash. 
</P>
<P>
	But detectives didn't buy the 24-year-old Brooklyn man's story,  
and accused him Friday of stealing the prints -- which once hung in 
the Sistine Chapel in Italy and are valued at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly this was a crime of opportunity, motivated by greed,''  
said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives zeroed in on DiSanto, who works as a baggage handler,  
in part because he left behind a dental appointment card -- with his 
name on it, said Port Authority Det. Lt. Bobby Caron. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started talking to him, he knew right way and gave it right  
up,'' Caron said. 
</P>
<P>
	After questioning DiSanto, police found the tapestries -- which  
date back to the 7th century -- stuffed in a garbage bag in his 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	They had been on display at Alitalia's first-class lounge, but  
were taken down because the airline is moving to another part of 
the terminal. DiSanto allegedly took the prints on Wednesday, 
though airline officials didn't realize it until a day later. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSanto was charged with grand larceny, criminal possession of  
stolen property and criminal mischief. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted he only wanted to look at them, not sell them.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said he appreciates art and was just going to hang them in  
his bedroom to look at them,'' Caron said. ``There's no way he knew 
they were worth $1 million each.''

<HEADLINE> LPGA Considers Hall of Fame Changes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- For all that Beth Daniel that has  
accomplished in her 20 years on the LPGA Tour, she can't escape the 
one question that follows her like a shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	Do you think you'll make it to the Hall of Fame?  
</P>
<P>
	That's what reporters ask her whenever she's in contention in a  
tournament, knowing that she needs only three more victories or one 
more major championship. That's what she faces from members at her 
home club, knowing how much it would mean to her. 
</P>
<P>
	One vote could change everything.  
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA Tour is in the midst of a vote that could change the  
requirements for election to its Hall of Fame, one of the toughest 
shrines in sports to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought for a while that we've needed to change our  
criteria,'' Daniel said Thursday. ``I think this is a step in the 
right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed criteria are based on points. If they are approved,  
Daniel would have no problem getting in with her 32 victories, one 
major championship, three-time player of the year awards and three 
Vare trophies for lowest scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither would Amy Alcott, who counts five majors among her 29  
victories, but has been one win short of the Hall since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Even former players like Judy Rankin and Donna Caponi would have  
a chance through the veterans' committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA has been discussing changes since 1985. A committee  
that has worked on the proposal for the past six years came up with 
the new criteria on Tuesday, and ballots from all LPGA members are 
due Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	JoAnne Carner said she and the other 13 members of the LPGA Hall  
of Fame support the new criteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to retain the integrity of the Hall of Fame and not  
make it any easier to get in, but instead make it attainable by 
each era's best golfers,'' Carner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player to qualify for the hall was Betsy King in 1995  
when she got her 30th career victory. Under the previous standards, 
there was some concern she might be the last. 
</P>
<P>
	Players had to have 30 victories and two major championships, 35  
victories and one major or 40 victories and no majors 
</P>
<P>
	``For a player who starts her career in 1999, or even 1990, it  
would have been so difficult to get into the hall,'' Daniel said. 
``What it comes down to is, do you want your Hall of Fame to 
represent a few, absolutely outstanding individuals? Or a Hall of 
Fame that represents players who stood out in their era?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new criteria would require 27 points:  
</P>
<P>
	-- 1 point for each LPGA tournament victory.  
</P>
<P>
	-- 2 points for each major.  
</P>
<P>
	-- 1 point for each Vare Trophy, awarded to the player with  
lowest scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1 point for each player of the year award.  
</P>
<P>
	Alcott would have 35 points under that system and Daniel would  
have 39. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee has done an excellent job in retooling the  
criteria, yet retaining the integrity of objective selection and 
making sure that those players that dominated their era and made an 
impact are recognized,'' LPGA commissioner Jim Ritts said. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the old system, players must have kept LPGA membership  
for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Annika Sorenstam is in her sixth year on the LPGA, although she  
already has won 16 times along with consecutive U.S. Opens. 
Sorenstam would have 24 points, and could have enough points for 
the hall with another solid year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started, I knew the Hall of Fame was way up here,'' she  
said, holding her hands high above her head. ``I thought I probably 
would never do it. But then they came out with this, and I started 
thinking that I have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little surprised,'' she said. ``They lowered it much  
more than I thought they would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel has tried to steer clear of players this week at the  
HealthSouth Inaugural, not wanting anyone to ask the opinion of 
someone whom the change would benefit the most. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say getting in has been a goal of mine,'' Daniel said.  
``My goal is to win golf tournaments, and if I do that then the 
Hall of Fame will take care of itself. The problem is, not a day 
has passed in the last five years that somebody hasn't mentioned 
it. It's a hot topic, and I'm tired of the questions.''

<HEADLINE> Son Sues Father, University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The son of former University of Michigan football  
coach Bo Schembechler is suing his father and the school, saying 
they tried to thwart his plan to make souvenirs of old stadium 
bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Schembechler's federal lawsuit alleges breach of  
contract and defamation in his bids to raise money for a foundation 
in his late mother's name. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks at least $500,000 damages for lost business  
opportunities and requests an injunction to prevent the university, 
in Ann Arbor, from allowing anyone else to remove old seats from 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials said they had not seen the suit and  
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bo Schembechler, who retired in 1989, said he was aware his son  
had run-ins with the school but knew no specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you kidding me? I have no knowledge of what he's trying to  
do here,'' he said in today's Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Schembechler, 39, claims the university awarded him a  
contract to remove old bleachers from Michigan Stadium. He has 
taken about 34,000 of the seats and made them into souvenirs, 
including coat racks and tables. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds go to MLS Co., a company he created in 1993 in part to  
help endow an adrenal cancer research center at Michigan in memory 
of his mother, Millie, who died of the disease in 1992. Matthew is 
her son by a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	He claims the university suddenly began demanding royalties,  
then refused to let him sell souvenirs on university property and 
tried to drive him off private property near the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was hospitalized for stress in 1996 and forced to  
suspend MLS' operations.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Develop Viagra Spray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Can't wait an hour for that kick from  
Viagra? 
</P>
<P>
	Two researchers from the University of Kentucky say they've come  
up with a nasal spray that could cut the time it takes for Viagra 
to work to five to 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel because of the nature of Viagra's use that people  
don't want to wait an hour for results,'' said Lewis Dittert, one 
of the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The impotency treatment pill debuted spectacularly last year,  
leading to millions of prescriptions and almost as many jokes. 
Sales have leveled off. 
</P>
<P>
	When used correctly, Viagra is extremely effective, allowing men  
to achieve an erection 60 to 70 percent of the time within an hour 
of taking the blue pills that sell for about $10 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert and his UK College of Pharmacy colleague, Anwar Hussein,  
say the nasal spray brings Viagra in contact with mucous membranes, 
getting the active ingredient, sildenafil, into the bloodstream 
more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The pill must reach the small intestines before it can be  
absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the researchers say, they haven't been able to generate  
any interest from the drug's manufacturer, Pfizer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, `We're looking at it, we'll call you,''' Dittert  
said. ``We're not trying to horn in on their patent. We just think 
we've got a better mousetrap, and we think they ought to be 
interested in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer spokeswoman Mariann Caprino said the company is ``always  
interested in advancing our medicines ... in a way that makes the 
medicine more patient-friendly. We certainly don't want to rule out 
any advance.''

<HEADLINE> Division Expected Over Petr Korda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Petr Korda will cause division when  
he appears at an ATP Tour players meeting in Melbourne on Saturday, 
players spokesman Todd Martin tipped Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda's positive drug test to a steroid and his escape from a  
suspension has created major waves in the usually serene coterie of 
professional tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's best players will gather for a meeting Saturday with  
Korda's drug case the center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, the ATP players council president, said he did not  
expect a unified statement from the players on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to get 200 guys giving him a unanimous vote  
of confidence,'' said Martin, who may miss the meeting because he's 
in the final of the Adidas International in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda refused to talk about the issue Friday after his match at  
the Colonial Classic in Melbourne. But after saying he had nothing 
to hide from earlier this week, it would be surprising if he 
doesn't address the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda, who will defend his Australian Open title beginning  
Monday, has argued he rightly escaped a ban because of 
``exceptional circumstances'' in his positive test to steroid 
Nandrolone at Wimbledon in July. He has yet to outline those 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Former French Open champion Michael Chang said the meeting  
should help clear up players' confusion on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully the rules are going to be clarified a lot more, and  
we'll walk out of there knowing what's going to happen if players 
are caught with a banned substance,'' said Chang Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe also we'll be able to get a few more answers on what  
actually happened and the whole situation concerning the 
'exceptional circumstances.' It's been a little bit vague, and the 
players are entitled to have those answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's tough for Petr because not only does he have to  
deal with this, but he's got to defend his title. By no means is it 
easy for him and his family, but this is something the players want 
to get squared away. We compete on a professional level and we want 
all aspects both on an off court to be treated professionally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British No.1 Tim Henman is also keen to see the situation  
clarified. 
</P>
<P>
	``A situation like this should be very black and white, and  
there's a lot of gray areas,'' Henman said ``Sooner rather than 
later I think someone needs to step forward and clear the situation 
up. There needs to be a decision one way or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda lodged a legal challenge Thursday to the International  
Tennis Federation's planned appeal against the leniency of his 
penalty for testing positive to steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda's lawyers have begun proceedings in the High Court in  
England in a bid to stop the ITF appealing its independent panel's 
decision not to impose a one-year ban on him in the Court of 
Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Set for Second Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson might have lost more against Evander  
Holyfield than a heavyweight title and a temporary ban from boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Francois Botha will find out Saturday night just how much.  
</P>
<P>
	Tyson begins his second comeback from an enforced layoff when he  
returns to meet Botha in a scheduled 10-round fight. This time, 
though, it begins with a fighter more eager to trade punches with 
him than when he fought Peter McNeeley after Tyson's release from 
prison in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bully mystique was shattered in the two fights with  
Holyfield,'' said Tyson's new trainer, Tommy Brooks. ``He has to 
fight now. Guys aren't going to lay down any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The old, invincible Mike Tyson disappeared about the time he bit  
Holyfield's ears, leaving Tyson without one of the major weapons he 
used to bring into a fight -- his ability to intimidate his 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, fighters like Botha can go into the ring knowing there is a  
way to beat Tyson. Actually doing it, though, is a different 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if my best is over yet,'' Tyson said. ``I was in  
a drought for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is a 6-1 favorite to beat Botha in his first fight in 19  
months and his first since he bit a chunk out of Holyfield's ears 
in his second straight loss to the reigning WBA and IBF heavyweight 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha has also not fought in 19 months, but his only loss was to  
former champion Michael Moorer. He is certainly a step up from 
McNeeley in the quality of opponent for Tyson's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be intimidated,'' said Botha, a South African now  
living in California. ``I won't be intimidated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will make some $10 million for the fight, which is  
available on pay-per-view for about $45, but isn't expected to draw 
more than about 10,000 fans willing to pay at least $200 a seat at 
the MGM Grand hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who weighed a career-high 223 pounds Thursday, is 45-3,  
but two of his losses have come in his last two fights. Botha, 233, 
is 39-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been training hard. I'm 32 years old, I've been putting  
on weight,'' said Tyson, whose previous top weight was 222 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is the first of a scheduled series of four fights this  
year that Tyson and his handlers hope will end in a third fight 
against Holyfield sometime in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kills me to think someone could get the better of me,''  
Tyson said of the Holyfield fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada boxing officials say they will take no extra precautions  
for the fight in the same ring where Tyson bit Holyfield in the 
third round of their June 28, 1997, fight, prompting a wild melee 
to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson won his boxing license back by promising never to snap  
again, and a team of psychiatrists from Massachusetts General 
Hospital who examined him for five days said there was little 
likelihood such an incident would occur again. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, efforts to promote Tyson as a changed individual fell  
flat in the days leading up to the fight when he went into an 
obscenity-laden tirade to a New York City television reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Mike and Mike is going to be Mike,'' Tyson said. ``You can  
be crass. You can be obnoxious. That's who I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who split with promoter Don King following his ban from  
boxing, needs a quick series of paydays to pay off a $13 million 
IRS debt and restore his finances. His earlier comeback earned him 
some $100 million, but King and his handlers got a good chunk of it 
and Tyson blew the rest in spending sprees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get screwed, that's the history of our business,'' Tyson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson begins his comeback still facing the possibility of jail  
time when he is sentenced next month on a no-contest plea to 
misdemeanor assault charges stemming from his assault of two men 
following a fender-bender in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	He also could face revocation of his Indiana probation, which is  
still in effect from his rape conviction. Those close to Tyson, 
though, believe he will escape any jail or prison time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready for anything. If you're going to send me to jail,  
send me to jail,'' Tyson said. ``I've done that already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Tyson faces the pressure of having to win to keep a  
comeback plan that could earn him another $100 million or so, Botha 
goes into the bout knowing it is his one big chance at stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Botha briefly held the IBF version of the  
heavyweight title before it was stripped from him for testing 
positive for steroids following his fight with Germany's Axel 
Schulz. He got another shot at the title, but was stopped by Moorer 
in the 12th round of a punishing fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a sore loser and I've got a great chin,'' said Botha, who  
will earn $1.8 million. ``I still think Tyson is the best 
heavyweight out there. It's just a great opportunity for me to be 
where I want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight tops a card that includes Roberto Garcia's defense of  
his IBF junior lightweight title against former champion John 
Molina. The telecast will begin at 9 p.m. EST, with the Tyson-Botha 
match expected to start no later than 11:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Grains Mixed; Soybeans Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices were mixed and soybean  
futures prices were lower in early trading today on the Chicago 
Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were higher on news that a large percentage  
of China's wheat crop may have been adversely affected by drought. 
There is also talk in the market that China is attempting to buy 
about 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	But corn futures prices were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices fell as the market continues to react to  
financial instability in Brazil. The devaluation of Brazil's 
currency has made soybeans cheaper. Giving some support to the 
market are reports of dryness in portions of southern Brazil and 
Argentina where competing crops are grown. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, wheat for March delivery was 1 cent higher at  
$2.77 1/2 a bushel; March corn was a 1/4 cent higher at $2.15 3/4 a bushel; 
March oats were 3/4 cent higher at $1.07 1/4 a bushel; January soybeans 
were 3/4 cent lower at $5.31 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and hog futures prices were higher in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were 1.03 cent higher at 63.35 cents a  
pound; January feeder cattle were .85 cent higher at 74 cents a 
pound; February lean hogs were .43 cent higher at 41.10 cents a 
pound; February pork bellies were .13 cent higher at 55 cents a 
pound.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Some police officers, upset with Chief  
Bernard Parks' management style, have asked Parks to stay away from 
their funeral if they are killed in the line of duty.

	``Chief Parks has no official comment,'' said Officer Isabel

dignify the claim at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least three of the 9,700 Los Angeles Police Department  
officers have submitted written requests to be on record in their 
files barring Parks, a strict disciplinarian, from their funerals 
should they die on the job. One officer also put it in her will. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Nicholas Wade, a watch commander in the 77th division, said  
he didn't know of any officers who felt that way about the chief 
and declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	But one 77th division officer, Lisa Golt, doesn't want anyone  
she doesn't respect at her funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm willing to give my life for my city, but I don't want him  
at my funeral,'' Golt said Friday. ``Apparently other officers feel 
the same way. I would say close to 100 officers have filed these 
forms. My phone is ringing off the hook, asking for where the form 
is for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Golt, a 10-year veteran was recently suspended for making false  
and misleading statements. She said the charges were added after 
she denied that she hit another car during a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chief has a history of being power hungry,'' said Victor  
Ramos, who left the LAPD to work for the San Bernardino Police 
Department in 1997 ``because the disciplinary system is 
ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Police Chief David Gascon said the whole situation was  
``a cheap and orchestrated campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sacred trust to be a leader of this organization, to be  
a supervisor or manager and to care about your people, all of your 
people. To think that we would drag out deaths and serious injuries 
and make it a political issue I think is just outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Hepburn, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective  
League, which represents most of the department, said the union is 
not involved and is not taking a position on the protest. But he 
said he understood what was behind it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not surprised because we talk to the officers all the  
time and we're well aware of the low morale in the department, and 
the negative feelings toward the chief and the lack of the support 
the rank and file feel from the chief of police,'' Hepburn said at 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	An unprecedented 54 officers were fired last year and seven  
resigned instead of being terminated, department statistics show. 
And 5,500 complaints have been filed against officers this year, 
more than any time in the department's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Discipline and increased accountability of the chief to civilian  
overseers were among principal recommendations of the Christopher 
Commission, the independent panel that conducted an extensive 
examination of the department after the Rodney King beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks was named chief in August of 1997. He has been with the  
LAPD since 1965.

<HEADLINE> 7M in Calif. Lack Medical Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Like many Californians without health  
insurance, taxi driver Walter Morgan worries how he'll pay for 
medical care should he ever get seriously sick. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of drivers who've had cancer and we put out  
money jars at work to help them,'' Morgan said as he waited for a 
fare in downtown San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released today shows Morgan is not alone. Nearly a  
quarter of all Californians -- more than 7 million people -- lack 
health insurance, including many people who make too much to 
qualify for Medi-Cal, the state's insurance program for low-income 
residents, but can't afford private medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many people, there's nowhere to turn,'' said Helen  
Schauffler, an associate professor of health policy at the 
University of California, Berkeley. ``Nothing's looking better and 
many things are looking worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report was developed by the Health Insurance Policy Program,  
a joint effort of the Berkeley School of Public Health and the UCLA 
Center for Health Policy Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that 24 percent of the state's population lacked  
coverage in 1997 -- some 500,000 more people than the total a year 
earlier. Nationally, 18 percent lack health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who can afford it, private health insurance plans are  
about $150 a month or $340 for families, Ms. Schauffler said. 
Pre-existing health conditions can cause those premiums to 
skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the increase in the number of uninsured people  
in the nation's most populous state is creating serious health 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	It cites a poll that shows only 34 percent of uninsured women  
have had a mammogram in the past two years, compared with 85 
percent of insured women. And 31 percent of those surveyed said 
they did not seek medical care when they needed it because of the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the number of uninsured are growing, somebody's got to get  
these people access to basic services,'' Ms. Schauffler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found that HMOs are increasingly dropping health  
promotion programs dealing with substance abuse, AIDS prevention 
and sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommends that the state expand programs to cover  
more of the uninsured, improve the state's managed-care system and 
reform Medi-Cal.

<HEADLINE> Marine Pilot Has One Charge Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A judge on Friday dismissed negligent  
homicide charges against a Marine pilot in the Italian ski gondola 
tragedy that killed 20 people -- but the aviator still faces more 
serious charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif.,  
will be court-martialed next month on the graver charges of 
involuntary manslaughter, as well as several lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors' decision to seek dismissal of the negligent  
homicide charges was viewed as a strategic move -- possibly aimed at 
forcing jurors to convict Ashby on more serious charges at his 
court-martial next month. The judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, 
granted the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors indicated they wished to streamline their case  
against Ashby, who piloted the EA-6B Prowler when the radar-jamming 
jet clipped the gondola cable in the Italian Alps while on a 
training flight. They did not give specifics at Friday's motion 
hearing. Their written motion was not made available to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of the  
20 involuntary manslaughter counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunley also strongly suggested Friday the government may not  
have enough evidence to convict the plane's navigator of the most 
serious charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues were discussed during the fifth day of a week-long  
motions hearing that is helping lay the groundwork for next month's 
courts-martial of the two aviators. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, and Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y.,  
the navigator, face courts-martial proceedings next month for the 
tragedy last Feb. 3. Prosecutors claim their jet was flying too low 
and too fast. Jury selection in Ashby's case begins Feb. 4, and for 
Schweitzer, on Feb. 22.

<HEADLINE> Army Clears Criminal Investigators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Allegations of racial bias against the Army's  
criminal investigators in two recent cases ``were without merit,'' 
the service reported Friday, following a seven-month investigation 
by its inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations were raised during the Army Criminal  
Investigative Command's study of sexual misconduct at Aberdeen 
Proving Ground, Md., in 1997, and the Army's court-martial of the 
former Sergeant Major of the Army Gene McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
	In its statement, the Army said:  
</P>
<P>
	``After a rigorous investigation, the Inspector General found  
that neither investigation was racially motivated. ... The Army 
Criminal Investigation Command investigators vigorously 
investigated the sexual misconduct allegations in an attempt to 
find the truth. In those isolated instances where standard 
investigative procedures were not followed, appropriate corrective 
action has or will be taken,'' an Army statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the Aberdeen scandal, the NAACP held a news  
conference where five women Army recruits said that military 
investigators tried to pressure them into making false claims that 
they had been raped by their superiors at Aberdeen. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's attorney also argued at one point that if his client  
were white and an officer, he would have been quietly retired 
rather than face a court martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, McKinney was acquitted of sexual misconduct, but  
found guilty of one count of obstruction of justice and demoted one 
rank to master sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigations at Aberdeen, about 40 miles north of  
Baltimore, resulted in charges against 12 black drill instructors 
accused of forcing female subordinates to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
	One instructor was cleared, and the remaining 11 were either  
convicted or resigned rather than face courts-martial.

<HEADLINE> `Doug's 1st Movie' Hits Big Screen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Like ``The Rugrats,'' another popular kids  
cartoon is coming to the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Disney plans to release ``Doug's 1st Movie,'' a  
low-budget feature based on the ``Doug'' series seen on Nickelodeon 
and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug's 1st Movie'' marks a rare departure for Disney from its  
higher-quality animated features that cost more than $100 million 
to produce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug's 1st Movie'' was made by the Disney subsidiary that  
creates the ``Doug'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	In the movie, 12 1/2-year-old Doug Funnie and his best friend  
discover that the mythical monster of Lucky Duck Lake is real. Doug 
is torn between saving the monster and his desire to take his 
secret crush, Patti Mayonnaise, to the school dance.

<HEADLINE> Firm Wants Global Satellite System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Virtual Geosatellite LLC is seeking a license  
from the Federal Communications Commission to build a global 
satellite system to offer high-speed Internet access and other data 
services, the company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming it wins FCC approval, the Washington-based company  
wouldn't offer services directly to the public but would lease its 
facilities to companies that would, Virtual Geosatellite spokesman 
Brian Willard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to begin providing services five years after  
FCC approval. It believes the system would be attractive to people 
living in sparsely populated areas or places with mountainous 
terrain who don't have access to high-speed services from 
conventional networks on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2.6 billion system would consist of 15 satellites in orbit  
closer to the earth than traditional satellites. As a result, the 
system would permit people to receive high-speed data using small, 
18-inch antennas mounted on rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC recently cleared a portion of the public airwaves for  
this type of satellite system. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture is being financed by private investors and venture  
capitalists, Willard said, declining to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is owned by Virtual Geosatellite Holdings Inc. and  
Ellipso Inc.

<HEADLINE> Old Essay Haunts Microsoft Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's first witness at its antitrust  
trial gave ground at the end of his opening week on the stand, 
confronted by government lawyers with an essay he wrote 16 years 
ago that appeared to contradict his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``My immediate reaction is, what could I have been thinking?''  
economist Richard Schmalensee said Thursday. ``But I'm happy to 
discuss it. ... It does not provide a good indication of my present 
views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology, testified that Microsoft's high profits are not 
sufficient evidence alone to conclude that the software giant 
wields monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies showed Schmalensee a 1982  
essay in the Harvard Law Review in which he wrote that 
``persistent, excess profits provide a good indication of long-run 
power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft used its influence as the  
maker of the dominant Windows operating system to try to ``crush'' 
rival Netscape Communications Corp., whose popular Internet 
software competes with Microsoft's. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the government's most sensational charges is that  
Microsoft sought illegally to divide the market for Internet 
software during a June 1995 meeting with Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has called the charge ``an  
outrageous lie,'' saying the meeting ``was to discuss various 
technologies Microsoft proposed sharing with Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just before it ended the presentation of its case Wednesday, the  
government released more than 2,000 pages of documents, including 
some e-mail messages about the June 1995 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In one exchange, Microsoft's Dan Rosen told Gates that during  
the meeting Netscape ``seemed OK'' with the company's plans to 
build Internet software features into Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But co-worker Thomas Reardon, who also was at the meeting,  
called Rosen's assessment ``bunk'' and told Gates, ``There was a 
noticeable increase in the level of tension'' on that subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates wrote to another executive praising Reardon for ``reading  
the situation pretty well,'' and he called Rosen's opinions 
``great, but I agree he is being a little naive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another e-mail, Paul Maritz, a senior Microsoft executive,  
wrote five weeks after the meeting confirming that the company had 
intended ``to leverage a relationship with Netscape ... to cede the 
(browser) to us or at least give us some major advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Rosen wrote: ``If no agreement, we should gear up  
to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Maritz and Rosen are expected to testify for Microsoft in  
the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, the government turned its attention again to  
what is happening behind the scenes at the trial, quizzing 
Schmalensee about his conversations outside the courtroom during 
breaks in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange followed a contentious hearing when U.S. District  
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson prohibited Microsoft lawyers -- over 
their objections -- from talking to their own witnesses outside 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said in a private meeting with lawyers late Wednesday  
that he worried about Microsoft ``woodshedding a witness.'' The 
Associated Press obtained transcripts of the meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want witnesses, when they are on cross-examination  
... to be conferring during recesses and overnight adjournments to 
improve the quality of their testimony,'' Jackson said, adding he 
was unclear about such matters ``until my court of appeals told me 
that I was wrong in a criminal case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue could become important when the government next week  
begins questioning some of Microsoft's top executives, who will not 
be able to talk to lawyers until afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue surfaced after Schmalensee acknowledged talking with a  
Microsoft lawyer and later with an economics colleague during 
breaks in the trial and using information they provided in his 
testimony.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Economic Woes Cast Shadow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Brazil's move to shore up its  
economy by devaluing the currency has left economies from Mexico to 
Argentina bracing for aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7.6 percent devaluation came as a sobering reminder that the  
1997 global economic crisis remains a threat, and raised fears the 
region would be dragged into a recession this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts warned that Latin America could again be facing dire  
economic conditions: a drop in currency values, the contraction of 
its economies and jittery investors eager to pull money out of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Brazil sneezes, the rest of Latin America catches a  
cold,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in 
Minneapolis. ``If this gets out of control all of Latin America 
could suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch's chief economist, Bruce Steinberg, said: ``Most  
of Latin America will now fall into recession and there could be 
spillover effects into other markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No country worries more about Brazil's economic ills than its  
southern neighbor, Argentina, one of the world's model emerging 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazil's devaluation has reignited Argentina's concern.  
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil controls whether things go well or bad,'' said  
Argentine economist Mario Vicens. 
</P>
<P>
	As an indication of that link, Argentine stocks tumbled 10  
percent Wednesday following the announcement that the Brazilian 
real was devalued. Stocks continued to falter Thursday, closing 
down 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries' economies are intertwined through the  
Mercosur trading bloc, which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay. 
Nearly 30 percent of Argentine exports go its giant northern 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	American cars made in Argentina are sent to Brazil. Many of the  
dairy products coming from the vast Argentine Pampas go north to 
Brazil. So do oil products. 
</P>
<P>
	A continued drop in Brazil's currency would make those products  
more expensive. And another plunge in the Brazilian real would 
increase Argentina's deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentine President Carlos Menem insisted the Brazilian crisis  
would not force a devaluation of the Argentine peso, now pegged to 
the dollar in a move considered key to the country's remarkable 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Although other Latin American countries are not as closely  
linked to Brazil, the consequences of persisting economic woes 
there have many worried, particularly the smaller economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru has already slipped into a recession, and should the  
troubles in Brazil draw out, it would exacerbate an already severe 
debt crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are anxiously waiting to see how the exchange rate will  
react. Who doesn't owe money in dollars here?'' said Peruvian 
journalist Igancio Brasombrio. 
</P>
<P>
	A continued devaluation of Brazil's currency would threaten the  
stability of Venezuela's money, the bolivar, which many analysts 
already believe is overvalued and in need of adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mexico, considered the most stable of the Latin American  
economies because of its close U.S. trade tries, would not emerge 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	Should foreign investors continue to withdraw their money from  
Brazil, it would also dampen Mexico's economic health. Many 
investors hold Brazilian and Mexican stocks in the same portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the concern of a burgeoning crisis, officials throughout  
South America rushed Thursday to calm rising fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Massad, Chile's Central Bank president, said his country  
was prepared if the crisis requires more belt-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our economy is a position of great strength and we are in  
excellent position to face any effects of the Brazilian crisis,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Mexico Governor Guillermo Ortiz was equally optimistic,  
telling a local radio station he hopes Brazil's troubles don't last 
to avoid ``a major impact.''

<HEADLINE> Howard Stern Stalker Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A stalker who referred to shock-jock Howard  
Stern as ``Dead Man Walking'' in letters threatening the radio 
personality's life has been sentenced to two and a half years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence from U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan was nearly  
twice as much as federal sentencing guidelines called for in a case 
that began when Michael Lance Carvin sent four letters to Stern 
last spring from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this sentence is to deter this defendant and  
others from engaging in this type of conduct,'' Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carvin, 44, who was convicted in 1976 of threatening the life of  
the president for pointing a toy gun at then-candidate Ronald 
Reagan, threatened Stern and his family in the letters, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will absolutely, without a doubt, kill you and this is 100  
percent guaranteed,'' Carvin said in one letter. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Keenan prior to sentencing Wednesday, Stern  
lawyer Joseph Famighetti said Carvin had waged a campaign of terror 
against Stern and his family.

<HEADLINE> Vikes' Coach Nears Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Dennis Green is one win away from  
becoming the first black coach to lead his team into the Super 
Bowl. He already is the first to make it to the NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither subject was an issue this week as the Minnesota Vikings  
prepared for Sunday's game against the Atlanta Falcons, and Green 
saw that as progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, because what everybody is talking about is the  
team, and that's the way it should be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking barriers is nothing new for Green. He was the first  
black coach in the Big Ten when Northwestern hired him in 1981, and 
he was only the second black coach in modern NFL history when the 
Vikings hired him in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I just try to stand for is somebody who's always tried to  
do a good job,'' Green said. ``A lot of people write, a lot of 
people call and talk about the significance of (being the first 
black coach in the Super Bowl). That's the breakthrough we're going 
through right now. It was a breakthrough when I went into 
Northwestern and I accepted it. I think it's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green's tenure hasn't always been smooth, but it has been  
successful. He has made the playoffs every season except 1995, and 
this season went 15-1 to boost his regular-season winning 
percentage to .634, surpassing Bud Grant for the best in team 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has a chance to bring the Vikings their first conference  
title since the 1976 season and the first Super Bowl championship 
in their 38-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his job security was an issue as recently as August, a  
mixture of the team's postseason failures (1-5 under Green before 
this season), off-field turmoil that included allegations of sexual 
harassment in 1995 and what Green often has described as an 
undertone of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	This season's success has allowed him to rise above the rancor  
that had started to define his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they look at Denny Green as a coach now, as being able  
to make his players perform at the highest level,'' defensive end 
Derrick Alexander said. ``In the past, I don't think they've looked 
at him that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's been judged as a black head coach because, he's  
been to the playoffs every year but one since he's been here but 
his job's in jeopardy. ... I think because of his skin color he was 
under that microscope even more his first couple years. But I'm 
glad he's fought his way through it to put himself in this 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green has endured the tough times to become the NFL's  
longest-tenured head coach with the same team, edging Pittsburgh's 
Bill Cowher by 11 days for that distinction following Marty 
Schottenheimer's resignation at Kansas City this week. 
</P>
<P>
	He got a three-year contract extension from new owner Red  
McCombs on the eve of the season-opener against Tampa Bay late last 
summer, and his wife, Marie, gave birth to their second child in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Green finally seems to have found peace in Minnesota. He has  
become a leading advocate in trying to help other black coaches 
break through the same barrier he did seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	There currently are three black coaches in the league, all in  
the NFC Central: Green, Ray Rhodes at Green Bay and Tony Dungy at 
Tampa Bay. Green sees progress in Green Bay's decision to hire 
Rhodes to replace Mike Holmgren, along with the handful of black 
assistants still being considered for top jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``And with Ray hiring Emmitt Thomas (as Green Bay's defensive  
coordinator), I think those are both great signs for the future,'' 
Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Vikings beat Atlanta Sunday -- they are favored by 11  
points -- Randall Cunningham also will become only the second black 
quarterback to start in the Super Bowl. Doug Williams was the MVP 
of Washington's championship victory after the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
	A chance to be there if Green becomes the first black coach in  
the Super Bowl would be a proud moment for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a situation when we are going into the next millennium and  
I'm on a team with an African-American head coach, it's a testament 
to how far we've come,'' cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock said. ``I think 
it'll make it a lot easier for African-American head coaches to get 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like people say: the guys who the owners saw winning  
Super Bowls in those days when they were kids were white. We have a 
situation where the young kids of today will see an 
African-American head coach go to the Super Bowl, so that's going 
to be huge.''

<HEADLINE> Jets' Glenn Unlikely To Play Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The last thing the underdog New York Jets need is  
a key injury. They've got one: Pro Bowl cornerback Aaron Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Parcells said Friday upon his team's arrival in  
Denver that Glenn, while listed as questionable with an ankle 
injury, ``doesn't look like he will play'' in Sunday's AFC 
Championship game. Glenn aggravated the ankle during practice this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't cancel him out at this moment,'' Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Jets are outsized at cornerback and in the secondary in  
general against Denver's tall receivers, Ed McCaffrey, Shannon 
Sharpe and Rod Smith. They need to make up for that with technique, 
particularly in man coverage, where Glenn excels. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells downplayed Glenn's potential absense, noting that since  
the second half on Dec. 6, they haven't had Glenn available for 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played a lot the last 5-6 weeks without him,'' the coach  
said. ``He had a limited role last week. We'll keep doing with the 
players who are in there what we've been doing without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn's replacement, Ray Mickens, has played very well since  
Glenn was hurt against. Seattle. Mickens, who usually plays as the 
nickel back and guards the slot receiver, was solid as a starter on 
the corner versus Miami, Buffalo, New England and in last Sunday's 
playoff victory over Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to make a name for myself,'' Mickens said, ``and this  
is a big game that if you make big plays, you can make a name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn, who made the Pro Bowl for the second straight year and  
led the Jets with six interceptions, was hurt making his last 
pickoff of the season. He had been beaten for two long touchdowns 
by Joey Galloway in the first quarter. He leaped to grab Jon 
Kitna's bomb for Galloway and was hurt when he landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Glenn admitted the right ankle will hurt him  
until next season, but was hopeful of playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it was too serious, but he was not getting  
around too well,'' Parcells said of Glenn, who played almost 
exclusively in nickel situations last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's other starting cornerback, Otis Smith, had a good  
season, but he struggled against Jacksonville, allowing two 
touchdowns. Parcells said Smith was directly responsible for one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	If Glenn can't go, the Jets might use rookie Kevin Williams, a  
converted safety, and veteran Marcus Coleman at cornerback behind 
Smith and Mickens.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phone Jams Thousands of Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRYSTAL RIVER, Fla. (AP) -- When the mysterious white car with  
tinted windows and a small satellite dish on top pulled up to 
Calvin Simpson's motor home, the retired engineer was puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, ``What are those guys doing?' Then they came up to  
me, and I said, ``Uh-oh.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The men, engineers for GTE Wireless, had found their culprit.  
For 10 days, Simpson's cellular phone had been jamming cellular 
service for tens of thousands of customers in Florida's Citrus and 
Hernando counties. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE Wireless customers in the region began reporting trouble  
with their phones on Jan. 4 -- the same day Simpson, 74, brought his 
motor home to the Crystal Isle RV Resort for the winter from his 
home in South Portland, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers still aren't sure what caused the problem, but they  
think Simpson's phone was constantly transmitting signals to a 
``set-up channel'' on a cellular phone tower behind Crystal River's 
City Hall. The channel is supposed to take signals and relay them 
to their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson's phone, however, sent signals to the channel even when  
he wasn't trying to make a call. Whenever his phone was on, the 
constant signal prevented any cellular phone user from making a 
call via that tower. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE Wireless spent days in Crystal River trying to figure out  
what was causing the outage before tracking the faulty signal to 
Simpson's cellular phone. They used the same technology cellular 
phone companies use to track stolen cell phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they found Simpson on Wednesday, they simply asked him to  
turn off his cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Like magic, GTE Wireless was back in service in Crystal River.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I pulled the plug, they had a big sigh of relief,''  
Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineers who tracked him down got Simpson a new cell phone.  
The company plans to take Simpson's old, faulty phone apart in 
hopes of finding out exactly what it was that went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for GTE wouldn't specify how many cell-phone  
customers the company has, but estimated that tens of thousands may 
have been affected.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Owner Heads to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos  
was to lead a delegation of baseball and church officials to Cuba 
today to discuss an exhibition series against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos hoped to arrange a game in Cuba and one in Baltimore,  
with the proceeds possibly going to the Catholic Relief Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos was to be joined by his son Louis, team counsel Russell  
Smouse, consultant Scott Armstrong, four representatives of Major 
League Baseball, including a representative of the players 
association, and a representative of Catholic Relief Services, team 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Garofalo, director of Catholic Relief Service's efforts in  
Cuba, told The Associated Press that the delegation hoped to 
negotiate details about holding the games, such as which field and 
even what type of bats to use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they want to negotiate some of the logistics of the  
game,'' Garofalo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos did not immediately return phone calls about the trip,  
which Garofalo said could last a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The series was first proposed in 1996, but the State Department  
rejected the proposal because of a longstanding ban on trade with 
Cuba. The idea was renewed last week when the Clinton 
administration announced new measures to aid the Cuban people, 
including permission for the Orioles to play in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Orioles play in Cuba, they would become the first major  
league team to play on the island since the Brooklyn Dodgers held 
spring training in Havana in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker of Cuba's parliament hinted last weekend that the  
Cuban government would allow a game, saying negotiations should 
address what types of bats -- wood or aluminum -- would be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials, however, are leery of sending a team of the  
country's best baseball players to the United States because of the 
possibility of defections. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two times the Cuban national team played in the United  
States, a player defected and signed with a major league club. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of such a series has not been warmly received by  
some Cuban players in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Marlins pitcher Livan Hernandez, who defected from Cuba,  
said earlier this week that he wants no part of any plan to play 
major league exhibition games in Cuba. Hernandez' half-brother, 
Orlando Hernandez, also defected from Cuba and now pitches for the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Orioles first baseman Rafael Palmeiro said last week that  
there is too much animosity between his family and Fidel Castro to 
return to Cuba, even for one game.

<HEADLINE> Moceanu Returns to Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Freed by court order from the influence of  
her father, Dominique Moceanu is returning to gymnastics, is about 
to start classes in community college and says she is happy at 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes that someday her father can accept her decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know deep down he cares and he doesn't understand why, but  
it had to be done,'' Moceanu said in an interview Friday. ``Now 
it's over with, so hopefully bygones will be bygones, and we can 
move into the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old gymnast has emerged from the emotional,  
successful legal fight to gain her independence and will appear at 
an autograph signing session before tonight's Reese's Gymnastics 
Cup. She will not compete because she hasn't trained since October. 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu has switched coaches and will resume training on Monday.  
Anything she accomplishes from now on will mean much more than 
anything she has done so far, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because I'm out on my own, I'm doing it for myself,'' she  
said. ``I'm an adult. Just going out there and doing it by yourself 
is twice as hard, but then you feel a sense of pride because you 
did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, a judge in Houston ordered Moceanu's father,  
Dumitru, not to come within 500 feet of her or have any contact 
with her for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she is living alone in an apartment in Houston and  
plans to begin classes at a junior college next week. Because she 
fell far behind at high school, she plans to get take a high school 
equivalency exam and eventually enroll at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father has called her once, in apparent violation of the  
court order, but has had no other contact with her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He keeps wanting to appeal and do all this stuff and it's just  
wasting everybody's money and time,'' Moceanu said. ``He just needs 
to put it behind him and deal with it and accept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she still talks regularly with her mother, sister and  
other members of her mother's side of the family. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad's side of the family condemns me and blames me but I  
have to deal with that and I have to go on,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She had been living off the $10,000 she earned in last year's  
Goodwill Games but says she is making money again for appearances. 
There is nothing left in the trust fund that was established for 
her by her father, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to start over now and that's fine,'' she said. ``I  
think I've learned early what it's like to fall down and pick 
yourself back up and fall down and pick yourself back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu is 10 inches taller than the 4-foot-4 14-year-old who  
captivated millions during the 1996 Olympics. At 5-foot-2, she is 
taller than Olympic teammates Shannon Miller and Jaycie Phelps, who 
greeted her with hugs and laughter at Friday's pre-meet gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu said she has split with her coach of last year, Luminita  
Miscenco, because Miscenco decided to move to Oklahoma in the wake 
of the tense court battle. Among other things, Moceanu's father is 
accused of attempting to hire a hit man to kill Miscenco and a 
friend of Moceanu's. 
</P>
<P>
	``She felt really pressured in Houston,'' Moceanu said. ``She  
just wanted to leave it behind her for the time being. We have no 
hard feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu will be reunited with Alexander Alexandrov, who was her  
coach in 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu said she never performed better than she did last year  
at the Goodwill Games and the U.S. championships, which makes it 
even harder to deal with the layoff and the need to start again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It tears me up,'' she said. ``I was in the best shape of my  
life. I was starting to get really consistent, and it just kills 
me. But I know I can get there again. I just have to put my heart 
in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She wants to compete in this year's world championships, with  
the ultimate goal of making it to Sydney for the 2000 Olympics, 
perhaps as the last remaining member of the ``Magnificent Seven'' 
that won the team gold in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Kevin Dubrow Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Rocker Kevin DuBrow, who was arrested  
after failing to pay a woman for injuries she suffered at a Quiet 
Riot concert, told a judge he's broke. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBrow, the band's lead singer, was arrested this week for  
failing to pay a $105,000 judgment to a woman who alleged he broke 
her leg at a 1994 concert when he threw another fan on top of her. 
</P>
<P>
	In court Wednesday after DuBrow's release from jail, he said he  
was unaware of the South Carolina woman's lawsuit, and that bad 
investments have left him in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he owes $54,000 to the Internal Revenue Service.  
</P>
<P>
	DuBrow, 43, whose band is best known for 1980s hits ``Let's Get  
Crazy'' and ``Bang Your Head,'' was released after promising to pay 
$1,000 bond in the next two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Angelos Arrives in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- A delegation that included Baltimore Orioles owner  
Peter Angelos arrived Friday night for weekend meetings with 
officials to work out the rules for possible exhibition games in 
Baltimore and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all pleased to be here,'' Angelos said shortly after  
arriving on a private flight from Baltimore. ``We appreciate the 
hospitality of the Cuban government and our own government's 
support of the two games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Private talks with Cuban sports officials were planned for  
Saturday, and the delegation was tentatively scheduled to attend a 
Cuban baseball game on Sunday, authorities here said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the 12-member delegation are Sandy Alderson, executive  
vice president of operations for Major League Baseball, and Tom 
Garofalo, director of charity efforts in Cuba by the 
Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services. 
</P>
<P>
	President Bill Clinton announced he would let the Orioles play a  
Cuban team as part of a plan to increase relations between the 
American and Cuban people while maintaining the three-decade U.S. 
economic embargo against the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would let more Americans send money to Cubans, offer  
direct mail service between the two countries and expand direct 
charter flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos hopes to arrange one game in Cuba and one at Camden  
Yards in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition games, first proposed in 1996, were earlier  
rejected by the State Department because of the trade embargo. No 
major league team has played on the island since the Brooklyn 
Dodgers held spring training in Havana in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the games have Clinton's backing, the State Department  
will require that any proceeds do not benefit the regime of 
president Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	The American preference is that any money go to Catholic  
Services' Cuban counterpart, Caritas. Cuban authorities have said 
they would like to see proceeds benefit victims of Hurricane Mitch, 
which devastated a wide swath of Central America late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Alarcon, the speaker of Cuba's parliament, hinted last  
weekend that the Cuban government would allow a game, saying 
negotiations should address what types of bats -- wood or aluminum -- 
would be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Cubans, including Castro, are avid baseball fans and an  
exhibition game on the island would receive wide public backing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials, however, may be leery of sending the country's  
best baseball players to the United States for a game because of 
the possibility of defections. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two times the Cuban national team played in the United  
States, a player defected and signed with a major league club.

<HEADLINE> Nev. Horse Slay Case Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) -- A Marine accused of taking part in  
the slaughter of 34 wild horses said he saw his two friends shoot 
one horse but doesn't know anything about the other animals killed 
in a canyon just east of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched my two friends kill this horse without doing  
anything about it. Yes, that is wrong. That is what I'm going to 
court for. But we did not kill 34 horses that night,'' Lance Cpl. 
Darien Brock said in a jailhouse interview Thursday with KGTV in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they did go back, maybe they didn't. Maybe there was  
somebody else out there, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested were fellow Marine, Lance Cpl. Scott Brendle, 21,  
and construction worker Anthony Merlino, 20, high school buddies of 
Brock. The two Marines, stationed in California, were home on leave 
when the horses were shot Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men are accused of shooting the wild mustangs that  
roam the hillsides about 5 miles east of the Reno-Sparks area. 
</P>
<P>
	They face the same charges -- grand theft, grand larceny and  
poisoning, maiming or killing another person's animal -- punishable 
by up to 15 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Merlino posted bail and was released from jail Thursday. His  
lawyer said Merlino maintains his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendle, 21, was expected to waive extradition and return to  
Nevada to face charges, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock has indicated he'll fight extradition. Dressed in a Navy  
jail jumpsuit, he did not speak during his arraignment Friday in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ordered held on $65,000 bond. His extradition hearing was  
postponed until Tuesday so a Reno attorney hired by his family can 
travel to San Diego.

<HEADLINE> Former USAC President Binford Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Former USAC president Thomas W. Binford, who  
guided the group during its early years and was the Indianapolis 
500's chief referee for 22 years, has died of a cerebral 
hemorrhage. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Binford was stricken at his downtown Indianapolis office  
Wednesday and taken to Methodist Hospital, where he died Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis native, who was one of the city's leading  
bankers, served as president of the United States Auto Club from 
1957-1969. He also was chief steward of the Indianapolis 500 from 
1974-1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Binford's leadership helped guide our organization through  
its formative years and his insight into our sport will be 
irreplaceable,'' USAC president Johnny Capels said. ``His 
enthusiasm will be sorely missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George praised  
Binford for his contributions to the IMS and the Indy 500. Binford 
was tapped as chief steward after the chaotic, rain-delayed 1973 
race, which was marred by crashes that killed two drivers and 
injured 11 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom Binford has been recognized as one of racing's most highly  
respected leaders for four decades. His unique leadership was 
recognized by my grandfather, Anton Hulman Jr. and the two worked 
closely together in building our type of racing, as we know it 
today,'' George said.

<HEADLINE> Mets Sign Cedeno to One-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On the afternoon six New York Mets filed for  
salary arbitration, outfielder Roger Cedeno avoided the process by 
agreeing to a $487,500, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedeno, 24, was acquired from Los Angeles on Dec. 1 as part of  
the three-way deal involving Todd Hundley that brought pitcher 
Armando Benitez to New York. Cedeno hit .242 with two homers and 17 
RBIs in 240 at-bats last season and made $280,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Filing for arbitration were shortstop Rey Ordonez, infielder  
Edgardo Alfonzo, Benitez and right-handers Jason Isringhausen, 
Hideo Nomo and Turk Wendell. Barring settlements, the Mets will 
exchange figures with the players Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York also agreed to one-year contract with four young  
players on its 40-man roster: infielder Maurice Bruce and 
right-handers Dan Murray, Grant Roberts and Oscar Henriquez. 
</P>
<P>
	Henriquez, who gets a split contract that will pay him $212,500  
in the maors and $60,000 in he minors, was acquired from Florida in 
November for catcher Jorge Fabregas.

	House Prosecutors Urge Witnesses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors prodded senators at  
President Clinton's impeachment trial today to summon Monica 
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and others for testimony and to invite the 
president to appear as well. Common sense says ``it's the president 
who is not telling the truth,'' Rep. Bill McCollum argued, and if 
senators have doubts they should bring the witnesses in to testify. 
``Time and again the president says one thing and they say 
something entirely different,'' said McCollum as Clinton's trial 
convened for a second day of arguments.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices bounced back from four days of  
losses today, as investors cheered Brazil's plan to stop defending 
its troubled currency. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 219.62 
points to close at 9,340.55, making back a good portion of the 353 
points that it lost the past two days. NYSE advancers led decliners 
2,189-858. The Nasdaq ended up 71.42 at 2,348.24.

	Clinton Proposes $1B in Tax Credits  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Offering a billion-dollar bundle of proposed tax  
credits and loan guarantees, President Clinton challenged Wall 
Street today to open its ``vaults of opportunity'' so the nation's 
prosperity can spill over into neglected urban and rural 
communities. Clinton proposed a 25 percent tax credit, at a cost to 
the government of $1 billion, to corporations and investment groups 
that would support small technology companies, shopping centers and 
other business development in targeted urban and rural areas. At an 
economic conference organized by Jesse Jackson today, Clinton told 
business executives his proposals would spur $15 billion in private 
investment.

	ABC's Union Lockout Ends  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC's lockout of 2,400 employees ended today,  
following a union agreement to give the network advance warning of 
any future strikes. Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the National 
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, declared that 
union members would be returning to their jobs at ABC after 11 
weeks on picket lines. Employees will be back on the job within 72 
hours, ABC said. NABET members at the network, who had been without 
a contract since 1997, had been locked out since a one-day strike 
in November. A vote on a new pact is planned.

	Weather Wreaks Havoc in East

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Snow and freezing rain caused deadly highway  
accidents, backing up airline flights and knocking out power to 
nearly half a million people in the East today. Ice forced the 
closing of a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 87 north of Albany, N.Y. 
Slick roads also caused two pileups on interstate ramps near 
Parsippany, N.J. At least six people died in traffic accidents in 
West Virginia and Maryland that were blamed on ice. The three major 
airports serving New York City canceled many early flights. 
Boston's airport had to close temporarily to de-ice runways.

	White House Concedes More to Iraq

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today relaxed its  
curbs on sales of spare parts to Iraq for its petroleum industry. 
The conciliatory move was designed to provide more food and 
medicine to the Iraqi people. State Department spokesman James P. 
Rubin said the United States was ``going to go the extra mile'' for 
the hungry and sick in Iraq ``while ensuring the money generated 
does not go to assist the Iraqi regime.'' He stressed the action 
applied only to spare parts that would help Iraq extract and export 
oil under the U.N. oil-for-food program.

Yugoslav army troops and tanks joined Serbian police in shelling

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The Nets didn't come up with almost  
$100 million to keep Jayson Williams until another NBA team made an 
offer to lure the All-Star center away from New Jersey, his agent 
said today. Williams and the Nets reached a tentative agreement on 
a seven-year deal for the player many consider the best offensive 
rebounder in basketball, Sal DiFazio said. While he would not 
disclose terms of the deal, DiFazio said it is guaranteed on three 
levels, with the first five years reportedly worth $82.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Rick Hendrick Returns to NASCAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, N.C. (AP) -- Already the most successful team in  
Winston Cup racing, Hendrick Motorsports got its leader back 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Hendrick, banished from the sport for a year as part of his  
sentence on a mail-fraud conviction, made a tearful return Friday 
to the team that has won the last four championships on NASCAR's 
premier circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best medicine in the world for me,'' Hendrick, who  
is fighting leukemia, said during a visit to his team's sprawling 
complex in the north Charlotte suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Hendrick's first public appearance since he was sentenced  
Dec. 31, 1997, for his role in the American Honda Motor Co. bribery 
and kickback scandal. Hendrick was fined $250,000 and was ordered 
to stay in his Charlotte home and avoid the car business and his 
race team for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrick, who continues to get chemotherapy treatments, looked  
tired and moved slowly during a news conference held as part of the 
Charlotte Motor Speedway Media Tour. He refused to discuss his 
guilty plea or anything else about the Honda case. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's history. Let's talk about racing,'' said Hendrick, who  
has acknowledged giving hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, 
BMWs and houses to Honda executives, but claims he received nothing 
in return. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the questions during the news conference prompted  
emotional responses from Hendrick, who couldn't contain himself 
during one answer about his medical outlook. His voice began 
breaking and he lowered the microphone he was holding, turned away 
from the several hundred reporters in the room and wiped his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon patted Hendrick on the shoulder and tried to put his  
boss at ease. 
</P>
<P>
	``That helped me in New York,'' Gordon said, referring to his  
tearful acceptance speeches in the 1995 and 1997 Winston Cup awards 
banquets. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrick spent much of his time trying to explain how much he  
missed racing, and his employees made it clear that the feeling was 
mutual. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just awesome having him back,'' said Gordon, who won his  
third Winston Cup title in 1998. ``Our first priority is to go to 
Daytona and get Rick to Victory Lane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been kind of an empty feeling around here the past  
year,'' 1996 series champion Terry Labonte said, ``and we just want 
to do whatever we can to make him feel at home again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrick's younger brother, John, had no prior racing experience  
but took over the day-to-day oversight of Hendrick Motorsports 
during his brother's absence. Now that Rick is back, he will hold 
the title of chief executive office and John will be the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I want to make real clear is he's making all the  
decisions this year,'' John said, ``and I'm real happy about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Hendrick said he plans on being in Florida next month for  
the season-opening Daytona 500 and will attend as many of the 
circuit's 34 races as his health permits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan to go to them all, but I know that's not possible,'' he  
said. ``My old body's tired, but my mind's zooming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrick, 49, said his doctors are hopeful that the chemotherapy  
treatments will soon wipe out the leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I stay with it,'' he said, ``there's a possibility and a  
probability maybe that I could be cured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrick used a racing analogy to describe his prognosis.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've still got maybe 100 more laps of a 500-mile race, so it's  
going to take a little bit more time,'' he said. ``But the good 
news is it's working.''

<HEADLINE> 8 Still in Running for Bears Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Personnel director Mark Hatley has traveled the  
country searching for the Chicago Bears' next coach. Now he's ready 
to present the findings of eight interviews to team president 
Michael McCaskey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a tough decision for Mike,'' Hatley said  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't eliminated any of the eight we've talked to. I'll  
turn it over to Mike today and tomorrow and we'll probably bring in 
three or four or five'' for second interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatley said there could be another candidate from one of the  
teams still in the NFL playoffs but would not identify him. 
</P>
<P>
	He already has interviewed Arizona defensive coordinator Dave  
McGinnis, Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dick Jauron, Buffalo 
offensive coordinator Joe Pendry, Kansas City defensive coordinator 
Gunther Cunningham, Chiefs offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, Green 
Bay offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis, Pittsburgh defensive 
coordinator Jim Haslett and former UCLA coach Terry Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
	Reportedly, Donahue is close to taking a front office job with  
the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both McGinnis and Pendry are former Bears assistants.  
</P>
<P>
	Dave Wannstedt was fired last month following his second  
straight 4-12 season. On Thursday, he became the assistant head 
coach to Jimmy Johnson at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt was a highly respected defensive coordinator at Dallas  
before taking the Bears job, then managed only one playoff 
appearance in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatley said he was impressed with Pendry's ability to make  
offenses better, an area where the Bears have struggled greatly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took a quarterback (Doug Flutie) nobody said could play and  
took them to the playoffs,'' Hatley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatley said there was no timetable for hiring a coach.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Challenges Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton challenged Wall Street today  
to invest in the underserved markets of America and ensure that the 
nation's downtowns share good economic times with impoverished 
inner-city and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the economy is so good, now is the time to build that  
bridge,'' Clinton exhorted business executives meeting on the 106th 
floor of the World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was ever a time when none of us have an excuse, this  
is that time. But the world changes very fast and we have to seize 
the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting a section of his fiscal 2000 budget, Clinton  
outlined a bundle of proposed tax incentives and loan guarantees 
designed to attract venture capital to distressed areas from the 
barrios of Los Angeles to the hamlets of Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
	``As leaders of the companies of on the `Big Board,' as the men  
and women who have helped transform America into the world's 
economic superpower, you must help build the bridge between those 
who work in our gleaming office towers and those who live in their 
shadows,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	With his Senate impeachment trial proceeding back in Washington,  
speaker after speaker at Clinton's appearance at the World Trade 
Center heaped lavish praise on him. Clinton called it ``the sort of 
thing people say for your funeral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're there yet,'' he added with a laugh.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, addressing a State Department conference of world  
leaders studying government reforms, Clinton said his 
administration's theory on the relationship of government to 
private sectors is ``to do less regulation, and instead create 
incentives and frameworks to solve problems and meet national 
goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the unveiling of his new initiative, Clinton chose the  
economic conference organized by Jesse Jackson's Wall Street 
Project, a coalition of executives from top Wall Street firms and 
some of the biggest U.S. companies dedicated to expanding business 
opportunities for minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plans to travel here Thursday night and attend the  
project's gala dinner were stymied by ice and snow on the East 
Coast. He was expected back in Washington tonight to attend a 
Democratic fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal was developed by an administration task  
force that consulted with investment advisers and pioneers in 
community development as well as members of Congress. In some ways 
it mirrored federal efforts to boost struggling economies abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a domestic version of these vehicles,'' Jackson said.  
``Whether it's the Ozarks, East L.A. or Harlem, there must be 
vehicles ... to transport capital to people who need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would seek to stimulate billions of dollars in new  
private capital investments, building a network of private 
investment institutions to funnel credit and technical assistance 
to businesses in these underserved areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The details of the proposal include:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $1 billion tax credit designed to spur $6 billion in new  
equity capital for investment in the targeted markets. The 
administration hopes the 25 percent credit will attract investors, 
who in turn could support small technology companies, inner-city 
shopping centers, manufacturers, retail stores and other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Creation of new private investment partnerships to be known as  
America's Private Investment Companies patterned after the Overseas 
Private Investment Corp. APIC would make equity investments into 
larger businesses that expand or relocate to inner cities or rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--Targeting of the SBA's Small Business Investment Program to  
low- and moderate-income areas. This program provides equity and 
debt financing to small companies that are looking to grow. America 
Online and Staples are two examples of companies that have 
benefited from this program, but the White House says it has been 
of little benefit to inner cities and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Probe of Farm Product Markets Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As concerns grow about consolidation in  
agriculture, farm state Democratic senators have asked Attorney 
General Janet Reno to investigate concentration in livestock and 
farm commodity markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe conditions have reached a point that our producers  
are being denied the opportunity to receive a fair price for their 
products through fair, free and open markets,'' said the letter, 
dated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was signed by Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad of North  
Dakota, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, 
Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, as well as Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Reno did not immediately return calls for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman recently asked the Justice  
Department and the Federal Trade Commission to examine pricing 
problems within the pork industry, where farmers are receiving 
record-low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers have expressed concern about plans by Cargill  
Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's No. 1 grain company, to buy the 
worldwide grain operations of second-ranked Continental Grain Co. 
Justice is reviewing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Dick Lugar, R-Ind., has  
scheduled a hearing Jan. 26 on the concentration issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators wrote that the top four firms control 87 percent of  
beef slaughter, 60 percent of pork slaughter and 73 percent of 
sheep slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the same in commodities markets, they said, writing that  
four firms control 59 percent of port facilities, 62 percent of 
flour milling, 74 percent of wet corn milling and 76 percent of 
soybean crushing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department should investigate ``whether such  
powerful concentration is squeezing farm prices and denying farmers 
the opportunity to receive a fair return for their production,'' 
the letter said.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Green Nears Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Purple is the only color that  
mattered to media members covering the Minnesota Vikings this week. 
To Dennis Green, that meant progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Green quietly has joined Art Shell as the only black NFL coaches  
to lead their teams to the conference championship game. That puts 
Green one win away from being the first to reach the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither subject was an issue as the Vikings prepared for  
Sunday's NFC title game against the Atlanta Falcons, something 
Green saw as a sign of changing times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because what everybody is talking about is the team, and  
that's the way it should be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking barriers is nothing new for Green. He was the first  
black coach in the Big Ten when Northwestern hired him in 1981, and 
he was only the second black coach in modern NFL history -- 
following Shell with the Raiders -- when the Vikings hired him in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Green's tenure hasn't always been smooth, but it has been  
successful. He has made the playoffs every season except 1995, and 
this season went 15-1 to boost his regular-season winning 
percentage to .634, surpassing Bud Grant for the best in team 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has a chance to bring the Vikings their first conference  
title since the 1976 season and the first Super Bowl championship 
in their 38-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I just try to stand for is somebody who's always tried to  
do a good job,'' Green said. ``A lot of people write, a lot of 
people call and talk about the significance of (being the first 
black coach in the Super Bowl). That's the breakthrough we're going 
through right now. It was a breakthrough when I went into 
Northwestern and I accepted it. I think it's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Green's job security was an issue as recently as August,  
a mixture of the team's postseason failures (1-5 under Green before 
this season), off-field turmoil that included allegations of sexual 
harassment in 1995 and what Green often has described as an 
undertone of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, he has endured the tough times to become the NFL's  
longest-tenured head coach with the same team, edging Pittsburgh's 
Bill Cowher by 11 days for that distinction following Marty 
Schottenheimer's resignation at Kansas City this week. 
</P>
<P>
	He got a three-year contract extension from new owner Red  
McCombs on the eve of the season opener against Tampa Bay late last 
summer, and his wife, Marie, gave birth to their second child in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Green finally seems to have found peace in Minnesota.  
</P>
<P>
	``(Green's success) means a lot, because that's showing it's not  
a situation of what color you are, but about what kind of job 
you're capable of doing,'' defensive end Derrick Alexander said. 
``It makes me really proud to see him be able to endure all the 
things he's had to endure and still be able to accomplish the same 
goals as anyone else (who has) had the easy street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Vikings beat Atlanta Sunday -- they are favored by 11  
points -- Randall Cunningham also will become only the second black 
quarterback to start in the Super Bowl. Doug Williams was the MVP 
of Washington's championship victory after the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
	One of three black coaches in the NFL -- joined by Ray Rhodes in  
Green Bay and former Vikings assistant Tony Dungy in Tampa Bay -- 
Green has become a leading advocate in trying to help others break 
through the same barrier he did seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A chance to be there if Green becomes the first black coach in  
the Super Bowl would be a proud moment for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a situation when we are going into the next millennium and  
I'm on a team with an African-American head coach, it's a testament 
to how far we've come,'' cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock said. ``I think 
it'll make it a lot easier for African-American head coaches to get 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like people say: the guys who the owners saw winning  
Super Bowls in those days when they were kids were white. We have a 
situation where the young kids of today will see an 
African-American head coach go to the Super Bowl, so that's going 
to be huge.''

<HEADLINE> Washington Gang Leaders Nabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police captured leaders of a violent street  
gang that turned a neighborhood in the national capital's poorest 
section into a war zone in an effort to control the illegal drug 
trade, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In three years, members of the gang known as the ``One-Five  
Mob'' ``committed 40 assaults and attempted assaults, including 
seven murders, 13 attempted murders and 20 shootings'' in the area 
around the Stanton Dwellings, a low-income housing project in 
Anacostia, U.S. Attorney Wilma Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two alleged members were arrested in early morning raids  
at 20 locations in the District of Columbia and suburban Maryland. 
District police and FBI agents also netted $60,000 in cash, 18 
pounds of crack cocaine, six pounds of powdered cocaine, a little 
less than two pounds of heroin, and 22 handguns and assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities acted on an indictment bearing 100 local and federal  
counts including murder, assault, armed robbery and firearms and 
narcotics violations. Several suspects face possible life 
imprisonment without parole if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``These arrests will allow us to start other investigations,''  
said Jimmy Carter, of the FBI's Washington field office. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of this investigation, since its inception we've  
closed at least 20 murders,'' said Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities identified Tommy Edelin, 30, as the gang's leader.  
Edelin's organization used violence to protect themselves against 
rival drug dealers, for retaliation and to silence potential 
witnesses, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other defendants range in age from 21 to 49. The oldest is  
Edelin's father, Earl. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the gang's alleged victims was shot and killed as he  
returned from a prom with his date. In another case, three 
bystanders were wounded in July 1996 when group members allegedly 
opened fire in a daylight drive-by shooting at a crowded picnic in 
a city park. 
</P>
<P>
	A month earlier, two district police officers were wounded as  
gang members allegedly fired on a rival street gang.

<HEADLINE> Firm recalls infant, toddler hats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before parents bundle up their infants and  
toddlers with knit hats, they should make sure the headwear doesn't 
have a one-piece chin strap that could get caught on something and 
strangle a young child. 
</P>
<P>
	Elegant Headwear Co. is notifying consumers that 150,000 infant  
and toddler hats with one-piece straps need to be fixed, according 
to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The strap could strangle 
a child if it gets caught on on playground equipment, riding toys 
or other catch points. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Elizabeth, N.J.-based company nor the commission is  
aware of any injuries associated with the hats. 
</P>
<P>
	The knit hats have an inside tag that reads ``100 percent  
acrylic ... made in U.S.A. ... RN 36299 or TN 82864.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mass merchandisers and discount stores sold the infant and  
toddler hats from 1985 to 1998 for about $2 to $4. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should cut the strap in half. The commission also  
reminds consumers to remove drawstrings from the hoods and necks of 
children's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has eliminated the one-piece strap from its line of  
infant and toddler hats. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers with questions can call Elegant Headwear at  
800-689-9237 Monday through Friday between 9.a.m. and 1 p.m. EST

<HEADLINE> Truth Is Matter of Partisan Prism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- So, who is telling the truth?  
</P>
<P>
	Republican prosecutors pose that question about the testimony of  
President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, and then make it perfectly 
clear they believe her account, not his. They offer the bleakest 
possible interpretation of Clinton's explanations, concluding that 
he is guilty of lying and obstructing justice and should be thrown 
out of office. 
</P>
<P>
	There is another side of the story, a different slant to be  
heard. Clinton's defenders will present their case to the Senate 
next week and it is sure to conflict with the Republican account on 
virtually every point. 
</P>
<P>
	Where Republicans say Clinton perjured himself, the White House  
offers the rosy explanation that he simply misled or dodged the 
truth. On the obstruction of justice charge, Clinton's attorneys 
say the accusation ``fails as a matter of law and as a matter of 
common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But no matter how you read it, according to the White House and  
its Democratic allies, Clinton's misconduct does not measure up to 
high crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	It comes down to Republicans and Democrats looking at the same  
facts through partisan prisms and reaching opposite conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Partisan passions run deep in this case. Look at the prosecution  
team in the Senate: 13 Republicans, no Democrats. The vote to 
impeach Clinton split on party lines in the House Judiciary 
Committee and then in the full House. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans recognize they need to convince Americans there is  
good cause for pursuing a case that most people believe should have 
been put to rest long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP's confrontational politics and zeal for pursuing Clinton  
cost them dearly in the November elections and afterward with the 
resignations of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and speaker-to-be 
Robert Livingston. Some Republicans fear their campaign against the 
president could cost them control of the House in 2000, and 
possibly the Senate as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The American people already have rendered their verdict about  
Clinton. They believe he had a sexual relationship with Ms. 
Lewinsky and lied about it. But they give the president a strong 
job approval rating, and a majority want him to remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be up to 100 senators -- 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats  
sitting as jurors -- to decide whether Clinton will serve out the 
final two years of his term or be disgraced as the first president 
in history to be removed from office. It takes 67 senators to throw 
him out. 
</P>
<P>
	The story told by the House prosecutors is the same saga that  
has been told and retold for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here today to summarize for you what you heard  
yesterday,'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., told the Senate Friday. 
``I don't want to bore you. I don't intend to do that.'' He said 
they would go over the evidence ``one more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The House case ... is almost entirely based on circumstantial  
evidence and interpretation,'' said Norm Ornstein, a political 
analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. ``And every place 
where you take a turn in the road, they took the worst possible, 
most negative interpretation of what witnesses said or Bill 
Clinton's motives or actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every single instance, there is an opposite interpretation  
that is just as reasonable that contradicts the case,'' Ornstein 
said. ``Democrats almost uniformly interpret (things) the other 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for Republicans -- who must persuade at least 12  
Democrats to vote with them if they hope to convict Clinton -- is to 
somehow change the dynamic of the case to underscore the gravity of 
their accusations. To do that, they want to call witnesses, to put 
a human face on Clinton's alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you boil the case down, somebody's telling the truth under  
oath and somebody's lying under oath,'' Rep. James Sensenbrenner, 
R-Wis., one of the House prosecutors, said Friday. ``And the only 
way the senators will be able to determine which is which is by 
seeing the principals, looking at their facial expressions, looking 
at the tone of their voice and making a determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House -- and many Democrats -- aren't buying the  
argument for witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not willing to argue the case on the record that's  
been developed, the 60,000 pages, after a yearlong investigation, 
and are seeking to open this up to a long, extended process,'' 
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said. ``And I think that in 
large part is an acknowledgment of the weakness in their case.''

<HEADLINE> EU Talks Focus on Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- With Brazil's financial crisis looming  
over world markets, German and Japanese finance ministers renewed 
their controversial call today for an international system to limit 
wild exchange rate swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting at a summit of European and Asian finance ministers,  
Germany's Oskar Lafontaine and Japan's Kiichi Miyazawa said ``an 
adequate exchange rate regime with emerging countries'' was crucial 
for avoiding further turbulence in the world financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, they also reinforced their support for  
setting target ranges among major currencies -- the dollar, the yen 
and the brand-new euro -- to promote stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't for fixed foreign exchange rates, but for stable  
currency rates,'' Lafontaine told reporters outside the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	His deputy, Heiner Flassbeck, said the Brazil crisis can be seen  
as an example of the need to stabilize the foreign-exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil will be a topic at a meeting of deputy finance ministers  
from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in Frankfurt 
on Saturday, and Flassbeck said the G-7 has a ``unified position'' 
on Brazil, but he declined to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is less unanimity -- especially with Washington -- over  
the idea of so-called exchange-rate bands, or corridors limiting 
how far a currency could rise or fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan under which central banks would intervene to keep  
currencies within the exchange-rate bands has gained political 
momentum in Europe since the launch of the single currency Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Europeans worry their new euro currency could also become  
too strong, hurting European exports and slowing growth. And Japan 
is concerned by the yen's recent appreciation against the dollar, 
which sparked intervention by the Bank of Japan this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United States and the Frankfurt-based European Central  
Bank, which sets monetary policy for the 11 euro nations, have 
voiced opposition to such a plan. They worry about the cost should 
they be forced to intervene in currency markets, and note similar 
schemes have failed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union's finance commissioner, Yves-Thibault de  
Silguy, called the idea ``premature'' today, noting ``exchange 
rates cannot be set by decree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lafontaine, who often promotes a more activist state role in  
the economy than the chancellor, insisted the idea at least 
deserved consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Flassbeck, his deputy, said in a radio interview today that it  
was more important to ``talk concretely about exchange rate systems 
rather than abstractly about world financial architecture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turbulence triggered by Brazil's devaluation of its  
currency, the real, has added urgency to the talks between finance 
ministers from the 15 EU nations and 10 Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto said ministers at the  
two-day meeting hoped to develop a ``early warning system for 
global crises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was unclear if any concrete proposals would emerge from  
the Frankfurt talks. Schroeder said he expected Group of Seven 
finance ministers to develop a ``coherent concept'' for financial 
reform at their Feb. 20 meeting in Bonn, setting the stage for an 
agreement at the G-7 summit in June in Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the ministers were to look at the tricky question  
of how to improve surveillance of financial institutions, in 
particular the secretive investment companies known as hedge funds 
that have been accused of provoking financial upheaval.

<HEADLINE> NBC Aims for Less Sex in Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NBC is turning a cold shower on  
overheated shows. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa said Thursday the  
network, home of such sexy comedies as ``Friends'' and ``Veronica's 
Closet,'' needs to put less emphasis on bedroom antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, we could use a few more words between `Hello'  
and `Would you sleep with me?''' Sassa told the Television Critics 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa, who took over as top programmer last fall, said he also  
wants NBC to show more traditional two-parent families, more 
diversity and more programs set somewhere other than New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his remark about toning down the sexual content in  
series that prompted the most questions from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa was quick to explain that he didn't mean NBC was turning  
puritanical. ``We're not trying to create The Family Channel 
here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For a show like ``Friends,'' about singles living in the big  
city, sexuality is a logical part of the formula, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying no sex. I'm saying less sex, and it depends on  
the kind of show it is,'' Sassa said. ``When sex is used in a smart 
way, it works out OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Friends'' airs at 8 p.m. in many markets, and NBC, which also  
focuses on young singles with comedies like ``Caroline in the 
City'' and ``Just Shoot Me,'' has taken heat for scheduling racy 
fare early in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa also acknowledged that NBC has weak spots in its schedule  
outside of its key Thursday night lineup that includes ``ER'' and 
``Friends,'' but he said the network has several shows in 
development for spring. 
</P>
<P>
	They include ``Everything's Relative'' with Jeffrey Tambor (who  
played Hank on ``The Larry Sanders Show'') and another sitcom 
called ``Cold Feet,'' based on a British series. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to predict what effect Michael Jordan's retirement would  
have on NBC's broadcast of NBA games, Sassa reached back to 
Jordan's first retirement in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings dipped 5 percent then, Sassa said, although the lockout  
and the shortened season makes this year's situation more difficult 
to gauge.

<HEADLINE> Orioles, Cuba Game May Happen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Which ball field and even what bats to use  
will be up for negotiation this week as baseball officials try to 
work out the rules for possible exhibition games in Baltimore and 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation that included Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos  
got special permission to fly directly to Havana and left Friday 
afternoon, according to a spokesman for Catholic Relief Services, a 
charity participating in the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos hopes to arrange one game in Cuba and one at Camden  
Yards in Baltimore in an effort to improve relationships between 
the countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members of the delegation were Sandy Alderson, executive  
vice president of operations for major league baseball, and Tom 
Garofalo, director of Catholic Relief's efforts in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Levin, a spokesman for major league baseball, described  
the trip as a ``fact-finding mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garofalo said he expected the trip would last less than a week.  
</P>
<P>
	Garofalo travels monthly to Cuba for the Baltimore-based  
charity, which has provided $20 million in food and medical relief 
to the island since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic Relief could receive proceeds from the exhibition  
games. A condition of State Department approval for the trip is 
that the proceeds do not benefit the regime of Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	But the charity's executive director, Kenneth Hackett, said  
increasing understanding between the two countries would be the 
main benefit of a baseball exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether there are financial benefits from this or not, we'd be  
happy,'' Hackett said. ``This is just great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos did not return phone calls Friday. Last week he called  
early signals from the Cuban government ``encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series was first proposed in 1996, but the State Department  
rejected it because of a trade embargo in place against Cuba since 
1959. The idea was given new life last week when the Clinton 
administration announced new measures to aid the Cuban people, 
including permission for the Orioles to play in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	No major league team has played on the island since the Brooklyn  
Dodgers held spring training in Havana in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker of Cuba's parliament hinted last weekend that the  
Cuban government would allow a game, saying negotiations should 
address what types of bats -- wood or aluminum -- would be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials, however, are leery of sending the country's  
best baseball players to the United States for a game because of 
the possibility of defections. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two times the Cuban national team played in the United  
States, a player defected and signed with a major league club.

<HEADLINE> NFL's Browns Mum on Expansion List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The list of potential Browns includes eight Pro  
Bowlers, nine former first-round draft picks and at least one 
future Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland received a list of 130 players Friday from the NFL  
that the Browns can select from for next month's expansion draft. 
So Carmen Policy, after reviewing the names, who do you like? 
</P>
<P>
	``There appeared to be some players on that list that could come  
in and start for the Cleveland Browns,'' the Browns president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Could you be more specific?  
</P>
<P>
	``I promised on the life of my firstborn that I wouldn't say a  
word about anybody on the list,'' Policy said of the pledge he made 
to Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week the 26 teams not currently playing football  
were required to submit their lists of the five players they would 
make available to the Browns for the Feb. 9 expansion draft in 
Canton. The four teams involved in this weekend's conference 
championship games will file their lists once their seasons are 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the names began trickling out before Friday, when the  
league released its official list. Among the notable names: 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago linebacker Andre Collins; Cincinnati linebacker James  
Francis; Dallas fullback Daryl Johnston; Green Bay wide receiver 
Robert Brooks, kick returner Roell Preston, and defensive tackle 
Reggie White, who is planning to retire; Kansas City offensive 
tackle Jeff Criswell; New England running back Sedrick Shaw; New 
Orleans QB Heath Shuler and wideout Qadry Ismail; Oakland wide 
receiver Desmond Howard; Philadelphia wide receiver Jeff Graham; 
St. Louis center John Flannery; Seattle center Kevin Glover; Tampa 
Bay defensive tackle Marcus Jones; and Washington running back 
Terry Allen, quarterback Gus Frerotte and defensive back Cris 
Dishman, all former Pro Bowlers. 
</P>
<P>
	The list also includes several former Browns, including  
Baltimore wide receiver Michael Jackson and defensive back Stevon 
Moore, San Francisco defensive back Antonio Langham and center 
Randy Kirk, and San Diego tight end Frank Hartley. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who was in California for the East-West Shrine Bowl, said  
in a statement the Browns would not comment on any of the players 
``until we have an opportunity to properly and extensively evaluate 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Browns, who have already signed 14 free agents, can  
select 30-42 players in the expansion draft, and under provisions 
set up by the league, Cleveland must use up 38 percent of its 
projected $60 million salary cap on such players. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Browns select a player, a team can pull back one of its  
unprotected players. And after a second player is picked, a team 
can pull back both of its remaining players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns inherit the salary of any draftee, making the size of  
his contract as important as his ability or stature. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said who the Browns take in the expansion draft would  
have little bearing on their selections in the early rounds of 
April's college draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might come in and start affecting picks four and later,''  
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market ended a four-day losing streak  
Friday as investors gained confidence that Brazil, the largest 
country in Latin America, is getting a handle on its economic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil decided to temporarily stop using its cash reserves to  
prop up its beleaguered currency, the real. Investors concluded 
this would allow interest rates in that country to fall, 
stimulating new business investment and perhaps helping the country 
back to economic health. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 219.62 points to 9,340.55,  
making up a large portion of the 522 points it lost earlier in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow still ended the week down 302.77 points. It was just  
last Friday that the Dow hit a new high of 9,643.32 on continued 
domestic economic strength and highflying technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue chip index, which gained 5 percent in the first week of  
the year, ended Friday's session just 1.7 percent higher for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indexes also rose sharply Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index advanced 71.38 to 2,348.20. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 gained 31.07 to 1,243.26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange -- Latin America's largest --  
skyrocketed as Brazilian shares began to look like a bargain for 
foreign investors. The exchange closed up 33.3 percent Friday -- the 
second highest rise in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil rocked world financial markets on Wednesday when it  
devalued its currency, the real, by 8 percent. Two top government 
finance officials resigned, raising doubts about Brazil's political 
resolve to get its economy in order. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday and Thursday, the Dow lost a total of 353 points,  
as U.S. investors feared that Brazil's problems would spread 
throughout Latin America, most importantly to Mexico, a key U.S. 
trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin America accounts for 20 percent of U.S. exports, so any  
region-wide downturn could cut deeply into profits of American 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many observers felt that if Brazil were serious about turning  
its economy around, it would stop using its currency reserves to 
prop up the real. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday the government said it would do just that, at least  
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors now hope that Brazil won't start a  
regional economic crisis as big as Asia's, which began in 1997 
after Thailand devalued its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think there's recognition that it isn't quite as bad as  
Asia, that it doesn't necessarily have to reverberate around the 
globe,'' said Peter Anderson, chief investment strategist at 
American Express Financial Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We survived Asia very well, because the (U.S.) Federal Reserve  
reduced interest rates, and in fact that's what pulled the market 
up in the final quarter of last year,'' he said. ``I think people 
increasingly recognize that these kinds of dilemmas, as long as 
they don't spread, can actually be constructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks led the rebound on Wall Street after  
having taken big hits earlier this week on fears that Brazilian 
companies would default on their loans. Dow component American 
Express rose 8 5/8 to 104 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of consumer companies, which are heavy exporters to  
Brazil, were mixed after taking big hits earlier this week. Procter 
&AMP; Gamble rose 1 7/16 to 86 5/8, but Philip Morris fell 3/4 to 52 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a nearly 3 to 1 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to a moderately heavy 
953.8 million shares as of 4 p.m., up slightly from Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 12.32 to 593.39, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 11.13 to 709.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.95 to 427.05.  
</P>
<P>
	The gains in U.S. trading helped lift European stocks from  
midday losses. Germany's DAX index closed up 1.4 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 rose 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In overnight trading, Asian stock markets were mostly higher.  
Tokyo's stock market was closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. financial markets will be closed Monday for the Martin

<HEADLINE> Detroit Still Buried Under Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Marisha Harris hasn't gotten her mail for a week  
and a half. Her 35-minute drive to work now takes two hours, she's 
gotten stuck several times and she keeps a shovel in her truck to 
dig out of streets that haven't been plowed since 2 feet of snow 
started falling two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what's wrong with Dennis Archer,'' she says,  
joining a growing chorus of complaints about the generally popular 
second-term mayor who came into office promising to make Detroit a 
``world-class'' city after years of fiscal pain, high crime and 
annual Devil's Night arson. 
</P>
<P>
	By all appearances, Archer had been doing well. Crime is down,  
new development is up and Devil's Night has been tamed. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of the snow blitz, the city that put the world on  
wheels hasn't had enough traction to keep its schools open, get its 
mail delivered or keep its 1 million residents moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is this: Detroit has a decades-old policy of not  
plowing its residential streets, and the city adhered to that 
policy even after an unusual 23 inches of snow fell during the 
first two weeks of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer maintains he's not to blame for the mess since the  
plowing policy wasn't his doing. 
</P>
<P>
	But that attitude that doesn't sit well with residents forced to  
drive in deep ruts -- when they can drive at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just feeding everybody a bunch of baloney,'' says Miss  
Harris, 22. She says Archer lately ``has developed this really 
nasty attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Neely, Archer's spokesman, says the mayor was a victim  
of his own success. Things are looking up in Detroit nowadays, and 
people have come to expect to see their streets plowed, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer says the plowing policy has been in place since at least  
the 1960s and was prompted mainly by budget constraints and the 
need to make choices of where to spend money. In the past, he says, 
residents haven't stressed plowing as a top concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had to decide between laying off cops and buying a snow  
truck, or one less truck and keeping an officer, the decision was 
for the cops or the firefighters,'' agrees Bob Berg, who was Mayor 
Coleman Young's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	City Council member Maryann Mahaffey says the city experimented  
with plowing side streets while Young was in office. The experiment 
failed because too many residents park their cars on the street and 
wouldn't move them for plows, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Detroit budgets only $1.5 million to use 59  
snowplows to cover main roads. By comparison, Milwaukee spends $6 
million and uses 400 vehicles for snow removal. Grand Rapids spends 
about $2 million and uses 50 snowplows. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Milwaukee and Grand Rapids cover fewer square miles than  
Detroit (Milwaukee has 96, Grand Rapids has 45 to Detroit's 132), 
and both have far fewer residents (590,000 in Milwaukee and 190,000 
in Grand Rapids). But both plow residential streets, and both 
average more inches of snow in January (20 in Milwaukee, 13 in 
Grand Rapids). 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of snow Detroit has gotten has compounded problems.  
In a city that averages only 10 inches in January, the 23.1 inches 
that had fallen by Friday tied the mark for the fourth-snowiest 
January on record. And none of it has melted, thanks to an average 
temperature of 11 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen days after the first foot of snow fell, Archer got the  
message Friday, went to the City Council and obtained $1.3 million 
for snow removal. He also got Gov. John Engler to declare a state 
of emergency and Engler asked federal officials to do the same -- 
allowing the city to get reimbursed for extra plowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said he hadn't been able to seek the federal emergency  
declaration until certain criteria were met, and that didn't happen 
until the last few days. He did not detail the criteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city's inability to plow side streets has created public  
health and safety concerns in many neighborhoods due to the lack of 
access for police, fire and other emergency vehicles,'' Engler said 
in his letter to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer, a Democrat, has generally enjoyed a good relationship  
with the Republican governor. But Engler spokesman John Truscott 
this week called the crisis an embarrassment and said the fact that 
schoolchildren couldn't get to school was ``almost beyond 
comprehension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people do expect a lot from the mayor. He has been a  
great promoter and marketer, he's made promises to improve city 
services,'' Truscott said. ``But I wouldn't put basic plowing on 
the list of too much to expect, no matter who the mayor is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime resident Ilene Riggins says she's never seen so much  
snow fall in Detroit. Still, she says, Archer could have done 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's his job, to deal with emergencies,'' she says. ``It's  
common sense.''

<HEADLINE>  Pentagon Details Afghanistan Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While acknowledging U.S. strikes against a  
terrorist training center in Afghanistan in August caused 
significant damage, a Pentagon spokesman still refuses to discuss 
what weapons were used. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage appeared to have been inflicted by cruise missiles. But  
spokesman Capt. Michael Doubleday said confirmation of that or 
where the attack originated would reveal too much to the terror 
suspects who were targeted in the assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aug. 20 hits, against alleged terrorist training camps in  
Afghanistan believed to be operated by expatriate Saudi millionaire 
Osama bin Laden, were to retaliate for the destruction of two U.S. 
embassies in Africa. Those bombings killed 258 people and wounded 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes also hit a factory in Sudan where Pentagon officials  
said convincing evidence had been found of a substance used to 
created deadly VX nerve gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has posted photos of three camps in the Khowst  
terrorist complex on its Internet site, and Doubleday was queried 
about them Thursday during a regular Pentagon press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was significant destruction to this particular site that  
was struck,'' Doubleday said. ``It is an indication that these 
facilities ... used by this terrorist group are not out of the 
reach of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday did not reply directly to a question about reports  
that bin Laden was present at the site at the time of the attack 
but escaped. The attack, Doubleday said, ``was not against a 
specific individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department Thursday, a poster was released that  
will be used to advertise a reward of up to $5 million for 
information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and 
his military commander, Muhammad Atef. The poster will be printed 
in various languages and sent to U.S. embassies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday said Pentagon officials knew at the time of the  
strikes that ``there was going to be a meeting of these terrorists 
for the purpose of planning further attacks against U.S. people and 
U.S. facilities. And our actions ... were designed to disrupt that 
kind of activity, and we believe we were very effective in doing 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of five buildings said to have functioned as leadership centers,  
Doubleday said two sustained ``almost total destruction,'' the 
other three ``significant damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Queried about the types of weapons used, Doubleday said such  
information would give too much information to the individuals 
targeted. Since August, Pentagon officials have refused to state 
officially whether the strikes were carried out by cruise missiles 
or even whether they were conducted by the Air Force or the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``On this particular occasion we elected not to get into the  
specifics of the types of weapons that we used nor the particular 
starting points for the launch of those weapons,'' Doubleday said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman, asked why camera footage has not been released  
from recent air attacks against Iraqi missile sites, said such 
video would also provide too much information to the Iraqis, in 
particular about the AGM-130 missile being used.

<HEADLINE> Fannie Mae Offers New Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First came smaller down payments, enabling  
more people to buy a home. But there was a catch: the borrowers had 
to pay more in home mortgage insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Now mortgage giant Fannie Mae is offering both lower down  
payments and lower insurance costs, by providing new options that 
will make mortgage insurance cheaper for homebuyers who cannot 
afford big down payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The new insurance options will save homebuyers who make small  
down payments $1,100 to $2,250 over the first 10 years of a 
30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, according to Fannie Mae, a 
congressionally chartered, publicly traded company that buys 
mortgages from original lenders such as banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae retains some of the mortgages in its portfolio and  
packages others into securities for resale to investors. The 
company reported Thursday that its profits rose to a record $3.4 
billion last year from $3.05 billion in 1997, boosted by continued 
growth in its mortgage business. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Raines, Fannie Mae's new chairman and chief executive  
officer, was announcing the mortgage insurance plan today at the 
National Association of Home Builders' annual meeting in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can cut costs to consumers, qualify more homebuyers, and  
give them more home for their mortgage-payment dollar by reducing 
their mortgage insurance costs,'' Raines said in a statement. 
``Eventually, we hope all low down payment borrowers will benefit 
from new approaches to mortgage insurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new options will be available nationwide in early March from  
some 700 mortgage lenders nationwide that use Fannie Mae's 
``desktop underwriter'' computer software. About 150,000 borrowers, 
most of them first-time homebuyers, are expected to take advantage 
of the options over the next year or so. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, Fannie Mae launched nationwide a new type of  
mortgage with a small down payment -- as low as 3 percent -- and 
flexibility regarding the source of that money. The new mortgage, 
previously available only in limited areas of the country, was 
designed to help people with very good credit histories but little 
savings who have been unable to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch: Homebuyers making the smaller down payments had to  
pay more in mortgage insurance to protect lenders against losses 
from defaults. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave millions of Americans the chance to buy a home by  
lowering down payments, but requiring more mortgage insurance,'' 
Raines said. ``Now we can offer homebuyers the best of both worlds 
-- lower down payments and lower mortgage insurance costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anger over the cost of home mortgage insurance led Congress last  
summer to enact legislation that automatically eliminates the 
insurance requirement when a homeowner has 22 percent equity in his 
or her home. A homeowner with a good payment record, and whose home 
has not depreciated below the purchase price, may ask that the 
insurance be canceled upon reaching 20 percent of equity. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae said the new insurance options were made possible by  
the use of its ``desktop underwriter'' computer software and a new 
strategy for reducing losses from mortgage defaults. 
</P>
<P>
	They include:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Across-the-board reductions in required insurance on 30-year,  
fixed-rate mortgages to the levels that prevailed in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Fannie Mae requires that homebuyers getting mortgage  
loans with only a 5 percent down payment buy insurance covering 30 
percent of the loan's value. Under the change, this will be reduced 
to 25 percent, the level required in 1994. Required insurance 
coverage for a mortgage with a 10 percent down payment will be cut 
from 25 percent to 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An option that reduces mortgage insurance costs even further,  
when combined with an additional payment. 
</P>
<P>
	For a loan with a 5 percent down payment, the required insurance  
coverage will be 18 percent of the loan's value; for a mortgage 
with 10 percent down, the insurance requirement will be 12 percent 
of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	To get these reductions, a homebuyer will have to make a payment  
of points or a higher note rate. If paid in points, the cost would 
be about $750 on a $100,000 mortgage with 5 percent down, and $375 
on $100,000 with 10 percent down. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the note rate for a $100,000 mortgage would be  
0.15 percent for a 5 percent down payment, or 0.08 percent for 10 
percent down -- making the rate 7.15 percent or 7.08 percent, 
compared with 7 percent for the same mortgage without this option. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers seeking more information can call Fannie Mae's  
consumer resource center at 1-800-7-FANNIE between 9 a.m. and 5 
p.m. EST. The service normally is available Monday through Friday, 
but will be open on Saturday, Jan. 16, and closed on Monday, Jan. 
18 for the federal holiday.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Virus Vaccine Tests Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers report some laboratory success of  
a vaccine that attacks HIV at a vulnerable moment of the deadly 
virus' infection cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies at the University of Montana, researchers developed  
antibodies in mice that attacked HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, 
just as the virus was in the process of fusing with target cells. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the study was being published today in the journal  
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	This fusion process, the researchers said, exposed HIV molecules  
that are not open to attack at other times in the infection cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	These molecules were then injected into laboratory mice. The  
injected mice, which had been genetically manipulated to respond to 
HIV, made antibodies against the fusion molecules. 
</P>
<P>
	When tested in laboratory dishes against actual samples of HIV,  
the mouse antibodies were able to neutralize 23 of 24 strains of 
the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana researchers said the study shows an encouraging new  
approach to HIV vaccine but the substances in the laboratory 
studies could not be used safely in humans. Also, it is not certain 
if humans could develop antibodies such as those produced by the 
laboratory mice, the researchers said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> 2 Brokerages Fined for Y2K Lapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two brokerage firms have agreed to pay civil  
fines of $5,000 each to settle federal regulators' charges that 
they failed to fully disclose their computer readiness for the Year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlements  
Friday with Allegheny Financial Programs Inc. of Weston, W.Va., and 
Atlantic-Pacific Capital Inc. of Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were among 37 relatively small brokerages charged by the  
SEC in October, in the federal government's first major enforcement 
action related to the Year 2000 computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, 19 of the 37 firms agreed to settle the charges by  
promising to refrain from such violations in the future, being 
censured and paying civil penalties ranging from $5,000 to $25,000. 
Fines from the settled cases totaled $235,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest settlements, Allegheny Financial and  
Atlantic-Pacific Capital agreed to pay the fines, to be censured 
and to refrain from future such violations. The firms neither 
admitted nor denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of Atlantic-Pacific were not immediately available for  
comment and Allegheny Financial officials could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the SEC accused nine stock-transfer agents  
of allegedly failing to adequately disclose their computer 
readiness for the millennial year. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the agent companies settled the charges and four  
contested them. 
</P>
<P>
	Transfer agents, which sometimes are banks or trust companies,  
are responsible for keeping records of shareholders of corporations 
and for issuing or canceling stock certificates when shares are 
bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said failure of transfer agents to anticipate and fix  
Year 2000 computer problems could ``seriously disrupt'' 
corporations' dividend payments and other transactions with their 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency also requires mutual fund companies  
and publicly traded corporations to disclose their readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about the Jan. 1, 2000, date stem from the fact that  
some computer systems may read only the last two digits of a 
four-digit year and interpret the year 2000 as 1900, potentially 
wreaking havoc on financial transactions.

<HEADLINE> Some Nations Seek Exchange Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Just as Brazil was letting its  
currency lurch at the whims of the marketplace, Japan, Germany and 
France pushed harder Friday for an international system to control 
the wild swings in exchange rates that have roiled world markets 
since mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine  
and his Japanese counterpart Kiichi Miyazawa urged the creation of 
``an exchange-rate regime among major currencies which would reduce 
excessive volatility.'' The same wording appeared in a statement 
issued later by Miyazawa and French Finance Minister Dominique 
Strauss-Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Japanese and French positions have moved very close  
together,'' Strauss-Kahn told reporters. ``I hope that will allow 
us to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, France and Japan led calls for exchange-rate ties at a  
two-day meeting of finance ministers from the 15 European Union 
nations and 10 Asian countries. They were also likely to promote 
the proposal Saturday at a meeting of deputy finance ministers from 
the leading world industrial powers, a bloc known as G-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the call for increased international cooperation to  
stabilize currencies, specific courses of action were unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans appeared to back away from earlier support for a  
proposal from Lafontaine for target rates, or bands within which 
the leading world currencies -- the dollar, yen and the newly 
created euro -- will be allowed to fluctuate. Central banks would 
have to coordinate buying and selling to prevent currencies 
lurching outside the bands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Target rates are not the only solution,'' said Italian  
Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi. ``We are not talking about controls 
in the old sense of the term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Lafontaine insisted he was not calling for ``fixed foreign  
exchange rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about taking power away from financial markets, but  
more about avoiding to a large extent damaging market impacts on 
the world economies,'' Lafontaine told the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is wary of any talk of exchange-rate ties,  
warning such plans could be hugely expensive and have failed in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Strauss-Kahn said the EU and G-7 would support Brazil's efforts  
to pull itself out of crisis. ``It's a difficult situation, but not 
an insurmountable one ... the policies Brazil is following are 
going in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil on Wednesday devalued its currency, the real, by around 8  
percent as it widened its trading bands. When Brazil said it would 
not intervene in foreign exchange markets Friday by buying or 
selling its currency, the real plummeted through the latest limits 
but stock markets rallied worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	After financial chaos swept across Asia and into Russia last  
year, the market panic that immediately followed Wednesday's 
surprise devaluation of Brazil's currency has revived fears of 
recession spreading through Latin America, stalling Asian recovery 
and eventually dragging down the U.S. and European economies. 
</P>
<P>
	European officials were eager to calm such fears, insisting the  
EU's economy would remain buoyant. ``The Brazil crisis has, of 
course, implications in the rest of the world,'' said Spanish 
Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato. ``We will be affected but other 
forces, such as growth, and domestic demand will work in the other 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said the  
introduction of the euro as the shared currency of 11 EU nations on 
Jan. 1, low European interest rates and European banks' reduced 
exposure to emerging markets meant ``Europe is better equipped to 
deal with the spillover effects,'' from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement from Germany and Japan also called for controls on  
currency speculators, particularly the secretive investment 
companies known as hedge funds, which buy and sell huge amounts of 
foreign currencies and have been frequent targets of critics who 
claim they provoke market upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is necessary to enhance financial sector supervision,''  
said Miyazawa and Lafontaine, calling for tighter reporting 
requirements for hedge funds and financial institutions investing 
in them.

<HEADLINE>  15 Reported Killed in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces unleashed a new assault  
on Kosovo's Albanian rebels Friday, reportedly killing at least 15 
separatists in a crackdown on three villages. Elsewhere, a 
cease-fire monitor and his translator were shot in the first attack 
to wound an international observer. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence in southern and western Kosovo dashed hopes that  
tensions in the troubled province would ease following the release 
of eight captive Yugoslav soldiers by the rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on unarmed monitors is sure to raise new questions  
about their role in Kosovo, where up to 2,000 people have been 
killed since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched an 
offensive against separatists last February. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.  
At least 90 percent of Kosovo's people are ethnic Albanian, and 
most favor independence. 
</P>
<P>
	International officials could not confirm the Serb report that  
15 guerrillas had been killed. But they protested the crackdown by 
Yugoslav forces, who used tanks and heavy weapons in a display of 
military might that sent villagers fleeing into the nearby hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain, France and the United States all voiced concern and  
anger that a Briton and a Serb translator for the Kosovo 
Verification Mission had been shot -- with U.S. State Department 
spokesman James P. Rubin calling the situation ``unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Both parties, the Kosovo Albanian side and the Serbian  
government, are responsible for the security of these monitors,'' 
Rubin said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs' fierce assault around Stimlje, 15 miles south of  
Kosovo's capital of Pristina, began Friday morning. International 
monitors said government forces shelled and fired automatic weapons 
on three villages, and reporters who reached the area saw three 
tanks perched on hills overlooking the villages, with at least one 
firing down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb Media Center, whose reports of casualties have proven  
reliable, said at least 15 KLA fighters were killed in the village 
of Racak and nearby Petrovo. Citing police sources, it said police 
confiscated large quantities of arms and drove off the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces claimed to be seeking out rebels who killed a  
policeman and attacked a patrol in the area last weekend, according 
to the Serb center. Authorities said the same group was responsible 
for killing seven pro-government ethnic Albanians in southwestern 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	If confirmed, the death toll would be the second-highest in a  
single clash since a U.S-brokered Kosovo cease-fire in October. 
Thirty-six rebels were reported killed last month by Yugoslav army 
border guards who intercepted them as they were trying to smuggle 
in arms from neighboring Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center reported an  
initial death toll of seven from the clashes. International 
monitors said Serb police blocked them as they tried to reach the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which  
runs the monitoring mission, said their employees were in a convoy 
of three OSCE vehicles near Decani in western Kosovo when 
unidentified gunmen ``deliberately targeted'' them. 
</P>
<P>
	The two victims were taken to a Pristina hospital, and the Serb  
translator was later released. The Briton was taken to Skopje in 
neighboring Macedonia for further treatment after being shot in the 
shoulder. OSCE spokesman Mons Nyberg declined to release further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he was ``shocked and  
concerned'' to hear of the shootings. ``The work of the KVM 
benefits both sides in Kosovo, and I absolutely condemn any 
violence directed towards them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sarajevo, Bosnia, the supreme NATO military commander, Gen.  
Wesley Clark, expressed concern that the violence in Kosovo was 
affecting chances for peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer the use of force goes on inside Kosovo, the more  
intractable the problem is likely to become,'' Clark said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Feels He Knows About Botha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson knows only two things about Francois  
Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's white, and he can't beat me,'' Tyson said of the opponent  
he will face Saturday night in a 10-round fight in the MGM Grand 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Tyson's first fight since the suspension for biting  
Evander Holyfield's ears on June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was a 6-1 favorite to beat Botha, who won the IBF  
heavyweight title in 1995. But championship recognition was 
withdrawn after he tested positive for a steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to come right after him,'' the 32-year-old Tyson  
said. ``I expect him to go down, be out cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson weighed in Thursday at 223 pounds, the heaviest of his  
career by one pound, but he appeared to be in top physical 
condition. What kind of fighting shape he's in after a layoff of 
about 19 months remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know until a guy is actually fighting,'' said Tommy  
Brooks, Tyson's new trainer. ``From what I've seen in the sparring 
sessions, there is no ring rust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks also thinks Tyson has been able to put the Bite Fight  
behind him and focus on his boxing future. He also said the subject 
of Holyfield has not come up since Brooks began working with Tyson 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's lost confidence in himself,'' Brooks said.  
``He lost confidence in his corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``His trainers weren't telling him anything in the Holyfield  
fights. When you come back to the corner and they're not telling 
you anything, that could put a damper on the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Bright was Tyson's trainer when he lost the WBA heavyweight  
to Holyfield in 11 rounds on Nov. 9, 1996. Richie Giachetti trained 
Tyson for the Holyfield rematch. Tyson weighed 222 pounds for the 
first fight and 218 for the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, a 30-year-old South African who weighed 233 pounds,  
expects Tyson to attack from the opening bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always comes out fast and tries to make it a short night,''  
said Botha, who has fought less than two full rounds in 19 months. 
``I'm making myself ready for an early attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``My strategy is the way Holyfield fought him. You can't run  
away from the guy. (Bruce) Seldon, (Frank) Bruno and others closed 
up, put themselves on the ropes, and Tyson could take his shots. I 
will tie him up when I have to and not stand still in front of 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Botha is a much more credible opponent than Peter  
McNeeley, who didn't last one round in Tyson's first fight after 
his release from prison in 1995, he has not shown himself to be on 
the level of a Holyfield despite his 39-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, who lives in Newport Beach, Calif., won the vacant IBF  
title by outpointing Axel Schulz on Dec. 9, 1995, in Germany, then 
was stripped because of the positive drug test. His loss came when 
he was stopped in the 12th round by Michael Moorer in a bid for the 
IBF title in Las Vegas on Nov. 9, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is not as quick as he was when he was the most feared  
fighter in the world from 1986 to 1990, but he is quicker than 
Botha. The 6-foot-2 Botha has scored 24 knockouts, but he doesn't 
match the punching power of Tyson, who is listed at 5-11 1/2, but 
appears shorter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson (45-3, with 39 knockouts) is getting $10 million for the  
pay-per-view match. Botha's purse is $1.85 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecast will begin at 9 p.m. EST, with the Tyson-Botha  
match to start no later than 11:30 p.m. It will be preceded by a 
12-round lightweight bout between Goyo Vargas of Mexico and Ben 
Tackie of Ghana and an IBF junior lightweight title defense by 
Roberto Garcia of Oxnard, Calif., against John John Molina of 
Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE>  Pentagon Details Afghanistan Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While acknowledging U.S. strikes against a  
terrorist training center in Afghanistan in August caused 
significant damage, a Pentagon spokesman still refuses to discuss 
what weapons were used. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage appeared to have been inflicted by cruise missiles. But  
spokesman Capt. Michael Doubleday said confirmation of that or 
where the attack originated would reveal too much to the terror 
suspects who were targeted in the assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aug. 20 hits, against alleged terrorist training camps in  
Afghanistan believed to be operated by expatriate Saudi millionaire 
Osama bin Laden, were to retaliate for the destruction of two U.S. 
embassies in Africa. Those bombings killed 258 people and wounded 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes also hit a factory in Sudan where Pentagon officials  
said convincing evidence had been found of a substance used to 
created deadly VX nerve gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has posted photos of three camps in the Khowst  
terrorist complex on its Internet site, and Doubleday was queried 
about them Thursday during a regular Pentagon press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was significant destruction to this particular site that  
was struck,'' Doubleday said. ``It is an indication that these 
facilities ... used by this terrorist group are not out of the 
reach of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday did not reply directly to a question about reports  
that bin Laden was present at the site at the time of the attack 
but escaped. The attack, Doubleday said, ``was not against a 
specific individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department Thursday, a poster was released that  
will be used to advertise a reward of up to $5 million for 
information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and 
his military commander, Muhammad Atef. The poster will be printed 
in various languages and sent to U.S. embassies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday said Pentagon officials knew at the time of the  
strikes that ``there was going to be a meeting of these terrorists 
for the purpose of planning further attacks against U.S. people and 
U.S. facilities. And our actions ... were designed to disrupt that 
kind of activity, and we believe we were very effective in doing 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of five buildings said to have functioned as leadership centers,  
Doubleday said two sustained ``almost total destruction,'' the 
other three ``significant damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Queried about the types of weapons used, Doubleday said such  
information would give too much information to the individuals 
targeted. Since August, Pentagon officials have refused to state 
officially whether the strikes were carried out by cruise missiles 
or even whether they were conducted by the Air Force or the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``On this particular occasion we elected not to get into the  
specifics of the types of weapons that we used nor the particular 
starting points for the launch of those weapons,'' Doubleday said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman, asked why camera footage has not been released  
from recent air attacks against Iraqi missile sites, said such 
video would also provide too much information to the Iraqis, in 
particular about the AGM-130 missile being used.

<HEADLINE> Graf Says She Can Win Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Three tough matches and a stomach  
illness have left Steffi Graf looking old beyond her 29 years and 
hardly a picture of health ahead of the Australian Open title in 
Melbourne next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But Graf, a winner of 21 Grand Slam titles, believes she has the  
game to worry the top seeds and the legs to carry her through seven 
rounds in a fortnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't ask for any more than where I am right now,'' Graf  
said Friday, after losing 6-2, 7-5 to world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport 
at the Adidas International. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf scored tough three-set wins against Serena and Venus  
Williams on consecutive days before falling to Davenport in 
Friday's semis. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport had too much class and accuracy Friday but the loss  
was probably better for Graf than another three-setter and a final 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good that I'm not going to do anything tomorrow, I'll  
relax and regain some energy and I should be fine for the 
tournament,'' said Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	While Graf rests, Davenport and No.2 Martina Hingis will beat  
each other up for the Sydney title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone exceptionally well this week. Looking back a week  
ago I didn't plan on playing and I've been in hard situations which 
have turned out well,'' Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
	A week earlier she was forced out of the final of a Hong Kong  
exhibition tournament because of a stomach illness. She would not 
elaborate on the exact problem but it clearly affected her more 
than she acknowledged in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've felt good about the way I was playing and the way I was  
getting through them,'' Graf said. ``And it's a lot easier in 
Melbourne, rather than playing day after day here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's victories over the Williams' sisters took all her fight  
as they tried to hammer her out of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	She is coming back after major knee and wrist surgery in the  
past two years and if she enjoys success in Melbourne it would stem 
from her efforts late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've pretty much beaten everybody in the last few tournaments  
and that gives me a good outlook for what's coming,'' Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
	She played Davenport five times last year for a 2-3 record,  
winning two of the last three. Graf won her only meeting against 
Hingis in 1998 and holds a 7-1 career advantage.

<P>
	``She played very well to get to the semis and was probably a  
little worn out today,'' Davenport said Friday. ``She can be 
unbelievable at times and when you've won 21 Grand Slams, you've 
got to count her as a favorite no matter what.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Rises 219.62 To End at 9,340.55 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market ended a four-day losing streak  
Friday as investors gained confidence that Brazil, the largest 
country in Latin America, is getting a handle on its economic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil decided to temporarily stop using its cash reserves to  
prop up its beleaguered currency, the real. Investors concluded 
this would allow interest rates in that country to fall, 
stimulating new business investment and perhaps helping the country 
back to economic health. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 219.62 points to 9,340.55,  
making up a large portion of the 522 points it lost earlier in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow still ended the week down 302.77 points. It was just  
last Friday that the Dow hit a new high of 9,643.32 on continued 
domestic economic strength and highflying technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue chip index, which gained 5 percent in the first week of  
the year, ended Friday's session just 1.7 percent higher for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indexes also rose sharply Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index advanced 71.38 to 2,348.20. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 gained 31.07 to 1,243.26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange -- Latin America's largest --  
skyrocketed as Brazilian shares began to look like a bargain for 
foreign investors. The exchange closed up 33.3 percent Friday -- the 
second highest rise in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil rocked world financial markets on Wednesday when it  
devalued its currency, the real, by 8 percent. Two top government 
finance officials resigned, raising doubts about Brazil's political 
resolve to get its economy in order. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday and Thursday, the Dow lost a total of 353 points,  
as U.S. investors feared that Brazil's problems would spread 
throughout Latin America, most importantly to Mexico, a key U.S. 
trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin America accounts for 20 percent of U.S. exports, so any  
region-wide downturn could cut deeply into profits of American 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many observers felt that if Brazil were serious about turning  
its economy around, it would stop using its currency reserves to 
prop up the real. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday the government said it would do just that, at least  
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors now hope that Brazil won't start a  
regional economic crisis as big as Asia's, which began in 1997 
after Thailand devalued its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think there's recognition that it isn't quite as bad as  
Asia, that it doesn't necessarily have to reverberate around the 
globe,'' said Peter Anderson, chief investment strategist at 
American Express Financial Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We survived Asia very well, because the (U.S.) Federal Reserve  
reduced interest rates, and in fact that's what pulled the market 
up in the final quarter of last year,'' he said. ``I think people 
increasingly recognize that these kinds of dilemmas, as long as 
they don't spread, can actually be constructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks led the rebound on Wall Street after  
having taken big hits earlier this week on fears that Brazilian 
companies would default on their loans. Dow component American 
Express rose 8 5/8 to 104 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of consumer companies, which are heavy exporters to  
Brazil, were mixed after taking big hits earlier this week. Procter 
&AMP; Gamble rose 1 7/16 to 86 5/8, but Philip Morris fell 3/4 to 52 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a nearly 3 to 1 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to a moderately heavy 
953.8 million shares as of 4 p.m., up slightly from Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 12.32 to 593.39, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 11.13 to 709.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.95 to 427.05.  
</P>
<P>
	The gains in U.S. trading helped lift European stocks from  
midday losses. Germany's DAX index closed up 1.4 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 rose 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In overnight trading, Asian stock markets were mostly higher.  
Tokyo's stock market was closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. financial markets will be closed Monday for the Martin  
Luther King holiday.

<HEADLINE> Two Shot at Salt Lake TV Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A woman carrying a grocery bag of bullets  
walked into the lobby of a TV station, demanded to speak to a 
reporter and then went floor to floor firing a handgun, authorities 
said. Two people were injured, one critically. 
</P>
<P>
	De-Kieu Duy, 24, was tackled and disarmed by workers after  
Thursday's shootings in the downtown building that houses several 
businesses, including KSL television and radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe she has a long history of psychiatric problems,''  
Sgt. Ken Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Wireless Services employee Anne Sleater, 30, was shot in  
the head and was in extremely critical condition today. KSL 
building manager Brent Wightman was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident began when a woman wearing a parka, hat and  
shooting-range ear protection entered KSL's lobby. Witnesses said 
she was told by receptionist Colleen Mercy that she couldn't go 
into the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lady stepped back from the reception desk and reached and  
brought out a gun and pointed it right at Colleen, and told her, `I 
want to go to the newsroom,''' Wightman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon afterwards, he said, the woman began shooting. Wightman  
said she spun in a circle, shot into the carpet and then turned 
back. When she was 10 feet from him, ``I knew she was going to 
shoot me -- I don't know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I turned and she nicked me on my right side twice,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	KSL radio employee Mary Kammeyer entered the lobby after hearing  
shots and was confronted by the woman. ``She was saying, `Newsroom, 
newsroom, where's the newsroom?''' Kammeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect took an elevator to the second floor, fired several  
shots, then rode to the fourth floor, got off and shot Sleater, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun jammed and two AT&AMP;T employees jumped her and held her  
down until officers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	KSL is an NBC affiliate and is owned by the Mormon Church.

<HEADLINE> Man Confesses To Killing Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- A man killed his wife and two children,  
then shot himself to death while on the phone with a 911 
dispatcher, because he thought his wife was having an affair via 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``My boy's dead. My wife is dead. My daughter's dead. And now  
I'm going to be dead on account of this goddamned computer,'' Terry 
M. Jones, 53, said on the 911 tape. The dispatcher heard a gunshot, 
followed by moaning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Terry Richwine said it is unclear whether Jones'  
34-year-old wife, Jennifer, really was having an affair over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the sheriff, Jones shot his wife and their  
children, 8-year-old Jesse and 4-year-old Tessa, in their rural 
home in Frankton, about 40 miles north of Indianapolis, on Tuesday 
night, then dialed 911 and asked the dispatchers whether they were 
recording the call. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just killed my wife. I just killed both my kids,'' he said  
on the tape, which was released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said he agreed to release the tape only after The  
Herald Bulletin of Anderson filed a request under the state's open 
records law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see absolutely no value in this,'' he said. ``You're  
only going to hurt the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police had been called to the house for previous disturbances,  
including an incident in which Jones was arrested on domestic 
battery charges. He was convicted of a misdemeanor.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyer Questions Tripp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In their first face-to-face confrontation,  
President Clinton's lawyers suggested Linda Tripp does not tell the 
truth and she blamed her legal problems on first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	During a civil deposition this week unrelated to the president's  
impeachment trial, Clinton lawyer Paul Gaffney got Mrs. Tripp to 
acknowledge she was ``not complete under oath'' in 1995 
congressional testimony and that another time she was untruthful in 
a taped conversation with book agent Lucianne Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp frequently clashed with Gaffney, at one point  
suggesting the first lady was behind an ongoing investigation into 
whether Mrs. Tripp had violated Maryland's wiretap law with her 
secretly recorded phone calls of Monica Lewinsky that sparked the 
impeachment crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you been given any indication by Maryland authorities  
that they cleared you of any criminal wrongdoing?'' Gaffney asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, certainly not,'' Mrs. Tripp retorted. ``Mrs. Clinton  
hasn't allowed them to do that yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During two hours of cross-examination Wednesday, Mrs. Tripp said  
she had heard from ``press sources'' that ``Mrs. Clinton and her 
people had'' contacted Maryland political figures to get the 
wiretap probe started. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no pressure put on this office by anybody,'' Steven  
Halpert, a law clerk in the Maryland prosecutor's office, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's testimony came in a lawsuit filed by Judicial  
Watch, a conservative group that has sued the Clinton 
administration over the White House's gathering of hundreds of FBI 
background files of Republican appointees. Mrs. Clinton is a 
defendant in the lawsuit. Mrs. Tripp worked in the White House 
counsel's office before being transferred to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton's impeachment trial did not come up, his lawyers  
could display snippets of Mrs. Tripp's videotaped testimony later 
in the trial if they get permission from senators to bring in 
outside evidence. Presidential lawyer David Kendall declined 
comment Friday on that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's spokesman, Philip Coughter, said ``Mr. Gaffney's  
performance was of a piece with the White House tactics we have 
seen over and over again and which we have come to deplore -- 
namely, attempts to shift the focus from those who may have 
committed crimes to those who may have witnessed them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney repeatedly asked questions that touched on Mrs. Tripp's  
secret tape-recorded phone calls of Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm advising my client not to make any further comment ...  
because it could tend to incriminate her,'' interrupted Tripp 
lawyer Anthony Zaccagnini. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will you say for the record?'' Gaffney pressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``That I don't acknowledge the existence of tapes,'' Mrs. Tripp  
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't acknowledge the existence of tapes you may have  
made?'' Gaffney asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Mrs. Tripp replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney frequently challenged Mrs. Tripp's credibility, noting  
that she now says she saw a document with Mrs. Clinton's 
handwriting on it directing the 1993 firings of the White House 
travel office staff but did not mention the document in past 
testimony. No such document has been found. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not lie under oath,'' but ``I was not complete under  
oath,'' Mrs. Tripp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney suggested that Mrs. Tripp, contrary to her grand jury  
testimony in the Lewinsky case, had been working on a book project 
on the Clinton White House that she says she dropped in 1996 and 
never rekindled. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney produced a transcript of a tape-recorded conversation  
between Ms. Goldberg and Mrs. Tripp in September 1997 in which Mrs. 
Tripp talks about having renewed the abandoned book project. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I represented to Lucianne that day and what was true are  
two separate things,'' Mrs. Tripp said, explaining she actually had 
not renewed work on the book. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you weren't telling Ms. Goldberg the truth there; is that  
fair to say?'' asked Gaffney. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's correct,'' Mrs. Tripp replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney asked her whether she is sending fund-raising letters  
``to people who one might expect to be hostile to the Clintons'' in 
order to raise money for her legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they get their lists from the DNC (Democratic  
National Committee),'' Mrs. Tripp snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney then asked whether anyone had offered to ``pay your  
legal fees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp retorted that she did not have a ``Walter Kaye,''  
referring to the wealthy New York businessman and Democratic Party 
donor who was befriended by Mrs. Clinton and who helped place Ms. 
Lewinsky in the White House intern program.

<HEADLINE> Right-to-Die Case To Be Appealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Gov. Jim Gilmore plans to appeal a  
decision to award legal costs to a woman who fought the state in 
order to remove her brain-damaged husband's feeding tube. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Frank Hoss Jr. erred on Nov. 25 in telling the  
state to pay $13,000 in legal costs to Michele Finn, a statement 
released Thursday by Gilmore's press secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	A notice of intent to appeal will be filed with the Virginia  
Supreme Court as soon as Hoss enters his final order, which was 
expected today, said David Botkins, a spokesman for Attorney 
General Mark Earley. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore's spokesman, Mark Miner, declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Greg Murphy, Mrs. Finn's attorney, said he wasn't surprised  
Gilmore's ``baseless positions and maliciousness in interfering 
with Hugh Finn's family appears to know no boundaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Finn, 44, died Oct. 9 at a Manassas nursing home, eight  
days after the feeding tube that had sustained him for 3 1/2 years was 
removed. The former Louisville, Ky., television news anchorman 
suffered a severe brain injury in a 1995 car crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Finn's family lost a court challenge to Mrs. Finn  
over the issue. Hours before the appeal deadline, Gilmore filed an 
emergency motion to stop Mrs. Finn from removing the tube but Hoss 
rejected the case. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 2, the day after the tube was removed, Gilmore asked the  
state Supreme Court to order it reinserted. The court unanimously 
refused.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Production Growth Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a pickup during the last few months of  
the year, growth in production at the nation's factories, mines and 
utilities declined in 1998 to the slowest pace in five years, 
reflecting economic turmoil abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial production increased 0.2 percent in December from the  
month before and 3.7 percent in 1998 from the year before, the 
Federal Reserve said today. The latter was the slowest rate of 
increase since a 3.5 percent gain in 1993 and followed a robust 6 
percent advance in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	American manufacturers were hard hit by loss of export sales to  
Asian nations and other countries hard-hit by the slump that began 
in Thailand in mid-1997, spread through Asia and has since hit both 
Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	But, there were some signs of recovery during the final three  
months of the year. Industrial production advanced at a 3.2 percent 
annual rate after a gain at a meager 0.9 percent rate in the 
July-September quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The pickup occurred even though output at utilities declined at  
a 12.5 percent annual rate during the quarter, the result of 
unusually mild weather. Just at factories, the production pace 
picked up from 0.4 percent in the third quarter to 5.1 percent in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the acceleration in manufacturing reflected a rebound at  
auto manufacturing plants following strikes that idled General 
Motors in June and July. Nevertheless, the output of other 
manufacturing industries grew at a 3.3 percent rate in the fourth 
quarter after little change in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in December, manufacturing output increased 0.1 percent,  
mining output -- including oil wells -- fell 0.6 percent and utility 
production rebounded 1.6 percent after steep drops during October 
and November. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, as output growth slowed, industrial companies  
continued to expand their capacity to produce at a brisk rate. It 
rose 5 percent, the third consecutive year at 5 percent or better. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, industrial firms had excess capacity. They were  
using 80.9 percent of it, the lowest level since October 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, some industries -- such as manufacturers of  
computers and office equipment -- continued to expand rapidly. 
Output grew 54.1 percent from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the 
fourth quarter of 1998. It rose 29.2 percent for semiconductors and 
28.5 percent for home electronic equipment but fell 13 percent for 
iron and steel, 8.7 percent for tobacco, 7.4 percent for oil and 
gas, 5.9 percent for apparel and 2.1 percent for chemical products. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department said today that inventories  
at American businesses rose a moderate 0.4 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted $1.09 trillion in November, in line with an identical gain 
in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say backlogs of unsold goods were relatively lean  
heading into 1999. Too big a buildup can signal production cutbacks 
as businesses work to reduce backlogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Business sales rose 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted $785  
billion. There were enough goods on shelves and backlots to meet 
demand for 1.39 months at the current sales pace, the same as the 
previous two months.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market ended a four-day losing streak

throughout Latin America, most importantly to Mexico, a key U.S.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The deputy director of the Central  
Intelligence Agency met Friday with Colombia's defense minister and 
armed forces chief. 
</P>
<P>
	A CIA spokesman in Washington would not confirm the arrival  
Thursday of Air Force Gen. John Gordon, the agency's number two in 
command, and the U.S. Embassy had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Colombian military chief, Gen. Fernando Tapias, told  
reporters on Friday he and Gordon discussed intelligence 
cooperation on stemming arms smuggling and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said the Bogota visit was part  
of a normal exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA is playing a growing role in U.S. efforts to stem drug  
trafficking worldwide and Colombia is the world's largest cocaine

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Twenty prisoners, including 15 suspected drug  
traffickers and two leftist rebels, escaped from a Peruvian jungle 
prison through a tunnel equipped with lights, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners fled through the 100-foot tunnel from San Jacinto  
prison in Iquitos, 620 miles northeast of Lima, a police spokesman 
in Iquitos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards did not realize the men had escaped on Wednesday until  
they did a prisoner head count the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have recaptured three of the prisoners and have set up  
checkpoints at exit routes from Iquitos, which is surrounded by the 
Amazon jungle. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru has fought a bloody war against leftist rebels that has  
left 30,000 dead since 1980, but has wound down in recent years. 
Peru is also one of the world's largest producers of coca, which is 
used to make cocaine.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Twenty men posing as police  
invaded an airport in Rio de Janeiro state, making off with almost 
half a million dollars, local press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with rifles and submachine guns, the band of thieves stole  
at least $485,000 from two planes owned by Brazil's Central Bank at 
Campos airport, 180 miles northeast of Rio. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, pretending to be searching for drugs, reportedly took  
the airport's security chief hostage and cut phone lines before 
escaping by car. An armored car driver was seriously injured in a 
shoot-out between the gang and airport security guards.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian government on Friday  
auctioned off two concessions that will allow private telephone 
companies to compete with the recently privatized national 
telephone company formerly known as Telebras. 
</P>
<P>
	A consortium led by Britain's National Grid, which includes  
Sprint and France Telecom, made the only bid of $37 million to 
provide long distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will compete with former federal long distance  
carrier Embratel, purchased by MCI International in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also awarded a concession to a consortium led by  
Bell Canada and WLL International Inc. to provide fixed-line phone 
service in 16 Brazilian states. The company paid $41.3 million for 
the concession. 
</P>
<P>
	This new company, named Canbra, will compete with the Tele Norte  
Leste, bought in July by a group headed by Brazilian construction 
company Andrade Gutierrez.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Police searched a remote wooded  
area in Minas Gerais state Friday for a man accused of killing five 
of his seven children, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police allege Adao Rocha Ferreira, a 48-year-old farm hand,  
poisoned his five children, aged between 3 and 11, and dumped their 
bodies in the woods near his home. 
</P>
<P>
	His two other children, who he allegedly bludgeoned with an ax,  
are hospitalized with serious head injuries, but are expected to 
survive, said police spokesman Mauricio Jose de Almeida Silva. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of the children, who are believed to have died Jan.  
5, were discovered by a neighbor Wednesday, a few miles from the 
family's home in Ladainha, about 240 miles from Rio.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- After five days of anti-government  
protests by students and union members, the government said Friday 
it was willing to meet with union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests, led by Ecuador's largest labor federation, were  
against President Jamil Mahuad's decision to slash subsidies on 
electricity, diesel oil and cooking gas, causing prices to soar. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters are demanding Mahuad freeze fuel prices and  
eliminate a 1 percent tax on all bank transactions that went into 
effect Jan. 1. They have threatened a national strike. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the second major strike against Mahuad, a political  
centrist who five months ago inherited an economy in shambles and a 
massive budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's economy was battered in 1998 by El Nino-powered  
floods, the global financial crisis, and the low price of oil, its 
main export.

<P>
	COLUMBUS, N.M. (AP) -- In a town with a two-man police force, the  
news from the training academy was particularly troubling: Officers 
Salvador Montes and Jose Ojeda had both flunked out. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were sent home from the academy after failing the  
physical pre-assessment requirements, Mayor Ken Riley said. 
Although both have returned to duty, they can only do clerical 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves exactly zero officers to patrol the streets.  
</P>
<P>
	Montes and Ojeda were hired on the condition they be fully  
certified by June. While they could re-enter the academy in April, 
neither would graduate until August.

officers even if they graduate in the summer, Riley said.

<HEADLINE> Coaches: Shrine Game Is Relevant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- The East-West Shrine Bowl, which once  
showcased college stars such as John Elway and Brett Favre, is 
missing many top names this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, only one first-team All American was on the roster for  
today's game. But the 74th edition of the Shrine game still 
attracts plenty of NFL coaches and scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro coaches say the Shrine game remains relevant, even if some  
of college football's biggest stars have been siphoned off by 
competing all-star games and by agents who have convinced players 
they should wait until the NFL combine and not risk injury in 
all-star games. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL coaches say today's game is still valuable for players  
hoping to be picked later in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a one-person draft. There are 350 guys who are going  
to get drafted. We're talking about those guys who are going to get 
drafted in the fourth or fifth round. And even if a guy doesn't get 
drafted, we might want to sign him as a free agent,'' Oakland 
Raiders defensive coordinator Willie Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a chance to get a first-hand look at them. You see the  
guy live and see how he responds to coaching. You get a couple of 
minutes to talk with them, and you can look them right in the 
eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Shrine game used to attract the nation's top stars. Previous  
winners of the game's outstanding offensive player award have 
included Don Meredith (1960), Roger Staubach (1965), Elway (1983) 
and Favre (1991). 
</P>
<P>
	The only first-team All American in the game this year is  
defensive end Montae Reagor of Texas Tech. Among the biggest names 
are quarterback Michael Bishop of Kansas State, a runner-up in the 
Heisman Trophy voting, and Ohio State quarterback Joe Germaine. 
</P>
<P>
	But UCLA quarterback Cade McNown, who originally committed to  
play in the Shrine game, dropped out on the advice of his agent and 
will be playing in the Senior Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, who shared the sidelines this week with NFL coaches such  
as Cincinnati's Bruce Coslet, San Francisco's Steve Mariucci, 
Pittsburgh's Bill Cowher and Indianapolis' Jim Mora, said the 
Shrine game is not about players such as McNown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never been for the Cade McNowns. It's the other guys that  
it's all about,'' said Shaw, who had to miss today's game because 
he'll be en route to coach in the Senior Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	A new all-star game today in Florida further diluted the talent  
pool available to the Shrine game. The inaugural All-Star Gridiron 
Classic in Orlando was to feature Daunte Culpepper, considered by 
many as the nation's top college quarterback, as Team Florida faced 
Team USA in a game run by the Florida Rotary Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shrine game rosters are particularly thin at running back.  
The most notable running back on the East squad is Georgia's 
Olandis Gary and on the West it's Jamie Kimbrough of Fresno State -- 
neither is a household name. 
</P>
<P>
	But the game can be an important showcase for players on the  
fringes of NFL teams' draft lists. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Tillman of Arizona State, thought by many scouts to be too  
small to play in the NFL, drew some attention at last year's Shrine 
game when he shared the outstanding defensive player award with Jim 
Nelson of Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	Tillman went on to become a seventh-round draft pick and was a  
starter this season for the Arizona Cardinals.

<HEADLINE> Old Essay Haunts Microsoft Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's first witness at its antitrust  
trial gave ground at the end of his opening week on the stand, 
confronted by government lawyers with an essay he wrote 16 years 
ago that appeared to contradict his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``My immediate reaction is, what could I have been thinking?''  
economist Richard Schmalensee said Thursday. ``But I'm happy to 
discuss it. ... It does not provide a good indication of my present 
views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology, testified that Microsoft's high profits are not 
sufficient evidence alone to conclude that the software giant 
wields monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies showed Schmalensee a 1982  
essay in the Harvard Law Review in which he wrote that 
``persistent, excess profits provide a good indication of long-run 
power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft used its influence as the  
maker of the dominant Windows operating system to try to ``crush'' 
rival Netscape Communications Corp., whose popular Internet 
software competes with Microsoft's. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the government's most sensational charges is that  
Microsoft sought illegally to divide the market for Internet 
software during a June 1995 meeting with Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has called the charge ``an  
outrageous lie,'' saying the meeting ``was to discuss various 
technologies Microsoft proposed sharing with Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just before it ended the presentation of its case Wednesday, the  
government released more than 2,000 pages of documents, including 
some e-mail messages about the June 1995 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In one exchange, Microsoft's Dan Rosen told Gates that during  
the meeting Netscape ``seemed OK'' with the company's plans to 
build Internet software features into Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But co-worker Thomas Reardon, who also was at the meeting,  
called Rosen's assessment ``bunk'' and told Gates, ``There was a 
noticeable increase in the level of tension'' on that subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates wrote to another executive praising Reardon for ``reading  
the situation pretty well,'' and he called Rosen's opinions 
``great, but I agree he is being a little naive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another e-mail, Paul Maritz, a senior Microsoft executive,  
wrote five weeks after the meeting confirming that the company had 
intended ``to leverage a relationship with Netscape ... to cede the 
(browser) to us or at least give us some major advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Rosen wrote: ``If no agreement, we should gear up  
to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Maritz and Rosen are expected to testify for Microsoft in  
the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, the government turned its attention again to  
what is happening behind the scenes at the trial, quizzing 
Schmalensee about his conversations outside the courtroom during 
breaks in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange followed a contentious hearing when U.S. District  
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson prohibited Microsoft lawyers -- over 
their objections -- from talking to their own witnesses outside 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said in a private meeting with lawyers late Wednesday  
that he worried about Microsoft ``woodshedding a witness.'' The 
Associated Press obtained transcripts of the meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want witnesses, when they are on cross-examination  
... to be conferring during recesses and overnight adjournments to 
improve the quality of their testimony,'' Jackson said, adding he 
was unclear about such matters ``until my court of appeals told me 
that I was wrong in a criminal case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue could become important when the government next week  
begins questioning some of Microsoft's top executives, who will not 
be able to talk to lawyers until afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue surfaced after Schmalensee acknowledged talking with a  
Microsoft lawyer and later with an economics colleague during 
breaks in the trial and using information they provided in his 
testimony.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Reliever Heathcliff Slocumb and the Baltimore  
Orioles agreed Friday to a $1.1 million, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Slocumb, 32, was 2-5 with three saves in four chances and a 5.32  
ERA in 57 games last season with the Seattle Mariners. The 
right-hander had a 2.65 ERA in his final 31 appearances.

<P>
	Slocumb has a 23-31 career record with 95 saves in 125 chances

	``We are pleased to be able to add Heathcliff to our bullpen,''  
Orioles general manager Frank Wren said. ``He has a tremendous arm 
and has proven to be very durable throughout his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his base salary, Slocumb can earn $350,000 in

<HEADLINE> Larry Flynt Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt was  
hospitalized with pneumonia after winning a conditional delay in 
his obscenity trial because of planned surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt was in intensive care at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, said one  
of his lawyers, Alan Isaacman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Flynt is doing fine. His prognosis is excellent,'' a Los  
Angeles-based spokeswoman told The Associated Press late Thursday 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, 55, and his brother, Jimmy, 49, were indicted April 7 on  
charges of pandering obscenity, disseminating material harmful to a 
juvenile, conspiracy and engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from the alleged sale of a sexually explicit  
video to a 14-year-old boy at the Hustler Magazine &AMP; Gifts store 
that Jimmy Flynt manages. If convicted, each brother could get 24 
years in prison and $65,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers successfully filed a motion earlier this week  
seeking a continuance in the Flynts' trial, saying Larry Flynt 
needed surgery for a urological problem common among paraplegics. 
The trial in Cincinnati had been scheduled to begin Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt has been in a wheelchair since he was shot in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Only 62 Players File Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just 62 players, the second-lowest total in 20 years, filed for  
salary arbitration as nine players agreed to contracts just before 
the deadline Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees stars Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte and Mariano  
Rivera were the biggest names to file, along with Texas pitchers 
Rick Helling and Aaron Sele. Barring settlements, they'll exchange 
figures with their teams Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1979, when 40 players filed, the only year fewer players  
went to arbitration was 1995. Following the 232-day strike, just 56 
players filed and only eight had hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Most players who file settle before their cases are heard. Just  
eight were decided by arbitrators last year, with owners winning 
five. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Los Angeles Dodgers players settled before the deadline,  
with pitcher Carlos Perez getting a $15.5 million, three-year 
contract. Ismael Valdes ($4,275,000) and outfielder Todd 
Hollandsworth ($850,000) got one-year deals. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis agreed to a $1.8 million, two-year contract with  
left-hander Lance Painter and a $550,000, one-year contract with 
right-hander Alan Benes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Curtis Leskanic got a $2.6 million, two-year deal with  
Colorado, and Albie Lopez, another reliever, agreed to a $1.35 
million, two-year contract with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Infielder David Bell agreed to a two-year contract with Seattle  
that is worth $1,775,000, and outfielder Roger Cedeno and the New 
York Mets agreed to a $487,500, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati right-hander Jason Bere became the first of the  
players who filed to settle, agreeing to a $1.2 million, one-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-one players filed Friday and joined Toronto first baseman  
Carlos Delgado, who filed Thursday. Because of Monday's Martin 
Luther King holiday, all will exchange numbers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets and the Houston Astros had the most players filing, six  
each, followed by the Rangers with five. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the decrease in the overall total -- a record 161 were in  
arbitration in 1990 and the total topped 100 from 1986 through 1993 
-- is due to clubs releasing and threatening to release marginal 
players rather than arbitrate with them. As a result, more than 
half of the players who filed -- 33 -- were eligible for arbitration 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them are seven of the so-called ``Super Twos,'' those with  
2-3 years of major league service who became eligible for 
arbitration under the 1990 lockout settlement. Among them are 
Helling, Houston closer Billy Wagner, St. Louis shortstop Edgar 
Renteria and Montreal starter Dustin Hermanson, all set to receive 
huge raises. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the 1996 collective bargaining agreement, 75 percent  
of cases will be scheduled for three-man arbitration panels and 25 
percent for single arbitrators. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new twist, the labor lawyers in the commissioner's office  
have asked teams to confer with them before settling arbitration 
cases to give them a chance to argue against agreements they think 
are too high. But the process isn't mandatory and some clubs won't 
follow it. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, two free agents found new teams Friday. Pitcher Mike  
Mohler and St. Louis agreed to a one-year contract, while infielder 
Luis Rivera and Anaheim agreed to a minor league deal.

<HEADLINE>  Hall Wants Divorce From Mick Jagger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Mick Jagger once lamented that he ``can't get no  
satisfaction'' but Jerry Hall's decision Friday to file divorce 
papers against him apparently centered on the fact that the Rolling 
Stones star has been getting way too much. 
</P>
<P>
	In what could be the most expensive divorce in British history,  
Ms. Hall's lawyers announced Friday that she has initiated 
proceedings to end their tumultuous eight-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas-born model has put up with years of Jagger's  
well-publicized infidelities but apparently considered the latest 
reports that he had impregnated a Brazilian model too much to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody really knows: She wasn't talking.  
</P>
<P>
	The law firm Mishcon de Reya said it had filed divorce papers on  
her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no further comment at this stage,'' said Mishcon de  
Reya, which also represented Princess Diana in her divorce from 
Prince Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm won a $28 million judgment for Diana in 1996, but  
newspaper speculation said Ms. Hall, 42, would seek at least $49.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Princess Diana's divorce was the most expensive recorded  
divorce in Britain,'' divorce lawyer Mark Stephens of London-based 
Stephens Innocent said Friday. He said some private settlements 
have probably exceeded that figure, but were likely not above the 
amount Ms. Hall is said to be seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall and Jagger have lived together since the late 1970s and  
married in 1990. They have four children -- Elizabeth, 14, James, 
13, Georgia May, 6, and 1-year-old Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at the Rolling Stones' London office, who declined  
to give her name, said Jagger had no immediate comment on the legal 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall has previously threatened to divorce Jagger, 55, over a  
number of well-publicized indiscretions -- the latest involving a 
Brazilian model, Luciana Gimenez Morad, who claims she is pregnant 
with his child. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple first separated in 1992 after the Rolling Stones  
frontman was linked to Italian model Carla Bruni. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose we will divorce,'' Ms. Hall was quoted as saying.  
``It's very heartbreaking.'' Months later, however, she and Jagger 
flew off for a vacation together and she soon publicly forgave him. 
</P>
<P>
	More trouble brewed two years ago after Jagger was linked to a  
string of women, including actress Uma Thurman and model Nicole 
Kruk. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall consulted Mishcon de Reya, but never filed divorce  
papers. Jagger wooed her with flowers, love notes and presents and, 
a year later, their son Gabriel was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall recently explained that staying jealous is the secret  
of keeping a marriage alive, adding, ``I don't remember anything 
bad for very long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger was divorced from his first wife, Bianca, in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Proposes New Sports Stadiums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The mayor wants to lure the New York Jets from  
their New Jersey home with a massive sports and convention center 
along the banks of the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
	In a plan outlined Thursday to the City Council, Rudolph  
Giuliani called for development of a domed stadium and a new 
Madison Square Garden in a mostly industrial neighborhood on 
Manhattan's West Side. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would become the most famous sports facility in the  
world,'' the mayor said of what would be a sprawling complex he 
hopes would attract big conventions, concerts and sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani didn't provide many details. He didn't put a price tag  
on the project or set a date when it might be built. He suggested 
only a vague outline of how the development would be funded, 
through a combination of public and private dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	If completed, he said the project would provide an opportunity  
to win back the Jets, the professional football team that left for 
the Meadowlands complex in East Rutherford, N.J., years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets' lease with the Meadowlands runs until 2008. Team owner  
Leon Hess had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also has been negotiating for new stadiums with  
baseball's New York Yankees and Mets. The Mets plan to stay in 
Queens, but Giuliani has faced some of his toughest criticism over 
his willingness to move the Yankees out of the Bronx, a proposal 
reviled by many New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium plan was touted as an alternative to putting the  
Yankees in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Admirals Coach Charged in Scuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- An East Coast Hockey League coach has been  
charged with two counts of assault and battery for a scuffle 
following Sunday's Hampton Roads-Roanoke game. 
</P>
<P>
	The two charges against Hampton Roads coach John Brophy are  
misdemeanors, punishable by up to 12 months in jail and $2,500 fine 
for each count, said Commonwealth's Attorney Don Caldwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldwell said a review of a videotape of the scuffle showed that  
Brody pushed two Roanoke Civic Center security guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my experience ... it would be a fine and probably some  
community service'' for a conviction, Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ECHL earlier suspended Brophy for six games for baiting the  
crowd and and the scuffle. The Admirals lost the game 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Van Hellemond, the league's senior vice president of hockey  
operations, said he accepted Brophy's denial of allegations that 
Brophy spit at two children in Roanoke. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Hellemond said he watched game films showing Brophy's  
departure from the ice and said Brophy's conduct was unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Brophy did not immediately return a telephone call to his office  
seeking comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Admirals general manager and assistant coach Al MacIsaac said he  
was disappointed with the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's saying what John did was right or wrong, but six  
games is a long suspension,'' MacIsaac said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brophy will not coach the Admirals' next four games, beginning  
Friday. He also will be suspended for games with Roanoke at home on 
March 26 and at Roanoke on April 2. He is barred from even 
attending the game in Roanoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Hellemond said Thursday that he also told Roanoke officials  
to ``get rid of'' the public address announcer, whom he said had 
inflamed the crowd by announcing that Brophy had spit at children. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Hellemond said Brophy lingered on the ice and in the walkway  
leading to the Admirals' dressing room and gestured toward the 
crowd in Roanoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``He raises his finger, some people said in an obscene gesture,  
but I couldn't tell,'' Van Hellemond said. ``Regardless, it was an 
act to get people upset with him again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brophy also shoved a police officer who had put his arm around  
him and said, ``We've got to get you out of here,'' Van Hellemond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gives me the impression he was looking for a  
confrontation,'' Van Hellemond said. ``We don't condone that and 
don't want that to be the norm.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons Line Revels in Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons defensive line would  
have been a perfect candidate for one of those American Express 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	It could go something like this: ``You may not know our names,  
but we're a major reason our team is playing Sunday for the NFC 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collectively, ends Chuck Smith and Lester Archambeau and tackles  
Shane Dronett and Travis Hall are regarded as one of the best units 
in the NFL, but that hasn't done much to get them noticed 
individually. 
</P>
<P>
	Not one of them has ever played in the Pro Bowl. Smith and Hall  
were overlooked last year, even though they combined for 22 1/2 sacks. 
Archambeau had a career-high 10 sacks this season and wasn't even 
mentioned as an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
	Even their own coach seems to be in the dark about these guys.  
Dan Reeves insists on pronouncing Dronett's name ``Droe-nay,'' even 
though it's actually ``Droe-net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When the head coach calls your name, you let him call you  
whatever you want,'' Archambeau said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, the line decided to give themselves a nickname,  
hoping that would improve their recognition factor. They settled on 
the Bomb Squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had been dropping bombs on people for a long time, so we  
thought that would be a fitting name,'' said Smith, senior member 
of the group. ``There wasn't much identity here, so we decided to 
create our own identity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The linemen have thoroughly embraced the philosophy of defensive  
coordinator Rich Brooks, who preaches a ``gap control'' scheme that 
requires players to remain in their assigned lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	While sacks dropped from 55 last season to 38 this season, the  
Falcons ranked second in the league in rushing defense, allowing 
only 75.2 yards per game and 3.3 yards per carry. The most 
impressive stat: Atlanta has allowed only three runs longer than 20 
yards all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is coming together and maturing as players at the  
same time,'' Archambeau said. ``We feed off each other real well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dronett is the biggest surprise of all. He was released by  
Atlanta after four games in 1996, then cut by Detroit the following 
year at the end of preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	His career teetering on the brink, Dronett returned to Atlanta  
only because the team was desperate for depth at the tackle 
position. This season, he was forced into a starting role when Dan 
Owens signed with the Lions and the Falcons failed to sign another 
big-name defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just lucky to finally get a chance to prove myself,''  
Dronett said. ``If I wasn't going to be out there this year, I was 
pretty much going to be a backup forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times, he has been a dominating presence on the interior of  
the line, particularly when Hall was plagued by injuries earlier in 
the season. Dronett had 81 tackles and 6 1/2 sacks and caused four 
fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a first alternate to the Pro Bowl, had another solid  
season with 8 1/2 sacks, a team-high 36 quarterback pressures and four 
fumble recoveries. He has put the rest the stereotype that he was 
too small (6-feet-2, 262 pounds) to play defensive end in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to do with heart, leverage and want to do it,'' Smith  
said. ``Size has nothing to do with anything. We've shown that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive line was one of Reeves' biggest concerns prior to  
the season. He felt confident about his starters, but saw no hope 
of having quality depth. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Burrough, a seventh-round pick in 1995, has played well  
at end, allowing the versatile Archambeau to work some at tackle. 
Free agents Esera Tuaolo and Antonio Edwards have been surprisingly 
effective in reserve roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of those guys are very smart in what they do. They  
anticipate and know formations. They don't just worry about their 
job, they worry about the overall picture,'' Reeves said. ``What we 
thought was a major concern has probably been one of the strengths 
of our defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if they can just get some recognition for it.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not been a better defensive line in the last three  
years,'' Smith said, ``than us.''

<HEADLINE> Verdict Overturned on Race Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Some say the case was racially charged from the  
beginning: Samuel LaFaille, a black man, was accused of shooting a 
white man in the leg during a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight outside a Somerville restaurant erupted after LaFaille  
and some friends, also black, allegedly harassed a group of white 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	LaFaille was convicted in the December 1993 shooting and served  
a jail sentence. But the state Appeals Court overturned the verdict 
Thursday, saying the original judge wrongly ignored a defense 
request to screen prospective jurors for racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records show one potential juror told the judge: ``I have  
a daughter who last year was ... accosted by a black person ... 
somebody looking very much like that ... and I don't feel very 
objective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts, judges are required to ask potential jurors  
about their feelings on race in cases of interracial murder and 
rape and in cases of child sexual assault where the victim and 
accused are different races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the crime did not involve either murder or rape, it  
did involve potential interracial murder and sexual overtones,'' 
wrote Appeals Court Judge Frederick Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	LaFaille was convicted of assault and battery with a dangerous  
weapon and sentenced to four years in prison in the shooting of 
Timothy Taddia. He has been released. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Martin Leppo, who represented LaFaille, said the ruling  
could be appealed, the case could be retried, LaFaille could strike 
a deal with prosecutors for a reduced conviction or the case could 
be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Middlesex District Attorney spokesman Anson Kaye said  
prosecutors were reviewing their options.

<HEADLINE>  Hall Wants Divorce From Mick Jagger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Mick Jagger once lamented that he ``can't get no  
satisfaction'' but Jerry Hall's decision Friday to file divorce 
papers against him apparently centered on the fact that the Rolling 
Stones star has been getting way too much. 
</P>
<P>
	In what could be the most expensive divorce in British history,  
Ms. Hall's lawyers announced Friday that she has initiated 
proceedings to end their tumultuous eight-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas-born model has put up with years of Jagger's  
well-publicized infidelities but apparently considered the latest 
reports that he had impregnated a Brazilian model too much to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody really knows: She wasn't talking.  
</P>
<P>
	The law firm Mishcon de Reya said it had filed divorce papers on  
her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no further comment at this stage,'' said Mishcon de  
Reya, which also represented Princess Diana in her divorce from 
Prince Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm won a $28 million judgment for Diana in 1996, but  
newspaper speculation said Ms. Hall, 42, would seek at least $49.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Princess Diana's divorce was the most expensive recorded  
divorce in Britain,'' divorce lawyer Mark Stephens of London-based 
Stephens Innocent said Friday. He said some private settlements 
have probably exceeded that figure, but were likely not above the 
amount Ms. Hall is said to be seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall and Jagger have lived together since the late 1970s and  
married in 1990. They have four children -- Elizabeth, 14, James, 
13, Georgia May, 6, and 1-year-old Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at the Rolling Stones' London office, who declined  
to give her name, said Jagger had no immediate comment on the legal 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall has previously threatened to divorce Jagger, 55, over a  
number of well-publicized indiscretions -- the latest involving a 
Brazilian model, Luciana Gimenez Morad, who claims she is pregnant 
with his child.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises as Stocks Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the  
euro Friday on the back of strong rallies in the U.S. and Brazilian 
stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were cheered by news that Brazil's government decided  
to stop spending heavily to prop its currency, the real, in world 
financial markets. The move is seen as a way for Brazil to attract 
foreign investment and save its currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose 8 percent against the real and gained against  
its other major counterparts. The dollar's gains were aided by a 33 
percent surge in Brazil's main stock exchange and a 220-point gain 
in the Dow Jones industrial average, which ended four straight days 
of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1588, down  
from $1.1710 late Thursday. The U.S. currency also was quoted at 
114.13 Japanese yen, up from 113.61 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.3833 Swiss francs, up from  
1.3583, and 1.5243 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5333. The British 
pound fell to $1.6518 from $1.6567. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6878 German 
marks, up from 1.6703; 5.6593 French francs, up from 5.6022; and 
1,672.24 Italian lire, down from 1,652.89.

<HEADLINE> Gymnast Moceanu To Resume Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Saying she is ``psyched about life now  
finally,'' Dominique Moceanu has switched coaches, will resume 
training on Monday and plans to compete in the U.S. championships 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old gymnast has emerged from an emotional  
three-month legal fight to free herself from the control of her 
father and seems happy and at ease with her situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like I took the weight of the world on my shoulders but  
I'm happy about it because I feel like I know what's going on in my 
life. I'm actually controlling my life,'' she said in an interview 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu was at Arizona State University for her first public  
appearance since her successful effort to be declared an adult made 
national headlines. She will sign autographs before Saturday 
night's Reese's Gymnastics Cup but will not take part in the event 
because she hasn't trained since last October. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a sense of relief because I don't feel controlled and  
hovered over,'' she said. ``It's something I can't explain. I'm 
trying to put those memories behind and move into the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, a judge in Houston ordered Moceanu's father,  
Dumitru, not to have any contact with her for a year. She says she 
is living alone in an apartment in Houston and plans to begin 
classes at a junior college next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father called her once, in apparent violation of the court  
order, but has had no other contact with her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's over with and hopefully he can deal with it, but I  
don't know how it is,'' she said. ``He keeps wanting to appeal and 
do all this stuff and it's just wasting everybody's money and time. 
He just needs to put it behind him and deal with it and accept 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she still talks regularly with her mother, sister and  
other members of her mother's side of the family. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad's side of the family condemns me and blames me but I  
have to deal with that and I have to go on,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the public reaction she's received, she said, has been  
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of it was critical but I expected that,'' she said.  
``Nobody really understood what pressure situation I was at to make 
some of the decisions I had to make. Nobody will ever know and it's 
hard for me to explain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had been living off the $10,000 she earned in last year's  
Goodwill Games but says she is making money again for appearances. 
There is nothing left in the trust fund that was established for 
her by her father, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to start over now and that's fine,'' she said. ``I  
think I've learned early what it's like to fall down and pick 
yourself back up and fall down and pick yourself back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu now stands 5-feet-2, taller than Olympic teammates  
Shannon Miller and Jaycie Phelps, who greeted her with hugs and 
laughter for Friday's pre-meet gathering. Moceanu is 10 inches 
taller than the 4-foot-4 14-year-old who captivated millions during 
the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she has split with her coach of last year, Luminita  
Miscenco, because Miscenco decided to move to Oklahoma in the wake 
of the tense court battle. Among other things, Moceanu's father is 
accused of attempting to hire a hit man to kill Miscenco and a 
friend of Moceanu's. 
</P>
<P>
	``She felt really pressured in Houston,'' Moceanu said. ``She  
just wanted to leave it behind her for the time being. We have no 
hard feelings. At one point we were just so fed up because we were 
stressed, but that doesn't mean we don't miss each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu said she couldn't leave Houston and ``not have any  
family, or what's left of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She will be reunited with Alexander Alexandrov, who was her  
coach in 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu says she is confident that she can be a better gymnast  
than ever, especially since her performances last year in the 
Goodwill Games and U.S. championships were the best of her career. 
</P>
<P>
	``That showed me that I still had it in me,'' Moceanu said. ``I  
still had the talent, and I've grown. I've even grown since I've 
been off. I feel so tall. I'm used to being itty-bitty and I'm not 
itty-bitty anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She wants to compete in this year's world championships, with  
the ultimate goal of making it to the Olympic Games in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps, a close friend, said her parents were nothing but  
supportive and never overbearing in her career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I could have lasted if my parents were like  
hers,'' Phelps said. ``She's a tough, tough girl.''

<HEADLINE> Senators To Appear on Weekend Shows </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although the impeachment trial won't be in  
session Sunday, the public can catch nearly one-fifth of those 
standing in judgment of the president talking about it on the TV 
talk show circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	While required to remain silent inside the chamber ``on pain of  
imprisonment'' during the trial, at least 18 of the 100 senators 
were lined up for Sunday TV appearances as of Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Meet the Press'' has the most, six, followed by ``Fox  
News Sunday'' with four. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those making the rounds are Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.;  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.; Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.; Phil 
Gramm, R-Texas; and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.

<HEADLINE> Leskanic in $2.6M Deal With Rockies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Reliever Curtis Leskanic avoided arbitration  
Friday, agreeing to a $2.6 million, two-year contract with Colorado 
Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're look forward to having Curtis continue to be a strong  
pillar in our bullpen,'' Rockies general manager Bob Gebhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leskanic will get $1.05 million this year and $1.45 million in  
2000. Colorado has a $1.6 million option for 2001 with $100,000 
buyout, and the option would increase to as much as $4 million if 
Leskanic is the team's closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Leskanic, the last Colorado player eligible for arbitration,  
made $730,000 last season, and had sought a deal worth nearly $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Leskanic has been with the Rockies since their inaugural season  
in 1993, going 25-18. He is the team's career strikeout leader with 
338 and has 20 career saves. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 6-4 with two saves and a 4.40 ERA last year. He also set  
a team record by pitching 21 1-3 scoreless innings from July 1 to 
Aug. 24.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Virus Vaccine Tests Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers report some laboratory success of  
a vaccine that attacks HIV at a vulnerable moment of the deadly 
virus' infection cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies at the University of Montana, researchers developed  
antibodies in mice that attacked HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, 
just as the virus was in the process of fusing with target cells. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the study was being published today in the journal  
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	This fusion process, the researchers said, exposed HIV molecules  
that are not open to attack at other times in the infection cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	These molecules were then injected into laboratory mice. The  
injected mice, which had been genetically manipulated to respond to 
HIV, made antibodies against the fusion molecules. 
</P>
<P>
	When tested in laboratory dishes against actual samples of HIV,  
the mouse antibodies were able to neutralize 23 of 24 strains of 
the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana researchers said the study shows an encouraging new  
approach to HIV vaccine but the substances in the laboratory 
studies could not be used safely in humans. Also, it is not certain 
if humans could develop antibodies such as those produced by the 
laboratory mice, the researchers said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Mourners Pay Tribute to Slain Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Police searched for a man wanted for  
questioning in the killing of an 8-year-old witness while mourners 
paid tribute to the boy and his mother, both gunned down in front 
of their home last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Peeler, a 22-year-old escapee from a halfway house, was  
being sought for questioning in the shooting of Leroy Brown Jr. and 
Karen Clarke, in addition to escape and weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler is the brother of Russell Peeler, a man Leroy was  
scheduled to testify against in a murder case before he was killed 
a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler, who had been out on bond and was being monitored  
by an electronic bracelet at the time of Leroy's killing, was 
apprehended early Thursday and put back behind bars on an unrelated 
weapons charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy was the key witness in the case against the 26-year-old  
Peeler, accused of gunning down Clarke's fiance, Rudolph Snead, Jr. 
The slayings of the boy and his mother have prompted a public 
outcry to improve the state's protection of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday, a dozen members of Leroy's basketball team,  
wearing the blue jerseys of the Bridgeport Boys &AMP; Girls Club squad, 
filed past the gold satin-lined casket of the boy affectionately 
known as ``BJ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His cousin Xavier White, 9, carried a blue and white basketball,  
signed by the players, which they planned to present to Leroy's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was nice. I don't know why anybody would want to do that to  
him,'' Xavier said during funeral services at the Refuge Temple 
Church of God. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were among about 500 mourners who packed the church,  
where inside the two caskets were separated by a tall bouquet of 
flowers. Embroidered in Leroy's casket were the words ``Going 
Home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mother and son were to be buried near her family's home in  
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Lodish on Verge of Making History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- With one more victory, in Sunday's AFC  
championship game, a Denver Broncos veteran would become the only 
player in NFL history to play in six Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	No, it's not John Elway, although Elway would, if the Broncos  
can beat the New York Jets, become the first quarterback to start 
in five Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle Mike Lodish is among nine NFL players to have  
appeared in five Super Bowls, and he's one step away from No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be a trivia question,'' Lodish said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lodish went to four straight Super Bowls with the Buffalo Bills  
and added his fifth with the champion Broncos last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor,'' Lodish said, ``and on Sunday I'll be thinking  
about all the great players who have made the league what it is and 
never had an opportunity to go to a Super Bowl. And here I am. I 
get a chance to go to six.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other Super-fives are Marv Fleming, Larry Cole, Charles  
Haley, Cliff Harris, D.D. Lewis, Preston Pearson, Charlie Waters 
and Rayfield Wright -- most of them better known than Lodish, a 
nine-year NFL veteran who has had extensive playing experience but 
who has been a full-time starter only one season (1996) and who has 
never been to a Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``After my fourth one, I thought, `How many guys have gone to  
four in a row?' '' said Lodish, Buffalo's 10th-round draft pick out 
of UCLA in 1990. ``And I was one of 20 to go to four. And how many 
have been to five? 
</P>
<P>
	``If we win this game, I think I'm the only guy who can say he  
dressed for six Super Bowls. That would be a miraculous honor. I 
could never ever expect to have had this happen to me. I couldn't 
have dreamed that this would happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This, of course, is Lodish's favorite time of year. He never has  
lost an AFC championship game and knows what kind of effort is 
needed to get to the next step. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a mature enough team to know what it's going to take to  
win at this point in the season,'' he said. ``We've got the talent 
to win, and we've got our confidence back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many Broncos players who dismissed the Jets early in the  
season but began to take notice when the Jets made a late-season 
surge, Lodish is impressed by the opposition. He said Jets 
quarterback Vinny Testaverde presents a different problem than 
Miami's Dan Marino, whom the Broncos contained in last week's 38-3 
playoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any time you get an offensive line protecting your  
quarterback like they do, you're going to take some of the pressure 
off of him to make the play,'' Lodish said. ``It's not like Vinny's 
got a quick release like Marino. They do a lot of play action, 
which slows the defensive line down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vinny has been making good decisions within their offense, and  
he's got good receivers in Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet. We 
had some success against (running back) Curtis Martin when he was 
with New England, but it looks like he's running better in the 
Jets' scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're an excellent team.''

<HEADLINE> Indian Health Service to Get Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration plans to ask  
Congress for $175 million more for the long-neglected Indian Health 
Service, where funding is so short that many health clinics stop 
paying for some basic care part way through the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, the lack of money means postponed gallbladder or  
cataract surgery. Other times, it means a doctor worried about a 
patient's weak heart cannot send the patient to a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do know how to ration care,'' said Yvette Joseph-Fox of  
the Indian Health Board, a private group that represents the 
nation's tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	American Indians and Alaskan native people are entitled to free  
health care under treaties signed with the federal government in 
exchange for land. But that care is far below what is provided to 
poor people in the federal Medicaid program -- not to mention what 
private insurance offers. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's plan comes after criticism from the  
Republican-controlled Congress and Indian groups -- and after 
increased lobbying from Indian groups who have become more savvy at 
working the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Pushed by stepped-up lobbying by Indian groups and major backing  
from Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, President 
Clinton plans to ask Congress for about $175 million more -- an 8 
percent jump over this year's $2.2 billion budget, according to 
administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also wants to increase the rates paid by Medicare  
and Medicaid to reimburse Indian hospitals -- spending that falls 
outside the regular budget. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a striking request for an administration that asked for a  
meager 0.9 percent increase for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should have been embarrassed by what they did last  
year,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, chairman of the House 
subcommittee that appropriates the money. His committee upped the 
administration's request for a $19 million increase to $141 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian system saw healthy budget increases in the early  
1990s, but its budget for the last several years has been stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The ramifications are plain:  
</P>
<P>
	--In 1997, the health service spent an average of $1,382 a person  
-- less than half the $3,261 spent per person nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1982, there were nearly 100 doctors for every 100,000 Indian  
people; by 1994, fewer than 90. That compares with 229 doctors for 
every 100,000 people nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a group with many needs: One in three Indians lives below  
the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are suffering and dying premature deaths, due in large  
part to reductions in Indian Health Service spending,'' Buford L. 
Rolin, chairman of the National Indian Health Board, told a Senate 
committee last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the most sophisticated Indian hospitals must refer patients  
with anything but routine troubles to outside hospitals and 
specialists -- an expensive proposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The crunch is so bad that most clinics run out of money for such  
referrals in the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pain has become the new standard for determining who can  
access basic surgery and other specialized care,'' Rolin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gallup, N.M., the Indian hospital eliminated 20 of its 99  
beds and closed an outlying field clinic that saw 5,100 patients 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Indians realized they needed more effective lobbying. They  
pumped up campaign donations to members of Congress and began 
reaching out to high-level administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates acknowledge that the health service also has work to  
do, such as supplementing federal money by seeking reimbursements 
from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers for eligible patients.

<HEADLINE> Military Institute Lawsuit Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Va. (AP) -- The 9-year-old lawsuit that put an end to  
Virginia Military Institute's male-only admission policy was 
dismissed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Jackson Kiser ruled the state and VMI have  
succeeded with a plan that guarantees equal treatment for women. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the state-supported  
military school to either admit women or give up its state funding. 
The first women entered the school in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those 31 women, 23 made it through the first year. The school  
now has 48 women -- 26 freshman and 22 sophomores -- among its 1,250 
cadets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiser said the Justice Department has filed no objections to  
dropping its lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In another court ruling Friday involving VMI, a state judge  
ruled that the traditional spanking of freshmen by upperclassmen 
violates Virginia's anti-hazing law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm putting you and VMI on notice that this is a corrupt  
practice under state law and it must cease,'' Circuit Judge George 
E. Honts III told cadets in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	But Honts said he would dismiss misdemeanor charges against two  
former VMI cadets if they stayed out of trouble for eight months 
and performed 56 hours each of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Gonzales and Charles Travers Clemons were accused of  
striking George Wade Jr. on the buttocks with belts and coat 
hangers about three times a week in fall 1997 before Wade withdrew 
from VMI. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury indicted the cadets after the Wade family  
complained that VMI officials did not bring administrative hazing 
charges against the cadets. 
</P>
<P>
	VMI spokesman Mike Strickler said school officials have  
repeatedly told cadets that such physical abuse will not be 
tolerated.

<HEADLINE> FDA Discusses Diabetes Drug Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration is asking  
independent experts to review the safety of the popular but 
controversial diabetes drug Rezulin, which it has linked to 32 
deaths from liver failure in the U.S. and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientific advisers to the FDA will review those deaths, and the  
cases of four Americans who have needed liver transplants, during a 
March 26 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin is among the biggest-selling diabetes drugs, taken by  
more than 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA wants to know if its recent advice that diabetics get  
monthly testing to detect liver toxicity before serious damage is 
done is adequate -- because two deaths occurred in such a short time 
span that testing didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	Original tests suggested those two patients were fine, but  
``within two weeks, they got into serious problems and died,'' FDA 
drug chief Dr. Murray Lumpkin said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	So the agency will ask its advisers whether more frequent  
testing is needed, ``or are there other things one could do to make 
the use of this drug even safer,'' Lumpkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lumpkin stressed that liver toxicity is rare and that  
Rezulin does have benefit, particularly to patients unhelped by 
other diabetes treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert Co., the parent of manufacturer Parke Davis, said  
Friday that it expects the advisory committee to confirm Rezulin's 
benefits outweigh its risks. It contends the media is hyping the 
risks, noting other diabetes drugs also can cause lifethreatening 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on March 26, the company will urge FDA to expand Rezulin's  
market by approving its use in combination with older diabetes 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin was the first in a new class of diabetes drugs, approved  
in December 1996. But by October 1997, the FDA had issued the first 
warning about liver toxicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain banned the drug following the first reported deaths, and  
last summer the National Institutes of Health abruptly canceled a 
study of whether Rezulin could prevent Type II, or adult-onset, 
diabetes in healthy but high-risk people when a participant died.

<HEADLINE> Bacterial Outbreak Kills 9 in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A bacterial outbreak linked to a Michigan meat  
processing plant has killed nine people and caused three 
stillbirths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak has sickened more than 60 people in 12 states since  
August, the CDC said. The states are Ohio, New York, Tennessee, 
Massachusetts, West Virginia, Michigan, Connecticut, Oregon, 
Vermont, Georgia, Minnesota and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee, parent company of the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland,  
Mich., recalled several brands of hot dogs and cold cuts last month 
after the CDC found listeria contamination in unopened packages of 
hot dogs and deli meat produced at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy people can usually fight off the bacteria with no more  
than flu-like symptoms. But listeria can cause meningitis or blood 
infections, particularly in pregnant women, the elderly and people 
with weak immune systems.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Temp Contract Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A federal judge has rebuked Microsoft over  
``arrogant'' new contracts for temporary workers requiring them to 
waive their right to additional pay or benefits that a court might 
grant in the future. U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge John C. Coughenour dismissed Microsoft lawyers'  
defense that it covers only future work for the company. A lawsuit 
is pending, and Coughenour said damages typically continue to 
accrue right up to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the software giant's efforts to exclude workers from  
future court awards ``outrageously arrogant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After debating Microsoft lawyer James Oswald over the language,  
Coughenour recessed the hearing until Jan. 26 ``to give lawyers a 
chance to suggest to their clients that they do the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll discuss it again in the event that the court doesn't  
feel the right thing has been done,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract workers filed a class-action lawsuit against Microsoft  
in 1992 over their status, claiming the company treated them as 
full-time workers in every regard except compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has not disclosed how many temporary employees it has,  
but estimates put the number near 5,000, with contracts that often 
run three to six months. It said a third had worked there at least 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1997 that  
Microsoft should have allowed contract workers to take part in a 
stock-purchase plan in which employees can buy stock at a 15 
percent discount. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was referred back to U.S. District Judge Carolyn  
Dimmick in Seattle. Last fall, she limited the scope of the case to 
include only people who worked at Microsoft from 1987 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' lawyers have appealed that ruling, but in the  
meantime filed a new class-action lawsuit to cover those excluded 
from the earlier lawsuit. Coughenour is overseeing the second 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as existing contracts expire, the company recently  
began requiring temporary workers to sign new contracts that 
plaintiffs contend illegally waives their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agreements contain a sentence reading: ``Even if a court  
or government agency determines that temporary personnel and 
Microsoft have had a common law employer-employee relationship at 
any time, temporary personnel ... will not be entitled to receive 
... any different or additional pay, or any benefits, insurance 
coverage, tax payments or withholding, or compensation of any 
kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Software tester David Vensas, who has worked under contract at  
Microsoft since August 1997, said in an affidavit filed with the 
court that he was shocked when he was asked to sign the new 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to be designed to deny me any due process, requiring  
me to forgo any possible claim in order to retain my job,'' Vensas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare move, Coughenour called Thursday's hearing rather than  
waiting for the plaintiffs' lawyers to seek it. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Dan Leach declined to say whether the  
company would remove the language from its contracts.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Aussie Balloon Launch Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALICE SPRINGS, Australia (AP) -- A U.S.-Australian balloon team  
hoping to be the first to fly around the world canceled their 
planned journey today but said they will try in December 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Team Re/Max said weather forecasts showed winds would be too  
high for a launch from the team's Alice Springs site before 
Sunday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather conditions over central Australia had given the team a  
takeoff window that lasted until mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said it plans to return to the site in December for  
another attempt to launch its high-altitude helium balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch, which had already been delayed nearly three weeks  
due to weather problems and technical glitches, was to have begun a 
journey expected to take 16 to 18 days and bring the two pilots 
back to Alice Springs, in the Australian outback. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver real estate magnate Dave Liniger and Australian  
balloonist John Wallington hoped to succeed by rising 24 miles 
above the Earth, above normal weather patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know Alice Springs is the right place to attempt this and  
we had the right team here,'' said Liniger, who funded the mission. 
``We just had a bit of a delay in getting here, a design challenge 
for launch and some unfortunate weather conditions after we 
arrived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team was one of several balloon syndicates attempting the  
round-the-world flight, which has never been done. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss-based Breitling Orbiter team is hoping to take off  
Monday, and in Albuquerque, N.M., the U.S. Spirit of Peace balloon 
team is almost ready to go. Both are waiting for permission from 
China to cross its airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, British tycoon Richard  
Branson and Per Lindstrand of Sweden were forced to ditch their 
balloon off Hawaii on Dec. 18 after flying around more than half 
the globe.

<HEADLINE> Texas Child Killer's Guilt in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- When Lacresha Murray was 11, she told  
police she might have dropped little Jayla Belton and accidentally 
stepped on her. Twice, juries convicted her of killing the 
2-year-old, and locked her away in a reform school. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Lacresha has a growing number of supporters, including a New  
York Times columnist, who say an 11-year-old girl never could have 
delivered the devastating blows Jayla apparently suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they say, Lacresha was herself a victim -- of police who  
coerced an inaccurate confession, of a prosecutor with political 
ambitions, of a racially biased justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lacresha Murray is innocent. That's the bottom line,'' said  
Barbara Taft, who quit her job as a legal secretary to devote 
herself to People of the Heart, an organization she created to help 
overturn the verdict. She claims to have 100 members. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 14, Lacresha is serving a 25-year sentence and waiting to  
see whether another appeal will free her. Dozens of protesters 
gather at least once a month outside the courthouse where the case 
is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really hard being away from my family. I've never gotten  
used to that,'' she said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Murray, Lacresha's grandmother and adoptive mother, said  
of the girl: ``She's not bitter, which is more than I can say for 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors shocked Austin in 1996 when they charged Lacresha  
with murdering Jayla, a little girl at the illegal day care center 
Mrs. Murray and her husband, R.L. Murray, a church deacon, ran in 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacresha allegedly slipped into where Jayla was sleeping and  
beat her. Prosecutors speculated that Lacresha lashed out at Jayla 
because she was angry at having to baby sit. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical authorities said Jayla had broken ribs, 30 bruises --  
some in the shape of a shoe -- and a fatal blow to her side that 
ruptured her liver. 
</P>
<P>
	Police questioned Lacresha. Almost 40 times, she denied beating  
Jayla. Finally, she agreed with a detective that she may have 
dropped the girl and stepped on her. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney, Keith S. Hampton, contends Lacresha's confession  
was coerced. Prosecutors deny that. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also point to the testimony of the medical examiner,  
who said Jayla's fatal injuries were inflicted when only Lacresha 
was with her. His testimony was supported by two other medical 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
	At Lacresha's first trial -- in which her court-appointed  
attorney was given only $300 for her defense -- she was cleared of 
murder but sentenced to 20 years for negligent homicide and injury 
to a child. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge threw out that conviction, questioning whether she was  
adequately defended. But a second trial, a year later, ended with 
another conviction on the same charges and the 25-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacresha's story has attracted attention as far away as England,  
where her case has been compared to that of British au pair Louise 
Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Herbert of The New York Times has published several columns  
arguing that the supposed facts of the case don't add up. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no legitimate evidence against her, just a  
`confession' that even prosecutors have acknowledged would not have 
accounted for the injuries that killed Jayla,'' Herbert wrote in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no witnesses and no murder weapon, and police  
investigators who scoured the premises where the killing supposedly 
took place could find no forensic evidence of any kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other critics say District Attorney Ronnie Earle sought a  
conviction to help his re-election campaign or was biased against a 
black defendant. Earle is white. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Lacresha Murray had been white and from a good side of  
town, the police department wouldn't have stopped her,'' Mrs. Taft 
said. The district attorney ``wanted a headline at time when 
politicians were standing up all over the country and being tough 
on juvenile crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earle countered: ``Twenty-four citizens have considered all the  
evidence and have concluded that Lacresha Murray did in fact kill 
Jayla Belton. That is sad and tragic but inescapable fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If her appeals fail, Lacresha could stay in a youth detention  
center until she is 21. If she is still considered dangerous then, 
she could be transferred to an adult prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacresha dreams of being home and restarting her life by summer.  
If nothing else, she said, her case has inspired her: ``I want to 
be a lawyer, so I can help people so they won't be in situations 
like me.''

<HEADLINE> IAAF Sets Hearing for Mary Slaney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Mary Slaney will have her disputed drug case heard  
beginning Jan. 29 by an arbitration panel of the International 
Amateur Athletic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Arne Ljungqvist, an IAAF vice president and head of the body's  
medical commission, said Friday that the arbitration panel's 
hearing in Monte Carlo, Monaco, could take several days. 
</P>
<P>
	If found guilty of a drug offense, Slaney could face a two-year  
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old distance runner didn't plan to testify in  
person. 
</P>
<P>
	``She will not attend,'' her husband, Richard, said by telephone  
from Eugene, Ore. ``Why put her through that? 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been exonerated already. She didn't do anything wrong.''  
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, considered the greatest women's distance runner in U.S.  
history and the 1983 world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters, 
tested positive for high levels of testosterone at the 1996 U.S. 
Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF complained that USA Track &AMP; Field was progressing  
slowly on the matter and suspended Slaney in May 1997. USATF then 
imposed its own suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney argued that the test did not take into account the  
hormonal swings a woman goes through during menstruation while on 
birth control and nearing menopause. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1997, USATF cleared Slaney of the charges. The IAAF  
then cleared Slaney to compete, but said it did not accept the 
USATF ruling and referred the case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is now between the IAAF and USA Track &AMP; Field,'' Richard  
Slaney said. ``The IAAF doesn't agree with USA Track &AMP; Field's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to prove anything.''

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House prosecutor called Monica Lewinsky a  
``very credible'' witness, telling senators in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial today that the former White House intern's 
testimony establishes that Clinton ``knowingly, intentionally'' 
sought to obstruct justice. Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., is still 
presenting his argument in the Capitol.

Clinton's impeachment trial. Dr. George D. Lundberg, editor of JAMA 
for 17 years, was fired for ``inappropriately and inexcusably 
interjecting JAMA into the middle of a debate that has nothing to

<HEADLINE> At Mile High, Jets Face Altitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Jets say they won't be caught breathless in  
Denver. The Broncos say that's a lot of hot air. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Jets visit Mile High Stadium for Sunday's AFC  
championship game, they will be riding high, with a seven-game 
winning streak. Their attitude, however, could fall victim to the 
altitude, as the thin air thins their chances of advancing to the 
Super Bowl for the first time in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell the altitude takes its effect on people,''  
Broncos defensive tackle Mike Lodish said. ``I don't care who you 
are. Late in the fourth quarter, you have some guys who are just 
dying out there. Even early in the game at the end of a 12- or 
14-play drive, you have some tongues hanging down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lodish saw that at the outset of last weekend's playoff victory  
over Miami. The Broncos marched 92 yards in 14 plays, a drive of 
nearly eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to see it again from the Jets. But New York isn't  
buying it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike High is not unlike talking about several other places we  
went,'' coach Bill Parcells said. ``Go to Buffalo, Kansas City, 
Miami, don't think the place can be unlike that, and at least we 
been through it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think (the altitude) has anything to do with it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Asked if teams must acclimate themselves to being in the  
Rockies, Parcells shook his head. He coached at Air Force in 
Colorado Springs, which gives him something to base that opinion 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they are moving the game to sea level, so I  
think we just have to go play,'' said Parcells, who added he 
wouldn't even mention it to the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why bring that up and create another distraction?'' linebacker  
Bryan Cox said. ``The only ones thinking about those things are the 
media, not the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our job is to get ready and play the Denver Broncos for the  
AFC championship in Mile High Stadium. Nothing else will matter to 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps. The Jets certainly have done well in what they term  
``hostile environments,'' winning at Kansas City, New England, 
Buffalo, Miami and Tennessee this season. They've displayed poise 
and gumption. 
</P>
<P>
	One Jets player thinks the altitude will help. Placekicker John  
Hall, who has converted 27 of 37 field goals, including 52- and 
30-yarders in last Sunday's 34-24 playoff win against Jacksonville, 
has no problem with playing in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's light air and it helps your ball move further,'' Hall  
said. ``There's more implications, but you have to look at it that 
it's just a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And not look at it as a head game, where the Broncos are  
breathing easily because they are used to the atmosphere, and the 
Jets are not. 
</P>
<P>
	``They might have a team where it affects nobody,'' Broncos  
fullback Howard Griffith said. ``It's a mental aspect. Even if it 
doesn't affect you, you've heard all week that you're going to Mile 
High and the altitude is going to affect you. Even if it doesn't 
really affect your game, it's already been embedded in your mind. 
If you allow it mentally to be a block, it's an advantage for us.''

<HEADLINE> IMG Signs Se Ri Pak to 3-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Se Ri Pak has signed a contract with  
International Management Group, giving the sports agency another 
powerful name in golf and giving her the management she lacked 
during her sensational rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year contract was signed Thursday night over dinner,  
before Pak's family could hear a last-ditch offer from Cornerstone 
Sports. A meeting with Cornerstone was planned but Pak signed with 
IMG before that session could be held. IMG declined comment, but 
the deal was confirmed Friday by family adviser Yeong Shin and by 
Samsung, Pak's corporate sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``IMG will handle everything,'' said Shin, as he and her father,  
Jun-Chul Pak, watched her struggle to a 2-over 74 in the first 
round of the HealthSouth Inaugural. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak, who became the youngest winner of the U.S. Women's Open and  
the first rookie in 14 years to win two majors, had been shopping 
for a management firm since last month, when Samsung agreed to give 
up management of the South Korean star. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak joins Tiger Woods, David Duval and Annika Sorenstam as other  
clients of the Cleveland-based IMG. 
</P>
<P>
	Shin said he expects endorsement contracts to follow shortly.  
Pak has played the Callaway Big Bertha irons and the Maxfli 
Revolution ball, although she did not have deals with any other 
company except Samsung. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the systematic and scientific management through IMG  
will help Pak remain a top-notch player,'' Samsung spokesman Ahn 
Ho-moon said from South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG will seek endorsement deals with golf equipment makers and  
other companies and split 30 percent of the profits with Samsung. 
Pak will receive the remaining 70 percent, Samsung officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung, the Korean electronics magnate, signed Pak to a 10-year  
contract in 1996, then sent her to the United States to work with 
swing coach David Leadbetter. 
</P>
<P>
	She tied for first in the LPGA qualifying school, then  
challenged Annika Sorenstam as the top player in the world with the 
most remarkable rookie season on the LPGA Tour since Nancy Lopez in 
1978. Along with winning the U.S. Open in a 20-hole playoff and the 
LPGA Championship, Pak won two other tournaments -- all in a 10-week 
stretch -- and set two scoring records in one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	But off the course, her life was far from smooth.  
</P>
<P>
	Leadbetter said she was playing too much. Pak played six  
straight tournaments on two occasions late in the year and 
complained of a sore shoulder and fatigue. She also was 
hospitalized for fatigue during her celebrated homecoming to Souh 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	When the season ended, Pak fired manager Steven Kil, rehired him  
and fired him again -- all within two weeks. She also ditched 
Leadbetter, decided to go back to him, then received notice that he 
was leaving her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to find very strong people to take care of everything --  
interviews, schedule, practice and time for me to relax,'' Pak said 
recently.

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Rodrick Rhodes, one of only four signed players

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Turn Mostly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets turned mostly higher today,  
rebounding from broad early losses as traders decided Wall Street's 
plunge and Brazil's unfolding economic crisis were less of a worry 
than they first thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips tumbled by 1.9 percent from the outset in Hong Kong,  
Asia's second-largest market after Tokyo, but gained back most of 
that ground by the end of trading. The Hang Seng Index finished 
with a loss of just 35.73 points, or 0.4 percent, at 10,147.40. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in this region seem not too worried about Brazil now,''  
said Percy Au-Young, sales director at DBS Securities (Hong Kong) 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore dealings got off to a spooky start as a human error  
briefly had investors thinking blue chips had fallen by an alarming 
5.5 percent. But the incorrect data entry for a bank stock trade 
was fixed within minutes, and the Straits Times Index soon 
recovered from its losses and bounced into positive territory. The 
index closed with a gain of 1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Taipei shares overcame early losses to finish with a 3.4 percent  
gain by the blue chips as the government began buying shares to 
stem a four-day decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some small markets that stayed in the red, such as Manila  
and Jakarta, narrowed their losses dramatically by the end of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed today for a holiday. But on  
Thursday, Tokyo blue chips had bucked the negative trend and 
finished higher despite all the Brazilian worries. That resilience 
in Tokyo helped boost optimism elsewhere in the region today, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil started a worldwide market decline on Wednesday after its  
central bank chief resigned and his successor devalued the 
Brazilian currency, the real, by 7.6 percent. On Thursday the 
Central Bank's director of the banking industry resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	After falling 5 percent on Wednesday, Brazil's Sao Paulo stock  
exchange fell nearly 10 percent Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The turmoil carried over to Wall Street, where stocks were  
pummeled for the second day in a row as investors began to worry 
that profits of U.S. companies operating in Latin America could 
suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 228.63, or 2.5 percent,  
to 9,120.93 in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's problems stirred major worries in New York as many  
traders feared any financial crisis spreading through Latin America 
eventually could hit Mexico, a key U.S. trading partner. Mexico's 
main stock index, however, ended higher on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Many experts in Asia have said any impact from the Brazil crisis  
should be muted here because direct economic ties between the two 
regions are limited.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Quadruplet Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- A Texas man was convicted of murder Friday  
for his role in the death of a woman who had moved to Florida with 
her young quadruplets and two teen-ager daughters to start a new 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found Daniel Rocha guilty of first degree murder and a  
lesser charge of conspiracy to commit murder in the third degree 
for the Nov. 7, 1997 killing of Sheila Bellush. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Jack McGill asked for a delay in sentencing,  
saying the verdicts were inconsistent. But prosecutor Charlie 
Roberts, who had argued that Rocha is just as responsible as the 
hit man who left Mrs. Bellush bleeding to death, said the verdicts 
made sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing for 29-year-old Rocha, of San Antonio, was scheduled  
for late February, but no exact date was set. He faces up to life 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is tragic for everybody involved. But the real tragedy is  
six kids that don't have a mother anymore,'' said the victim's 
widower, Jamie Bellush. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Rocha was the middle man in a plot hatched in  
Texas to kill Mrs. Bellush, 35, two months after she and her family 
moved to Sarasota. She was shot in the face and stabbed twice and 
bled to death with her then-2-year-old quadruplets nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sheila Bellush thought she was safe moving away from Texas to  
Florida. That didn't save her,'' Roberts said in his closing 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Mrs. Bellush's wealthy ex-husband, Allen  
Blackthorne, told Rocha that she was abusing their two teen-age 
daughters and he wanted to regain custody of them. 
</P>
<P>
	McGill said Rocha intended only for Mrs. Bellush to be beaten.  
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Bellush ``was not to be killed. ... There was never any  
intent of that,'' McGill said after resting his case without 
calling any witnesses. ``That was the act of a madman, the act of 
someone who had gone berserk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors said Rocha, motivated by greed and envy, made  
arrangements to hire someone to harm Mrs. Bellush as a favor to 
Blackthorne, his golfing pal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocha ``was the driving force'' behind her death, Roberts said  
in closing arguments. ``This was his idea ... he pulled others into 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocha's friend Samuel Gonzales testified he recruited his cousin  
Jose Luis Del Toro, who borrowed a .45-caliber handgun and drove 
from Texas to Florida. He then allegedly contacted Gonzales, saying 
he broke into Mrs. Bellush's home and killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and  
struck a deal for his testimony in return for a 19-year prison 
term. Del Toro is jailed in Mexico and is fighting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackthorne has not been charged and has denied any involvement  
in a plot to kill Mrs. Bellush. 
</P>
<P>
	After a bitter divorce, Mrs. Bellush was granted custody of the  
their two daughters, and the girls were adopted by her second 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Daughter Stevie Bellush, 14, testified at the trial that her  
mother was ``loving and understanding'' and never abused her or her 
13-year-old sister. She called Blackthorne manipulative. It was 
Stevie who found her mother's body, with the quadruplets, unharmed 
but covered in blood, nearby.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 154.48 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were higher today, bouncing back from  
four days of losses, as investors cheered Brazil's plan to stop 
defending its troubled currency. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average stood  
at 9,275.41 up 154.48. Broad-market indexes were sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent economic troubles in Brazil have raised fears among  
investors that profits of U.S. companies operating in Latin America 
could suffer. The Dow lost more than 353 points in the last two 
days of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wall Street was pleased with Brazil's decision Friday to  
stop spending heavily to prop up its battered currency, the real. 
The move is seen as a way for Brazil to attract foreign investment 
and hold on to its currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian currency fell nearly 15 percent against the U.S.  
dollar, but the main stock market in Sao Paolo -- Latin America's 
largest exchange -- soared more than 27 percent today, after 
plunging the last six sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is the biggest and most important economy in Latin  
America, which accounts for 20 percent of U.S. exports. Investors 
worry that its problems will spread throughout the region, 
specifically to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think there's recognition that it isn't quite as bad as  
Asia, that it doesn't necessarily have to reverberate around the 
globe,'' said Peter Anderson, chief investment strategist at 
American Express Financial Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We survived Asia very well, because the Federal Reserve  
reduced interest rates, and in fact that's what pulled the market 
up in the final quarter of last year,'' he said. ``I think people 
increasingly recognize that these kinds of dilemmas, as long as 
they don't spread, can actually be constructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gains in U.S. trading helped lift European stocks from  
midday losses. Germany's DAX index closed up 1.4 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 rose 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In overnight trading, Asian stock markets were mostly higher.  
</P>
<P>
	Leading the gains on Wall Street were financial services stocks,  
which had taken big hits earlier this week on Brazil's devaluation. 
American Express was up 5 7/16 at 100 7/16, Merrill Lynch gained 4 5/8 
to 71 11/16, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose 3 to 83 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 11 to 5 on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 617.32 million shares, 
down from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 24.22 at 1,236.31, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was up 47.36 at 2,324.18.

<HEADLINE> Law Banning Casino Ads Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Friday to judge the  
validity of a federal law the Clinton administration says is needed 
to protect compulsive gamblers from the lure of casinos and games 
of chance. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will decide whether free-speech rights  
are violated by the government's ban on television and radio ads 
that promote casinos not owned by Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban is only in effect in some parts of the nation because  
some federal appeals courts have ruled it unconstitutional while 
others have upheld it. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down  
the ban last year, blocking its enforcement in nine Western states 
-- Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, 
Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court refused last February to review that 9th  
Circuit court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The longstanding federal law bans broadcast advertising for  
``any lottery, gift enterprise or similar scheme offering prizes 
dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance.'' But Congress in 
the past 20 years has amended the anti-broacast law to allow airing 
ads for casinos on Indian reservations, state-run lotteries or any 
gambling sponsored by nonprofit promoters working for charitable 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, 37 states and the District of Columbia sponsor -- and  
aggressively advertise -- lotteries, and more than two-thirds of the 
states are home to Indian-owned casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-Indian casinos are legal in 22 states, and the appeal acted  
on Friday focuses on how the federal ban affects advertising for 
those establishments. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals upheld the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers say the appeals court was right. They  
pointed to studies detailing economic and social problems, such as 
compulsive gambling and organized crime, associated with casino 
gambling and other gaming activities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a New Jersey case the Supreme Court refused to review last  
week, government lawyers said ``broadcast advertising of casino 
gambling would directly contribute to compulsive gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking to have the 5th Circuit court's ruling overturned,  
the Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association and individual 
radio and television stations contend that the government's stated 
concern for compulsive gamblers is hard to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Broadcasters are encouraged to air advertisements that feature  
gaming conducted on Indian reservations and are permitted to 
broadcast advertisements that feature pari-mutuel betting and other 
sports betting,'' they noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent Supreme Court rulings appeared to cut against such an  
advertising ban. The court ruled in a Rhode Island case last year 
that states may not ban all advertising that refers to liquor 
prices in efforts to promote sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association vs.  
U.S., 98-387.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Defense Line Still Unsung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- A few years ago, hardly anyone could recite  
their names. The Atlanta Falcons' defensive linemen thought a 
catchy nickname might help. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fearsome Foursome already had been taken. Ditto for the  
Steel Curtain. They settled on the Bomb Squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had been dropping bombs on people for a long time, so we  
thought that would be a fitting name,'' said defensive end Chuck 
Smith, senior member of the group. ``There wasn't much identity 
here, so we decided to create our own identity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the nickname hasn't done much to improve their  
recognition factor. Smith, Lester Archambeau, Shane Dronett and 
Travis Hall may be regarded collectively as one of the best units 
in the NFL, but any of them would be a candidate for an American 
Express commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	It could go something like this: ``You may not know our names,  
but we're a major reason our team is playing Sunday for the NFC 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not one of them has ever played in the Pro Bowl. Smith and Hall  
were overlooked last year, even though they combined for 22 1/2 sacks. 
Archambeau had a career-high 10 sacks this season and wasn't even 
mentioned as an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
	Even their own coach seems to be in the dark about these guys.  
Dan Reeves insists on pronouncing Dronett's name ``Droe-nay,'' even 
though it's actually ``Droe-net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When the head coach calls your name, you let him call you  
whatever you want,'' Archambeau said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, why doesn't anyone notice these guys?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know and I don't care,'' Archambeau said. ``It's all  
about winning games. It's all about being 15-2. It's not about 
personal recognition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The linemen have thoroughly embraced the philosophy of defensive  
coordinator Rich Brooks, who preaches a ``gap control'' scheme that 
requires players to remain in their assigned lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	While sacks dropped from 55 last season to 38 this season, the  
Falcons ranked second in the league in rushing defense, allowing 
only 75.2 yards per game and 3.3 yards per carry. The most 
impressive stat: Atlanta has allowed only three runs longer than 20 
yards all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is coming together and maturing as players at the  
same time,'' Archambeau said. ``We feed off each other real well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dronett is the biggest surprise of all. He was released by  
Atlanta after four games in 1996, then cut by Detroit the following 
year at the end of preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	His career teetering on the brink, Dronett returned to Atlanta  
only because the team was desperate for depth at the tackle 
position. This season, he was forced into a starting role when Dan 
Owens signed with the Lions and the Falcons failed to sign another 
big-name defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just lucky to finally get a chance to prove myself,''  
Dronett said. ``If I wasn't going to be out there this year, I was 
pretty much going to be a backup forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times, he has been a dominating presence on the interior of  
the line, particularly when Hall was plagued by injuries earlier in 
the season. Dronett had 81 tackles and 6 1/2 sacks and caused four 
fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a first alternate to the Pro Bowl, had another solid  
season with 8 1/2 sacks, a team-high 36 quarterback pressures and four 
fumble recoveries. He has put the rest the stereotype that he was 
too small (6-feet-2, 262 pounds) to play defensive end in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to do with heart, leverage and want to do it,'' Smith  
said. ``Size has nothing to do with anything. We've shown that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive line was one of Reeves' biggest concerns prior to  
the season. He felt confident about his starters, but saw no hope 
of having quality depth. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Burrough, a seventh-round pick in 1995, has played well  
at end, allowing the versatile Archambeau to work some at tackle. 
Free agents Esera Tuaolo and Antonio Edwards have been surprisingly 
effective in reserve roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of those guys are very smart in what they do. They  
anticipate and know formations. They don't just worry about their 
job, they worry about the overall picture,'' Reeves said. ``What we 
thought was a major concern has probably been one of the strengths 
of our defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if they can just get some recognition for it.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not been a better defensive line in the last three  
years,'' Smith said, ``than us.''

<HEADLINE> World Not Riveted by Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The historic impeachment trial of President Clinton  
didn't seem to rivet much of the world today, especially Asia, 
where Michael Jordan's retirement was still producing front-page 
headlines in three countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The first day of testimony in the Senate on Thursday did  
dominate many of the broadsheets in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	But throughout much of the world, the news was overshadowed by  
the Brazilian economic crisis, the Olympic bribery scandal and the 
Chicago Bulls superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's trial was relegated to the inside pages of newspapers  
in the Philippines, while Jordan grabbed the headlines and the 
front pages in the basketball-crazed country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, some papers devoted more than half a page to the  
Clinton story, but others focused on economic issues. Jordan's 
retirement received more coverage in the Oriental Daily than 
Clinton did. 
</P>
<P>
	The same thing happened in northeastern China, where Jordan made  
the front page of the lively Beijing Youth daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial also was relegated to brief stories in the  
foreign news sections of many papers in Indonesia, Thailand, South 
Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's media were less enthralled by the trial than they  
had been by all the lurid details of Clinton's affair with White 
House intern Monica Lewinsky, which were released last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Malaysia, where the sexual misconduct and corruption trial of  
former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has dominated news 
reports for months, the Clinton trial had little impact. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Mexican news media, occupied with economic woes,  
paid little attention to Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	And Austrian radio ignored the Washington spectacle to focus on  
the big European Union story -- a vote of confidence over 
allegations of fraud and nepotism within the European Commission, 
the EU's executive agency. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton's trial got under way, the 20-member commission  
survived a vote in the European Parliament that could have forced 
its dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in Britain, the first day of testimony appeared in  
several papers today and most evening TV news broadcasts played up 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton story dominated papers such as the Times of London,  
the Daily Telegraph and the Independent, with headlines such as 
``Battle begins for Clinton's survival.''

<HEADLINE> Swiss Skier Hilpert Wins World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Swiss skier Koni Hilpert  
collected the second World Cup win of his career Friday night, 
edging former world champion Ian Edmondson of Birmingham, Mich., 
who couldn't get out of bed to start the day because of a back 
spasm. 
</P>
<P>
	Elena Batalova, who has won the last three World Cup acro titles  
after claiming gold in the 1995 World Championships, led a 1-2 
sweep by Russian skiers in the women's competition. Lara Rosenbaum 
of Portsmouth, R.I., the top American, finished fifth and Maria 
Guarnieri of Mahopac, N.Y., was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilpert, whose previous victory came a year ago at Breckenridge,  
Colo., took the first event of the Sprint Shootout with 26.30 
points. Edmondson, a semi-ageless 41 and the 1982 world champion 
when acro was known as ballet skiing, received 25.90. Newlywed 
Steve Roxberg of Lakeville, Minn., was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the first time my father has seen me compete since  
1982, and I'm so happy he could be here,'' said Edmondson, who 
retired after winning the title. He came out of retirement in 1992 
and was silver medalist in acro in the 1997 World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The back spasm hit as he woke up, Edmondson said, ``and I  
couldn't roll over. But Kim (team physiotherapist Kim Nelson) fixed 
me up and I had two wonderful runs, today and tonight. This was a 
great crowd, a lot of energy flowing.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Caldor May Sell Some Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- A deal to sell 64 of Caldor's 145 discount  
retail stores is in the late stages of negotiations and an 
agreement is expected within two weeks, according to a published 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing anonymous sources, the New Haven Register reported Friday  
that the stores may be sold to three large discount chains -- 
Kohl's, Target and Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohl's will likely get at least half of the 64 stores, the  
Register reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldor spokeswoman Wendi Kopsick declined to comment on the  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the negotiations comes a week after Caldor said it  
stopped paying its suppliers. The Norwalk-based chain has been 
operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, Caldor announced it would close 12  
unprofitable stores, including all of its stores in the Washington, 
D.C., area. At that time, officials said Caldor wanted to 
concentrate on its main markets in New England and the Middle 
Atlantic states.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Big News Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Millions of British newspaper readers could be  
forgiven today if they knew little about the impeachment trial of 
President Clinton. Like many newspapers in other parts of the 
world, the big-selling tabloids found other stories more 
interesting for their front pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun, Britain's largest-selling daily, gave the Clinton story  
nine paragraphs on page 2, but in a prominent position -- just to 
the left of the topless model of the day. The Mirror, the 
second-largest seller, found space for Clinton on page 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadsheets, however, regarded the possible ouster of the  
leader of the world's most powerful nation as front-page stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Battle begins for Clinton's survival,'' said a headline in The  
Times. ``Trial of the century begins,'' said The Guardian. 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, where Boris Yeltsin's opponents in parliament are  
seeking an impeachment trial, the media have closely followed the 
impeachment proceedings. The liberal daily Vremya published a 
front-page article today headlined ``Doomsday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans' `slick Willy' hunt has entered its final  
phase,'' the newspaper said. It stressed that the Democrats in the 
Senate are trying to cut the trial short, fearing it could spin out 
of control if witnesses, including Monica Lewinsky, are called to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper also carried a long story describing the Senate's  
previous impeachment trial against President Andrew Johnson in 
1868. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rome daily Il Messagero said ``12 months of scandals,  
revelations and growing public indifference has been transformed 
into a set so austere that it almost looks convincing''. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily La Repubblica headline said: ``Clinton: Come and  
defend yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, Switzerland, the daily Le Temps was alone in putting  
Clinton on its front page. ``The Bill Clinton judgment machine has 
been launched. No one knows where it will stop,'' its headline 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the television news Thursday night, the Clinton story  
appeared 15 minutes into the newscast, after an item on Swiss 
cheesemakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Philippines, the retirement of U.S. basketball star  
Michael Jordan has dominated front pages this week while Clinton 
languished inside. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, some papers devoted more than half a page to the  
Clinton story, but others focused on economic issues, including 
Brazil's collapsing financial markets. Jordan's retirement received 
more coverage in the Oriental Daily than Clinton did. 
</P>
<P>
	The same thing happened in northeastern China, where Jordan made  
front-page news in the lively Beijing Youth daily. 
</P>
<P>

foreign news sections of many of the papers in Indonesia, Thailand, 
South Korea and Japan.

<HEADLINE> IOC Calls Meeting Over Salt Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC will hold a special general  
assembly in March to vote on possible expulsions of members accused 
of corruption and consider overhauling the Olympic site-selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch  
announced today that he was convening the special session of the 
committee's 115 members for March 17-18 in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	``This extraordinary session will deal with the final decisions  
relating to certain members and procedures concerning the host city 
election for future Olympic Games,'' the IOC said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch called the meeting as a result of the bribery scandal  
surrounding Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games, 
the biggest corruption crisis in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Four separate investigations are under way into allegations that  
IOC members or their relatives received cash payments, 
scholarships, jobs, free medical care, real estate deals, lavish 
gifts and other inducements from Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch told The Associated Press on Thursday that the IOC  
sent letters to 13 members seeking explanation for their conduct 
during Salt Lake's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	He said nine members were accused of ``serious'' offenses that  
could result in expulsion, while four were cited for minor 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member IOC panel investigating the Salt Lake City case  
is due to conclude its findings on Jan. 23 and make recommendations 
to the executive board the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the executive board could suspend any members  
found guilty of serious misconduct. Recommendations to expel 
members would go to the full assembly, where a two-thirds majority 
vote is required for expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	The session will address proposals to revamp the bidding and  
selection process for Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has suggested banning visits by IOC members to  
candidate cities, stripping the full assembly of the vote and 
leaving the selection to the executive board or other small 
``electoral college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said visits by IOC members to bid cities aren't  
necessary because the committee already has a group of experts who 
inspect the sites and compile a report on the logistical and 
financial merits of each bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Other top IOC officials have suggested other options, such as  
allowing the general assembly to vote after the executive board has 
narrowed the field to two or three finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Any new process should be in place before the 2006 Winter Games  
site is selected at the IOC session in Seoul, South Korea, next 
June.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lots of people believe the number ``13''  
brings bad luck, but House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde 
apparently disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Republican decided some time ago that he and a  
dozen colleagues would present the ``compelling'' case to the 
Senate for President Clinton's removal from office on charges of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no set formula for the number of House members, or  
managers, who go to the Senate and act as prosecutors during an 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hyde, a lawyer, settled on 13 Republicans. Each of the  
remaining members was actively involved in the case when it was 
before the committee, and they all have legal or prosecutorial 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats on the committee refused to join the prosecution.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Where have all the spelling checks gone?  
</P>
<P>
	A chart used on opening day of the impeachment trial in an  
attempt to outline efforts by President Clinton and his confidant, 
Vernon Jordan, to find employment for Ms. Lewinsky in New York, had 
just one problem -- a misspelled word. 
</P>
<P>
	Calendar was spelled as ``calender'' and The New York Times laid  
the error out for the nation to see on the front page of its Friday 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistake was corrected on photographed copies of the chart,  
used by Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., delivered to the House Press 
Gallery on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There've been other publicized spelling gaffes linked to the  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial memorandum from Clinton's defense lawyers omitted the  
``l'' from the president's surname on the first page of the 
130-sheet document. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, souvenir Parker pens the senators used to sign a  
ceremonial book identified them as ``Untied States Senator,'' 
instead of ``United States Senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone and Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who is  
presiding over the impeachment trial in the Senate, have at least 
one thing in common: ailing backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone, D-Minn., has a ruptured disc in his back, which he  
said makes sitting for long periods of time, as senators are 
required to do for the trial, painful. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been getting out of his seat every half hour or so to  
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, the liberal Democrat cited the problem as a reason  
why he decided to abandon a run for the presidency in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	When the trial resumed on Wednesday, Rehnquist asked senators to  
pay no attention when he stands during the proceedings to stretch 
his ailing back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no intention that the proceedings should be in any way  
interrupted when I do so,'' the chief justice said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Two new senators have unobstructed views of the proceedings.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., who defeated Sen. Carol  
Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., sat in a front-row seat on the Republican 
side of the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., listened to the presentations from  
Moseley-Braun's former seat in the Democrats' first row. Schumer 
cast several impeachment votes last year as a member of the House 
and its Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who this month formed a  
presidential campaign committee, moved his desk closer to camera 
range to a spot in the second row. His seat in the last Congress 
had been in the third row. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum plans to bring his two young sons to the  
Senate to watch history Saturday as it continues to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum, R-Pa., said his sons, Johnny, 6, and Daniel, 3, and  
playmates from a Saturday afternoon ``Boys Club'' will watch from 
the Senate gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell them we are in a process here that's very, very  
important for this country and that shows how the Constitution 
works,'' Santorum said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee members will finish presenting their  
case against Clinton on Saturday afternoon. The trial resumes next 
Tuesday with defense attorneys arguing against removing Clinton 
from office.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phone Jams Thousands of Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRYSTAL RIVER, Fla. (AP) -- When the mysterious white car with  
tinted windows and a small satellite dish on top pulled up to 
Calvin Simpson's motor home, the retired engineer was puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, ``What are those guys doing?' Then they came up to  
me, and I said, ``Uh-oh.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The men, engineers for GTE Wireless, had found their culprit.  
For 10 days, Simpson's cellular phone had been jamming cellular 
service for tens of thousands of customers in Florida's Citrus and 
Hernando counties. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE Wireless customers in the region began reporting trouble  
with their phones on Jan. 4 -- the same day Simpson, 74, brought his 
motor home to the Crystal Isle RV Resort for the winter from his 
home in South Portland, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers still aren't sure what caused the problem, but they  
think Simpson's phone was constantly transmitting signals to a 
``set-up channel'' on a cellular phone tower behind Crystal River's 
City Hall. The channel is supposed to take signals and relay them 
to their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson's phone, however, sent signals to the channel even when  
he wasn't trying to make a call. Whenever his phone was on, the 
constant signal prevented any cellular phone user from making a 
call via that tower. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE Wireless spent days in Crystal River trying to figure out  
what was causing the outage before tracking the faulty signal to 
Simpson's cellular phone. They used the same technology cellular 
phone companies use to track stolen cell phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they found Simpson on Wednesday, they simply asked him to  
turn off his cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Like magic, GTE Wireless was back in service in Crystal River.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I pulled the plug, they had a big sigh of relief,''  
Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineers who tracked him down got Simpson a new cell phone.  
The company plans to take Simpson's old, faulty phone apart in 
hopes of finding out exactly what it was that went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for GTE wouldn't specify how many cell-phone  
customers the company has, but estimated that tens of thousands may 
have been affected.

<HEADLINE> Striving for Financial Simplicity / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Financial simplicity isn't too complicated to  
achieve, but it does require some work and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	For many people that's a top goal for 1999 behind losing weight  
or living healthier. 
</P>
<P>
	While someone else can't take your place on the treadmill, you  
can pass off some of the drudgery of organizing your finances, 
budgeting, bill paying, checkbook balancing and tax preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer software programs like Quicken or Microsoft Money can  
create a budget, provide running estimates of checkbook balances, 
even track mortgage rates or stock prices on-line. Employers can 
directly deposit paychecks into a bank account; banks, in turn, can 
automatically withdraw money for investing or bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not using technology, you're certainly working  
harder than you have to,'' said Jeffrey J. Mayer, a Chicago 
consultant and expert on time and business management. ``If you 
want to get ahead in life, you have to use tools that make life 
simpler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First, you have to put those tools in place, and that includes a  
little low-tech work, like buying and learning to use this new 
software, filling out proper paperwork with employers and financial 
institutions and organizing bills and documents by hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizational experts offer these simple tips to get going:  

</P>
<P>
	--SET UP A FILING SYSTEM for bills, canceled checks or account  
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Software will do much to cut clutter and time, but even a simple  
system of using folders and a ledger notebook can be useful. Mayer 
suggests doing the latter before punching in any numbers on a 
computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``After you pay a bill, put it in the appropriate folder. File  
it away by categories or companies ... If you do a good job and 
keep track of income and expenses, you can save a whole lot of 
money in taxes, which is what most people are interested in 
doing,'' he says. 

</P>
<P>
	--TOSS OUT THE OLD paperwork and documents.  
</P>
<P>
	Some items can go now, some later.  
</P>
<P>
	Utility bills, credit-card statements, paycheck stubs can go,  
unless they can be used for a tax write-off, in the case of a home 
office. Other exceptions: bills involving late fees, disputed or 
fraudulent charges, and big-ticket items should an insurance claim 
be filed or warranty used. 
</P>
<P>
	Interim statements for Individual Retirement Accounts, 401(k)s  
and brokerage accounts may be thrown out, but keep annual reports. 
Keep records of real estate, stocks, and other investments at least 
three years after assets are sold. File away insurance policies, 
even those that have expired. 
</P>
<P>
	All tax-related records should be kept at least three years  
since the Internal Revenue Service has that amount of time after a 
tax return is filed to conduct an audit. 
</P>
<P>
	Keep forever: marriage, death, birth and divorce certificates  
and the deed to your home. 

</P>
<P>
	--SET UP AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS and save yourself a few postage  
stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	You can instruct an employer to set aside a portion of your pay  
in a retirement plan, like a 401(k). The remainder can be 
electronically sent to checking or savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, money automatically can be transferred to investment  
accounts, like a mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The advantage of doing that, says the Institute of Certified  
Financial Planners, is it forces you to ``dollar-cost average,'' or 
invest a regular amount each paycheck regardless of whether the 
stock market is up or down. This prevents you from trying to 
``time'' the market, which is difficult for all but the most 
sophisticated investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills can be paid electronically, too, either through the  
software program you've installed or your bank. Mortgages, 
utilities, insurance policies and health club dues usually can be 
paid automatically. 

</P>
<P>
	--CONSOLIDATE INVESTMENTS and discard the losers.  
</P>
<P>
	Most people accumulate various investments over the years. But  
how do you know when you've accumulated too much? The Institute of 
Certified Financial Planners recalls how one member saw a 
perspective client who was invested in 124 mutual funds! 
</P>
<P>
	Some financial advisers think any more than 10 funds is  
confusing and defeats the purpose of investing through funds, since 
investment styles will overlap. Do you really need six small-cap 
funds, for instance? And do you need several IRAs spread among 
several brokers? 
</P>
<P>
	Cut through the clutter by consolidating similar types of  
investments. Drop underperforming funds, for example, or 
investments with high fees. Mayer suggests reviewing investment 
objectives and discarding those which no long meet your goals. 

</P>
<P>
	--OTHER HELPFUL HINTS   	
</P>
<P>
	Get rid of all but one or two credit cards. If you can't control  
credit-card spending, consider cutting up the remaining cards and 
transferring the balances to one account. 
</P>
<P>
	Round out your numbers in your checking account.  
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest nuisances that everyone has is reconciling  
the checkbook,'' Mayer noted. ``One of the things I started doing 
... when I send in a bill, I always round it off. If I owe them 
$182, I send them $185; they apply that credit for the next 
bill.''

<HEADLINE>  Pentagon Details Afghanistan Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While acknowledging U.S. strikes against a  
terrorist training center in Afghanistan in August caused 
significant damage, a Pentagon spokesman still refuses to discuss 
what weapons were used. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage appeared to have been inflicted by cruise missiles. But  
spokesman Capt. Michael Doubleday said confirmation of that or 
where the attack originated would reveal too much to the terror 
suspects who were targeted in the assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aug. 20 hits, against alleged terrorist training camps in  
Afghanistan believed to be operated by expatriate Saudi millionaire 
Osama bin Laden, were to retaliate for the destruction of two U.S. 
embassies in Africa. Those bombings killed 258 people and wounded 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes also hit a factory in Sudan where Pentagon officials  
said convincing evidence had been found of a substance used to 
created deadly VX nerve gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has posted photos of three camps in the Khowst  
terrorist complex on its Internet site, and Doubleday was queried 
about them Thursday during a regular Pentagon press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was significant destruction to this particular site that  
was struck,'' Doubleday said. ``It is an indication that these 
facilities ... used by this terrorist group are not out of the 
reach of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday did not reply directly to a question about reports  
that bin Laden was present at the site at the time of the attack 
but escaped. The attack, Doubleday said, ``was not against a 
specific individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department Thursday, a poster was released that  
will be used to advertise a reward of up to $5 million for 
information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and 
his military commander, Muhammad Atef. The poster will be printed 
in various languages and sent to U.S. embassies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday said Pentagon officials knew at the time of the  
strikes that ``there was going to be a meeting of these terrorists 
for the purpose of planning further attacks against U.S. people and 
U.S. facilities. And our actions ... were designed to disrupt that 
kind of activity, and we believe we were very effective in doing 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of five buildings said to have functioned as leadership centers,  
Doubleday said two sustained ``almost total destruction,'' the 
other three ``significant damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Queried about the types of weapons used, Doubleday said such  
information would give too much information to the individuals 
targeted. Since August, Pentagon officials have refused to state 
officially whether the strikes were carried out by cruise missiles 
or even whether they were conducted by the Air Force or the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``On this particular occasion we elected not to get into the  
specifics of the types of weapons that we used nor the particular 
starting points for the launch of those weapons,'' Doubleday said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman, asked why camera footage has not been released  
from recent air attacks against Iraqi missile sites, said such 
video would also provide too much information to the Iraqis, in 
particular about the AGM-130 missile being used.

<HEADLINE> Audubon Zoo's White Tiger Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A rare white tiger that was one of the most  
popular attractions at the Audubon Zoo was put to death to end its 
suffering from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Suri was loaned to the zoo in 1983 by the Cincinnati Zoo and  
proved so popular with visitors that the New Orleans zoo easily 
raised the $200,000 needed to buy her a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Her cancer was discovered last year, and surgery to remove part  
of her intestine failed to cure it. The 16-year-old tiger was put 
to death Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a beautiful and graceful animal and we'll miss her,''  
Audubon Institute president Ron Forman said. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a Bengal tiger with a genetic variation that gave her  
blue eyes and white fur with faint stripes. There are only a few 
hundred like her. 
</P>
<P>
	Bengal tigers generally live 15 to 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Starts Farmers' Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Philip Morris has made the first move  
toward establishing a $5.15 billion trust fund to help farmers and 
communities hurt by declining cigarette sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, in a letter obtained by The Associated Press  
Friday, said it would pay $300 million into the fund this year 
regardless of whether other tobacco companies decided to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our intention that these funds be distributed to growers  
and quota owners as determined by the trustees as soon as 
possible,'' said Steven Parrish, Philip Morris' senior vice 
president of corporate affairs, in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Further payments would be made for the next nine years if the  
three other companies -- R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson and 
Lorillard -- decide to pay their share. 
</P>
<P>
	If the other companies enter the trust fund, Philip Morris  
proposed a payment schedule of a total of $600 million this year, 
$550 million next year and $500 million for the next eight years. 
The payments would be indexed to inflation and U.S. cigarette 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers' trust fund would be the second phase of the massive  
tobacco settlement signed Nov. 23 between companies and 46 states. 
It stipulated that the two sides meet to address the concerns of 
the growers, who were not included in the deal. A first meeting was 
held a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Philip Morris came after several tobacco grower  
groups agreed to accept the trust fund on Jan. 8, instead of 
holding out for amounts as high as $12 billion, said North Carolina 
Attorney General Mike Easley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't make them (the farmers) understand it was a  
gift,'' Easley said Friday. ``Now that the farm groups are 
supporting the trust fund, the companies are going to be more 
likely to provide it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the big question is: Will the other three companies go  
along? 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting with officials of tobacco-growing states and the  
companies to discuss the trust fund is scheduled for Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson spokesman Mark Smith said the ``Philip Morris  
move is very positive. We've said before we're very supportive of 
that plan. We're hoping that all four companies are involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when B&AMP;W would start paying into such a trust fund, he  
said: ``We've got to have all four companies involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds has said it wouldn't participate in the trust  
fund, but had no immediate comment on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter from Philip Morris was sent to Phil Carlton, an  
attorney who is representing the industry in the talks with tobacco 
state officials. The company asked him to start setting up the 
trust fund immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Friday, Carlton confirmed that he would  
begin drawing up trust papers on Monday but said he couldn't 
divulge what the other companies were thinking because they were 
his clients.

<HEADLINE> U.N., World Bank Discuss Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The heads of several U.N. agencies and the  
World Bank chief met Friday to explore how they can bridge the gap 
between the time humanitarian emergency aid runs out and longer 
term development aid arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	``War doesn't end with a neat peace process,'' said Sadako  
Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which provides 
immediate care and shelter for refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the war subsides, our work supposedly subsides and ...  
then the development agencies arrive much later,'' she added. 
``This in-between period is very important because if this is 
addressed properly perhaps we can prevent the recurrence of 
conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think  
tank, also included World Bank president James Wolfensohn and the 
heads of the U.N. Development Program, the World Food Program and 
UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund.

about being on a team that can't make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	No way. No thanks. Forget it.  
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc knows how great it is to be at the top of the NBA. And he  
decided on the way up that he didn't like the view of those lesser 
teams. So with Jordan already gone and Scottie Pippen apparently 
leaving, Kukoc says the Chicago Bulls are better off just starting 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a team in the middle of the league, to not  
have a chance to get to the playoffs,'' he said Thursday. ``It will 
take a year or two, (but we should) get to the low point, maybe get 
the chance to grab a few free agents, draft picks and then start 
rebuilding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Jordan retired, the brutal reality of the Bulls'  
future without him is sinking in. Only four players -- Kukoc, Ron 
Harper, Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- are under contract, with 
Harper the only starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget about signing enough good players to make a mediocre  
team, Kukoc said. That's only prolonging the agony. The rebuilding 
threat has been hanging over Chicago for two seasons, so it's time 
to just go ahead and do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Kukoc said the timing couldn't be better. Instead of  
bad basketball for 82 games, the Bulls and their fans will only 
have to endure it for 50. When the season ends, Chicago could have 
a top draft pick and, with plenty of cap money, be a big player in 
free agency next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it would be nicer to have seven rings than six, but we  
would be here and talking about, `What do you think about 
rebuilding?' '' Kukoc said. ``I don't want to say that it's better 
to be done earlier, but at one time, it had to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it's coming soon. Pippen's name is popping up frequently on  
the NBA rumor mill. There's talk he could sign outright with 
Houston, or sign a long-term, big-money deal with the Bulls, then 
be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll see Scottie back in a Bulls uniform  
again,'' said Bill Wennington, another of the Bulls' free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for Luc Longley. Bulls general manager Jerry Krause called  
Longley's agent last week to tell him they didn't have an offer 
yet, and that's the last they've heard, Longley said. Meanwhile, 
Phoenix and several other teams are making a big push for the 
7-foot-2 center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the fact I've heard from everybody else that's a  
player in my free agency market, it's a strong indication to me 
that they're not going to bring me back,'' Longley said today. 
``(I'm) a bit surprised and a bit disappointed. I thought I may end 
up back here because they're going to need someone in the middle, 
but change is a good thing as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the championship team broken up, the Bulls will get ...  
Does it matter? 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope even this first year that we are able to get enough  
players to salvage enough out of what remains to be a decent 
team,'' assistant coach Tex Winter said. ``But it's probably not 
going to be championship caliber for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might not be pretty, either. The Bulls probably are going to  
stick with the triangle offense, and while the system isn't 
complicated, it's not easy to learn, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who had a successful career in Europe before joining the  
Bulls, said it took him about 1 1/2 years before he felt comfortable 
with it. The new players will get two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a whole new team, there's going to be a lot of guys  
running into each other on the court,'' said Dickey Simpkins, 
another free agent. ``It's a big learning process to learn that 
triangle. It's going to be tough if they try to bring in a lot of 
new guys, but it can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls need a new floor leader, too. Harper is liked and  
trusted by everyone on the team, but Kukoc said he's willing to 
step up, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe not in this kind of circumstance, but I'll accept it,''  
he said when asked if he wants to take on a bigger role. ``It's 
going to be different and it might take a while, but I'll take the 
challenge.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Prosecutors Lay Out Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's flashiest trial lawyers need not  
worry -- they probably will not lose clients to the first set of 
House prosecutors in President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not show horses, they're work horses,'' said  
University of Virginia law professor A.E. ``Dick'' Howard after 
four House prosecutors spent more than five hours Thursday 
methodically laying out the initial case against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors got good marks from legal observers for their  
explanation of the impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction 
of justice against Clinton for what he did to conceal his affair 
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	But by outlining the case in great detail, they may have  
undercut their effort to persuade the Senate to call witnesses, 
some observers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really is nothing new. You get the sense that we've  
heard this song before,'' said New York lawyer Bruce Yannett. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., did the best job, Yannett said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson, a U.S. attorney in Arkansas from 1982 to 1985,  
opened by saying, ``This is certainly a humbling experience for a 
small-town lawyer.'' But his largely memorized one-hour, 20-minute 
presentation on the obstruction charge was the most animated of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Yannett thought Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., overreached by arguing  
that Ms. Lewinsky had no motive on her own to file a false 
statement denying an affair with the president. She simply could 
have wanted to stay out of public view, Yannett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Barbara Nicastro said Bryant was persuasive in  
``pointing out the gamesmanship of Bill Clinton'' as part of the 
background of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant and Rep. James Sensenbrenner read closely from their  
scripts, and Sensenbrenner spoke almost in a monotone. Rep. James 
Rogan, R-Calif., who described the perjury charge, referred to his 
written speech much less often. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of the House managers has a stunning lack of charisma and  
is best able to take the Jack Webb-type approach -- just the 
facts,'' said Indiana University law professor Charles Geyh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being thorough requires a methodical, systematic approach that  
may not be exciting to listen to,'' added Geyh, who was special 
counsel to Pennsylvania state House members in the 1994 impeachment 
of a state Supreme Court justice. 
</P>
<P>
	But Washington lawyer Joseph Di Genova said, ``This is not about  
histrionics. They have done the most important thing of all: 
structuring their case by showing the president's centrality to a 
massive scheme of obstruction of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Explaining the obstruction charge first makes it easier to show  
why the perjury case against Clinton is significant, Di Genova 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawyers thought the House members' presentations included  
so much interpretation of events they sounded more like the closing 
arguments of a trial rather than the opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't know if they're ever going to get to call  
witnesses, and this may be their only shot,'' Yannett said. 
</P>
<P>
	All four prosecutors argued for the need to call witnesses after  
Clinton's lawyers outline their defense next week and senators get 
two days to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors were ``effective enough to create the impression  
that there's nothing frivolous about going further and having 
witnesses,'' Geyh said. However, Yannett thought the prosecutors 
did not clearly explain how witness testimony would change what is 
known about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors used a number of videotape clips -- of Clinton  
taking the oath of office on a Bible in 1993, of wagging his finger 
and telling Americans he did not have sexual relations ``with that 
woman, Miss Lewinsky,'' and telling a grand jury the answer to a 
question depended on ``what the meaning of is, is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to remind people this is Slick Willie you're looking  
at,'' Howard said.

<HEADLINE> Rally in Brazil Buoys Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged today on Wall Street as Brazilian  
shares rolled up one the biggest gains in history. There was relief 
in world financial markets, which rallied after Brazil's government 
decided to stop spending heavily to prop up its battered currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 219.62 points, or by  
2.4 percent, to close at 9,340.55. That put the blue chip index 
back into positive territory for the year following four straight 
days of losses that totaled more than 522 points. For the week, the 
Dow was off 302.77 points, or 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index had an even steeper  
rise, climbing 71.38 points Friday, or by 3.1 percent, to close at 
2,348.20, according to preliminary figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was heavy with nearly 793 million shares changing hands  
on the New York Stock Exchange, almost matching Thursday's volume 
but below the frenzied pace of Wednesday, the day of Brazil's 
surprise devaluation of its currency, the real. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian government today reversed its pledge to defend the  
real, which pushed the Brazilian currency down almost 8 percent 
against the U.S. dollar by the end of trading. The move is seen as 
a way for Brazil to attract foreign investment and hold on to its 
currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The main stock index in Sao Paolo -- Latin America's largest  
exchange -- closed up 33.3 percent, the second-biggest gain ever, as 
Brazilian shares suddenly became cheaper for foreign investors. 
Other Latin American markets rallied in turn. 
</P>
<P>
	The news provided relief for investors who feared that the  
financial crisis in Brazil, one of the United States' most 
important trading partners, would spread through all of Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will get through this crisis just like we did in Mexico and  
Asia in years past. Brazil is listening and attempting to act,'' 
said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow fell 228.63 to 9,120.93 on continued  
worries about Brazil and U.S. corporate profits. It is now back 
above where it started the year, at 9,181.43, but is still below 
the record of 9,643.32 set Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The upswing on Wall Street today helped major European markets  
reverse their early losses. London's main stock index closed 2.1 
percent higher, while German stocks rose 1.5 percent and French 
stocks gained 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Asian stock markets were mainly higher as investors  
seemed unconcerned about any spillover effects from Brazil's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips tumbled by 1.9 percent from the outset in Hong Kong,  
Asia's second-largest market after Tokyo, but finished with a loss 
of just 0.4 percent. Singapore shares rose 1.6 percent, while 
Taiwan's main index gained 3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in this region seem not too worried about Brazil now,''  
said Percy Au-Young, sales director at DBS Securities (Hong Kong) 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed today for a holiday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Freezing rain and snow continued to pound the Northeast this  
morning, while a few thunderstorms rumbled through parts of the 
Southeast. A storm system was expected to hit the Pacific Northwest 
later today, while calm was predicted in the Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	The unyielding winter weather continued to cause problems in the  
Northeast and Midwest Thursday, as several inches of snow and 
freezing rain caused hundreds of flight cancellations, miserable 
driving conditions and gave school children yet another day off 
from school. 
</P>
<P>
	Things aren't expected to get much better today. An area of low  
pressure was predicted to drag a cold front through the entire East 
Coast. A band of snow is forecast western New York northeast into 
western Maine, and up to 12 inches could fall by evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Locations from central Pennsylvania through eastern Maine may  
see a combination of freezing rain, sleet, and snow with 
accumulations from 2 to 6 inches. The weight of the ice, coupled 
with strong winds, may continue to cause damage to trees and 
powerlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain is expected to fall from New Jersey, south through eastern  
Virginia, and flooding is likely later today. Meanwhile, rain and 
thunderstorms were predicted from eastern North Carolina into 
Florida, sometimes accompanied by 50 mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	It should be quiet in most areas of the Midwest and Plains, but  
light snow and freezing rain could fall from the eastern Dakotas 
into western Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm system is expected to slowly make its way into the  
Pacific Northwest, causing rain and snow from western Washington to 
northern California. Rainfall along the coast could be heavy, and 
flash flooding may be a problem. Snow is predicted in higher 
elevations of the Cascades, with up to 8 inches likely above 4,000 
feet. Mainly cloudy skies were forecast over northern and central 
Rockies, with a chance of light snow and flurries. Wind gusts over 
40 mph may occur. Dry weather and partly to mostly sunny skies were 
predicted from the southern Rockies to the southern California 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs in the Northeast and the Midwest are forecast for the  
upper 20s and 30s; in the 40s and 50s in the Pacific Northwest, 
Mid-Atlantic States, the Carolinas, the northern Plains and the 
Tennesee Valley; in the 50s and 60s for the central and southern 
Plains, parts of the Southwest and Southeast; in the 70s for 
western Texas and southern California, to near 80 in south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The high for the U.S. mainland Thursday was 86 in Los Alamitos,  
Calif. The low was minus 55 in Allagash, Maine.

<HEADLINE> Man Claims Internet Led to Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- Seconds before fatally shooting himself, a  
man told a 911 dispatcher he murdered his two young children and 
wife because he believed she was having an affair via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``My boy's dead. My wife is dead. My daughter's dead. And now  
I'm going to be dead on account of this goddamned computer,'' Terry 
M. Jones, 53, said on the 911 tape released Friday. The dispatcher 
heard a gunshot, followed by moaning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Terry Richwine said it is unclear whether Jones'  
34-year-old wife, Jennifer, really was involved in an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the sheriff, Jones shot his wife and their  
children, 8-year-old Jesse and 4-year-old Tessa, in their rural 
home in Frankton, about 40 miles north of Indianapolis, on Tuesday 
night, then dialed 911 and asked the dispatchers whether they were 
recording the call. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just killed my wife. I just killed both my kids,'' he said  
on the tape, which was released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said he agreed to release the tape only after The  
Herald Bulletin of Anderson filed a request under the state's open 
records law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see absolutely no value in this,'' he said. ``You're  
only going to hurt the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police had been called to the house for previous disturbances,  
including an incident in which Jones was arrested on domestic 
battery charges. He was convicted of a misdemeanor.

<HEADLINE> Owner of NBA's Kings Sells Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sacramento Kings majority owner Jim  
Thomas will sell controlling interest in the NBA franchise and its 
arena to the Maloof family of Albequerque, N.M., the Kings said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ownership change will be effective July 1, Thomas and Joseph  
Maloof said in a joint statement. Thomas will remain chief 
executive officer of the team until that date. Other details of the 
sale were not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maloof family, which owned the NBA's Houston Rockets from  
1979-82, purchased a one-quarter interest in the Kings one year ago 
for $37.5 million, with an option to purchase the rest of Thomas' 
53 percent interest within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always intended to evaluate my ownership ... of the  
Sacramento Kings following this season,'' said Thomas, a Los 
Angeles-based developer who purchased the team in 1992 and has been 
CEO or managing general partner since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, due to the time constraints of my other business  
activities, I recently contacted the Maloof family and asked them 
if they would like to exercise their option of ownership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maloof family includes Colleen Maloof, whose late husband,  
George Sr., once owned the Rockets, and her adult children, Joseph, 
Gavin, George Jr., Phillip and Adrienne. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have wanted to get back into owning an NBA franchise for  
many years, so this day has been much anticipated,'' Joseph Maloof 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maloof family owns the Fiesta Casino Hotel in North Las  
Vegas, Nev., and holdings including a beer distributorship in 
Albuquerque and several banks, a transportation company and other 
businesses operating in New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleen Maloof chairs the board of directors and Joseph Maloof  
is president of the Maloof companies. Phillip Maloof is a state 
senator in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has not had a winning season since purchasing the Kings.  
However, he did restructure the struggling team's finances two 
years ago by obtaining a $70 million loan from the city, secured by 
the franchise and the Kings' Arco Arena.

<HEADLINE> Senators Return for Day 2 of Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators returned to the Capitol today for  
more evidence and arguments from House prosecutors, still mostly 
divided along party lines on the crucial issues of calling trial 
witnesses and whether President Clinton should be removed from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving after an overnight ice storm, the senators gave their  
views of Thursday's opening of the prosecution case, in which 
Republican House members charged that Clinton engaged in a criminal 
conspiracy to thwart the courts from learning of his affair with 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The House members also pressed for the right to call witnesses  
at the first presidential impeachment trial since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in favor of having witnesses if they can shed light,''  
said Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a moderate Republican the 
White House has hoped will joined Democrats in opposing the calling 
of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can do it in an effective way. Have them stick just  
to the narrow points. We don't want them wandering all over the 
place. We don't want an army of witnesses, but I think a few would 
be helpful,'' Chaffee said in an interview on CNN outside the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats remained steadfast in their opposition to witnesses  
and suggested the House prosecutors' presentation hadn't moved them 
any closer to removing Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	There is still ``a long way to go before you get to the  
threshold that qualifies an impeachment decision,'' Sen. Frank 
Lautenberg, D-N.J., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House joined in the criticism. ``Everything that they  
presented has been presented before,'' Press Secretary Joe Lockhart 
said today. ``I think the excessive desire to call witnesses ... 
demonstrates an admission of a fundamental weakness in the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution's tale of perjury and obstruction began  
unfolding Thursday before a jury of 100 hushed senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising from their curved, custom-built tables in a chamber  
steeped with history, House ``managers'' took turns in their 
opening statements to argue in favor of removing the 42nd president 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the prosecutors were to offer a summation of evidence and  
arguments that the president's conduct violated criminal law. 
</P>
<P>
	A key decision facing senators is whether to call witnesses  
during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you boil the case down, somebody's telling the truth under  
oath and somebody's lying under oath,'' Rep. James Sensenbrenner, 
R-Wis., one of the House prosecutors, said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
``And the only way the senators will be able to determine which is 
which is by seeing the principals, looking at their facial 
expressions, looking at the tone of their voice and making a 
determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton worked at the White House, preparing for  
Tuesday's State of the Union address. Lockhart said he was briefed 
by his lawyers for 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today he addressed a reinventing government forum at the State  
Department before flying to New York City to unveil a new economic 
initiative designed to encourage investment in underserved 
inner-city and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., chided Democrats in  
a written statement for commenting on the substance of the case -- 
contending most Republicans followed his admonition to hold their 
political fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we heard today was nothing new,'' said freshman Sen.  
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who served on the House Judiciary 
Committee as that panel built the impeachment case with sharp 
partisan divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some in the House hope if we keep saying it enough,  
maybe (pro-Clinton) public opinion will change. I don't think so,'' 
Schumer told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, countered that the prosecution  
brought the jurors ``a chronology we've not had. ... The 
presentations were very meaningful and very strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A team of White House lawyers sat at their own curved table  
opposite the prosecution team, waiting to present their case next 
week but unable under Senate rules to raise any objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in  
two articles of impeachment approved Dec. 19 by the House along 
partisan lines. It takes a two-thirds vote in the Senate to remove 
the president from office, meaning a dozen Democrats would have to 
join the 55 Republicans to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., presenting the case for  
obstruction, methodically wove together a series of presidential 
actions in late 1997 and into 1998 that, he said, were designed to 
keep Clinton's extramarital affair with Ms. Lewinsky from the Paula 
Jones lawyers at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning on Dec. 5, 1997, when Ms. Lewinsky was added to the  
potential list of witnesses in Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment 
lawsuit against the president, ``the wheels of obstruction started 
rolling and they did not stop until the president successfully 
blocked the truth from coming out on a civil rights case,'' 
Hutchinson argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., presenting the perjury case against  
Clinton, showed videotape from the president's grand jury testimony 
to pick apart his statements about his relationship with Ms. 
Lewinsky, a former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a trial is permitted before this body where live witnesses  
can be called, and their credibility can be scrutinized, the 
evidence will show the president charted a course of perjury,'' 
Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the chamber Rogan said, ``I don't see how the case can  
be presented without witnesses'' including Ms. Lewinsky, 
presidential secretary Betty Currie, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan 
and the president himself.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged today, bouncing back from four  
days of losses as investors cheered Brazil's plan to stop defending 
its troubled currency. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
135.43 at 9,256.36. Broad-market indexes also rose today. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent economic troubles in Brazil have raised fears among  
investors that profits of U.S. companies operating in Latin America 
could suffer. The Dow lost more than 353 points in the last two 
days of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wall Street was pleased with Brazil's decision to stop  
spending heavily to prop up its battered currency, the real. The 
move is seen as a way for Brazil to attract foreign investment and 
hold on to its currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian currency fell nearly 15 percent against the U.S.  
dollar, but the main stock market in Sao Paolo -- Latin America's 
largest exchange -- soared more than 27 percent today, after 
plunging the last six sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is the biggest and most important economy in Latin  
America, which accounts for 20 percent of U.S. exports. Investors 
worry that its problems will spread throughout the region, 
specifically to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think there's recognition that it isn't quite as bad as  
Asia, that it doesn't necessarily have to reverberate around the 
globe,'' said Peter Anderson, chief investment strategist at 
American Express Financial Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We survived Asia very well, because the Federal Reserve  
reduced interest rates, and in fact that's what pulled the market 
up in the final quarter of last year,'' he said. ``I think people 
increasingly recognize that these kinds of dilemmas, as long as 
they don't spread, can actually be constructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gains in U.S. trading helped lift European stocks from  
midday losses. Germany's DAX index closed up 1.4 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 rose 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In overnight trading, Asian stock markets were mostly higher.  
</P>
<P>
	Leading the gains on Wall Street were financial services stocks.  
American Express was up 4 at 100, Merrill Lynch gained 2 13/16 at 
69 15/16 and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose 2 5/16 to 83 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 356.08 million 
shares, up from 336.60 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 18.19 at 1,230.38, and

<HEADLINE>  Bulls May Have a Long Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- After playing with Michael Jordan and  
winning three NBA championships, Toni Kukoc has a few thoughts 
about being on a team that can't make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	No way. No thanks. Forget it.  
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc knows how great it is to be at the top of the NBA. And he  
decided on the way up that he didn't like the view of those lesser 
teams. So with Jordan already gone and Scottie Pippen apparently 
leaving, Kukoc says the Chicago Bulls are better off just starting 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a team in the middle of the league, to not  
have a chance to get to the playoffs,'' he said Thursday. ``It will 
take a year or two, (but we should) get to the low point, maybe get 
the chance to grab a few free agents, draft picks and then start 
rebuilding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Jordan retired, the brutal reality of the Bulls'  
future without him is sinking in. Only four players -- Kukoc, Ron 
Harper, Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- are under contract, with 
Harper the only starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget about signing enough good players to make a mediocre  
team, Kukoc said. That's only prolonging the agony. The rebuilding 
threat has been hanging over Chicago for two seasons, so it's time 
to just go ahead and do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Kukoc said the timing couldn't be better. Instead of  
bad basketball for 82 games, the Bulls and their fans will only 
have to endure it for 50. When the season ends, Chicago could have 
a top draft pick and, with plenty of cap money, be a big player in 
free agency next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it would be nicer to have seven rings than six, but we  
would be here and talking about, `What do you think about 
rebuilding?' '' Kukoc said. ``I don't want to say that it's better 
to be done earlier, but at one time, it had to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it's coming soon. Pippen's name is popping up frequently on  
the NBA rumor mill. There's talk he could sign outright with 
Houston, or sign a long-term, big-money deal with the Bulls, then 
be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll see Scottie back in a Bulls uniform  
again,'' said Bill Wennington, another of the Bulls' free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for Luc Longley. Bulls general manager Jerry Krause called  
Longley's agent last week to tell him they didn't have an offer 
yet, and that's the last they've heard, Longley said. Meanwhile, 
Phoenix and several other teams are making a big push for the 
7-foot-2 center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the fact I've heard from everybody else that's a  
player in my free agency market, it's a strong indication to me 
that they're not going to bring me back,'' Longley said today. 
``(I'm) a bit surprised and a bit disappointed. I thought I may end 
up back here because they're going to need someone in the middle, 
but change is a good thing as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the championship team broken up, the Bulls will get ...  
Does it matter? 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope even this first year that we are able to get enough  
players to salvage enough out of what remains to be a decent 
team,'' assistant coach Tex Winter said. ``But it's probably not 
going to be championship caliber for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might not be pretty, either. The Bulls probably are going to  
stick with the triangle offense, and while the system isn't 
complicated, it's not easy to learn, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who had a successful career in Europe before joining the  
Bulls, said it took him about 1 1/2 years before he felt comfortable 
with it. The new players will get two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a whole new team, there's going to be a lot of guys  
running into each other on the court,'' said Dickey Simpkins, 
another free agent. ``It's a big learning process to learn that 
triangle. It's going to be tough if they try to bring in a lot of 
new guys, but it can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls need a new floor leader, too. Harper is liked and  
trusted by everyone on the team, but Kukoc said he's willing to 
step up, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe not in this kind of circumstance, but I'll accept it,''  
he said when asked if he wants to take on a bigger role. ``It's 
going to be different and it might take a while, but I'll take the 
challenge.''

	Dow Ends Up 219.62 at 9,340.55  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rose aggressively Friday, bouncing  
back from four days of losses, as investors cheered Brazil's plan 
to stop defending its troubled currency. The Dow Jones industrial 
average closed up 219.62 points at 9,340.55, making back a good 
portion of the 353 points that it lost on Wednesday and Thursday. 
Broad-market indexes were sharply higher, boosted again by more big 
gains in technology shares. The Nasdaq composite index rose 71.38 
to 2,348.20. Leading the gains on Wall Street were financial 
services stocks, which had taken big hits earlier this week on 
Brazil's devaluation. Basic materials stocks, like those of paper 
and chemical companies, were higher. Consumer stocks were mixed 
after taking big hits earlier this week on Brazil.

	Brazil Stocks Soar As Currency Falls  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian currency tumbled and  
stock markets soared Friday as the government temporarily floated 
its currency, the real, in a new strategy to escape the global 
crisis hanging over Latin America. Euphoria raced through the 
markets, with investors seeing new bargains in Brazil and a likely 
end to the drain on the country's currency reserves. The turmoil in 
South America's largest economy had raised fears that it would 
spread across the continent and even to the United States. 

</P>
<P>
	Some Nations Seek Exchange Controls  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Germany, Japan and France have called  
for some exchange controls even as Brazil is letting its currency 
lurch at the whims of the marketplace. In a joint statement, German 
Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine and his Japanese counterpart 
Kiichi Miyazawa urged the creation of ``an exchange-rate regime 
among major currencies which would reduce excessive volatility.'' 
The same wording appeared in a statement issued later by Miyazawa 
and French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn.

	ABC's Union Lockout Ends  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC's lockout of 2,400 employees in five cities  
ended Friday. ``We're done. The lockout ends at 5 p.m.,'' said a 
spokesman for the National Association of Broadcast Employees and 
Technicians. The union members will return to their jobs at ABC 
after 11 weeks on picket lines. These employees, who include camera 
operators, producers and other behind-the-scenes workers, will be 
back on the job within 72 hours, the network said. NABET members at 
the network, who have been without a contract since March 1997, had 
staged a one-day strike over health benefits on Nov. 2. The next 
day, ABC locked them out of their jobs until they promised advance 
warning on future job actions. Until this week, the union refused.

	Russia's 1999 Budget a Hard Sell  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov tried to assuage  
Russians' worries about their country's economic future on Friday, 
praising the 1999 budget and hinting at more loans from the West. 
But Stanley Fischer, the International Monetary Fund's No. 2 
official, painted a bleak picture on Friday of Russia's financial 
situation, saying the country has a lot of serious restructuring to 
do. Speaking at a forum at Harvard University, Fischer reiterated 
that the fund won't offer any more money until Russia comes up with 
a feasible budget, Russian news report said.

	Industrial Production Up 0.2 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Output at the nation's factories, mines and  
utilities in 1998 grew at the slowest pace in five years but a 
modest end-of-the-year pickup offered hope that 1999 won't be as 
dismal as some feared. Industrial production increased 0.2 percent 
in December from the month before and 3.7 percent in 1998 from the 
year before, the Federal Reserve said Friday. The annual gain was 
the smallest increase since a 3.5 percent advance in 1993. It 
followed a robust 6 percent rise in 1997. Separately, the Commerce 
Department said inventories at American businesses rose a moderate 
0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted $1.09 trillion in November, in 
line with an identical gain in sales. Economists say backlogs of 
unsold goods were relatively lean heading into 1999. Too big a 
buildup can signal production cutbacks as businesses work to reduce 
inventories.

	Firm Wants Global Satellite System  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Virtual Geosatellite LLC is seeking a license  
from the Federal Communications Commission to build a global 
satellite system to offer high-speed Internet access and other data 
services, the company said Friday. Assuming it wins FCC approval, 
the Washington-based company wouldn't offer services directly to 
the public but would lease its facilities to companies that would, 
Virtual Geosatellite spokesman Brian Willard said. The company 
plans to begin providing services five years after FCC approval.

	Clinton Challenges Wall Street  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Offering a billion-dollar bundle of proposed tax  
credits and loan guarantees, President Clinton challenged Wall 
Street on Friday to open its ``vaults of opportunity'' so the 
nation's prosperity can spill over into neglected urban and rural 
communities. Day 2 of the Republican prosecution team's 
presentation in the Senate trial of the president doubled as the 
umpteenth day of Clinton's going-about-business strategy for 
surviving impeachment. He proposed a 25 percent tax credit, at a 
cost to the government of $1 billion, to corporations and 
investment groups that would support small technology companies, 
shopping centers and other business development in targeted urban 
and rural areas. 

</P>
<P>
	Airline in Challenge to Northwest  
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Charter carrier Sun Country Airlines plans to  
institute regularly scheduled daily service on June 1, hoping to 
compete directly with Northwest Airlines on several routes. Bill La 
Macchia Jr., Sun Country's president and chief executive, said 
Friday the airline was responding to demand from business and 
leisure travelers. Sun Country, which has only 15 planes, will 
offer daily nonstop flights between the Twin Cities and New 
York-JFK, Washington-Dulles, Boston, Detroit, Orlando, Las Vegas, 
Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.

	Arco To Cut 300 More Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Atlantic Richfield Co. will eliminate 300  
more jobs and take a fourth-quarter charge of $890 million to cover 
the cost of the layoffs and reflect the shrinking value of oil 
holdings in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. The announcement 
on Friday follows a trend of cutbacks and consolidations throughout 
the oil industry, which has been battered by falling prices and 
lower demand for petroleum products ranging from gasoline and 
natural gas to petrochemicals. Crude prices are at their lowest 
levels in more than a decade. 

</P>
<P>
	Medicare To Adjust HMO Payments  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare will pay private health plans more  
for patients who are sick and less for those who are healthy, 
starting in 2000. The change will remove the incentives for plans 
to enroll only more healthy beneficiaries, according to Medicare's 
deputy administrator, Michael Hash, who announced details of the 
change on Friday. Congress ordered the payment change in the 1997 
balanced budget law. Health plans appealed to lawmakers to 
reconsider, saying that combined with recent payment curbs, the 
change could prompt more plans to pull out of Medicare. Already, 
health plans have dropped more than 400,000 elderly and disabled 
patients this year, citing lower-than-expected payments.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Challenges Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Offering a billion-dollar bundle of proposed tax  
credits and loan guarantees, President Clinton challenged Wall 
Street on Friday to open its ``vaults of opportunity'' so the 
nation's prosperity can spill over into neglected urban and rural 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Day 2 of the Republican prosecution team's presentation in the  
Senate trial of the president doubled as the umpteenth day of 
Clinton's going-about-business strategy for surviving impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed a 25 percent tax credit, at a cost to the government  
of $1 billion, to corporations and investment groups that would 
support small technology companies, shopping centers and other 
business development in targeted urban and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many places are there in America where a kid has to walk  
for blocks and blocks past abandoned storefronts just to buy a book 
for school or milk for the family?'' Clinton asked business 
executives at an economic conference organized by Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, his package of proposals would spur $15 billion in  
private investment, Clinton said. He talked of building a bridge 
between the office towers and their shadows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the economy is so good, now is the time to build that  
bridge,'' Clinton exhorted. 
</P>
<P>
	The day also offered Clinton -- within the World Trade Center's  
106th floor, at least -- warm refuge from the condemnation of House 
prosecutors laying out their case on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, led a  
parade of nine speakers who praised Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``You done good, William Jefferson Clinton,'' said Essence  
magazine editor Susan Taylor. ``Only God is perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A relaxed and joking Clinton called all of it ``the sort of  
thing people say for your funeral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're there yet,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	On the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., Clinton borrowed a  
phrase from the slain civil rights leader and spoke of American 
economic success as ``vaults of opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, those vaults of opportunity are richer and fuller than  
they ever have been. Wall Street has helped to make that so,'' 
Clinton said. ``Now what we need to do is to open those vaults 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed a domestic version of the Overseas Private  
Investment Corporation, which helps businesses expand overseas. The 
proposed private investment partnerships, to be known as America's 
Private Investment Companies, would win government loan guarantees 
by making equity investments in larger businesses that expand or 
relocate to inner cities or rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton promised to target to low- and moderate-income areas the  
Small Business Administration's investment program, which gives 
equity and debt financing to small companies looking to grow. 
America Online and Staples are two examples of companies that have 
benefited from this program, but the White House says it has been 
of little benefit to inner cities and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who has undertaken a day-by-day rollout of his new  
budget due to Congress next month, cast this latest initiative as a 
must-have centerpiece of his 1999 agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave a nod to the awkward context in which that agenda will  
sink or soar: a Republican-led Congress currently preoccupied with 
his impeachment and unlikely to hand him any policy successes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I thought it would pass it,'' Clinton said of his Wall  
Street proposal, ``I would be glad to call it the Herbert 
Hoover-Warren Harding-Calvin Coolidge Economic Development Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will do anything to pass it.''

<HEADLINE> Louisville Wants Playoff Ban Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Louisville's president and athletic director went  
before an NCAA appeals committee Friday seeking to reverse the 
school's ban from postseason basketball play. 
</P>
<P>
	President John Shumaker said that in the hearing before the  
four-member Infractions Appeals Committee the school argued the 
postseason ban was excessive punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the discussion was very good, very enlightening, but I  
can't predict what the outcome will be,'' Shumaker said after the 
four-hour hearing at a resort hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Shumaker said he expects a decision in the next few weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Louisville was given a three-year probation last year by the  
NCAA's Committee on Infractions for two violations by former 
assistant coach Scooter McCray, who was reassigned within the 
athletic department last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA report said that McCray secured a discounted hotel room  
for Fred Johnson, the father of forward Nate Johnson, and later 
provided his personal credit card to keep him from being evicted 
because of a delinquent bill.

<P>
	Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich said Friday that ``we  
never felt that the crime fit the punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals are 9-3 this season, including a win against No. 6  
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Another of the school's main arguments Friday was that the  
infractions committee did not notify the university before a 
hearing that it was applying the repeat-violator provisions to the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The infractions committee went against the recommendation of  
NCAA investigators in ruling Louisville a ``repeat violator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee had placed Louisville on probation in 1996 after  
an investigation raised questions concerning former player Samaki 
Walker's use of two cars during the summer and fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville has noted that of the 23 programs hit with postseason  
bans, it was the only one that didn't violate rules regarding 
ethical conduct, institutional control or academic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray's attorney, Gregg Hovious, said Friday he would like to  
see the appeals panel reverse McCray's three-year coaching 
suspension because McCray did not commit a major infraction. McCray 
is appealing independently. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think at worst what he did was a secondary violation,''  
Hovious said. ``We have asked the NCAA appeals committee to reach 
the same conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hovious said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' that the appeals  
committee would reverse the ruling by the infractions committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovious also was critical of the infractions committee's  
decision to apply the repeat-violator provisions in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``They went in there looking at a speeding ticket and they came  
out with something much worse,'' Hovious said. ``Scooter (McCray) 
was stunned to learn that this happened to him.''

<P>
	HYDERABAD, India (AP) -- A chorus of Hindu chants echoed as  
Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci was honored Friday with the 
first lifetime achievement award at India's annual film festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertolucci, 58, whose work includes ``The Last Emperor'' and  
``Last Tango in Paris,'' received a gold medal and certificate from 
India's information minister. A screening of Bertolucci's new film, 
``Besieged,'' followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertolucci was honored for ``enriching world cinema as a master  
craftsman, an incisive social analyst and chronicler of our 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While making films, I was exposed to different cultures which  
always fascinate me,'' Bertolucci said. ``This endeavor is a search

<HEADLINE>  Maier Seeks To Hold World Cup Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WENGEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Like his cyborg namesake, the  
``Herminator,'' skier Hermann Maier seems impossible to stop, no 
matter how badly his body takes a beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously considering a short break in order to rest a painful  
back before the upcoming world championships in Vail, Colo., Maier 
is instead disregarding his chronic injury to compete Saturday in 
celebrated Lauberhorn downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner last year in a downhill moved from Veysonnaz and  
shortened due to high winds, Maier is hoping a repeat this year 
might solidify his place among the Austrians likely to compete next 
month in Vail. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the physical impediment, it would not be surprising to  
see Maier come through. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier has repeatedly displayed remarkable Terminator-like  
resilience, the most shocking example at the Nagano Olympics when 
he survived a horrific, crash in the downhill before returning to 
the slopes to triumph in the super-G and giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauberhorn, the longest and one of the most demanding  
downhills on the World Cup circuit, provably will provide the same 
type of challenge for Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true it's very long but maybe I'm very fast so it's not  
so long for me,'' joked the reigning overall World Cup champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier's toughest competition probably will come from 1996  
overall World Cup champion Lasse Kjus of Norway, the winner of the 
season's first two downhills. He leads the World Cup standings in 
that discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Kristian Ghedina, who set a course record two years ago,  
and Austrian Andreas Schifferer, the reigning World Cup downhill 
champion, also will provide a strong challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Schifferer, who won the full-length Wengen downhill last year,  
also is looking to secure one of the four Austrian berths in the 
downhill at the worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can qualify if I win here,'' said Schifferer, still winless  
this season after an ankle injury in August set him back. ``But 
that doesn't add any pressure. We all still have a chance to 
qualify during downhill training in Vail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches will decide then on the remaining berths.  
</P>
<P>
	``Besides that, it's exciting to defend my win here,'' said  
Schifferer, who won four downhills last season. 
</P>
<P>
	While Maier also is chasing the World Cup downhill crown this  
season -- the only title to elude him among the events in which he 
regularly competes -- he has a more immediate concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the overall World Cup standings with 911 points, Maier  
is just 228 ahead of 1994 overall champion Kjetil Andre Aamodt of 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, a versatile skier skilled in both the speed and  
technical disciplines, also is competing in this weekend's 
downhill, and could easily weaken Maier's lead with additional 
points from both the slalom and the season's first combined event. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Maier finished third in the combined downhill then  
10th in his first career World Cup slalom -- staged in Veysonnaz 
because of insufficient snow in Wengen -- to clinch the combined 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, the reigning combined world champion, finished eighth in  
both downhills in Wengen last year, but went out in the first leg 
of the slalom, losing a valuable opportunity to collect points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegian, tied for second with Maier in the World Cup  
combined standings last season, has never climbed the podium in 
Wengen in any discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier's back problems, however, probably will give Aamodt a  
considerable advantage in the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the downhill it's not so bad because there are fewer back  
movements involved,'' acknowledged Maier, who won the most recent 
downhill, last month in Bormio, Italy. ``But the technical events 
are harder on the back with all that turning, twisting and 
leaning.''

<HEADLINE> Wannstedt, Johnson Talk Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Dave Wannstedt and Jimmy Johnson rode to the  
office together Friday, and the conversation focused on going back 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all Miami Dolphins talk, and what we can do to make the  
team better,'' Wannstedt said. ``With free agency coming up, that's 
where Jimmy's focus is now. We were talking through some scenarios. 
He was as excited about the direction we're going as I've seen 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 24 hours earlier, Wannstedt was unemployed and Johnson was  
contemplating retirement. On Friday, the two close friends formed a 
car pool and began preparing for a busy offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt joined the Dolphins as assistant head coach, a hiring  
that resolved the team's coaching crisis. The 55-year-old Johnson 
decided he could keep working and still spend time with his family 
by delegating some duties to Wannstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy is dealing with contracts, the salary cap, free  
agency, the draft and the Xs and Os of football,'' Wannstedt said. 
``That's an awful lot of hats to wear. Hopefully I can help him in 
a lot of those areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt, 46, was Johnson's defensive coordinator with the  
University of Miami and the Dallas Cowboys before becoming head 
coach of the Chicago Bears. He was fired by the Bears two weeks ago 
after going 40-56 in six seasons with one playoff win. 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt was vacationing in Naples, Fla., when Johnson  
telephoned him with a job offer Thursday morning. By then, Dolphins 
owner Wayne Huizenga had persuaded Johnson to remain as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt quickly accepted, and Huizenga sent his helicopter to  
Naples to fetch the Dolphins' newest acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to do something just to do it,'' said  
Wannstedt, who has two years and $2.5 million remaining on his 
contract with the Bears. ``This is a special organization and a 
special area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after arriving at his new job Friday, Wannstedt stood in  
the lobby of the Dolphins complex and inspected the wall above the 
main entrance. It's covered with plaques honoring each member of 
the undefeated 1972 Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's impressive,'' he said. ``When you've been in the league  
10 years, you have a greater appreciation for what it takes to 
accomplish something like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt signed a one-year, $300,000 contract with Miami. He  
wants to be a head coach again someday and joins the Dolphins as 
the heir apparent to Johnson. But Wannstedt said he's had no 
discussions with Johnson or Huizenga about becoming Miami's head 
coach eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only focus is to see if we can move this team to another  
level next year,'' he said. ``That's all anybody is concerned about 
right now, and definitely me.''

<HEADLINE> Senator Urges Changes in IRAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new type of 401(k) plan allowing money to be  
withdrawn tax-free would be created and numerous major changes 
would be made to other individual retirement arrangements under 
legislation proposed by a key Republican senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance  
Committee and sponsor of the popular Roth IRA, said today the 
Retirement Savings Opportunity Act would ``address the issue of 
baby boomers and others not having enough savings'' for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress and President Clinton debate how to ensure Social  
Security remains solvent, lawmakers are examining dozens of options 
to enable more people to guarantee their own retirement incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	Foremost among the bill's provisions would be a so-called ``Roth  
401(k)'' plan that would differ from regular 401(k) plans in a 
crucial way: the earnings on contributions -- while made on an 
after-tax basis -- would be tax-free when they are distributed, much 
like the Roth IRA. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules for a Roth IRA would also change. The income limit on  
people wishing to convert a traditional IRA to a Roth would rise 
from $100,000 to $1 million and all income limits would be 
eliminated for people wishing to make a full annual contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would make these other changes:  
</P>
<P>
	--The maximum IRA contribution limit would rise from $2,000 to  
$5,000 per year and go up annually in $100 increments. Workers 50 
and older could contribute up to $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	--The maximum pre-tax contribution to a regular 401(k) plan would  
increase from $10,000 to $15,000; those 50 and older could 
contribute as much as $22,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	--For people who are active in a workplace pension plan, the  
amount they can contribute to traditional IRAs is limited by the 
amount they earn. Roth's bill would end all income limits. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several other provisions dealing with matching  
contributions by employers and laws governing certain pension 
plans. Roth is expected to introduce the measure in the Senate in a 
few days.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Jones Spar Over Legal Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday he should  
be free from a dispute over attorneys fees in the Paula Jones case 
because he already has sent a settlement check to the parties 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers said they wrote the $850,000 settlement check  
this week to Mrs. Jones and also her past and present lawyers 
specifically to avoid being involved in any dispute over legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' former lawyers, Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert Davis,  
have lodged an $874,000 claim in legal fees for their work. 
</P>
<P>
	But in papers filed in U.S. District Court, Clinton's lawyers  
said the president has upheld his part of the agreement and can no 
longer be tapped for additional money. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of the president's payment of the settlement  
amount in full, neither the president nor his counsel are liable 
... for attorneys fees and costs in any amount,'' said the filing 
by Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of Clinton's payment, any claim by Cammarata and  
Davis must come out of the settlement money, Bennett says, and is 
now in the hands of the plaintiff and her present and former 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	The response of the Dallas law firm Rader, Campbell, Fisher and  
Pyke, which represented Mrs. Jones through the settlement, was not 
on file with the federal court clerk at the close of Friday's 
business day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the firm did not return messages left at their  
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate responses were filed Friday by Mrs. Jones and the  
Rutherford Institute, which helped fund her defense. Those 
responses cited arguments in the unseen filing by the Dallas firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones alleged in her lawsuit that Clinton, when he was  
governor of Arkansas, made a sexual proposition to her in a Little 
Rock hotel room in 1991. Clinton denied the accusation and, in the 
settlement, did not admit any wrongdoing or apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright dismissed the lawsuit  
April 1, but Mrs. Jones appealed the decision. The appeal was 
pending when she and Clinton reached the settlement Nov. 13.

<HEADLINE> Native Hawaiians To Elect Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Imprisoned in her palace bedroom, Queen  
Lili`uokalani was given an ultimatum in 1895: abdicate the throne 
or her followers would face a firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``For myself, I would have chosen death rather than to have  
signed it,'' the eighth Hawaiian monarch later wrote. But she felt 
she had no choice. Her signature forever relinquished the monarchy 
begun in 1810 by Kamehameha I. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, more than a century later, some native Hawaiians want the  
crown restored, others want their own nation and still others would 
like to see something akin to the partial autonomy some Indian 
tribes have, a ``nation within a nation,'' for descendants of the 
original islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	No one seriously worries about insurrection, but the sovereignty  
movement in Hawaii is real, and native Hawaiians will cast votes 
Sunday to select the people who will shape it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sovereignty is a trail Hawaiians have been traveling actively  
for 25 years and even longer since the overthrow of the monarchy,'' 
said Kaipo Kincaid, executive director of Ha Hawaii, sponsor of the 
election. ``This is a journey we are taking -- all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 100,000 native Hawaiians -- anyone with at least part  
ancestry of the Hawaiian race, no matter where they live -- are 
eligible to elect delegates to a sovereignty convention planned for 
this summer. The convention, organizers hope, will set specific 
goals for the sovereignty movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The process began three years ago when the Hawaiian Sovereignty  
Elections Council mailed ballots to 81,507 registered native 
Hawaiians. Fewer than half voted, but 73 percent of those who 
returned ballots favored electing delegates to a convention. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 156 Hawaiians are competing for 85 seats at the  
convention. Results of Sunday's vote are to be announced Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all native Hawaiians support the push for sovereignty. Some  
question the legitimacy of a process begun by less than half of 
qualified voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kina`u Boyd Kamali`i, a former trustee of the Office of Hawaiian  
Affairs, an agency charged with looking out for the interests of 
native Hawaiians, said the election should meet minimum 
requirements, including having ballots cast by a majority of 
registered native Hawaiian voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ha Hawaii (``ha'' means ``breath'' in Hawaiian) succeeded the  
state-appointed Sovereignty Elections Council -- and Kamali`i said 
any process started by state appointees is tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ha Hawaii process is not the breath of life, but possibly  
the kiss of death to native Hawaiian self-government,'' Kamali`i 
said in a January newsletter from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	She also likened the election to the creation of the Republic of  
Hawaii after Lili`uokalani's overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, as now, a small group of unelected individuals decided  
the process and drafted a constitution -- ready or not, wanted or 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ha Hawaii president Pua`ala McElhaney said the group's  
authority comes from its membership and supporting organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can detractors have such total lack of trust in the judgment  
of the Hawaiian people to think that all of these groups, all of 
these people, as diverse as they are, are under state control and 
not know it?'' McElhaney asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentiment in favor of sovereignty has existed ever since  
Americans, Germans and Britons sacked Queen Lili`uokalani's 
government and formed the Republic of Hawaii in 1893. She abdicated 
two years later, having spent a portion of that time under house 
arrest in her palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar planters then persuaded the United States to annex Hawaii  
in 1898, despite opposition from native islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The islands became a U.S. territory in 1900. Though Hawaiians  
were U.S. citizens, they could not vote and were represented by a 
congressional delegate who also could not vote. Hawaii became the 
50th state in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Ha Hawaii still needs to raise about $3 million to hold the  
convention. Assuming fund-raising targets are met, delegates will 
likely hold community briefings and then make recommendations for 
ratification by voters, Kincaid said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over time, the (sovereignty) discussion will weave a fabric,''  
she said, ``As there is more dialogue, the predominant concepts 
will prevail.''

<HEADLINE> Man Nabbed in $5 Million Art Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frank DiSanto says he's an art lover. So when he  
saw five antique silk prints enclosed in glass at the Alitalia 
lounge at Kennedy Airport, he thought they were being thrown away -- 
and took them. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeah, right, say detectives who tracked and arrested him in just  
four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old baggage handler was charged with stealing $5  
million worth of artwork that once hung in the Sistine Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
	Catching DiSanto wasn't hard: He had left behind a dental  
appointment card with his name on it Wednesday, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us he thought they were being thrown out so he took  
them,'' said Detective Lt. Bobby Caron of the Port Authority 
Police. ``He said he appreciates art and was just going to hang 
them in his bedroom to look at them.'' 
</P>

	The tapestries that once hung among Michelangelo's frescos were  
found stuffed in a garbage bag at DiSanto's home.

	They date from the 7th to the 14th centuries and had been a gift

	The framed prints were still in their glass case housing in the

antiques.

<HEADLINE> Grand Ole Opry Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Resplendent in a purple suit studded  
with rhinestones, Grand Ole Opry star Porter Wagoner sang his hit 
``Company's Comin''' Friday to launch the Opry's first show at the 
Ryman Auditorium in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-year-old radio showcase spent 31 years at the Ryman, and  
was last presented at the former church March 15, 1974. Then it 
moved to the Grand Ole Opry House in north Nashville, where it has 
been ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcome to the Grand Ole Opry from the mother church, the  
Ryman Auditorium,'' Wagoner greeted the sold-out crowd of 2,100. 
The bill featured Opry regulars like ``Jumpin''' Bill Carlisle and 
George Hamilton IV, as well as younger stars like Vince Gill, 
Sherrie Austin, John Berry and Ricky Skaggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more shows slated for Saturday night were already sold out.  
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, the intimate Ryman echoed with country music  
classics like ``The End of The World'' by Skeeter Davis, ``Rose 
Colored Glasses'' by John Conlee and ``Daddy's Hands'' by Holly 
Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the music had a familiar ring, a lot has changed since  
1974. The Opry left a declining downtown, and returned to find it 
thriving, with Friday's National Hockey League game drawing 
thousands of fans to the new Nashville Arena down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd probably have come down sometime or other to see the Opry,  
but having it at the Ryman made me do it today,'' said Bradley 
McIntyre of Cape Girardeau, Mo., a 39-year-old painter and amateur 
steel guitar player who went to the show. 
</P>
<P>
	The return to the Ryman is the first major initiative of Steve  
Buchanan, who took over running the Opry show this year. Buchanan 
has said there is no plan to move the Opry back downtown 
permanently.

<HEADLINE> Scandal Costs USOC Staffer His Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A scheme to gather information on IOC members  
for Salt Lake City's Olympic bidders has cost a top-level U.S 
Olympic Committee official his job, Olympic sources told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfredo La Mont, the USOC's senior director of international  
relations, was the middleman in efforts by Salt Lake bid chief Tom 
Welch to buy intelligence about IOC members in Latin America, the 
sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont is the first USOC official to be linked to the growing  
scandal involving alleged bribes of International Olympic Committee 
members in an attempt to win votes in Salt Lake's successful bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A USOC statement said La Mont stepped down after informing the  
committee ``of a previously undisclosed business relationship with 
the Salt Lake Olympic (Bid) Committee through the office of former 
SLOC president Tom Welch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We concluded that Mr. La Mont's activities, which he indicated  
he pursued independent of his USOC responsibilities, nonetheless 
constituted a conflict of interest,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not provide details.  
</P>
<P>
	But sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said La  
Mont had ``passed money -- not a lot -- a couple of grand a month'' 
to third parties in return for ``intelligence information on IOC 
members in Latin America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said they did not know just what La Mont might have  
passed on, but Olympic bid cities generally try to find details 
about IOC members' personal tastes, hobbies and other interests so 
they can cater to them. 
</P>
<P>
	They said La Mont also sent food and dairy products, including  
the diet supplement Ensure, to contacts in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach La Mont by telephone Thursday night were  
unsuccessful. He did not return messages left on his answering 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages also were not returned by Welch, USOC president  
Bill Hybl and spokesman Mike Moran. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Schultz, the USOC's executive director who issued the  
statement on La Mont, said he could not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the sources, the USOC learned of the connection  
when La Mont went to Schultz earlier this month after being 
contacted by Welch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew everyone was being watched,'' one source said.  
</P>
<P>
	The sources also said that La Mont apparently did the work from  
his Colorado Springs, Colo., home, but that the committee was 
checking the hard drive of his office computer to see if any action 
was taken on USOC property. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said they did not know how long the operation had  
lasted, but believed it started in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont has been with the USOC since the late 1980s. Salt Lake  
won the 2002 Games in 1995, on its fifth try. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Schultz said information on the La Mont-Welch  
relationship has been given to two panels investigating the bribery 
scandal -- the USOC Special Commission chaired by former Sen. George 
Mitchell and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Those inquiries, as well as ones representing the IOC and SLOC,  
are looking into possible influencing of IOC members in exchange 
for votes backing Salt Lake's candidacy for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont's alleged association with Welch is expected to become a  
part of the Justice Department investigation, according to the 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members face possible expulsion for ``serious''  
offenses in the Salt Lake scandal, and four others face minor 
charges, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Thursday in an 
interview with The Associated Press. Samaranch didn't identify the 
IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who resigned in 1997 as head of the Salt Lake organizers  
amid allegations of spouse abuse, has said he used a privately 
funded program to pay for favors of IOC members. He said this was 
common practice in the Olympic bids.

<HEADLINE>  Brazilian Currency Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian currency tumbled  
sharply today after the Central Bank refused to prop up the 
faltering real in world financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The abrupt move -- reversing the government's pledges to defend  
the real in financial markets -- was taken to try to halt the 
financial crisis that has engulfed Latin America's largest economy. 
The turmoil in Brazil has raised concerns that the robust U.S. 
economy could also be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank said in a statement that it ``will not  
intervene in foreign exchange markets today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The currency immediately plunged about 15 percent to 1.55 reals  
to the U.S. dollar before strengthening slightly to 1.49, still 
below the 1.32 at the close of trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The main stock market in Sao Paulo soared, as Brazilian shares  
suddenly became cheaper for foreign investors. Hours after opening, 
the Bovespa index was up more than 27 percent. Share prices at the 
smaller Rio de Janeiro exchange were up more than 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank said it was revoking its decision on Wednesday  
to set a new trading band for the currency, which had effectively 
devalued the real by about 8 percent. In revoking the band, the 
bank seemed to let the currency float freely on foreign exchange 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A new statement regarding foreign exchange policy will be  
released on Monday,'' the bank said in a statement released in 
Brasilia, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the Central Bank intervenes and sells dollars from its  
reserves to keep the currency within the limits. It had been doing 
so the past two days within the new limit. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports that Finance Minister Pedro Malan and newly  
named Central Bank director Francisco Lopes were planning a trip to 
Washington this evening to discuss the turmoil. The officials were 
likely to meet with officials from the Clinton administration and 
the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's director for financial system supervision, Claudio  
Mauch, whose resignation Thursday added to the turmoil in Brazilian 
markets, announced today he would stay in his post. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso today cut short a  
vacation at his family farm in the state of Minas Gerais and 
returned to Brasilia, the Presidential press office said. It was 
the second time in three days that Cardoso has interrupted his 
long-planned summer holiday due to abrupt shifts in foreign 
exchange policy and market turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Since being caught up in the global financial crisis in August,  
Brazil has been under increasing pressure to devalue its currency 
as a way to attract foreign investment and hold on to its currency 
reserves. Jittery investors have been pulling money out of the 
giant economy, fearful of the turbulence that has roiled emerging 
markets around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have pulled more than $40 billion out of the country  
since August, dropping reserves to around $35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts feel that Brazil had taken a calculated risk that it  
could pull off a smaller devaluation than many economists thought 
necessary and control it. 
</P>
<P>
	To try to protect the currency, the government had forced  
interest rates up to around 29 percent a month, which has hurt 
consumers and businesses and slowed the economy. Brazil had also 
promised to trim $23 billion from its budget in exchange for a 
$41.5 billion bailout package from the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts had said Wednesday's devaluation was too little,  
too late and Brazil was paying for its timidity. Some had said the 
government would have to float the currency. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Lopes had denied any possibility of Brazil adopting  
a floating exchange system, calling such reports ``totally 
unfounded and untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, he said the Central Bank would intervene ``whenever  
necessary'' to defend the new exchange band, which allowed the real 
to float at a rate of between 1.20 and 1.32 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Prefer Noise Over Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- As the Atlanta Falcons' plane descended, Dan  
Reeves looked out at ice fishermen on the lakes and the 
snow-covered terrain and decided he really didn't care about noise. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I looked out of the window, I decided I'd take the dome  
over the weather,'' said the Falcons coach, who went so far as to 
complain to the NFL this week about artificial noise at the 
Metrodome, where Atlanta will play the Vikings on Sunday for the 
NFC title. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the Falcons think they can do what all nine teams that  
played in the Metrodome didn't do -- overcome the noise that creates 
illegal procedure and delay of game penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason, of course, is that the Falcons also play in a dome  
and have had an inordinate number of dome games this season. 
Sunday, in fact, will be their ninth straight game inside and 
they've won them all in a season in which they finished 14-2 and 
eliminated San Francisco in their first playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was the last formal meeting with the media for the two  
teams, who will play the first NFC title game since 1992 not 
involving San Francisco, Green Bay or Dallas. Minnesota hasn't 
played in a title game in 12 years and Atlanta has never been in 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of like to see the power shift because we're part of  
the shift,'' said Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler, in the 
playoffs for the first time in his 11-year career. ``I spent a lot 
of time with bad teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no question that these two teams are the best in the NFC  
-- the Vikings were 15-1 in the regular season and set an NFL record 
by scoring 556 points. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's no question that the noise that Reeves so gracefully  
accepts will play a major part -- even the Vikings think it 
sometimes gets too loud. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be a problem for me, too,'' Minnesota quarterback  
Randall Cunningham said. ``There are times after we make a big play 
that the noise is so loud that I can't hear the play coming in from 
the sideline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are relatively healthy, although Minnesota wide  
receiver Jake Reed was deactivated with a pulled hamstring. But 
coach Dennis Green said he expects Matthew Hatchette to fill in 
well behind Randy Moss and Cris Carter, as he did when Reed was 
sidelined with a back injury the latter part of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	John Randle, Minnesota's all-Pro defensive lineman, said he was  
ready to go, although he may wear a knee brace to protect an 
injury.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Rig Count Down by Three / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of oil and gas rigs operating  
nationwide dropped by three to 597 this week -- just one short of 
the all-time low recorded in 1993, Baker Hughes Inc. said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy company officials said 989 rigs were operating in the  
United States during the same week last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running this week, 470 were exploring for natural  
gas and 126 for oil. One was listed as miscellaneous. 
</P>
<P>
	The rig count represents the number of rigs actively exploring  
for oil and natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since  
1940. The tally peaked at 4,500 in December of 1981 during the oil 
boom. It dropped to a record low of 596 in the summer of 1993, 
exceeding the previous low of 663 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest decline comes as oil companies cut back on  
exploration in the wake of slumping oil prices. Prices have dropped 
to their lowest levels in more than a decade as demand from Asia 
withers and oil-producing nations continue to churn out crude 
despite a huge oversupply in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Alaska lost three  
rigs, Texas lost two and California lost one. Wyoming gained two, 
while Louisiana and Oklahoma each gained one. New Mexico was 
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> EEOC, Fed Job Bias Case To Be Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide  
whether the federal agency that protects workers against on-the-job 
bias can order other federal agencies to financially compensate 
employees they discriminate against. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will use the case of a Department of  
Veterans Affairs accountant from Illinois who was passed over for 
promotion because he is a man to decide whether the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission has the authority to make such 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled in his case that the EEOC has no  
such authority and ordered that a trial be held to determine what 
damages Michael Gibson should be paid. Other appeals courts have 
let the EEOC make such awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson began his VA career in 1988 at hospital in Albuquerque,  
N.M., and transferred to Illinois in 1990. He applied for a 
promotion in 1992 but his two female supervisors instead selected a 
less-experienced woman for the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson filed a sex-discrimination claim but the VA found no  
illegal conduct. He then appealed to the EEOC, which found the VA 
had discriminated against Gibson and ordered the agency to give him 
a promotion and back pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The VA was tardy in complying with the commission's order, and  
Gibson sued in federal court. His lawsuit, invoking an anti-bias 
law known as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sought much 
of the same relief the VA belatedly gave him, and also sought 
compensatory damages for emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge threw out Gibson's lawsuit, ruling that  
part of it had become moot and that his claim for compensatory 
damages should have been raised first in the EEOC proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated  
that part of Gibson's lawsuit, and ordered a trial to determine 
what damages he should be paid. The appeals court ruled that 
Gibson's failure to raise the compensatory-damages issue in the 
EEOC proceedings was irrelevant because the commission is not 
authorized to make such awards. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Clinton administration lawyers  
argued that the 7th Circuit court was wrong. ``Congress has made 
clear that the appropriate remedies for violations ... by the 
federal government include compensatory damages,'' the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	They noted that another federal appeals court -- the New  
Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals -- has ruled that 
the EEOC can order federal agencies to pay compensatory damages for 
employment bias. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conflict is already creating considerable uncertainty for  
the EEOC, as well as other federal agencies, with regard to their 
authority to award compensatory damages in the thousands of 
administrative cases that arise annually under Title VII,'' the 
appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is West vs. Gibson, 98-238.

<HEADLINE> Hyperactivity Drug Researched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medical science now may know how the drugs  
taken daily by millions of American children to calm hyperactivity 
affect the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	New research in mice suggests that drugs such as Ritalin quiet  
hyperactivity by boosting the levels of serotonin, a 
neurotransmitter, in the brain. A study was appearing today in the 
journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 3 percent and 6 percent of American school-age children  
suffer from a condition called attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder, or ADHD. These children are restless and impulsive and 
have difficulty concentrating. Drugs such as Ritalin and Dexedrine 
have a calming effect, but their action has been poorly understood. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers at Duke University  
discovered the serotonin action of Ritalin by eliminating the 
possibility that the drug was acting on other brain chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	They used a laboratory mouse strain that had been genetically  
manipulated to lack a key protein in the processing of dopamine, 
another neurotransmitter. Such mice have symptoms similar to those 
of ADHD. 
</P>
<P>
	When the mice lacking normal dopamine were given Ritalin, they  
were calmed, proving that the drug was not acting on dopamine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers then blocked the effects of norepinephrine,  
another brain chemical, but this had no effect on the ADHD 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the researchers gave the mice Prozac, a drug that  
inhibits the action of serotonin. The ADHD symptoms declined 
dramatically in the mice. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, said the researchers, show that Ritalin acts on the  
serotonin levels in the brain by restoring a proper balance between 
serotonin and other natural brain chemicals.

they will be going out at the same time, too. 
</P>
<P>
	John Elway and Gary Kubiak could both be making farewell  
appearances at Mile High Stadium on Sunday when the Denver Broncos 
entertain the New York Jets in the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who announced last summer that this would be his final  
season but who has recently declined to talk about his future, 
would leave the game as the winningest quarterback in NFL history 
(148 victories). He and Miami's Dan Marino are the only 
quarterbacks to have thrown for 50,000 yards in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak, who served as Elway's understudy for nine seasons and  
who has been the Broncos' offensive coordinator for the past four 
seasons, is reportedly set to become the new head coach at the 
University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing can become official until after Sunday's game, since  
Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan won't give the university 
permission to talk to Kubiak until after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	While neither Elway's retirement nor Kubiak's departure are 100  
percent certainties, their colleagues talk as if both will leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chances are this is John's last game at Mile High Stadium,''  
Shanahan said on Friday. ``I think it would be a surprise if he 
does come back. I'm hoping he does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was reminded on Friday that a year ago he asked his wife  
and four children to cast a vote at the dinner table on whether he 
should play the 1998 season. He said the vote was 5-1 to play, with 
his being the lone dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there has been a vote for 1999, he said, ``No, at least  
not yet. Everybody has been so busy, it's hard to get them all 
together. And I won't allow any absentee ballots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to Kubiak, who has declined comment since his name  
surfaced as Colorado's No. 1 candidate on Thursday, Elway said, 
``Gary Kubiak will be a great head coach no matter where he lands. 
We've talked about this, and he knows he's in a perfect situation. 
He could stay where he is. He can pick and choose. From CU's 
perspective, they couldn't get a better guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak interviewed for the new head coaching vacancy with the  
Cleveland Browns, but that team is believed leaning toward 
Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak would replace Rick Neuheisel, who left Colorado last  
Saturday to accept a lucrative offer from the University of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp promised that officials  
would move ``expeditiously'' to name a successor since national 
letter-of-intent signing day is Feb. 3 and recruiting will suffer 
the longer the Buffaloes go without a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan refused to say whether Kubiak would depart immediately  
if he accepted the Colorado job. If the Broncos beat the Jets and 
Kubiak takes the CU job, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said he expected 
that Kubiak would stay with the team through the Super Bowl.

	In Taiwan, share prices surged more than 3 percent as buying by  
the government's stock stabilization fund helped to trigger a

</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 213.28  
points, or 3.4 percent, to 6,454.60.

<HEADLINE> Marine Pilot Has One Charge Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot whose jet severed an  
Italian gondola cable and killed 20 people could still face more 
than a lifetime in prison even after a judge dismissed negligent 
homicide charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Robert Nunley on Friday granted a request from  
prosecutors to dismiss the negligent homicide charges against Capt. 
Richard Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	The request was viewed as a strategic move -- possibly aimed at  
forcing jurors to convict Ashby of the more serious charges of 
involuntary manslaughter at his court-martial next month. The 20 
charges each carry maximum 10-year sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they wanted to streamline their case against  
Ashby, who piloted the EA-6B Prowler when the radar-jamming jet 
clipped the gondola cable in the Italian Alps while on a training 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues were discussed during the fifth day of a week-long  
hearing on motions that is helping lay the groundwork for next 
month's courts-martial of the two aviators. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., and Capt. Joseph  
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., the navigator, face 
courts-martial proceedings for the tragedy last Feb. 3. Prosecutors 
claim their jet was flying too low and too fast. Jury selection in 
Ashby's case begins Feb. 4, and for Schweitzer, on Feb. 22.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Says It's Business As Usual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil insists it is back to  
business as usual after a currency devaluation sent markets 
plunging, forced another Central Bank official to resign and led 
investors to take more than a billion dollars out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	As if to drive home the point, President Fernando Henrique  
Cardoso resumed his vacation Thursday, flying off to his ranch on 
Brazil's Atlantic coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral said Wednesday's surprise  
devaluation was a necessary adjustment to an otherwise firm economy 
and called the market reaction ``panicked, excessive and 
exaggerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts show that there is no reason for the volatility  
because things are going ahead,'' Amaral said. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Bank President Gustavo Franco resigned Wednesday and his  
successor announced a 7.6 percent currency devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The move raised fears that the financial crisis that has  
battered Asia and more recently Russia has not gone away, and could 
bring down economies in Latin America. Traders also worry that U.S. 
multinational companies operating in Brazil could take a big profit 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sao Paulo's Bovespa index plunged 10 percent, setting off a  
circuit-breaker that automatically halted trading for 30 minutes 
near the end of the day Thursday. The market ended the day down 
9.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders blamed the drop on the resignation of the Central Bank's  
director for banking system supervision, Claudio Mauch, and on 
Standard &AMP; Poor's lowering Brazil's long-term debt rating. Mauch 
said his resignation had been planned for months. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 228.63 points  
to close at 9,120.93, which on top of Wednesday's 125-point loss 
put the index below where it began the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dollars fled Brazil at a rate of more than a billion a day, but  
new Central Bank President Francisco Lopes called the nervous 
market reaction to the new foreign exchange policy ``natural.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since August, investors have pulled more than $40 billion out of  
the country, dropping reserves to around $35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts feel that Brazil took a calculated risk that it could  
pull off a smaller devaluation than many economists thought 
necessary and control it. 
</P>
<P>
	If they succeed they could bring interest rates, currently at  
around 29 percent a month, down to a reasonable level and avoid the 
recession thought likely as a result of Brazil's promise to trim 
$23 billion from its budget in exchange for a $41.5 billion bailout 
package from the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	But many analysts think the devaluation was too little, too late  
and Brazil may now pay for its timidity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that Brazil is going to be forced into a free float  
within weeks, if not days, and that the Brazilian currency is going 
to end up depreciating by at least 30 percent this year,'' said 
Bruce Steinberg, Merrill Lynch's chief economist, speaking in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	His statement echoed loudly in Brazil, where Lopes responded  
with a statement calling the possibility of Brazil adopting a 
floating exchange system ``totally unfounded and untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the Central Bank would intervene ``whenever  
necessary'' to defend the new exchange band, which allowed the real 
to float at a rate of between 1.20 and 1.32 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Court Allows Daytrips for Hinckley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A divided appeals court panel cleared the way  
Friday for John W. Hinckley Jr. to make supervised day trips away 
from the mental hospital where he has been confined since he tried 
to assassinate former President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-1 ruling said the decisions on such trips should not be  
decided by the court, but should be up to the doctors treating 
Hinckley at St. Elizabeths Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling means that Hinckley, accompanied by hospital  
personnel, may leave St. Elizabeths for short visits with his 
family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	His doctors support letting Hinckley make such visits as part of  
a gradual re-entry into society, with the eventual goal of 
releasing him from St. Elizabeths, said his lawyer, Barry W. 
Levine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not a prisoner. He is a patient with a right to  
treatment,'' Levine said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley, 43, has been a patient at the hospital since 1982, a  
year after he shot Reagan outside a Washington hotel in an 
assassination attempt that Hinckley later said was an attempt to 
impress actress Jodie Foster. Reagan's press secretary at the time, 
James Brady, was seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court did not rule directly on the merits of  
Hinckley's request to leave the hospital, but the ruling has the 
effect of allowing such trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what the court is saying is that the decision on  
whether he should get a visit in the community is one that is 
within the purview of the hospital, not the courts,'' Levine said. 
``And the hospital has already made the decision that he should get 
this community visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A third judge on the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of  
Appeals for the District of Columbia had disagreed with the 
majority, saying court approval should be required for trips by 
Hinckley. 
</P>
<P>
	Levine predicted Hinckley's doctors will recommend an off-campus  
visit soon. The visit would be arranged by hospital staff and 
approved by a hospital review board, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors opposed letting Hinckley out, even for a  
short trip, and said he may still be dangerous. They had intervened 
to prevent a 1997 Christmastime visit between Hinckley, his parents 
and his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public should understand that today's court decision does  
not allow Mr. Hinckley to come and go when he pleases,'' U.S. 
Attorney Wilma Lewis said in a statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said she is disappointed but has not yet decided whether  
to ask for a rehearing of the case by the full appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Lewis said the three-judge panel's ruling is  
automatically on hold for 52 days to give prosecutors time to 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
	A district court judge sided with the prosecutors in 1997, but  
that decision was overturned by the two appeals court judges -- 
Patricia Wald and Stephen Williams. Opposing their decision was 
Judge Karen L. Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley's lawyers argued in December that the District Court  
judge did not have the legal right to rule on visits by Hinckley. 
The proposed trip is not a ``conditional release'' and thus did not 
fall under court supervision, Levine said then. 
</P>
<P>
	The two judges noted that prosecutors have not opposed similar  
visits for other patients who, like Hinckley, are not considered 
criminal prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time, in a case involving perhaps the most  
notorious patient at the hospital, the government now argues ... 
that (such a visit) requires court approval. We do not believe it 
has made its case,'' the judges wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In her dissenting opinion, Henderson said the proposed visit is  
a conditional release. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proposed visit with Hinckley's parents is plainly a  
`release from the hospital,''' she wrote.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Said No to Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- This was the town that told the Olympics: ``No!''  
</P>
<P>
	Badgered by officials seeking swanky hotel rooms and spiffier  
sports facilities, troubled by a possible drain on taxpayers' 
wallets and worried about what the whole thing might do to the 
environment, Denver did something unique. 
</P>
<P>
	It gave the 1976 Winter Olympics back to the IOC.  
</P>
<P>
	``The games started out as a place where great amateur athletes  
could come to compete, but it became an international social event 
for members of the jetset who expected to be wined and dined. By 
the time they got done demanding things, it just got too 
expensive,'' former Gov. Dick Lamm said. ``They were poor trustees 
of the Olympic spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamm, who was a legislator on the state audit committee at the  
time and led a push to reject the Olympics, said other factors also 
drove voters in 1972 to turn down the Winter Games, including 
concerns over the environment and the growth it would bring to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gov. John Love, however, said it wasn't the International  
Olympic Committee -- at the center of a bribery scandal involving 
the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City -- but problems with 
Colorado's own organizing committee that forced changes, driving up 
the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Love said he feels sorry for Salt Lake, now embroiled in the  
worst scandal in Olympic history after finally getting the games on 
the fifth try. 
</P>
<P>
	``They worked so hard and so long to get it. It just got out of  
hand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Love went to Amsterdam for the IOC vote that gave Denver the  
1976 Winter Games over three other cities -- Sion, Switzerland; 
Vancouver, British Columbia; and Tampere, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there were no demands from IOC members, and no bribes  
were offered by Colorado organizers to get the games. The only 
gifts to IOC members were a few paperweights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the award was made, demands came to improve the sports  
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our main problem was the fact that the venues were so  
spread out across the state,'' Love said. ``When the IOC and 
various sports federations found the bid proposals were 
unacceptable, they asked for changes, which voters feared would 
drive up the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hoped to use a ski jump at Steamboat Springs, for  
instance, but the federation said it would need a new one. Plans to 
build a ski venue above Loveland basin also had to be scrapped 
because federation members didn't like the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Moran, spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee, said  
problems with the bid were the fault of local organizers, not the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how the IOC could drive the cost of the games  
up,'' he said. ``The IOC didn't determine the venues. The ski areas 
would have to be approved by the federations and the IOC, but I 
don't think he can legitimately say they drove up the cost of the 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love said organizers could have come up with some imaginative  
solutions, and still pulled it off without running deep in the red. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lamm said previous Olympics had lost millions of dollars,  
``and the state of Colorado would have been held responsible as the 
insurer of last resort.'' For instance, Innsbruck, Austria, which 
stepped in and hosted the Olympics after Colorado bowed out, lost 
millions of dollars. Montreal still is paying off a billion-dollar 
debt from the '76 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The keynote address in Amsterdam was given by a Netherlands  
cultural affairs minister who ``struck a responsive chord with 
members of the IOC by voicing deep concern that unless the 
philosophy of a `Grand Olympics' was changed, it would no longer be 
possible for smaller nations to stage the games,'' according to a 
USOC newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamm said voters won the battle, but lost the war to prevent  
growth. Beaver Creek, one of the host sites, expanded rapidly 
despite the vote, and Colorado is now home to some of the fastest 
growing cities in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Coloradans also apparently had some second thoughts after  
rejecting the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, when Lake Placid had trouble with too little snow,  
Colorado offered to take over the Winter Games. The state also put 
in a bid for the 2002 Olympics that eventually went to Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran said the IOC won't hold Colorado's rejection against it,  
but he said it might be a long time before the state gets another 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next time they could look at the Winter Games will be  
2022. That's the first time the United States has a chance to host 
the games again,'' Moran said. ``By that time, John Elway will have 
great-grandchildren.''

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Vets Face More Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Persian Gulf War veterans have a rate of general  
ill health at least twice as high as forces who stayed home or were 
sent to Bosnia, according to a new study of British troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lancet, a British medical journal, published a study this  
week that confirms what previously has been reported in studies of 
U.S. and Canadian veterans -- that while no definable disease could 
be found, going to the Persian Gulf in 1991 affected troops' 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of 8,195 soldiers, sailors and pilots -- the first to  
compare Gulf War veterans with troops who served in another 
hazardous conflict around the same time -- is the largest of 
symptoms to date. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, half of whom had retired from the military, filled out  
questionnaires about their current health. 
</P>
<P>
	They all reported a variety of 59 ailments, including chronic  
fatigue, hair loss, rashes, headaches, joint pain, memory loss, 
heart problems and nervous system disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	There was hardly any difference between the Bosnia troops and  
men who served at the time of the Gulf War but were not deployed. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the ailment, however, vets who served in the  
Persian Gulf were about twice as likely to complain of it than the 
other two groups studied, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence is unequivocal that going to the Gulf affects  
your health,'' said Dr. Simon Wessely, one of the researchers from 
King's College at the University of London. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers don't know why ailments were more common in Gulf  
War vets, but said the study shows there is no single cause, either 
physical or psychological, and that attempts to look for a 
``smoking gun'' will not succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to look at a multitude of causes and their  
interactions,'' Wessely said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found that hazards of war -- ranging from  
using pesticides and seeing dead bodies to getting diesel fuel on 
your skin -- were linked to more symptoms, regardless of whether the 
men had served in the Gulf or somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did find a slight increase in ill health in those who  
had vaccines against biological threats such as anthrax or plague. 
Receiving multiple vaccinations against routine infections also was 
linked to a modest increase in illness, but only in the Persian 
Gulf group and not in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial in the Lancet, a scientist with the National  
Institutes of Health called the study one of the most definitive 
conducted to date and said it added weight to the argument that no 
unique ``Gulf War Syndrome'' exists. 
</P>
<P>
	In his editorial, Stephen E. Straus, chief of the laboratory of  
clinical investigation at the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases, drew parallels between the ailments cited by 
Gulf War vets and soldiers who fought in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the possibility of some still unappreciated  
environmental factor cannot be dismissed entirely,'' he wrote, 
``the Gulf War seems to differ from others only in a quantitative 
sense and in the intensity of public discourse about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Robert Haley, an epidemiologist at University of Texas  
Medical Center who believes a particular ``Gulf War syndrome'' 
exists, criticized the research. He said the scientists' questions 
were too vague, so it was not surprising they found the same 
symptoms in all of the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found questions that by their nature are not unique. They  
didn't ask the right questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley's research on a small number of patients has previously  
concluded that some Gulf War veterans suffer from distinct symptom 
clusters caused by chemical poisoning and that some may suffer 
neurological damage from nerve gas or pesticides.

<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- With Brazil's financial crisis looming  
over world markets, German and Japanese finance ministers renewed 
their controversial call today for an international system to limit 
wild exchange rate swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting at a summit of European and Asian finance ministers,  
Germany's Oskar Lafontaine and Japan's Kiichi Miyazawa said ``an 
adequate exchange rate regime with emerging countries'' was crucial 
for avoiding further turbulence in the world financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, they also reinforced their support for  
setting target ranges among major currencies -- the dollar, the yen 
and the brand-new euro -- to promote stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't for fixed foreign exchange rates, but for stable  
currency rates,'' Lafontaine told reporters outside the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	His deputy, Heiner Flassbeck, said the Brazil crisis can be seen  
as an example of the need to stabilize the foreign-exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil will be a topic at a meeting of deputy finance ministers  
from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in Frankfurt 
on Saturday, and Flassbeck said the G-7 has a ``unified position'' 
on Brazil, but he declined to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is less unanimity -- especially with Washington -- over  
the idea of so-called exchange-rate bands, or corridors limiting 
how far a currency could rise or fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan under which central banks would intervene to keep  
currencies within the exchange-rate bands has gained political 
momentum in Europe since the launch of the single currency Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Europeans worry their new euro currency could also become  
too strong, hurting European exports and slowing growth. And Japan 
is concerned by the yen's recent appreciation against the dollar, 
which sparked intervention by the Bank of Japan this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United States and the Frankfurt-based European Central  
Bank, which sets monetary policy for the 11 euro nations, have 
voiced opposition to such a plan. They worry about the cost should 
they be forced to intervene in currency markets, and note similar 
schemes have failed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union's finance commissioner, Yves-Thibault de  
Silguy, called the idea ``premature'' today, noting ``exchange 
rates cannot be set by decree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lafontaine, who often promotes a more activist state role in  
the economy than the chancellor, insisted the idea at least 
deserved consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Flassbeck, his deputy, said in a radio interview today that it  
was more important to ``talk concretely about exchange rate systems 
rather than abstractly about world financial architecture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turbulence triggered by Brazil's devaluation of its  
currency, the real, has added urgency to the talks between finance 
ministers from the 15 EU nations and 10 Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto said ministers at the  
two-day meeting hoped to develop a ``early warning system for 
global crises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was unclear if any concrete proposals would emerge from  
the Frankfurt talks. Schroeder said he expected Group of Seven 
finance ministers to develop a ``coherent concept'' for financial 
reform at their Feb. 20 meeting in Bonn, setting the stage for an 
agreement at the G-7 summit in June in Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the ministers were to look at the tricky question  
of how to improve surveillance of financial institutions, in 
particular the secretive investment companies known as hedge funds 
that have been accused of provoking financial upheaval.

<HEADLINE> Navy Recruiting More Non-Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy said Friday it has begun accepting  
more recruits who have not finished high school, part of a series 
of initiatives meant to fill a shortfall of 22,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Secretary Richard Danzig announced the moves, which he said  
are intended to improve the Navy's readiness for war and raise 
morale among sailors who, because of the job gap, sometimes are 
forced to fill positions outside their own specialty or do double 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 22,000 unfilled jobs, 18,000 are positions aboard ships  
at sea, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Undermanning the Navy is simply not acceptable to me,  
especially when more quality personnel can be recruited or 
high-quality sailors can be retained,'' Danzig said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Danzig said the Navy would increase the proportion of recruits  
who have not graduated from high school to 10 percent from 5 
percent. Ten percent is the maximum allowed under Defense 
Department rules, but the individual services are allowed to set 
stricter limits of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997 the Army loosened its limit of non-high school  
graduates from 5 percent to 10 percent. The Marine Corps takes no 
more than 5 percent. The Air Force's maximum is 10 percent, 
although it has not had more than 1 percent in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other changes announced by Danzig: a planned revision of  
the Navy's physical fitness and health standards. He said new 
standards would be set within a year, and in the meantime sailors 
will not be discharged solely on the basis of failing to meet the 
current standard. Danzig said this could mean keeping 2,000 sailors 
who otherwise would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year 95 percent of Navy recruits were high school  
graduates, but the Navy fell nearly 7,000 short of its recruiting 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Danzig said the Navy figures that by taking more non-high school  
graduates it will get an extra 2,600 boot camp entrants this year. 
It expects to get an additional 4,500 through other new measures, 
including increasing advertising and offering more enlistment 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy secretary said he believes that having a smaller  
proportion of high school graduates in boot camp will not dilute 
the talent pool. He said those who sign up who are not high school 
graduates will have to score above average on Navy entrance exams 
and have good references. 
</P>
<P>
	``A high school diploma is an important validation of ability to  
succeed,'' Danzig said. ``It is not, however, the 'be-all' or 
'end-all' of a potential recruit's measure of worth.'' He said the 
Navy wants ``proven performers,'' even if they have left school 
because of financial need, personal circumstances, home schooling 
or because it was ``not the right place for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience shows these 'proven performers' make good -- indeed,  
sometimes exceptional -- sailors,'' Danzig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recruits without high school diplomas have historically failed  
to complete recruit training at a rate about 10 percent greater 
than those who did finish school, the Navy secretary said. But he 
said the recruits without diplomas who do succeed in boot camp 
usually stay in the Navy longer.

<HEADLINE>  White House Concedes More to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration on Friday relaxed  
its curbs on sales of spare parts to Iraq for its petroleum 
industry. The conciliatory move was designed to provide more food 
and medicine to the Iraqi people. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the United States  
was ``going to go the extra mile'' for the hungry and sick in Iraq 
``while ensuring the money generated does not go to assist the 
Iraqi regime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed the action applied only to spare parts that would  
help Iraq extract and export oil under the U.N. oil-for-food 
program. On Thursday, the administration proposed removing a U.N. 
ceiling on Iraqi oil sales, provided that the proceeds were used to 
buy food and other humanitarian supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Baghdad, Trade Minister Mehdi Saleh demanded an end to  
all U.N. trade sanctions and said Iraq would not accept anything 
short of that. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin responded saying, ``We, for many years, have tried to  
improve the plight of their people and Iraq's response is usually 
'no.' They don't want to improve the plight of their people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calling on Iraq to take advantage of the oil-sales exemption to  
a 9-year-old Security Council trade embargo, Rubin said Thursday 
that the process for approving contracts for food and medicine 
would be virtually automatic. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, spare parts for the industry were added to that  
green-light category. About half the ``holds'' the United States 
has placed on parts destined for Iraq will be removed, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. moves are designed partly to counter a campaign by  
Baghdad of accusing the United States of starving the Iraqi people 
through its support of economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq is permitted to sell $5.2 billion worth of oil every six  
months provided the proceeds are used to purchase food, medications 
and other humanitarian supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	That ceiling would be lifted if the U.S. proposal were accepted  
by the Council. But it wouldn't necessarily ensure a better life 
for Iraqi children, pregnant women, nursing mothers and the 
elderly. U.S. officials contend Iraq has kept large supplies of 
food and medicine in storehouses, refusing to distribute them to 
the needy. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to allegations the U.S.-backed embargo effectively  
starves Iraqi children and elderly people, senior American 
officials say Iraq intentionally withholds oil it is permitted to 
sell on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's defenders, in turn, say a shortage of spare parts limits  
production. 
</P>
<P>
	On the diplomatic front, Russia offered its own proposal at the  
United Nations to solve an impase with Iraq over weapons 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Russian plan, the trade embargo could be lifted once  
the Security Council received a report from an assessment team on 
the status of Iraqi cooperation on disarmament and once Iraq 
permits a new monitoring system. 
</P>
<P>
	The approach pursued at U.S. behest by a U.N. commission headed  
by Australian diplomat Richard Butler is all but dead. President 
Saddam Hussein last month reversed a promise to permit unfettered 
inspections. The United States and Britain retaliated with a 
missile attack, but other American allies opposed the use of force 
and have effectively gutted the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin insisted Friday that ``we must have a disarmament and  
inspection system, and the Russian proposal appear to have none of 
the positive elements we found in a French plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The French approach, Rubin said, raised ``serious questions and  
concerns.''

<HEADLINE> Life Seeks 100th Straight Home Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Ninety-nine and counting.  
</P>
<P>
	Life University, an NAIA powerhouse in suburban Atlanta, can  
become only the third men's college basketball team to win 100 
straight home games when it meets Talladega (Ala.) tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Running Eagles haven't lost at the Life Sports Center since  
Nov. 13, 1993, when Georgetown (Ky.) posted a 77-70 victory. Since 
then, they have reeled off 99 straight victories at home, the 
third-longest streak in college basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky had a 129-game home winning streak from 1943-55, while  
Marymount (Kan.), another NAIA school, went 106 games without a 
home loss from 1971-78. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some clutch shots to keep it going by players on  
every team,'' Life coach Roger Kaiser said. ``This is part of our 
tradition and everyone steps up and plays their best games at 
home.''

<P>
	He said the home winning streak has become ``a rallying point  
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's mentioned before the game, during the game and  
afterwards,'' the coach said. ``There is a great amount of pride, 
handed down from one team to the next. It's a motivating factor 
now, more than anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles (15-5), ranked 15th in NAIA this season, have been  
one of the nation's most successful small-college teams since the 
program started in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Life finished 29-6 its first season and made the NAIA tournament  
the following year, beginning a streak of six straight postseason 
appearances. The Eagles were national runner-up in 1994 and won the 
championship two seasons ago. Overall, the team has a record of 
234-40, including 126-6 at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The last of those six home losses came more than five years ago,  
though several teams have come close to breaking the streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn-Montgomery (Ala.) took Life to double-overtime in 1994-95  
before losing 104-96, and the streak was in serious jeopardy three 
times during the 1997-98 season: Life defeated Azusa Pacific 
116-110 in overtime, slipped by North Georgia 83-80 and edged 
Auburn-Montgomery 73-71 when Antwon Hall connected on a 3-pointer 
as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the Running Eagles have won their 12 home games by  
an average margin of 30 points, though they struggled to an 83-79 
victory over Augusta State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every team wants to be the team to break the streak,'' Kaiser  
said.

<HEADLINE> Ice, Rain Glaze the East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Snow and freezing rain put a hard-shell finish on the East on  
Friday, causing deadly highway accidents, backing up airline 
flights and knocking out power to nearly half a million people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Snow, sleet, hail, ice, rain, floods,'' James Ellis of New  
Rochelle, N.Y., said, trying to remember all the weather he had 
seen in 48 hours. ``Slush, frozen slush, snowmelt. Lots of branches 
down. Ice, did I say ice?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The snow that blanketed the Northeast on Thursday was topped by  
freezing rain Friday, creating a slick coating over much of the 
region during the morning rush hour. As the day wore on and the 
temperature climbed, people found themselves slogging through slush 
and high water. 
</P>
<P>
	At least six people died Thursday and Friday in traffic  
accidents in West Virginia and Maryland that were blamed on ice. 
Earlier this month, at least 89 deaths were blamed on a major storm 
that hammered the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice forced the closing of a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 87  
north of Albany, N.Y. Slick roads also caused two pileups on 
interstate ramps near Parsippany, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, commuter trains were delayed and traffic was slowed  
to a crawl. Streets that were coated and slippery before dawn 
turned to streams of slush as rain fell and the temperature rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weather is for the birds -- ducks,'' said Efrain Burgos, a  
doorman in New York City. ``But if it wouldn't have rained, we'd 
have 2 feet of snow by now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three major airports serving the city canceled many early  
flights and worked to resume normal operation as the temperature 
rose. Boston's airport had to close temporarily to de-ice runways 
after snow changed to freezing rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airlines all woke up with lot of ice on their airplanes,''  
New York Port Authority spokesman Bill Cahill said. ``They spent 
the morning deicing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm glazed trees with ice, breaking off limbs and knocking  
out power from New York to as far south as Virginia. About 330,000 
customers lost power in the Washington, D.C., area. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 customers also lost service in Baltimore, and  
there were smaller outages in New Jersey, New York and around 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to get even warmer through the weekend, with  
temperatures headed toward the 50s as far north as Boston on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, National Park Ranger David Wahlgren chopped  
away with a garden spade at patches of ice on the walk outside 
Independence Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even at Yellowstone and Yosemite, where I have worked before,  
you end up shoveling a lot of snow, said Wahlgren, a 26-year-old 
Oregon native. ``It's just part of the job.''

<HEADLINE> Few Attend Calif. Teach-In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Eleventh-grader Andre Washington is aware  
of the debate that has raged outside schools this week over whether 
a death penalty teach-in is a good idea or bad example. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's more concerned with what's being said inside the  
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting for us to talk about because it gets the  
whole class involved,'' said Washington, who dutifully took notes 
Thursday as he and fellow juniors at Fremont High School debated 
the pros and cons of capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	His instructor, Craig Gordon, was one of a fewer than a  
half-dozen Oakland teachers who went ahead with the event, district 
spokesman Ken Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teach-in, which focused on the controversial case of  
Pennsylvania death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal, had been criticized 
as too political and the wrong focus for a district where many 
can't read at grade level. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition solidified after an Oakland policeman was killed by a  
sniper last weekend; his funeral was held Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal is a black radio journalist who was convicted of  
killing a Philadelphia policeman in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the representative council of the teachers' union  
voted 48-42 to go ahead with the event. But Superintendent Carole 
Quan canceled any formal attempts at a teach-in, and union 
president Sheila Quintana asked colleagues to hold off for at least 
a day out of respect for the dead officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said it's unfortunate some are drawing a link between the  
two cases, but he doesn't believe a connection exists and ``for me 
to change what we're doing today would be sort of warping the 
curriculum according to an external political agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He began the day with a media class in which students played the  
roles of key players in the Abu-Jamal case. Students were told to 
``cover'' the trial from different points of view -- guilty, 
innocent or neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	For the U.S. history class, he did not bring up Abu-Jamal's  
case, concentrating instead on the death penalty. Students looked 
at pro and con fact sheets pulled from the Internet and then split 
into two factions to argue their cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Navarro cited a statistic that a maximum security cell  
costs about $75,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we would have the death penalty, it would save millions in  
taxpayer dollars,'' she said. ``Let's say they're 20 years old. By 
the time they're 60 -- it's going to cost a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the room, students waved newspaper  
clippings about people who were wrongly convicted and sent to death 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about the innocent people they killed with the death  
penalty?'' demanded a member of the anti-death penalty group. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the class came the homework -- a five-paragraph  
essay arguing for or against capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon raised his voice to be heard above the hubbub of students  
scraping back their chairs as they prepared to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you write for both sides, that'll be extra credit,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lag in Computer Climate Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Foreign researchers have pulled ahead of the  
United States in developing complex computer models of the weather 
that are crucial to predicting the effects of climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States pioneered much climate change research,  
it has fallen behind in computer power needed for massive climate 
simulations and fails to coordinate research efforts, the National 
Research Council warned in a new report. 
</P>
<P>
	``To understand how climate change might affect people ... we  
want to understand it at the level of counties, how it's going to 
affect my city, and the U.S. hasn't leveraged the resources 
together to achieve this as effectively as the Europeans have,'' 
study director Peter Schultz said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a leader in understanding the dynamics of climate and  
understanding the processes that make up these climate models, but 
we lack the computation'' power, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The report indicated that the leader now in computer power to  
generate these models is the European Center for Medium-Range 
Weather Forecasts in Reading, England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another is the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and  
Analysis. The Germans are doing some leading work, the Australians 
too,'' Schultz said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Climate models are complex computer programs that use  
mathematical formulas to explain how the weather works. Scientists 
can make changes in the initial weather conditions in the model, 
run through the formulas, and see what happens to the climate 
hours, days or years later. 
</P>
<P>
	The models divide the world into grids. The smaller the grids,  
the more accurate they are in simulating the actual weather. But 
smaller grids mean millions more calculations per second for each 
little change, requiring more and more computer power. 
</P>
<P>
	The models in use in the United States are among the best in  
forecasting conditions in grids larger than 2.8 degrees of latitude 
by 2.8 degrees of longitude, while the finer models get down to 
about 2 degrees each way. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States ``there is no integrated national  
strategy'' coordinating the climate modeling efforts, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have in the U.S. are several different modeling  
centers'' including the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 
Boulder, Colo.; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton 
University and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	While the three labs make an effort to cooperate, Schultz said  
better coordination would be valuable ``in terms of producing the 
simulations that are of value to policy makers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of climate change has been debated widely in  
recent years, with many scientists concerned that the so-called 
greenhouse warming, caused by industrial gases released into the 
atmosphere, could lead the earth to overheat. Other scientists, 
however, say the threat remains unproved. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides duel over the results produced by various computer  
models in forecasting how climate might change in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, ``Capacity of U.S. Climate Modeling to Support  
Climate Change Assessment Activities,'' was produced by the climate 
research committee of the Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate 
at the National Research Council, an affiliate of the National 
Academy of Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Rehnquist Upholds Harkin Objection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Providing a rare jolt to the Senate  
impeachment trial, Chief Justice William Rehnquist issued his first 
substantive ruling Friday on an objection raised about House use of 
the word ``juror'' to describe senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, became the first senator to raise a  
vocal objection in President Clinton's impeachment trial when he 
interrupted Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., towards the end of the 
afternoon-long proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I object to the use and the continued use of the word  
jurors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist sustained Harkin's objection.  
</P>
<P>
	Outside the chamber a few minutes later, Harkin explained that  
he believed House members were attempting to ``put us in a box'' 
that would limit what factors they consider in determining 
Clinton's guilt or evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Founding Fathers, Harkin said, meant for the Senate to be  
``expansive'' in considering impeachment of a president and that 
the Constitution blends the role of jury and judge in the Senate. 
For example, the Senate can overrule Rehnquist by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are charged not just with facts and law but also what's in  
the public good, and what's the general welfare of the people of 
this country in deciding on impeachment cases,'' Harkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	After listening to Harkin -- and hearing Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H.,  
urge Harkin to wrap up his explanation -- Rehnquist sustained the 
Iowa senator's objection. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senator from Iowa's objection is well taken,'' the chief  
justice said. ``The Senate is not simply a jury, it is a court in 
this case. Therefore counsel should refrain from referring to 
senators as jurors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barr assented, and afterwards said he didn't see a big problem  
with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly correct. There are differences between the  
Senate sitting as jurors, and normal jurors,'' Barr said. ``I'm 
perfectly happy with his ruling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Olympia, called it ``a distinction without  
a difference,'' and Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he didn't 
think the wording was ``material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ira Reiner, a Los Angeles defense lawyer and former  
prosecutor, said there is meaning in the ruling, in that normal 
court jurors are obligated to convict a defendant if they are 
persuaded by the law and the facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, there is no duty to convict,'' Reiner said.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Convicted of Valentine Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Md. (AP) -- A nurse was convicted Friday of killing her  
husband after prosecutors told jurors she poisoned him during a 
Valentine's weekend murder-mystery retreat then set their hotel 
room on fire to cover up the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated only a few hours before finding Kimberly  
Hricko guilty of first-degree murder and first-degree arson. She 
faces life in prison for the death of Stephen Hricko. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged that Mrs. Hricko, a 33-year-old surgical  
technician, confided in friends and co-workers before the death 
that she was bitterly unhappy in her nine-year marriage and longed 
to get rid of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Mrs. Hricko stood to collect $400,000 from life  
insurance policies taken out on her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	During closing arguments Friday, prosecutor Robert Dean detailed  
Mrs. Hricko's ``coldblooded and sinister'' plot to kill her husband 
by injecting him with the powerful drug succinylcholine chloride to 
stop his breathing. Then, he said, she set fire to the hotel suite 
they shared at an Eastern Shore resort hours after the couple 
watched a Valentine's Day murder-mystery play on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The whodunit onstage portrayed a groom sipping poisoned  
champagne who drops dead during a toast and the audience tries to 
solve the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	A state medical examiner concluded Hricko was probably poisoned  
with succinylcholine chloride, commonly used in surgery to help 
doctors administer breathing tubes and relax patients' muscles. It 
paralyzes the diaphragm and stops the subject's breathing, 
producing fatal brain damage within four minutes if the subject 
doesn't receive help to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Dr. David Fowler told the jury  
that Hricko, a 35-year-old golf course superintendent, was probably 
injected with a fatal dose of the drug, but acknowledged that it 
wasn't found in his system. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler said the drug is processed rapidly by the body and can be  
undetectable in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler said his autopsy ruled out every other cause of death,  
including heart attack, drug or alcohol overdose, a lethal buildup 
of pesticides or carbon monoxide that he might have inhaled from 
the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys, who said they would appeal the verdict,  
argued that Hricko drank heavily the night he died and may have 
accidentally set his bedspread on fire. They also theorized that 
Hricko committed suicide, though they never said how he might have 
killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	During three days of prosecution testimony, several friends and  
former co-workers of Mrs. Hricko said she complained in late 1997 
and early 1998 that she was unhappy in her marriage, had begun an 
affair with a younger man and wanted her husband killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Hricko, 42, the victim's sister, said the verdict won't  
do much to assuage the family's pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will help a little bit, but ... Steve's not back,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows To Be Proud of Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked Democrats at a  
$25,000-a-couple fund-raiser Friday night ``to be proud of what has 
happened in the last six years'' and said he was determined to 
``make the most of'' of two more years in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day has been a joy and even the bad days have been an  
honor,'' Clinton told about 130 major Democratic Party contributors 
who had gathered at an art gallery near the White House. Hours 
earlier, the Senate finished a second day of hearing the House of 
Representatives' impeachment case for removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund-raiser, which brought an estimated $1.3 million to the  
Democratic National Committee, was organized by Washington lawyer 
Robert Altman and his wife, actress Lynda Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	It was dubbed a dinner and concert to honor the president and  
Vice President Al Gore, but it also was the first major fund-raiser 
for the party since the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer Sheryl Crow provided the entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
	No mention was made of the Senate impeachment trial, but Altman,  
in introducing Clinton, said he had never before seen a political 
climate ``as partisan, as extremist ... as mean spirited as it is 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, Altman said, has responded to his critics with ``quiet  
dignity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people ... are rock solid in support of this  
president,'' declared Altman. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton defended his policies and said that he planned in the  
State of the Union address next Tuesday to outline his objectives 
for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans had suggested the president postpone his State  
of the Union address because of the ongoing impeachment trial in 
the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Security Tight After Horse Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Sheriff's deputies roped off a block  
around the 19th century courthouse to help protect the first of 
three suspects appearing for arraignment in the slaughter of 34 
wild horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obvious concern for the safety of the defendant,''  
Sheriff Pat Whitten said Friday. ``It is an emotional trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Merlino, 20, of Reno, didn't enter a plea, but his  
lawyer said the young construction worker maintains he is innocent. 
Merlino and two U.S. Marines are accused of shooting the horses 
with high-powered rifles. The three attended high school together 
in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Marines, Lance Cpl. Darien Brock, 20, said he saw his  
two friends shoot one horse but doesn't know anything about the 
other animals killed in a canyon just east of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched my two friends kill this horse without doing  
anything about it. Yes, that is wrong. That is what I'm going to 
court for. But we did not kill 34 horses that night,'' Brock said 
in a jailhouse interview Thursday with KGTV in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they did go back, maybe they didn't. Maybe there was  
somebody else out there, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merlino, Brock and Lance Cpl. Scott Brendle face the same  
charges -- grand theft, grand larceny and poisoning, maiming or 
killing another person's animal -- punishable by up to 15 years in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice of the Peace Annette Daniels granted a request by  
Merlino's lawyer to postpone setting a preliminary hearing until 
the other two suspects are returned to Nevada from California, 
where they are stationed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendle, 21, was expected to waive extradition and return to  
Nevada to face charges, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock has indicated he'll fight extradition. Dressed in a Navy  
jail jumpsuit, he did not speak during his arraignment Friday in 
San Diego Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock was ordered held on $65,000 bond and his extradition  
hearing was postponed until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Marines were home on leave when the horses were shot  
Dec. 27, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Merlino refused comment Friday but smiled at reporters outside  
the Storey County courthouse, which was built in the old mining 
town of Virginia City in 1876 on a hillside above the Bucket of 
Blood Saloon.

<HEADLINE> Jayson Williams Stays With Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The Nets didn't come up with almost  
$100 million to keep Jayson Williams until another NBA team made an 
offer to lure the All-Star center away from New Jersey, his agent 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and the Nets reached a tentative agreement on Thursday  
on a seven-year deal for the player many consider the best 
offensive rebounder in basketball, Sal DiFazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	While he would not disclose terms of the deal, DiFazio said it  
is guaranteed on three levels, with the first five years reportedly 
worth $82.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not an open and shut deal by any means,'' DiFazio  
said in a telephone interview. ``In fact we brought a firm offer 
from another team to the table (on Thursday). The day before we 
were very disappointed with the (Nets) initial offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the leverage was there, the other offer was there, things  
took a dramatic turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiFazio refused to identify the team that offered to sign  
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit, Charlotte and Seattle reportedly were interested in  
signing the 30-year-old veteran of nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leverage of another pending opportunity has always been  
what moved teams to get deals done,'' DiFazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the NBA lockout has not officially ended, the Nets  
cannot comment on either the contract or the negotiations until the 
new collective bargaining agreement is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had said on Monday that he wanted to finish his career  
with the Nets, but even he was annoyed after the sides held initial 
talks on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was extremely happy on Friday night, though, and was cheered  
when his picture was shown on the overhead scoreboard during the 
Devils' hockey game against Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad it got done,'' he said of the contract talks.  
``The first day (of negotiations) was pretty ridiculous, but they 
came around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said there were actually seven teams that made offers  
to him, including two which were very attractive. He would not name 
any of the teams involved. 
</P>
<P>
	DiFazio said that he and Nets general manager John Nash will  
meet over the weekend to put the final touches on the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement in principal has been accepted by both  
parties,'' DiFazio said. ``We just haven't settled on certain 
issues, but there will be some give and take and the deal will be 
finalized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams finished second in the NBA rebounding race last season  
with a 13.6 average, and added 12.9 points a game. The former St. 
John's star also was selected to the All-Star game for the first 
time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round draft pick of Phoenix in 1990, Williams was traded  
to Philadelphia before ever playing a game for the Suns. After two 
seasons with the 76ers, he was dealt to the Nets for a pair of 
draft choices.

<HEADLINE> Parcells, Shanahan Have Pasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The challenge for the New York Jets is to dethrone  
the Super Bowl champions. In their home, where they almost never 
lose. And, perhaps, in John Elway's last game before the adoring 
Denver fans. 
</P>
<P>
	One weapon nearly everyone concedes could be a difference-maker  
for the Jets is coach Bill Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
	Even his counterpart, Mike Shanahan, mentioned the value of  
Parcells during Friday's news conferences. He noted how Parcells 
rebuilt the Jets from a 1-15 laughingstock to AFC East winners and 
the visiting team in Sunday's AFC Championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has proven over time that he is the best in the business,''  
Shanahan said. ``He's done a great job there and done it 
consistently wherever he's been. What he's done with the Jets over 
the last two years, I take my hat off to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does Elway, who, surprisingly, said he has never met  
Parcells, but admired his work from afar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at this track record,'' Elway said of the man who has won  
two Super Bowls with the Giants, went to one with the Patriots and 
never has lost a conference title game. ``There's no question he's 
got to be one of the top coaches in the league. He's done it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Elway, who came back to the Broncos this season to be just  
where he is -- playing for a spot in his fifth Super Bowl -- has his 
own candidate for best coach around. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the last three years, what Mike did in turning us around  
after some mediocre years in the early '90s, going 13-3, then 12-4 
and winning the Super Bowl and 14-2 this year,'' Elway presented as 
evidence. ``People say the toughest thing is to repeat, and we're 
back to where we can get back to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has only been here for four years and I feel he already is  
taken for granted. It's not easy what he has done. I don't think 
anyone compares to Mike Shanahan. When the time comes, he'll get 
his due.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could be Sunday, if his team subdues the Jets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think you always get a little juiced up when you're going  
against a coach who has had a lot of success, and obviously a coach 
who has a couple of Super Bowl rings,'' Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells, who says he barely knows Shanahan, but admires his  
work, sees that work in how the Broncos conduct themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Broncos have won so many games in the last few years, I  
don't think anything that happens on the field is going to damage 
their mentality,'' said Parcells, who with a fourth straight 
victory in a conference championship game -- two came with the 
Giants and one with the Patriots -- would be the first man to coach 
three franchises to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get behind, they think they are going to come back ... I  
don't think we're speaking about fragile mentalities at this time 
of the season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While, as Shanahan readily notes, the players will decide the  
game, those players often cite how the coaches put them in position 
to succeed. Jets running back Curtis Martin, who played two seasons 
with the Patriots for Parcells and was signed as a free agent 
before the '98 campaign, believes fans are seeing the coach at his 
pinnacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best I've ever seen him coach in the two or three  
years I've been with him,'' Martin said. ``He has such a great 
balance. It's like he's the tough, tough coach, but at the same 
time he's taking care of the players. We're not all tired and beat 
up going into the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And they believe they will win, thanks greatly to Parcells. Just  
as the Broncos believe they will win, thanks greatly to Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question,'' kick returner Vaughn Hebron said,  
``that you generate loyalty -- any coach on any level -- if you treat 
your players right. That's what Mike does.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Finish Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices were mixed and soybean  
futures prices fell Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices fell on Brazil's decision to float its  
currency, the real. The reduced value of Brazil's currency is 
expected to spur farmer selling of soybeans, which will force 
prices lower. Forecasts of rain in soybean crop areas of southern 
Brazil and Argentina also forced futures lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain in South America is also expected to help Argentina's  
corn crop, which sent corn futures prices fractionally lower. News 
that Taiwan bought U.S. corn also gave some support to the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were higher on indications Egypt will make  
a weekend bid for U.S. wheat. The market also received support from 
the National Weather Service's 90-day forecast, which calls for 
drier than normal conditions in the southern Plains states. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery settled 1/2 cent higher at $2.77 a  
bushel; March corn was unchanged at $2.15 1/2 a bushel; March oats 
were 1 cent higher at $1.07 a bushel, January soybeans were 1 1/2 
cents lower at $5.30 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on  
prospects of better beef sales in coming week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog futures prices fell as traders anticipated lower pork  
products prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle for February delivery was .88 cent higher at 63.20  
cents a pound; January feeder cattle were .90 cents higher at 74.05 
cents a pound; February live hogs were .72 cents lower at 39.95 
cents a pound; February pork bellies were 1.27 cents lower at 53.60 
cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Judge Chides Abortion Trial Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An abortion case erupted into calls for a  
mistrial Friday when a federal judge chided a witness by saying: 
``Truthful means truthful. ... This is not a Clinton deposition!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert E. Jones quickly apologized for his angry outburst  
in front of the jury and portrayed it as a comment made in jest at 
the end of a long week of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``May the record reflect that the court is smiling and the  
witness is smiling,'' a flustered Jones told a courtroom echoing 
with both gasps and laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't any smiling from defense attorneys, who put  
Wisconsin activist Monica Miller on the stand in a $200 million 
lawsuit accusing anti-abortion posters and a Web site of being 
thinly veiled invitations to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers said Jones ruined the credibility of Miller, who had  
responded to a question by asking: ``What do you mean by 
truthful?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge then referred to the impeachment case against  
President Clinton, in which he dissected the meaning of simple 
words and phrases. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense asked for a mistrial, which Jones quickly denied.  
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood, several abortion doctors and others claim  
the posters targeting ``The Deadly Dozen'' abortion doctors and the 
Web site giving personal information on ``baby butchers'' violate a 
1994 federal law that bars threats of force against abortion 
doctors and their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for more than a dozen defendants across the nation  
acknowledge the posters and Web site called ``The Nuremberg Files'' 
contain strong statements and graphic images. But they maintain it 
is constitutionally protected political speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our intention was not speak harm to any of the abortionists  
listed on it,'' said Miller, who designed the posters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site attracted attention last October when it crossed  
through the name of Dr. Barnett Slepian after he was killed by 
sniper fire in his home outside Buffalo, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Maier Seeks To Hold World Cup Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WENGEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Like his cyborg namesake, the  
``Herminator,'' skier Hermann Maier seems impossible to stop, no 
matter how badly his body takes a beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously considering a short break in order to rest a painful  
back before the upcoming world championships in Vail, Colo., Maier 
is instead disregarding his chronic injury to compete Saturday in 
celebrated Lauberhorn downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner last year in a downhill moved from Veysonnaz and  
shortened due to high winds, Maier is hoping a repeat this year 
might solidify his place among the Austrians likely to compete next 
month in Vail. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the physical impediment, it would not be surprising to  
see Maier come through. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier has repeatedly displayed remarkable Terminator-like  
resilience, the most shocking example at the Nagano Olympics when 
he survived a horrific, crash in the downhill before returning to 
the slopes to triumph in the super-G and giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauberhorn, the longest and one of the most demanding  
downhills on the World Cup circuit, provably will provide the same 
type of challenge for Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true it's very long but maybe I'm very fast so it's not  
so long for me,'' joked the reigning overall World Cup champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier's toughest competition probably will come from 1996  
overall World Cup champion Lasse Kjus of Norway, the winner of the 
season's first two downhills. He leads the World Cup standings in 
that discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Kristian Ghedina, who set a course record two years ago,  
and Austrian Andreas Schifferer, the reigning World Cup downhill 
champion, also will provide a strong challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Schifferer, who won the full-length Wengen downhill last year,  
also is looking to secure one of the four Austrian berths in the 
downhill at the worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can qualify if I win here,'' said Schifferer, still winless  
this season after an ankle injury in August set him back. ``But 
that doesn't add any pressure. We all still have a chance to 
qualify during downhill training in Vail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches will decide then on the remaining berths.  
</P>
<P>
	``Besides that, it's exciting to defend my win here,'' said  
Schifferer, who won four downhills last season. 
</P>
<P>
	While Maier also is chasing the World Cup downhill crown this  
season -- the only title to elude him among the events in which he 
regularly competes -- he has a more immediate concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the overall World Cup standings with 911 points, Maier  
is just 228 ahead of 1994 overall champion Kjetil Andre Aamodt of 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, a versatile skier skilled in both the speed and  
technical disciplines, also is competing in this weekend's 
downhill, and could easily weaken Maier's lead with additional 
points from both the slalom and the season's first combined event. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Maier finished third in the combined downhill then  
10th in his first career World Cup slalom -- staged in Veysonnaz 
because of insufficient snow in Wengen -- to clinch the combined 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, the reigning combined world champion, finished eighth in  
both downhills in Wengen last year, but went out in the first leg 
of the slalom, losing a valuable opportunity to collect points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegian, tied for second with Maier in the World Cup  
combined standings last season, has never climbed the podium in 
Wengen in any discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier's back problems, however, probably will give Aamodt a  
considerable advantage in the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the downhill it's not so bad because there are fewer back  
movements involved,'' acknowledged Maier, who won the most recent 
downhill, last month in Bormio, Italy. ``But the technical events 
are harder on the back with all that turning, twisting and 
leaning.''

<HEADLINE> World Not Riveted by Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The historic impeachment trial of President Clinton  
didn't seem to rivet much of the world today, especially Asia, 
where Michael Jordan's retirement was still producing front-page 
headlines in three countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The first day of testimony in the Senate on Thursday did  
dominate many of the broadsheets in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	But throughout much of the world, the news was overshadowed by  
the Brazilian economic crisis, the Olympic bribery scandal and the 
Chicago Bulls superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's trial was relegated to the inside pages of newspapers  
in the Philippines, while Jordan grabbed the headlines and the 
front pages in the basketball-crazed country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, some papers devoted more than half a page to the  
Clinton story, but others focused on economic issues. Jordan's 
retirement received more coverage in the Oriental Daily than 
Clinton did. 
</P>
<P>
	The same thing happened in northeastern China, where Jordan made  
the front page of the lively Beijing Youth daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial also was relegated to brief stories in the  
foreign news sections of many papers in Indonesia, Thailand, South 
Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's media were less enthralled by the trial than they  
had been by all the lurid details of Clinton's affair with White 
House intern Monica Lewinsky, which were released last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Malaysia, where the sexual misconduct and corruption trial of  
former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has dominated news 
reports for months, the Clinton trial had little impact. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Mexican news media, occupied with economic woes,  
paid little attention to Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	And Austrian radio ignored the Washington spectacle to focus on  
the big European Union story -- a vote of confidence over 
allegations of fraud and nepotism within the European Commission, 
the EU's executive agency. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton's trial got under way, the 20-member commission  
survived a vote in the European Parliament that could have forced 
its dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in Britain, the first day of testimony appeared in  
several papers today and most evening TV news broadcasts played up 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton story dominated papers such as the Times of London,  
the Daily Telegraph and the Independent, with headlines such as 
``Battle begins for Clinton's survival.''

<HEADLINE> Computer Services Spending Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans spent $216 billion on such computer  
services as programming and data processing in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That's up 17 percent from the year before, the Census Bureau  
reported Friday in a study of receipts by service industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings included:  
</P>
<P>
	--Travel agents and tour operators had income of $16.6 billion,  
up 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The motion picture industry had receipts of $63 billion, up 4.5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Real estate agents and managers recorded a 10 percent increase,  
to $99.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Companies providing health services had receipts of $836  
billion, up 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--There was a 10 percent increase for firms providing  
engineering, accounting, research and management services, to $322 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Automotive repair, automotive services and parking businesses  
receipts increased 5 percent, to $112 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Receipts for hotels, motels, rooming houses and other lodging  
places increased 6 percent, to $94 billion.

<HEADLINE> Spectators Getting Sense of History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They waited outside in miserable weather,  
watched their 15 minutes of infamy and moved on, somehow touched. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in awe of the building and everything that's going on,''  
said Jim Griffeth of Manchester, Conn., previously unawed by 
anything in the months and months of the Monica Lewinsky matter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington's grave spectacle some found hope, stirrings of it  
in a year of unpleasantness and poison. 
</P>
<P>
	The few Americans getting a personal glimpse of the Senate  
impeachment trial are finding that being inside, however briefly -- 
and regardless of whether they even know who's talking -- drives 
home the weight of it all, the sense that very old wheels are in 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems they are really trying to do this correctly,'' said  
Peggy Brun of Dayton, Ohio. And if the process is just, she added, 
the nation might finally be able to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right or wrong, to get to this point, it's serious,'' Greg  
Bellamy of Wilmington, N.C., said after watching from the public 
gallery where over 1,000 members of the public have been 
efficiently rotated in and out each day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy, I think, to get overly callous on the whole deal  
... if you just follow it at home,'' said Kurt Gahnberg. The 
transportation engineer from Seattle brought his wife and 
12-year-old twin girls on a business trip and spent 45 minutes 
shivering outside the Capitol before being ushered into the toasty 
chamber. ``No matter how you think about the issue, you are 
watching a piece of history,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores at a time waited in a damp and then biting wind Friday to  
get inside, no one taking the offer of a man waving $10 for anyone 
who would let him cut in line. ``Not for that price,'' commented 
Monica Hayden of northern Virginia. Pizza was shared. 
</P>
<P>
	The sergeant-at-arms office estimated 1,500 people from the  
public line were seated on the opening day of arguments, Thursday, 
each group getting 15 minutes. About 15 seats a day were set aside 
for diplomats, although few of them were taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people are coming away with a generic congressional gallery  
pass, in blue, not specific to the occasion. Security officers are 
suggesting people take it to any post office in town and have it 
stamped with the date to make it more of an impeachment memento. 
</P>
<P>
	But people who manage to get one of the 300 yellow tickets  
distributed each day by senators' offices -- three to a senator -- 
possess a true mark of history. ``Impeachment Trial of the 
President of the United States,'' the tickets say. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been lost on the crowd that the Senate so far has been  
proceeding without the raw anger that marked the House debate. 
``People on both sides of the aisle are trying to defuse the 
emotion,'' said Diane Conocchioli of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, many came with their children, as if it were suddenly  
safe to bring out the young. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents expressed relief that the case against President Clinton  
was being made without the graphic details that made his troubles 
so hard to explain over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing to have to shut their ears about,'' said  
Mrs. Brun, who came with her husband and two children. She needn't 
have worried. Her younger child, 8-year-old David, warmly ensconced 
in the gallery, fell asleep.

<HEADLINE> Council Deliberates on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A month after U.S. and British missiles  
rained down on Iraq, the Security Council is beginning its first 
serious discussions on how to resume monitoring Baghdad's weapons 
programs while improving the humanitarian situation for the Iraqi 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Several proposals are on the table and more were expected today:  
Russia is planning to elaborate on a French proposal to lift the 
oil embargo on Iraq while instituting a new surveillance system to 
make sure Saddam Hussein doesn't buy any more weapons, diplomats 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington came up with its own initiative Thursday but focused  
purely on the humanitarian side. The plan would allow Baghdad to 
sell unlimited amounts of oil but would maintain the controls in 
place requiring that the proceeds go toward buying food and 
medicine for Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would streamline the bulky U.N. bureaucracy,  
allowing contracts to bring food and medicine into Iraq to be 
automatically approved. Washington would also work to improve 
contract approval for spare parts to improve Iraq's oil 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	And the plan would allow Baghdad to borrow against a U.N. escrow  
fund to buy such goods, encourage humanitarian contributions and 
strengthen UNICEF and other U.N. programs already there. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh took pains to distance the  
U.S. initiative from the French, repeating U.S. concerns that U.N. 
resolutions require Iraq to be completely disarmed before the oil 
embargo can be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe that Iraq is disarmed,'' Burleigh told  
reporters after presenting the plan to the council. ``And it 
appears that the French proposal makes that assumption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both proposals were intended to jump-start council discussions  
on the Iraqi question in the aftermath of the December airstrikes 
by U.S. and British forces. The attacks were motivated by U.N. 
claims that Iraq wasn't cooperating with U.N. weapons inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals also point to the mounting concern that the oil  
embargo has failed to achieve the U.N. goal of disarming Iraq and 
is only hurting the Iraqi people. 
</P>
<P>
	Baghdad responded to the initiatives with a statement Thursday  
carried by the official Iraqi News Agency saying: ``Sanctions 
against Iraq in all their facets should be lifted immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Council members, meanwhile, found the proposal ``interesting and  
positive,'' but needed further time to study it, council president 
Celso Amorim of Brazil said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he welcomed the fact that the council was --  
finally -- discussing Iraq after nearly a month of near paralysis 
sparked by the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Benon Sevan, the head of the U.N. humanitarian program in Iraq,  
wouldn't comment on the U.S. or French proposals but welcomed the 
``flexibility shown by all members'' in trying to help the Iraqi 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, however, sided with the  
French, saying: ``If it doesn't go to lifting sanctions, it doesn't 
go far enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, new council member Canada suggested the 15-member  
body receive two comprehensive reports assessing the disarmament 
and humanitarian situation in Iraq, council diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the disarmament side, the U.N. Special Commission, which has  
carried out arms searches, was expected to turn over to the council 
next week a compendium of documents on the status of disarmament. 
</P>

	The Security Council barred Iraq from freely exporting oil after  
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, depriving it of its most valuable 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that the sanctions were creating devastating hardships  
for Iraq's 22 million people, the council agreed in 1995 to allow 
Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil for humanitarian relief -- 
currently $5.26 billion over six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Sagging oil prices and production limits, however, have  
prevented Iraq from reaching that ceiling.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Vaccines in Preparation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULUTH, Minn. (AP) -- Health officials hoped to vaccinate several  
thousand people by Saturday to contain an outbreak of the bacteria 
that cause meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people have been hospitalized with the bacteria this week.  
An 8-year-old girl and two boys aged 5 and 13 remained hospitalized 
in serious condition, but were considered out of danger. A 
20-year-old man was released. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 people in the Duluth area were scheduled for  
vaccinations today and Saturday to combat the Neisseria 
meningitidis bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Immunity can take seven to 10 days to develop, and health  
officials said they wouldn't be surprised to see more cases during 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who have been immunized and their families should not  
regard the immunizations as a magic bullet,'' said Dr. Mark Eckman 
of St. Mary's Medical Center . 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are concentrating the free immunizations at the Fond  
du Lac Indian Reservation, where the youngest boy and the man live, 
and a Duluth elementary school attended by the girl. The teen-age 
boy is a cousin of the 5-year-old victim.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Oral Sex Not Considered Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Fifty-nine percent of college students surveyed  
in 1991 did not consider having oral sex as having ``had sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 599 students who were surveyed, 59 percent answered  
``no'' when asked, ``Would you say you `had sex' with someone if 
the most intimate behavior you engaged in'' was oral-genital 
contact, according researchers with the Kinsey Institute for 
Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1991 survey data is being published in the Jan. 20 issue of  
The Journal of the American Medical Association, and the timing of 
its release to coincide with President Clinton's impeachment trial 
resulted in the firing of Dr. George D. Lundberg, JAMA's highly 
praised editor of 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``These data make it clear that general agreement regarding what  
constitutes having 'had sex' and how sexual partners are counted 
cannot be taken for granted,'' said co-authors Stephanie A. Sanders 
and June M. Reinisch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among the behaviors assessed, oral-genital contact had the  
most ambivalent status,'' they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction was mixed to the merits of the article by veterans in  
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health  
Research Group, said the study's findings ``are very interesting 
and very relevant,'' and the data appear sound. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, editor of the New England Journal of  
Medicine, said he would not have published the article, partly 
because ``any survey of young adults about sex -- you never are 
quite sure what the responses mean.''

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Claims Viagra Spray Patent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Two University of Kentucky researchers  
touting a Viagra nasal spray may have been beaten to the punch by 
the anti-impotence drug's manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariann Caprino, a Pfizer spokeswoman, said Friday that the  
pharmaceutical giant already has filed for a patent on a nasal 
version of the drug and has tested it on humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly not ready to speculate in terms of when we'll  
have a product out,'' Caprino said in a telephone interview from 
New York. She added, ``We are moving forward in terms of 
investigating this as a potential delivery system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two Kentucky professors, Lewis Dittert and Anwar Hussain,  
say they have developed a Viagra spray that speeds the drug's entry 
into the bloodstream, dropping the time it takes for Viagra's 
active ingredient to take effect from over an hour to five to 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is based on the fact that the active ingredient,  
sildenafil, can reach the bloodstream directly through the mucous 
membranes, instead of having to be digested and reach the small 
intestines before it can be absorbed, as with the current Viagra 
pill. 
</P>
<P>
	The key to the nasal spray, Dittert said, is adding a secret  
compound to the sildenafil that allows it to be dissolved in a 
small amount of solution and be sprayed into the nose. He and 
Hussain filed a provisional patent application on their process 
last June, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert released a written statement Friday in response to  
Pfizer's claim that it has a nasal version of Viagra in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	``After we filed our provisional (patent) application in June,  
we contacted Pfizer in England (where Viagra was developed). They 
did not tell us they had a patent application in this area,'' 
Dittert said in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed out that the key to his and Hussain's breakthrough is  
that they have found a way to dissolve 5 milligrams of sildenafil 
in a very small amount of water -- .1 milliliters, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the addition of the secret compound, Dittert said, it  
would take almost 10 milliliters of water to dissolve a dose of 
Viagra -- an amount Dittert called ``impractical'' for intranasal 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solubilization is the key to our invention; this is why we  
are anxious to work with Pfizer to develop the best possible dosage 
form,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caprino said Pfizer's version of a Viagra nasal spray was  
developed and tested in England, but she had no further details on 
the company's nasal system.

<HEADLINE> Indian Health Service to Get Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The basic health care provided to millions of  
Americans is routinely denied to Indians as chronic financial 
troubles force their federal health system to deny services when 
money runs out part-way through the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after years of neglect and stepped-up lobbying from  
outside, the Clinton administration is set to ask Congress for 
major new spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, the lack of money means postponed gallbladder or  
cataract surgery. Other times, it means a doctor worried about a 
patient's weak heart can't send him or her to a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do know how to ration care,'' said Yvette Joseph-Fox of  
the Indian Health Board, a private group that represents the 
nation's tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	American Indians and Alaskan native people are entitled to free  
health care under treaties signed with the federal government in 
exchange for land. But that care is far below what's provided to 
poor people in the federal Medicaid program -- not to mention what 
private insurance offers. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's plan comes after criticism from the  
Republican-controlled Congress and Indian groups -- and after 
increased lobbying from Indian groups who have become more savvy at 
working the system. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton plans to ask Congress for an increase of about  
$175 million -- an 8 percent jump over this year's $2.2 billion 
budget, according to administration officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also wants to increase the rates paid by Medicare  
and Medicaid to reimburse Indian hospitals -- spending that falls 
outside the regular budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House had even considered a much-bigger $500 million  
increase pushed by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna 
Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a striking request for an administration that asked for a  
meager 0.9 percent increase for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should have been embarrassed by what they did last  
year,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, who chairs the House 
subcommittee that appropriates the money. His committee upped the 
administration's request for a $19 million increase to $141 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian system saw healthy budget increases in the early  
1990s, but its budget for the last several years has been stagnant. 
That amounts to cuts, given the growing Indian population and 
inflation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ramifications are plain:  
</P>
<P>
	--In 1997, the health service spent an average of $1,382 a person  
-- less than half the $3,261 spent per person nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1982, there were nearly 100 doctors for every 100,000 Indian  
people; by 1994, fewer than 90. That compares with 229 doctors for 
every 100,000 people nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a group with many needs: One in three Indians lives below  
the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
	While tuberculosis has been treatable for decades, Indians are  
five times as likely to die from it than are Americans as a whole. 
They're more than four times as likely to die of liver disease and 
three times as likely to die of diabetes -- deaths preventable with 
proper care. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are suffering and dying premature deaths, due in large  
part to reductions in Indian Health Service spending,'' Buford L. 
Rolin, chairman of the National Indian Health Board, told a Senate 
committee last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the most sophisticated Indian hospitals must refer patients  
with anything but routine troubles to outside hospitals and 
specialists -- an expensive proposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, clinics would run out of money for referrals in  
the last quarter of the fiscal year, implementing something called 
``Priority One.'' That means people needing nonemergency tests or 
operations had to wait until the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the crunch is so bad that most clinics adopt Priority One  
in the year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pain has become the new standard for determining who can  
access basic surgery and other specialized care,'' Rolin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gallup, N.M., the Indian hospital eliminated 20 of its 99  
beds and closed an outlying field clinic that saw 5,100 patients 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Indians realized they needed more effective lobbying. They  
pumped up campaign donations to members of Congress and began 
reaching out to higher-up administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	But the health service has work of its own to do, its advocates  
acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	It can supplement its federal money by making the effort to bill  
Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers for certain eligible 
patients. Clinics and hospitals have gotten better at this, but 
there's room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	And the service needs to better monitor expenses so it can make  
the case for more money. In other words, it needs to run more like 
a business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would certainly like for us to be able to justify  
ourselves,'' Dr. Tim Fleming, who heads the service's hospital in 
Gallup. ``We're not very good at that.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lincoln Center has scheduled 400 events to honor  
Duke Ellington this year, the 100th anniversary of his birth, and 
you don't have to take the A train to get to all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the events honoring Ellington this year include a PBS  
program, a book, a live CD and performances in Central Park and on 
subway platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra also plans to celebrate with a  
five-month tour of Europe, Australia and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The first event, ``Happy Reunion -- Memories of Duke,''  
reminiscences by 17 musicians who were in Ellington's band before 
his death in 1974, followed a news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, artistic director of the Lincoln  
Center Jazz Orchestra, played Ellington's ``Portrait of Louis 
Armstrong'' with the Hall High School Concert Jazz Band of West 
Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> JAMA Editor Fired Over Sex Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The editor of The Journal of the American Medical  
Association was fired Friday for publishing a what-is-sex survey of 
college students to coincide with President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. George D. Lundberg was dismissed for ``inappropriately and  
inexcusably interjecting JAMA into the middle of a debate that has 
nothing to do with science or medicine,'' said AMA Executive Vice 
President E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The article -- ``Would You Say You `Had Sex' If ...?'' -- found  
that 59 percent of college students surveyed in 1991 did not 
consider having oral sex as having ``had sex.'' The question of 
what constitutes sex is at the center of the impeachment case. 
</P>
<P>
	On the advice of his attorney, Lundberg, 65, would not comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg had been editor of JAMA for 17 years. The distinguished  
journal, circulation 700,000, is considered one of the ``twin 
peaks'' of American medical literature, along with the New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said the firing had nothing to do with the scientific  
merits of the article and instead involved the rush to get it into 
print. Anderson said Lundberg ``was focused on sensationalism, not 
journalism,'' and he apologized for the article's timing. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said of the firing: ``I think  
that clearly is an internal matter for the AMA to deal with. And I 
think they're in the best position to decide what's appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some longtime observers of medicine criticized the firing and  
said good journals often speed publication of articles relevant to 
public health or public debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a tragedy, since George Lundberg is a giant in  
the field of American medical publishing, and under his leadership, 
the journal flourished,'' said Arthur Caplan, director of bioethics 
at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	June M. Reinisch, co-author of the article in the Jan. 20 issue  
of JAMA, said she was ``absolutely shocked'' by the firing. 
Reinisch, retired director of the Kinsey Institute for Research in 
Sex, Gender and Reproduction, said there was nothing unusual about 
JAMA's handling of the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Her article was based on a survey of 599 students by the  
Bloomington, Ind.-based Kinsey Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	She said various colleagues had urged her to prepare a paper  
after the issue of whether oral sex is sex was raised during the 
Clinton scandal when the president denied having sexual relations 
with Monica Lewinsky. Other portions of the 1991 survey have 
previously been published. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest article only briefly refers to the current public  
debate on the question. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said the article was not the only decision that caused  
him to lose confidence in the editor. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health  
Research Group, said Lundberg's willingness to speak out on 
important issues made him the enemy of some doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA has about 290,000 members, or about 40 percent of U.S.  
doctors. Its journal goes worldwide as well as to all its members.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was tough obeying democracy's rare summons  
to sit still and be quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those chairs are more museum pieces,'' observed newcomer Peter  
Fitzgerald, Republican senator from Illinois, after six hours of 
sitting and listening. ``I don't think they had sitting in mind 
when they designed them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A chamber that echoes with debate and chatter was devoted  
Thursday to a monologue, the opening House Republican case on why 
President Clinton should be thrown out of office. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators acted as jurors. Some were transfixed, gazing  
sphinx-like upon the proceedings. Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller 
of West Virginia was stuck in the same contemplative, hands-clasped 
pose all day. 
</P>
<P>
	A decorum suited to the august chamber was the norm on this  
far-from-normal occasion. The House Republicans who had unleashed 
the graphic Starr report on the world tread delicately on matters 
sexual when they stood in the well, Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
behind them, presiding. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Rogan of California, one of the House impeachment  
managers, struggled to make his point about how Clinton dodged 
legal definitions of sexual relations without getting into the sort 
of details that, not so long ago, made following the news a 
treacherous business for families with children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel a need to enumerate to this body what the actual  
body parts are,'' Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House members brought video, slides and charts. There again  
was the stark tape of Clinton fudging in testimony. Also, shown was 
video of two of his oaths -- when he became president, and again in 
court proceedings when he said ``I do'' to the oath committing him 
to the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on a day of ringing history, there was a ring of the  
familiar. Senators may have resolved to cleanse their minds of bias 
and subvert their political nature, but these are people who, for 
the most part, have been following the Monica Lewinsky saga from 
Day One. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept feeling like I heard everything again and again,'' said  
Democratic Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers -- their turn to come -- sat around one of  
the curved tables specially made for the trial. Among them, David 
Kendall sat there with his beaten-up briefcase, eyebrows raised, 
head bent, mouth drawn down at the edges into what appeared to be a 
permanent look of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	He took few notes. Mostly, he had his two pens lined up neatly  
on the table. He was among the first to yawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask for a special measure of wisdom,'' Senate chaplain  
Lloyd J. Ogilvie prayed at the start. ``Now, dear Father, help us 
through this difficult time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, chairman of the House Judiciary  
Committee and essentially leader of the prosecution, gave an 
introductory speech that marked the drama's turning from high 
ceremony to painstaking business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are now stewards of the oath,'' he said gravely. He  
invoked Sir Thomas More, who chose to die rather than swear an oath 
that he could not live by. Senators paid rapt attention at that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the particulars. The prosecution team got out the  
charts and the senators began to fidget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their demeanor was, 'Let's cut to the quick -- I've heard this  
all before,''' said Nora Owen, an Irish member of Parliament 
watching from the public gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina Republican Sen. Jesse Helms' eyes closed and his  
head dropped several times. Alaska Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, 
battling a cold, leaned his head heavily on his hand, eyes also 
drifting shut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking antibiotics,'' he said later. ``It's tougher than  
hell to stay awake.'' But he praised the House team's presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Snyder, a teacher from Wasilla, Alaska, said the senators  
seemed to be paying attention for the most part. ``They looked like 
they were taking notes. They could have been writing grocery lists 
for all I know.''

<P>
	``We ask for a special measure of wisdom,'' Senate chaplain  
Lloyd J. Ogilvie prayed at the start. ``Now, dear Father, help us 
through this difficult time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, chairman of the House Judiciary  
Committee and essentially leader of the prosecution, gave an 
introductory speech that marked the drama's turning from high 
ceremony to painstaking business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are now stewards of the oath,'' he said gravely. He  
invoked Sir Thomas More, who chose to die rather than swear an oath 
that he could not live by. Senators paid rapt attention at that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the particulars. The prosecution team got out the  
charts and the senators began to fidget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their demeanor was, 'Let's cut to the quick -- I've heard this  
all before,''' said Nora Owen, an Irish member of Parliament 
watching from the public gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina Republican Sen. Jesse Helms' eyes closed and his  
head dropped several times. Alaska Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, 
battling a cold, leaned his head heavily on his hand, eyes also 
drifting shut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking antibiotics,'' he said later. ``It's tougher than  
hell to stay awake.'' But he praised the House team's presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Snyder, a teacher from Wasilla, Alaska, said the senators  
seemed to be paying attention for the most part. ``They looked like 
they were taking notes. They could have been writing grocery lists 
for all I know.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Markets Bigger Business Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TETERBORO, N.J. (AP) -- Sick of that interminable airline jingle  
while you wait on hold for a reservation? Tired of standing in line 
with your boarding pass, or getting cross looks when you try to 
cram your carry-on into the overhead compartment? 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has just the plane for you: the Boeing Business Jet, a  
derivative of its popular 737 commercial airliner. The Seattle 
company is marketing them to anyone willing to pay $35 million -- 
and that does not include a paint job or the interior. 
</P>
<P>
	You can easily drop another $10 million adding queen-sized beds  
and a private office. But if you are smart about it, you can fly 
away for not much more than you would pay for other corporate 
planes. The big difference? The amount of room. 
</P>
<P>
	With 807 square feet of floor space, the size of the passenger  
compartment is more than twice that found in competing planes. 
Indeed, it is bigger than the average studio apartment in 
Manhattan, which runs a cozy 600 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
	With all that space to fill, buyers are running the gamut with  
decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are all business, picking lots of seats -- first-class size,  
of course -- and a conference room. Others are indulging themselves, 
partitioning the cabin into a living room, dining room, library and 
master bedroom suite. 
</P>
<P>
	A few have installed galleys with dishwashers. Middle East  
customers are showing an inclination toward ovens for their roast 
lamb. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, Boeing has sold 46 -- including two for General  
Electric's globetrotters. It has also sold nine to Net Jets, a 
fractional ownership program that lets the wealthy use planes part 
time, like vacation timeshares. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman, the professional golfer, put in an order, but he  
backed out late last year when the Asian economic crisis crimped 
his plans to crisscross the Pacific Rim building golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
	While private jets have long been the domain of heads of states,  
celebrities and the Fortune 500 crowd, the BBJ is in some ways more 
comprehensible to the average flier. The 737 is the world's most 
widely used passenger jet. All 280 jets in the Southwest Airlines 
fleet, for example, are 737s. 
</P>
<P>
	Step inside a mockup at Teterboro Airport, though, and it is  
clear the BBJ is not the typical 737 that 150 people pile into for 
a commercial flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We provide space, space that affords the chief executive to do  
more than just travel from A to B,'' BBJ President Borge Boeskov 
says in a promotional video. ``He's able to have a meeting in this 
airplane, he's able to sleep in this airplane and he's able to eat 
a proper meal in this airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Bolen, president of the General Aviation Manufacturers  
Association, said the jet is especially attractive to global 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	It allows companies ``to go into some parts of the world and  
stay on the aircraft,'' Bolen said. ``They can basically make that 
their office, hotel room and boardroom in a country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Boeing has found success, competitors such as Gulfstream  
consider the BBJ more of a niche player than a rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BBJ is a larger aircraft, a slower hybrid aircraft which  
flies at lower altitudes,'' said company spokesman Keith Mordoff. 
``Undoubtedly there are some customers who would want a very large 
cabin despite the many tradeoffs and they will purchase a BBJ, but 
these customers are not typically Gulfstream customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Head-to-head, the BBJ consumes up to 50 percent more fuel than  
Gulfstream's new G-V. It also takes about 20 minutes longer to fly 
from New York to London, and the purchase price can be a few 
million dollars more, depending on the amenities. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing says it closes the gap by offering more durable  
equipment, cheaper replacement parts and access to bulk fuel 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	The BBJ is being marketed by Boeing and GE. While Boeing  
recently announced up to 48,000 layoffs because of the Asian 
financial crisis, the BBJ is a company blessing. It brings a new 
kind of customer to an existing production line. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales also help GE, because the plane is powered with engines  
made by the company and its French partner, Snecma. The idea has 
prompted Boeing's European counterpart, Airbus Industries, to offer 
its A319 model to corporate titans. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two Boeing Business Jets were delivered to customers  
just before Thanksgiving, with 44 more on order. They are plucked 
from the 737 assembly line at a rate of two per month, so new 
customers will have to wait two years. 
</P>
<P>
	They had better be ready with their checkbooks. Under Boeing's  
standard terms, buyers have to hand over their first $2 million 
when they place their orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a Peanuts Fare with  
this airplane.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Doctors in HMO Try To Unionize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Health-maintenance organizations have  
turned independent, Marcus Welby-style physicians into employees 
controlled by rules and financial incentives, claims a labor union 
seeking federal permission to organize doctors for collective 
bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	In a legal brief filed late Thursday with the National Labor  
Relations Board in Philadelphia, Local 56 of the United Food and 
Commercial Workers Union argues that AmeriHealth HMO Inc. 
unilaterally decides what fees the doctors receive and, often, what 
care they give patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is targeting AmeriHealth, hoping to set a precedent  
that would allow doctors in any HMO to unionize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that these people aren't independent contractors at  
all, not in the true sense of the word,'' Anthony Cinaglia, 
president of the union, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The physicians say forming a union would help them regain  
control over medical decisions, improving quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriHealth, in its own brief, counters that the doctors are  
still independent contractors -- and that that was clearly proved 
during 14 days of hearings before the NLRB last fall, the first 
ever on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``AmeriHealth plays absolutely no role in the day-to-day  
operations of these doctors,'' Rich Rosenblatt, an attorney for the 
subsidiary of Philadelphia-based Independence Blue Cross, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the doctors treat patients enrolled in numerous HMOs and  
receive at most 12 percent of their income from AmeriHealth. 
</P>
<P>
	The NLRB regional director in Philadelphia, Dorothy  
Moore-Duncan, will consider both sides' briefs, along with several 
thousand pages of hearing exhibits and transcripts involving 18 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore-Duncan initially denied the union's petition without a  
hearing last January, but was ordered to hold the hearing after the 
doctors appealed to the NLRB's Washington headquarters. If she 
rules in favor of the doctors this time, it would set a national 
precedent, allowing a union election and then collective bargaining 
with the HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would trigger a flood of physicians contacting unions,  
labor officials predict. Just 3 percent of U.S. doctors -- nearly 
all of them hospital employees -- are unionized. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. antitrust law prohibits independent contractors from  
banding together to set prices and terms for their work, but NLRB 
has allowed unions for some whose work primarily is dictated by 
others, including entertainers, athletes, cab drivers and, most 
recently, couriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust lawyers, though, call the case a long shot for the  
doctors, primarily because they supply their own offices, equipment 
and support staff. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriHealth covers 270,000 New Jersey residents.

<HEADLINE> PBS Examines America the Rude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If you believe that America the beautiful has  
become America the churlish, you've got company. 
</P>
<P>
	A worthy, three-part PBS program examines what many observers  
see as society's growing incivility and coarseness at every level, 
from daily life to politics to popular culture. Some of the 
conclusions, however, may prompt Bronx cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of PBS' ``National Desk'' public affairs series, the  
program opens tonight (check local listings) with ``We the (rude) 
People,'' in which political commentator and journalist Morton 
Kondracke examines the roots of rudeness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Sleaze: Media and Politics,''  
airs Friday, Jan. 22, with Mara Liasson. The National Public Radio 
correspondent looks at how the ambitions of journalists and 
politicians clash with the public's right to fairness and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The concluding chapter is ``The Popular Culture: Who's to  
Blame?'' with comedian David Steinberg, who dissects the Jerry 
Springer Era of trash entertainment and more worthy, 
boundary-breaking fare. It airs Friday, Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the first episode overreaches in its attempt to target  
the causes of America's social deterioration, the series offers a 
convincing portrait of a country confused, at best, about modern 
etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not merely a drawing-room topic: One 1996 study found 91  
percent of Americans believe the decline of civility contributes to 
violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	A caution: The series makes points about changing standards of  
behavior with graphic examples of profanity, nudity and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kondracke's segment, which takes on the thorny job of figuring  
out why Americans seem increasingly inclined to cuss, lean on car 
horns and slam doors in each others' faces, is the most 
provocative. 
</P>
<P>
	The causes are varied, the program suggests, and include  
technological advancements like the Internet that depersonalize 
interaction and value speed over politeness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really elegant communication takes some thought, and thought  
is a lost commodity where we're driven by speed,'' says Rep. Henry 
J. Hyde, R-Ill., who may currently be concerned about supersonic 
impeachment hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the program stretches further, finding extensive roots of  
today's social rancor in the upheaval of the '60s and its blunt 
protest tactics adapted from the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Painting with a broad brush, Kondracke contends that Vietnam War  
protesters lacked the moral righteousness of those fighting for 
black equality. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the first glimpse of the 'me generation,' in which  
civility and duty were not part of everyday life, but simply a 
personal choice to be made when it suited them,'' says Kondracke. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncivil 1990s, he argues, are the selfish 1960s come home to  
roost. 
</P>
<P>
	Beg your pardon, Mr. Kondracke. Besides disparaging the  
motivations of an entire generation, the assessment simplifies the 
changes in American society wrought by that pivotal era, what led 
up to it and what followed, for good and ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Social commentators including Alan Ehrenhalt further blame the  
``Balkanization'' of America into special interest groups that they 
say have undermined our shared identity, the basis for mutual 
respect as well as self-respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact you identify with a sexual preference or an ethnic  
group doesn't necessarily give you what residence in a neighborhood 
or community gave you 40 years ago,'' Ehrenhalt says. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a polite suggestion, but it could be argued that community  
spirit without social and economic equality rings hollow, and that 
the two aren't necessarily antithetical. 
</P>
<P>
	Other observers in the program cite substandard education, a  
lack of religious emphasis and the dissolution of families as 
reasons for our frayed manners, not to mention spirit. City 
dwellers might add overcrowding to the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the extent of the problem, Kondracke says, there is  
reason for hope. As Walter Williams of George Mason University sees 
it, civility really is as simple as the golden rule: Treat others 
as you would like to be treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``National Desk'' even found small signs of change.  
</P>
<P>
	One educator tells how overcoming the anonymity of a large  
school by breaking it up into four sub-schools gave students more 
of a stake in behaving properly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows everybody's name,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Not a return to the days of sir and ma'am. But it's a start.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> At Mile High, Jets Face Altitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Jets say they won't be caught breathless in  
Denver. The Broncos say that's a lot of hot air. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Jets visit Mile High Stadium for Sunday's AFC  
championship game, they will be riding high, with a seven-game 
winning streak. Their attitude, however, could fall victim to the 
altitude, as the thin air thins their chances of advancing to the 
Super Bowl for the first time in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell the altitude takes its effect on people,''  
Broncos defensive tackle Mike Lodish said. ``I don't care who you 
are. Late in the fourth quarter, you have some guys who are just 
dying out there. Even early in the game at the end of a 12- or 
14-play drive, you have some tongues hanging down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lodish saw that at the outset of last weekend's playoff victory  
over Miami. The Broncos marched 92 yards in 14 plays, a drive of 
nearly eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to see it again from the Jets. But New York isn't  
buying it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike High is not unlike talking about several other places we  
went,'' coach Bill Parcells said. ``Go to Buffalo, Kansas City, 
Miami, don't think the place can be unlike that, and at least we 
been through it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think (the altitude) has anything to do with it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Asked if teams must acclimate themselves to being in the  
Rockies, Parcells shook his head. He coached at Air Force in 
Colorado Springs, which gives him something to base that opinion 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they are moving the game to sea level, so I  
think we just have to go play,'' said Parcells, who added he 
wouldn't even mention it to the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why bring that up and create another distraction?'' linebacker  
Bryan Cox said. ``The only ones thinking about those things are the 
media, not the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our job is to get ready and play the Denver Broncos for the  
AFC championship in Mile High Stadium. Nothing else will matter to 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps. The Jets certainly have done well in what they term  
``hostile environments,'' winning at Kansas City, New England, 
Buffalo, Miami and Tennessee this season. They've displayed poise 
and gumption. 
</P>
<P>
	One Jets player thinks the altitude will help. Placekicker John  
Hall, who has converted 27 of 37 field goals, including 52- and 
30-yarders in last Sunday's 34-24 playoff win against Jacksonville, 
has no problem with playing in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's light air and it helps your ball move further,'' Hall  
said. ``There's more implications, but you have to look at it that 
it's just a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And not look at it as a head game, where the Broncos are  
breathing easily because they are used to the atmosphere, and the 
Jets are not. 
</P>
<P>
	``They might have a team where it affects nobody,'' Broncos  
fullback Howard Griffith said. ``It's a mental aspect. Even if it 
doesn't affect you, you've heard all week that you're going to Mile 
High and the altitude is going to affect you. Even if it doesn't 
really affect your game, it's already been embedded in your mind. 
If you allow it mentally to be a block, it's an advantage for us.''

<HEADLINE> Industrial Production Up 0.2 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Output at the nation's factories, mines and  
utilities in 1998 grew at the slowest pace in five years but a 
modest end-of-the-year pickup offered hope that 1999 won't be as 
dismal as feared. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial production increased 0.2 percent in December from the  
month before and 3.7 percent in 1998 from the year before, the 
Federal Reserve said Friday. The annual gain was the smallest 
increase since a 3.5 percent advance in 1993, and it followed a 
robust 6 percent rise in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	American manufacturers have been hit hard by the loss of export  
sales to Asian nations and other countries hurt by the world slump 
that began in Thailand in mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a hint of recovery during the final three months  
of the year. Industrial production advanced at a 3.2 percent annual 
rate after a gain at a meager 0.9 percent rate in the 
July-September quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The pickup occurred even though output at utilities declined at  
a 12.5 percent annual rate during the fourth quarter, the result of 
unusually mild weather. Just at factories, the production pace 
picked up from 0.4 percent in the third quarter to 5.1 percent in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the acceleration in manufacturing reflected a rebound at  
auto plants following strikes that idled General Motors during the 
summer. Nevertheless, the output of other manufacturing industries 
grew at a 3.3 percent rate in the fourth quarter after little 
change in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists chose to view the report as a glass half full.  
</P>
<P>
	``The big story here is the amazing resilience of the  
manufacturing sector, which ought to be in recession but which 
clearly is not,'' said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics 
in Valhalla, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ken Mayland of KeyCorp in Cleveland said January's  
rough weather should depress manufacturing output and, after that, 
a ``rising tide of Latin American economic turmoil'' following this 
week's devaluation of the Brazilian real should act as a drag. 
Latin America buys 20 percent of U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``The factory sector ... still has several more months of  
purgatory yet to endure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to Brazil's troubles, Wall Street took a beating this  
week. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 522 points through 
Thursday, before recouping 220 points to close at 9,341 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Reaser of NationsBank Corp. in Jacksonville said industrial  
output should increase moderately again in 1999 but probably won't 
show significant improvement until late in the year as the 
economies of Asia and Latin America begin to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, as output growth slowed, industrial companies  
continued to expand their capacity to produce at a brisk 5 percent 
rate. As a result, industrial firms have excess capacity. They were 
using 80.9 percent of it in December, the lowest level since 
October 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically that leads to less pricing power, as is currently  
the case,'' said economist Mark Vitner of First Union Corp. in 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, some industries -- such as manufacturers of  
computers and office equipment -- expanded rapidly. Output grew 54.1 
percent from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It rose 29.2 percent for semiconductors and 28.5 percent for  
home electronic equipment but fell 13 percent for iron and steel, 
8.7 percent for tobacco, 7.4 percent for oil and gas, 5.9 percent 
for apparel and 2.1 percent for chemical products. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department said inventories at American  
businesses rose a moderate 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
$1.09 trillion in November, in line with an identical gain in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say backlogs of unsold goods were relatively lean  
heading into 1999. Too big a buildup can signal production cutbacks 
as businesses work to reduce inventories.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Gov't Housing Agency Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is considering a  
proposal to privatize a government housing agency as it searches 
for more money for next year's budget, but the potential impact on 
consumers remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House's budget arm is considering the plan to sell the  
Government National Mortgage Association, known as Ginnie Mae, for 
several billion dollars to help offset the costs of new spending 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginnie Mae is a wholly owned government corporation within the  
Department of Housing and Urban Development. It guarantees 
securities backed by pools of mortgages that are issued by private 
institutions. The mortgages are insured by the Federal Housing 
Administration or guaranteed by the Veterans Administration or by 
the Rural Housing Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a conceptual proposal that still needs to be developed,''  
said Victor Lambert, a HUD spokesman. ``It's an intriguing concept, 
but the devils are in the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ginnie Mae increases the supply of credit available for housing  
by guaranteeing payments even if borrowers can't make them. It 
generates $400 million a year for the government, but can bring in 
as much as $600 million. That is reason enough for the 
cash-strapped housing department to be less than eager to 
relinquish it, say some. 
</P>
<P>
	``HUD never likes to lose anything, because they've lost so much  
already,'' says Calvin Bradford, who runs a fair housing and 
lending consulting firm in Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 19 million homes have been financed through Ginnie Mae  
securities. The agency finances more than 12 percent of all the 
nation's mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has already trumpeted proposals to increase  
military readiness, improve food safety and expand Medicare. The 
sale of Ginnie Mae could be one way to balance out the expenses in 
the budget plan, along with a proposal to raise taxes on 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact of any Ginnie Mae sale on home loans is unclear. Any  
charter to set it up a privatized company must answer whether 
Ginnie Mae has the backing of the Treasury Department and whether 
it will change the fees it pays as incentives to lenders to service 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD will not speculate on the potential impact of any sale,  
calling it ``premature,'' Lambert said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a person familiar with the negotiations, HUD helped  
revise a plan initially proposed by the budget office to make it 
more ``tailored and practical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One possible result is that the administration could bar  
mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from bidding to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-chartered mortgage  
market companies that function like commercial corporations and are 
publicly traded. They compete with FHA, part of the housing 
department, which insures mortgage loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assume they want this privatized Ginnie Mae to stand on its  
own and compete against Freddie and Fannie,'' said bank analyst 
Bert Ely of Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the administration also considered adding a fee to  
Fannie Mae transactions. The plan was dropped after drawing strong 
opposition from those ``who did not want to see a tax on 
homeownership,'' said John Buckley, Fannie Mae's senior vice 
president for communications.

<HEADLINE> West Coast's Best Big Men To Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA's youth against Stanford's veteran  
starting five. That's only one intriguing aspect of the Pac-10 
Conference showdown between the 10th-ranked Bruins and No. 4 
Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game features five of the most talented big men on  
the West Coast in a clash of contrasting styles. The athleticism of 
UCLA freshmen Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric will go up against 
Stanford's experienced frontline of 7-foot-2 Tim Young, 6-9 Mark 
Madsen and 6-7 Peter Sauer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stanford is just a runaway freight train,'' UCLA coach Steve  
Lavin said. ``Stanford is the one team that looks like they're 
going to run the table undefeated or have the ability to go 17-1 
(in the Pac-10).'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the first two weeks in the Pac-10 have been unpredictable,  
Stanford has stayed above the fray with a 4-0 record. The Cardinal 
(14-2) bring a 10-game winning streak into Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see how long we can keep it going,'' coach Mike  
Montgomery said. ``It looks like this conference won't be very 
forgiving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Stanford snapped UCLA's 16-game home winning streak  
with an 84-81 victory that completed a two-game sweep of the 
Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	But this season UCLA (12-3, 4-1 Pac-10) is better equipped to  
deal with Stanford's height. The addition of Moiso and Gadzuric -- 
who are both 20 years old, stand 6-10 and have overseas playing 
experience -- made the Bruins bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``UCLA probably has the best young players in the Pac-10,  
they're very dangerous,'' Madsen said. ``We're extremely wary of 
their front line, we're concerned about the matchups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Madsen is most impressed with Moiso, the West Indies native who  
is UCLA's second-leading scorer with 12.8 points a game. The 
freshman's best outing came in a 66-62 loss to Kentucky, with 25 
points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's big, he's quick and he can shoot the ball,'' Madsen said.  
``I'm nervous about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moiso and Gadzuric are not typical big men. Moiso can hit  
3-pointers and left-handed hook shots when he's not dishing off to 
teammates. Gadzuric counters Moiso's finesse with physical play. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the strengths of our big guys is they have very agile  
feet. Even though Jerome is not going to be a banger and may not 
have the strength of the Madsens and the Tim Youngs, he has the 
agility and the quickness,'' Lavin said. ``Madsen and Young's game 
is more of a plodding, sumo wrestler, grind it out down on the 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan is strong enough to bang with the bigger players in the  
conference, but he's quick enough to also get out and run the floor 
and move his feet and use his position inside,'' Lavin said.

<HEADLINE> NRA, Businesses Defend Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like cigarette makers, gun manufacturers face  
a round of lawsuits brought by municipalities seeking to recover 
medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a page from the cigarette industry's playbook, the gun  
manufacturers are broadening their arguments to attract the same 
broad-based business groups that entered the fray over tobacco, 
helping to defeat legislation in the Senate last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt an obligation with tobacco to stand up and speak  
out,'' said Larry Kraus, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
Institute for Legal Reform. ``We did it there, we'll do it with 
guns, and we'll do it with every target until we can put a stop to 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are lawsuits filed by Chicago and New Orleans, and  
maybe in the future by other cities, seeking to make firearms 
manufacturers pay the costs of treating gunshot victims and 
responding to gun-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are modeled after the just-settled tobacco lawsuits,  
which will bring millions of dollars into municipal treasuries and 
impose new restrictions on cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns are the only unregulated consumer product in America,''  
said Bob Walker, president of Handgun Control Inc., a gun control 
group whose educational and legal arm, the Center to Prevent 
Handgun Violence, is helping in the New Orleans suit. ``At the 
moment, the courts are the best means available of assuring that 
gun manufacturers are held to a reasonable standard of 
accountability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the cigarette manufacturers, the gun makers want to shift  
the debate from their industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people out there who feel the courts and  
judges are out of control,'' said Bob Ricker, director of 
government affairs for the American Shooting Sports Council, the 
trade association for gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers plan to ask both Congress and state  
legislatures for legislation that would restrict the cities from 
going to court, either by requiring states to approve all lawsuits 
or by prohibiting suits where the lawyers work on contingency, 
getting paid only if they win. 
</P>
<P>
	To bolster their efforts, the gun manufacturers are trying to  
make common cause with business groups that long have favored 
limits on liability suits. It is the same way the tobacco industry 
enlisted the support of organizations opposed to government 
regulations and higher taxes and framed the debate that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't going to stop with guns,'' Ricker said. ``They've  
already got their sights on the alcohol industry, fast food, 
automobiles. We're going to try to do whatever we can to shape 
public opinion to really expose these rich trial lawyers for what 
they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also intervening on the side of the gun manufacturers is the  
National Rifle Association, one of Washington's most potent 
lobbying groups. The NRA plans to conduct its own campaigns in 
support of legislation curbing the lawsuits, but coordinate its 
efforts with the gun manufacturers, Ricker said. NRA officials 
could not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Howard Stern Stalker Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A stalker who promised in a letter to Howard  
Stern that he would ``absolutely, without a doubt'' kill the 
shock-jock has been sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence was nearly twice as much as federal guidelines  
called for in a case that began when Michael Lance Carvin sent four 
letters to Stern last spring from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Carvin, 44, threatened Stern and his family, referring in one  
letter to the radio personality as ``Dead Man Walking,'' according 
to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will absolutely, without a doubt, kill you and this is 100  
percent guaranteed,'' said in one letter to Stern, whose radio show 
is broadcast nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Carvin was arrested in 1975 for pulling a toy gun on  
then-presidential candidate Ronald Reagan. The next year, he was 
convicted of threatening then-President Ford and Vice President 
Nelson Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
	Carvin served six years of a 10-year federal sentence and was  
paroled in 1982.

<HEADLINE> GOP Prosecutors Lay Out Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's flashiest trial lawyers need not  
worry -- they probably will not lose clients to the first set of 
House prosecutors in President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not show horses, they're work horses,'' said  
University of Virginia law professor A.E. ``Dick'' Howard after 
four House prosecutors spent more than five hours Thursday 
methodically laying out the initial case against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors got good marks from legal observers for their  
explanation of the impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction 
of justice against Clinton for what he did to conceal his affair 
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	But by outlining the case in great detail, they may have  
undercut their effort to persuade the Senate to call witnesses, 
some observers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really is nothing new. You get the sense that we've  
heard this song before,'' said New York lawyer Bruce Yannett. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., did the best job, Yannett said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson, a U.S. attorney in Arkansas from 1982 to 1985,  
opened by saying, ``This is certainly a humbling experience for a 
small-town lawyer.'' But his largely memorized one-hour, 20-minute 
presentation on the obstruction charge was the most animated of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Yannett thought Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., overreached by arguing  
that Ms. Lewinsky had no motive on her own to file a false 
statement denying an affair with the president. She simply could 
have wanted to stay out of public view, Yannett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Barbara Nicastro said Bryant was persuasive in  
``pointing out the gamesmanship of Bill Clinton'' as part of the 
background of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant and Rep. James Sensenbrenner read closely from their  
scripts, and Sensenbrenner spoke almost in a monotone. Rep. James 
Rogan, R-Calif., who described the perjury charge, referred to his 
written speech much less often. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of the House managers has a stunning lack of charisma and  
is best able to take the Jack Webb-type approach -- just the 
facts,'' said Indiana University law professor Charles Geyh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being thorough requires a methodical, systematic approach that  
may not be exciting to listen to,'' added Geyh, who was special 
counsel to Pennsylvania state House members in the 1994 impeachment 
of a state Supreme Court justice. 
</P>
<P>
	But Washington lawyer Joseph Di Genova said, ``This is not about  
histrionics. They have done the most important thing of all: 
structuring their case by showing the president's centrality to a 
massive scheme of obstruction of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Explaining the obstruction charge first makes it easier to show  
why the perjury case against Clinton is significant, Di Genova 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawyers thought the House members' presentations included  
so much interpretation of events they sounded more like the closing 
arguments of a trial rather than the opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't know if they're ever going to get to call  
witnesses, and this may be their only shot,'' Yannett said. 
</P>
<P>
	All four prosecutors argued for the need to call witnesses after  
Clinton's lawyers outline their defense next week and senators get 
two days to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors were ``effective enough to create the impression  
that there's nothing frivolous about going further and having 
witnesses,'' Geyh said. However, Yannett thought the prosecutors 
did not clearly explain how witness testimony would change what is 
known about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors used a number of videotape clips -- of Clinton  
taking the oath of office on a Bible in 1993, of wagging his finger 
and telling Americans he did not have sexual relations ``with that 
woman, Miss Lewinsky,'' and telling a grand jury the answer to a 
question depended on ``what the meaning of is, is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to remind people this is Slick Willie you're looking  
at,'' Howard said.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Leg Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several million Americans with a painful leg  
condition that inhibits walking won their first new medicine in 15 
years Friday. But the government's approval of Pletal came amid 
criticism that the drug may endanger certain heart patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Pletal is for intermittent claudication, a condition named for  
the Latin word for limping. It occurs in people, mostly the 
elderly, who have poor blood circulation in their legs. 
</P>
<P>
	The cholesterol that clogs up heart arteries to cause heart  
attacks also can block leg arteries, causing peripheral vascular 
disease. Intermittent claudication is a top symptom: Patients walk 
for a few minutes and then suddenly feel debilitating pain, 
cramping, numbness or severe fatigue in their leg muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise, however, is considered the best treatment. Studies  
show exercise programs that make patients walk 30 minutes to an 
hour a day can significantly increase the time that patients spend 
on their feet without pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved Pletal, known  
chemically as cilostazol, based on studies that showed adding the 
prescription-only drug to exercise for six months could increase 
patients' walking distance by about two or three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``To healthy people, this may not seem significant, but to this  
patient population, it could mean the difference between being 
homebound and actively living,'' said Dr. Gary Ingenito of 
manufacturer Otsuka America Pharmaceutical Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the studies, most patients had difficulty  
walking half a block -- or 150 feet -- without pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can only walk a block, then being able to walk a couple  
more blocks is a really big improvement and might change your 
quality of life,'' agreed Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's 
Center for Drug Evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	But patients with heart failure -- a fairly frequent co-disease  
among people with poor leg circulation -- should never take Pletal, 
the FDA warned. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Pletal is part of a class of drugs called  
phosphodiesterase inhibitors that can increase the risk of sudden 
death when taken by people with heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies of Pletal were too small and too short to tell whether  
it had any effect on mortality, Woodcock said. But patients with 
any degree of heart failure should not take the drug because of the 
known danger of similar medicines. Brochures given to every patient 
will stress that warning. 
</P>
<P>
	But few doctors have the time to read FDA's warnings anymore,  
meaning heart failure patients may wind up taking Pletal, said Dr. 
Lemuel Moye of the University of Texas, Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, some Pletal patients in the clinical trials  
experienced unexpected side effects of irregular heartbeats and a 
slightly increased heart rate. The FDA had asked its cardiac 
advisers whether this signaled a problem that should be studied 
further, and they ultimately voted 7-3 that the agency should 
approve Pletal. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``if it were my sister or my mother, I'd say to wait a  
year'' before trying Pletal to see if the concerns are real, said 
Moye, an FDA adviser who opposed Pletal. ``That's a terrible 
recommendation to have to make, but the haste with which these 
drugs are approved demands that physicians and patients be 
ultra-careful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pletal's main side effects were headache, heart palpitations and  
diarrhea, Woodcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Claudication patients also take blood-thinning drugs. Pletal has  
blood-thinning properties, too, but did not appear to cause 
bleeding problems when used together with aspirin. The FDA, 
however, warned that no one knows if it's safe when used together 
with a new blood-thinner called Clopidogril that many claudication 
patients may begin using. It ordered Otsuka to continue studying 
that, as well as whether Pletal has any effect on the number of 
patient deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Otsuka said Pletal will be on pharmacy shelves within two  
months. A price has not been set.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Officially Make Floyd Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Tim Floyd can finally ditch those  
business cards with ``director of basketball operations'' on them 
and break out the real ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months after he arrived in Chicago, the Bulls dropped the  
``in-waiting'' tag Friday and officially made Floyd their coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a daunting task,'' he admitted. ``I'm  
standing here in front of six trophies, you've got a hall of fame 
coach that you're replacing and the best basketball player in the 
world left your team two days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``So if anybody wants to trade positions, come on,'' he added,  
drawing laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	It'd be hard to find a job tougher than the one the former Iowa  
State coach is inheriting. Michael Jordan retired two days ago, 
Scottie Pippen is as good as gone and last season's championship 
team is all but dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have just four players under contract -- Ron Harper,  
Toni Kukoc, Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- with Harper the only 
starter. That's not even enough to hold a real practice when 
training camp opens next week. 
</P>
<P>
	And if that's not bad enough, the Bulls' first exhibition game  
is against the Indiana Pacers, the same team that took them to 
seven games in the Eastern Conference finals last year and has been 
practicing together all fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do recognize the tradition and I recognize what's at stake,  
and I know there's a great deal at stake,'' he said. ``But I'm 
looking forward to this task. This is an incredible opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old Floyd has no NBA experience, but he does have a  
solid record as a college coach. Still, his appointment hardly came 
as a surprise. He'd been rumored to be Jackson's successor for the 
past two seasons -- long before Jackson got on his Harley-Davidson 
and roared off last June after the Bulls won their sixth 
championship of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd joined the Bulls in July, but the team made him director  
of basketball operations because Jordan swore he wouldn't play for 
anyone but Jackson. Floyd would be the Bulls' next coach, chairman 
Jerry Reinsdorf promised at the time, but only if Jackson turned 
the job down again when the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson did say no, but Reinsdorf held off a little longer so he  
could talk to Jordan. Jordan announced his retirement Wednesday, 
clearing the way for Floyd's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's stepping into the fire and he knows it,'' said Steve  
Kerr, one of Chicago's many free agents. ``He's the coach who comes 
in when Michael Jordan leaves. I don't envy him. He's got a tough 
job ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd said he's not worried about being seen as ``the coach who  
ran Michael Jordan out of basketball.'' Jordan himself said he 
didn't have the mental energy needed to play, and that even Jackson 
might not have been able to motivate him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would much preferred having a Michael Jordan on my team as a  
coach,'' Floyd said. ``(But) somebody was going to have to be 
standing here today and moving into this position. I'm glad it's 
me. I'm looking forward to trying to carry on the Bulls' way of 
doing things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with who? Bulls general manager Jerry Krause is trying to  
work out sign-and-trade deals for Pippen, Dennis Rodman and Luc 
Longley, sources told The Associated Press. Kerr still hasn't 
received an offer and doesn't expect one. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a possibility some of the other Bulls might be back, but  
no one's counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious that no matter what happens, we're not all going  
to be back, so we've gotten together a little bit and sort of 
recognized the fact that it's the end of something,'' Longley said. 
``And also thought about how great it's been. It has been. It's 
been a blast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Floyd hopes that will continue.  
</P>
<P>
	``The same goal will remain in place, and that's to win a  
championship at some point,'' he said. ``Whether it's a patchwork 
type of situation or whether it's a long-term process still remains 
to be seen. You just hope you can have a little fun along the way 
with that journey, regardless of what it is.''

<HEADLINE> What Senate Jurors Are Saying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In their role as jurors in President Clinton's  
impeachment trial, senators are supposed to be impartial and 
silent, but there isn't one who hasn't had something to say about 
the possibility of throwing the president out of office. 
</P>
<P>
	Not one has gone so far as to say, ``I shall vote to convict the  
president.'' And only a few have said they absolutely will not vote 
to evict the president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a state-by-state rundown of some of what each senator has  
had to say. 
</P>
<P>
	ALABAMA   	
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Sessions, R: Says censure of Clinton would be legal, but  
asks: ``What more censure can you have than impeachment?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Shelby, R: Would vote to convict if convinced that the  
charges were true, but the burden of proof ``ought to be very 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ALASKA   	
</P>
<P>
	Frank Murkowski, R: ``The Senate in a sense is on trial itself  
... in spite of our political differences, we can come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Stevens, R: Concedes there probably aren't the 67 votes  
needed to convict, ``but surprises can develop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ARIZONA   	
</P>
<P>
	Jon Kyl, R: Has no doubts that Clinton's actions were  
impeachable offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	John McCain, R: Of censure, says ``it sounds like a great idea  
until you get into the specifics ... it's a lot more complicated 
than it sounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ARKANSAS   	
</P>
<P>
	Tim Hutchinson, R: Calls the trial ``very serious, very sad and  
I hope history will look back and say we acquitted ourselves in a 
way that brought honor to this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blanche Lambert Lincoln, D: ``It's very unfortunate that this is  
our first action (in the 106th Congress) and yet there is some 
assurance that we offer to the people of this nation that our 
government is equipped to deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CALIFORNIA   	
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Boxer, D: Claims ``in no way is this a jury. ...In a  
jury, not one of us would ever be seated. We all have opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dianne Feinstein, D: ``Impeachment is not meant to be  
punishment. Impeachment is meant to remove a threat to the nation's 
well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	COLORADO   	
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Allard, R: Of putting Clinton on the witness stand, says  
``I would say that it was probably a very risky thing for him to do 
to get down there and be the witness directly before the Senate, 
and to have the prosecutors have a direct shot at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R: Thinks that Clinton should resign,  
``the only way to get out of all this cannibalism and 
bloodletting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CONNECTICUT

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Economic Woes Cast Shadow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Brazil's move to shore up its  
economy by devaluing the currency has left economies from Mexico to 
Argentina bracing for aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7.6 percent devaluation came as a sobering reminder that the  
1997 global economic crisis remains a threat, and raised fears the 
region would be dragged into a recession this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts warned that Latin America could again be facing dire  
economic conditions: a drop in currency values, the contraction of 
its economies and jittery investors eager to pull money out of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Brazil sneezes, the rest of Latin America catches a  
cold,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in 
Minneapolis. ``If this gets out of control all of Latin America 
could suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch's chief economist, Bruce Steinberg, said: ``Most  
of Latin America will now fall into recession and there could be 
spillover effects into other markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No country worries more about Brazil's economic ills than its  
southern neighbor, Argentina, one of the world's model emerging 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazil's devaluation has reignited Argentina's concern.  
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil controls whether things go well or bad,'' said  
Argentine economist Mario Vicens. 
</P>
<P>
	As an indication of that link, Argentine stocks tumbled 10  
percent Wednesday following the announcement that the Brazilian 
real was devalued. Stocks continued to falter Thursday, closing 
down 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries' economies are intertwined through the  
Mercosur trading bloc, which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay. 
Nearly 30 percent of Argentine exports go its giant northern 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	American cars made in Argentina are sent to Brazil. Many of the  
dairy products coming from the vast Argentine Pampas go north to 
Brazil. So do oil products. 
</P>
<P>
	A continued drop in Brazil's currency would make those products  
more expensive. And another plunge in the Brazilian real would 
increase Argentina's deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentine President Carlos Menem insisted the Brazilian crisis  
would not force a devaluation of the Argentine peso, now pegged to 
the dollar in a move considered key to the country's remarkable 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Although other Latin American countries are not as closely  
linked to Brazil, the consequences of persisting economic woes 
there have many worried, particularly the smaller economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru has already slipped into a recession, and should the  
troubles in Brazil draw out, it would exacerbate an already severe 
debt crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are anxiously waiting to see how the exchange rate will  
react. Who doesn't owe money in dollars here?'' said Peruvian 
journalist Igancio Brasombrio. 
</P>
<P>
	A continued devaluation of Brazil's currency would threaten the  
stability of Venezuela's money, the bolivar, which many analysts 
already believe is overvalued and in need of adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mexico, considered the most stable of the Latin American  
economies because of its close U.S. trade tries, would not emerge 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	Should foreign investors continue to withdraw their money from  
Brazil, it would also dampen Mexico's economic health. Many 
investors hold Brazilian and Mexican stocks in the same portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the concern of a burgeoning crisis, officials throughout  
South America rushed Thursday to calm rising fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Massad, Chile's Central Bank president, said his country  
was prepared if the crisis requires more belt-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our economy is a position of great strength and we are in  
excellent position to face any effects of the Brazilian crisis,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Mexico Governor Guillermo Ortiz was equally optimistic,  
telling a local radio station he hopes Brazil's troubles don't last 
to avoid ``a major impact.''

<HEADLINE> Senator Urges Changes in IRAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People would have more alternatives to Social  
Security through a new type of 401(k) plan under a proposal by the 
Senate sponsor of the popular Roth IRA. He also wants to increase 
contribution limits for individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should expand the opportunity to save,'' Sen. William Roth,  
R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Friday. 
``Social Security is very important for a vast majority of 
Americans, but it does not provide the wherewithal to have an 
adequate retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress and President Clinton debate how to ensure Social  
Security remains solvent -- an agreement on reform is far from 
certain -- lawmakers are examining dozens of options to enable more 
people to guarantee their own retirement incomes using individual 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people think there can and should be some other things  
done even if Social Security reform can't be decided upon,'' said 
Evan Liddiard of the KPMG Peat Marwick accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Foremost among the Roth bill's provisions would be a ``Roth  
401(k)'' plan that would differ from regular 401(k) plans in a 
crucial way: The earnings on contributions -- while made on an 
after-tax basis -- would be tax-free when they are distributed, much 
like the Roth IRA. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key component would increase the maximum contribution  
limit for a traditional IRA from $2,000 to $5,000. As part of a 
catch-up provision for older people, workers 50 and up could 
contribute up to $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules for a Roth IRA would also change. The income limit on  
people wishing to convert a traditional IRA to a Roth would rise 
from $100,000 to $1 million and all income limits would be 
eliminated for people wishing to make a full annual contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would make these other changes:  
</P>
<P>
	--The maximum pretax contribution to a regular 401(k) plan would  
increase from $10,000 to $15,000; those 50 and older could 
contribute as much as $22,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	--For people who are active in a workplace pension plan, the  
amount they can contribute to traditional IRAs is limited by the 
amount they earn. Roth's bill would end all income limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats would likely be cool to some of these ideas because  
they tend to benefit more people earning middle and upper incomes. 
Clint Stretch, director of tax and legislative affairs for the 
Deloitte &AMP; Touche accounting firm, said raising limits for IRA 
contributions won't help those who can't afford to save so much. 
</P>
<P>
	``The spin will be that it's targeted to the upper-income  
people,'' Stretch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth, however, noted that millions of people with modest incomes  
have IRAs today and said he is proposing separate legislation that 
would use some of the projected federal budget surplus to create 
five-year ``personal retirement accounts'' for an estimated 128 
million Americans in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Each eligible worker would get a minimum of $250 per year out of  
the surplus and have choices to make on how that money might be 
invested. Such accounts could be a precursor to permanent 
individual retirement accounts that would complement Social 
Security.

<HEADLINE> Fannie Mae Offers New Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First came smaller down payments, enabling  
more people to buy a home. But there was a catch: the borrowers had 
to pay more in home mortgage insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Now mortgage giant Fannie Mae is offering both lower down  
payments and lower insurance costs, by providing new options that 
will make mortgage insurance cheaper for homebuyers who cannot 
afford big down payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The new insurance options will save homebuyers who make small  
down payments $1,100 to $2,250 over the first 10 years of a 
30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, according to Fannie Mae, a 
congressionally chartered, publicly traded company that buys 
mortgages from original lenders such as banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae retains some of the mortgages in its portfolio and  
packages others into securities for resale to investors. The 
company reported Thursday that its profits rose to a record $3.4 
billion last year from $3.05 billion in 1997, boosted by continued 
growth in its mortgage business. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Raines, Fannie Mae's new chairman and chief executive  
officer, was announcing the mortgage insurance plan today at the 
National Association of Home Builders' annual meeting in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can cut costs to consumers, qualify more homebuyers, and  
give them more home for their mortgage-payment dollar by reducing 
their mortgage insurance costs,'' Raines said in a statement. 
``Eventually, we hope all low down payment borrowers will benefit 
from new approaches to mortgage insurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new options will be available nationwide in early March from  
some 700 mortgage lenders nationwide that use Fannie Mae's 
``desktop underwriter'' computer software. About 150,000 borrowers, 
most of them first-time homebuyers, are expected to take advantage 
of the options over the next year or so. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, Fannie Mae launched nationwide a new type of  
mortgage with a small down payment -- as low as 3 percent -- and 
flexibility regarding the source of that money. The new mortgage, 
previously available only in limited areas of the country, was 
designed to help people with very good credit histories but little 
savings who have been unable to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch: Homebuyers making the smaller down payments had to  
pay more in mortgage insurance to protect lenders against losses 
from defaults. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave millions of Americans the chance to buy a home by  
lowering down payments, but requiring more mortgage insurance,'' 
Raines said. ``Now we can offer homebuyers the best of both worlds 
-- lower down payments and lower mortgage insurance costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anger over the cost of home mortgage insurance led Congress last  
summer to enact legislation that automatically eliminates the 
insurance requirement when a homeowner has 22 percent equity in his 
or her home. A homeowner with a good payment record, and whose home 
has not depreciated below the purchase price, may ask that the 
insurance be canceled upon reaching 20 percent of equity. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae said the new insurance options were made possible by  
the use of its ``desktop underwriter'' computer software and a new 
strategy for reducing losses from mortgage defaults. 
</P>
<P>
	They include:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Across-the-board reductions in required insurance on 30-year,  
fixed-rate mortgages to the levels that prevailed in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Fannie Mae requires that homebuyers getting mortgage  
loans with only a 5 percent down payment buy insurance covering 30 
percent of the loan's value. Under the change, this will be reduced 
to 25 percent, the level required in 1994. Required insurance 
coverage for a mortgage with a 10 percent down payment will be cut 
from 25 percent to 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An option that reduces mortgage insurance costs even further,  
when combined with an additional payment. 
</P>
<P>
	For a loan with a 5 percent down payment, the required insurance  
coverage will be 18 percent of the loan's value; for a mortgage 
with 10 percent down, the insurance requirement will be 12 percent 
of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	To get these reductions, a homebuyer will have to make a payment  
of points or a higher note rate. If paid in points, the cost would 
be about $750 on a $100,000 mortgage with 5 percent down, and $375 
on $100,000 with 10 percent down. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the note rate for a $100,000 mortgage would be  
0.15 percent for a 5 percent down payment, or 0.08 percent for 10 
percent down -- making the rate 7.15 percent or 7.08 percent, 
compared with 7 percent for the same mortgage without this option. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	Consumers seeking more information can call Fannie Mae's  
consumer resource center at 1-800-7-FANNIE between 9 a.m. and 5 
p.m. EST. The service normally is available Monday through Friday, 
but will be open on Saturday, Jan. 16, and closed on Monday, Jan. 
18 for the federal holiday.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is ahead 55 points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 3-2 lead over 
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 15 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index

<P>
	After four straight declines, Wall Street finally may have a  
reason to celebrate this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has allowed its battered currency to float freely on  
foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The move marks a significant reversal for Brazil, after attempts  
to keep the real at artificially high levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Brazilian government has come under fire both at home  
and abroad, by those who say support for the currency is costing 
too much money. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. equity investors are expected to welcome the news from

</P>
<P>
	Still, it's anybody's guess whether the early momentum will be  
maintained throughout the session.

<P>
	FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) -- A US Airways flight diverted to Fort  
Wayne on Friday after passengers complained of a strong odor in the 
cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people were treated and released from a hospital for chest  
pains and troubled breathing. Another 17 sought medical attention 
on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 1177 was going from Baltimore to Chicago when some of the  
88 passengers and crew of five noticed the odor, said US Airways 
spokesman David Castelveter. Crews were trying to identify a cause, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alice Robinson of Lutheran Hospital said the seven passengers  
suffered from chemical inhalation. Hospital officials weren't sure 
what they had inhaled but nothing suggested it was toxic, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger Al Taujemas said the fumes made him a ``little  
spacey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little short of breath and luckily I had some, an  
inhaler, in my pocket,'' he said. ``The oxygen helped a little bit 
but I still sort of don't know where I live at too much.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 138.77 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were higher today, bouncing back from  
four days of losses, as investors cheered Brazil's plan to stop 
defending its troubled currency. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 138.77 at 9,259.70. Broad-market indexes were sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent economic troubles in Brazil have raised fears among  
investors that profits of U.S. companies operating in Latin America 
could suffer. The Dow lost more than 353 points in the last two 
days of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wall Street was pleased with Brazil's decision to stop  
spending heavily to prop up its battered currency, the real. The 
move is seen as a way for Brazil to attract foreign investment and 
hold on to its currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian currency fell nearly 15 percent against the U.S.  
dollar, but the main stock market in Sao Paolo -- Latin America's 
largest exchange -- soared more than 27 percent today, after 
plunging the last six sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is the biggest and most important economy in Latin  
America, which accounts for 20 percent of U.S. exports. Investors 
worry that its problems will spread throughout the region, 
specifically to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think there's recognition that it isn't quite as bad as  
Asia, that it doesn't necessarily have to reverberate around the 
globe,'' said Peter Anderson, chief investment strategist at 
American Express Financial Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We survived Asia very well, because the Federal Reserve  
reduced interest rates, and in fact that's what pulled the market 
up in the final quarter of last year,'' he said. ``I think people 
increasingly recognize that these kinds of dilemmas, as long as 
they don't spread, can actually be constructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gains in U.S. trading helped lift European stocks from  
midday losses. Germany's DAX index closed up 1.4 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 rose 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In overnight trading, Asian stock markets were mostly higher.  
</P>
<P>
	Leading the gains on Wall Street were financial services stocks.  
American Express was up 4 11/16 at 100 11/16, Merrill Lynch gained 
3 1/4 at 70 3/8 and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose 2 11/16 to 83 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 11 to 5 on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 529.55 million shares, 
off slightly from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 20.00 at 1,232.19, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was up 46.31 at 2,323.13. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 8.54 at 589.61, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 6.45 at 704.61.

<HEADLINE> IOC Calls Special Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Threatened by a growing bribery  
scandal, the International Olympic Committee plans to hold an 
emergency assembly in March to vote on expelling corrupt members. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch announced Friday that he  
was convening an extraordinary session of the committee's 115 
members for March 17-18 in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC will also look into tightening procedures for selecting  
host cities of the Winter and Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always said that we want to get to the bottom of this  
matter, and to act swiftly'' said IOC director-general Francois 
Carrard. ``This is a decision which goes in that direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said ``about half'' the 13 members under investigation  
for alleged misdemeanors during Salt Lake City's winning bid for 
the 2002 Winter Games have replied to a letter from Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to identify them or offer details about the letters.  
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch told The Associated Press on Thursday that nine  
members are accused of ``serious'' offenses that could result in 
expulsion, and that four are cited for minor violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The members are entitled to appear in person to defend  
themselves before the six-man IOC commission investigating the Salt 
Lake case. The panel meets Jan. 23 to conclude its findings before 
making recommendations to the executive board the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Recommendations to expel members would go to the full assembly,  
where a two-thirds majority vote is required for expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision to exclude a member of the IOC is a matter of the  
utmost gravity,'' Carrard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, LeRoy T. Walker, president of the U.S. Olympic  
Committee in 1995, when the games were awarded to Salt Lake City, 
told The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh, N.C., that the entire Olympic 
movement is being jeopardized by the scandal. He called it, ``The 
worst threat to the Olympics in my lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Globe and Mail of Toronto reported that the husband of  
an IOC member from Finland got a job from the Ontario government 
after a request from the group seeking to win the 1996 Summer Games 
for Toronto. USA Today said Bjarne Haggman, who later was divorced 
from Pirjo Haggman, worked for 20 months for the Ontario Ministry 
of Natural Resources, until Sept. 14, 1990 -- four days before 
Toronto lost out to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Four separate investigations are under way into allegations that  
IOC members or their relatives received cash payments, 
scholarships, jobs, free medical care, real estate deals, lavish 
gifts and other inducements from Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal has prompted Samaranch to suggest banning visits by  
IOC members to candidate cities, stripping the full assembly of the 
vote and leaving the selection to the executive board or other 
small ``electoral college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said visits by IOC members to bid cities aren't  
necessary because the committee already has a group of experts who 
inspect the sites and compile a report on the logistical and 
financial merits of each bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said another possibility is to reduce the field of  
candidates earlier to weed out cities with no realistic chance of 
staging the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always been concerned about the lavishly expensive  
campaigns by member cities in spite of our calls not to,'' he said. 
``We may want new procedures to filter earlier to spare cities 
which have no chance the cost of the campaigns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any new process should be in place before the 2006 Winter Games  
site is selected at the IOC session in Seoul, South Korea, next 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard confirmed that the IOC might introduce a code of ethics  
for its members in a bid to wipe out corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	But he stressed that the organization valued the independence of  
its members. 
</P>
<P>
	And he reiterated that Samaranch does not intend to resign and  
that he has the support of the IOC membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been leading the IOC over the most fantastic period of  
development in the last 19 years,'' Carrard said. ``He's determined 
to clean the house and see that future procedures are improved so 
that these kind of events don't repeat themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC has survived many difficult times in the world and is  
one of the few organizations to survive. The decisions taken in 
general by the IOC are recognized as good ones, including the 
awarding of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games to Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is determined to go on with the Games in 2002 in Salt  
Lake City,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Stocks Soar; Currency Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian currency tumbled and  
stock markets soared Friday as the government temporarily floated 
its currency, the real, in a new strategy to diffuse the global 
crisis hanging over Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	As euphoria raced through the markets, with investors seeing new  
bargains in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said the 
surprise action was necessary to save Brazil's foreign currency 
reserves and rebuild faith in plans to stabilize its shaken 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The devaluation will reduce the doubt in relation to our  
economy and create the conditions to lower interest rates,'' 
Cardoso said in a televised speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The turmoil in South America's largest economy had raised fears  
that it would spread across the continent and even to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	After Brazil's Central Bank announced Friday that it would not  
prop up the currency's value by spending its reserves to buy reals, 
the currency plunged as low as 1.60 to the U.S. dollar before 
strengthening to 1.43 at the close of trading. That figure was 
nearly 8 percent below Thursday's close of 1.32 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the currency has fallen more than 15 percent since  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange -- Latin America's largest --  
skyrocketed as Brazilian shares suddenly became cheaper for foreign 
investors. After dropping 5 percent at the beginning of the 
session, the market closed up 33.3 percent Friday -- the second 
highest rise in the exchange's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices at the smaller Rio de Janeiro exchange closed up 30  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average turned around  
after four straight days of losses to close up 219 points at 
9,340.55. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index closed 71.38 
points higher at 2,348.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts are looking now for the Central Bank to reduce  
high interest rates of around 29 percent that have worsened the 
recession and the government deficit, as the next stage in efforts 
to repair the battering Brazil's economy has taken since August. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cardoso warned that interest rates could only be lowered if  
his austerity package is quickly approved and called on Congress to 
put aside ``personal and even party differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Pedro Malan and new Central Bank chief  
Francisco Lopes were to fly to Washington on Friday night to 
discuss the new policy. They were expected to meet with officials 
from the Clinton administration and the International Monetary 
Fund, which in November put together a $41.5 billion aid package 
for Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank statement was brief Friday, saying it would  
``not intervene in foreign exchange markets today'' and it would 
announced a new stance on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the exchange rate shot through the ceiling, we thought  
it better to let the market act freely to find its own balance,'' 
Malan told reporters in Brasilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The move effectively floated the real -- if only for one day -- a  
more dramatic step after the Central Bank tried a smaller 
devaluation of 8 percent on Wednesday. The bank made that 
devaluation by extending the band in which the currency can trade 
to between 1.20 reals and 1.32 reals to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank usually enforces the bands by intervening in  
the foreign exchange markets to sell its reserves of dollars to 
bolster the currency's value. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move to calm the waters, Claudio Mauch, the Central  
Bank's director for financial system supervision, said Friday he 
would stay on in his post. His abrupt resignation a day earlier had 
caused further market turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis hit Brazil full force in August,  
when investors pulled money out in fear that the government 
couldn't cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on 
loans. Since then, more than $40 billion has left the country, 
dropping reserves to around $35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts cheered the Central Bank's move Friday, saying its  
earlier, more controlled devaluation had been smaller than what 
many economists thought necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Controlled devaluations never work when expectations are  
negative,'' said Carlos Langoni, a former Central Bank president. 
With Friday's step, ``the government is taking a more realistic 
attitude toward foreign exchange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cheaper real will make Brazilian goods cheaper for foreign  
buyers, while other countries will have more trouble placing their 
products on the market here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely happy,'' said Synesio da Costa Batista,  
president of the Toy Manufacturers Association. ``We will be able 
to raise production by 10 percent this year, produce 220 million 
toys and create 2,000 new jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil must now review forecasts of record 12 percent  
unemployment in 1999 and economic retraction of 1 percent or more. 
But inflation, less than 2 percent this year, also is likely to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some analysts warn that the currency move will be in vain  
unless the government delivers on promises to trim the deficit this 
year by about $19.3 billion.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Turn Mostly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets turned mostly higher today,  
rebounding from broad early losses as traders decided Wall Street's 
plunge and Brazil's unfolding economic crisis were less of a worry 
than they first thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips tumbled by 1.9 percent from the outset in Hong Kong,  
Asia's second-largest market after Tokyo, but gained back most of 
that ground by the end of trading. The Hang Seng Index finished 
with a loss of just 35.73 points, or 0.4 percent, at 10,147.40. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in this region seem not too worried about Brazil now,''  
said Percy Au-Young, sales director at DBS Securities (Hong Kong) 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore dealings got off to a spooky start as a human error  
briefly had investors thinking blue chips had fallen by an alarming 
5.5 percent. But the incorrect data entry for a bank stock trade 
was fixed within minutes, and the Straits Times Index soon 
recovered from its losses and bounced into positive territory. The 
index closed with a gain of 1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Taipei shares overcame early losses to finish with a 3.4 percent  
gain by the blue chips as the government began buying shares to 
stem a four-day decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some small markets that stayed in the red, such as Manila  
and Jakarta, narrowed their losses dramatically by the end of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed today for a holiday. But on  
Thursday, Tokyo blue chips had bucked the negative trend and 
finished higher despite all the Brazilian worries. That resilience 
in Tokyo helped boost optimism elsewhere in the region today, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil started a worldwide market decline on Wednesday after its  
central bank chief resigned and his successor devalued the 
Brazilian currency, the real, by 7.6 percent. On Thursday the 
Central Bank's director of the banking industry resigned. 
</P>

	After falling 5 percent on Wednesday, Brazil's Sao Paulo stock  
exchange fell nearly 10 percent Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Reno Rejects Clinton Campaign Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite House Republican allegations, the  
Justice Department says there is no ``specific and credible 
information'' that President Clinton's former campaign manager 
received an illegal $1 million payment in connection with a 
controversial office building development. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno announced Thursday that she was  
ending the investigation into lawyer and lobbyist Peter Knight, a 
former top aide to Vice President Al Gore who ran Clinton's 
re-election campaign in 1996. The decision means that no 
independent counsel will explore Knight's financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight received $1 million from Tennessee developer Franklin  
Haney shortly before becoming Clinton's campaign manager. 
Republicans on the House Commerce Committee issued a report last 
month questioning whether the money was an illegal contingency fee 
for helping get the Federal Communications Commission to move to 
Haney's Portals development in Southwest Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney and Knight both have said the $1 million payment  
represented legal fees for Knight's work on several Haney projects 
over a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Republicans criticized Reno's decision Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The legal burden is on the attorney general to show why the  
evidence contained in the report is not specific and credible,'' 
the committee said in a statement. ``The Justice Department's 
cursory response utterly fails to meet this legal obligation. We 
expect a full explanation of this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Assistant Attorney General Dennis Burke said in a letter  
to the committee chairman, Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr., R-Va., that the 
allegations against Knight were investigated as part of a Justice 
Department campaign task force's probe of Haney. 
</P>
<P>
	``The task force concluded that the evidence does not support  
the report's view that Mr. Haney's payment to Mr. Knight was a 
contingency fee,'' Burke wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the task force's investigation, Haney, a longtime  
supporter of Gore, was indicted last month on 42 counts alleging he 
made illegal donations to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign and to two 
senatorial candidates.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Convicted of Valentine Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Md. (AP) -- A nurse was convicted Friday of killing her  
husband after prosecutors told jurors she poisoned him during a 
Valentine's weekend murder-mystery retreat than set their hotel 
room on fire to cover up the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated only a few hours before finding Kimberly  
Hricko guilty of first-degree murder and first-degree arson. She 
faces life in prison for the death of Stephen Hricko. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged that Mrs. Hricko, a 33-year-old surgical  
technician, confided in friends and co-workers before the death 
that she was bitterly unhappy in her nine-year marriage and longed 
to get rid of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Mrs. Hricko stood to collect $400,000 from life  
insurance policies taken out on her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	During closing arguments Friday, prosecutor Robert Dean detailed  
Mrs. Hricko's ``coldblooded and sinister'' plot to kill her husband 
by injecting him with the powerful drug succinylcholine chloride to 
stop his breathing. Then, he said, she set fire to the hotel suite 
they shared at an Eastern Shore resort hours after the couple 
watched a Valentine's Day murder-mystery play on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The whodunit onstage portrayed a groom sipping poisoned  
champagne who drops dead during a toast and the audience tries to 
solve the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	A state medical examiner concluded Hricko was probably poisoned  
with succinylcholine chloride, commonly used in surgery to help 
doctors administer breathing tubes and relax patients' muscles. It 
paralyzes the diaphragm and stops the subject's breathing, 
producing fatal brain damage within four minutes if the subject 
doesn't receive help to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Dr. David Fowler told the jury  
that Hricko, a 35-year-old golf course superintendent, was probably 
injected with a fatal dose of the drug, but acknowledged that it 
wasn't found in his system. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler said the drug is processed rapidly by the body and can be  
undetectable in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler said his autopsy ruled out every other cause of death,  
including heart attack, drug or alcohol overdose, a lethal buildup 
of pesticides or carbon monoxide that he might have inhaled from 
the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys argued that Hricko drank heavily the night he  
died and may have accidentally set his bedspread on fire. They also 
theorized that Hricko committed suicide, though they never said how 
he might have killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	During three days of prosecution testimony, several friends and  
former co-workers of Mrs. Hricko said she complained in late 1997 
and early 1998 that she was unhappy in her marriage, had begun an 
affair with a younger man and wanted her husband killed.

<HEADLINE> Browns Not Naming Expansion Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Before he left town on a scouting trip, Browns  
director of football operations Dwight Clark made his boss make a 
promise -- to keep his mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
	For Carmen Policy, that can be a hard thing to do.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland received a list of 130 players Friday from the NFL the  
Browns will be able to choose from in next month's expansion draft. 
The list includes eight Pro Bowlers, nine former first-round draft 
picks and at least one future Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
	There must be at least a few of them appealing to the Browns,  
right, Carmen? 
</P>
<P>
	``I promised on the life of my firstborn that I wouldn't say a  
word about anybody on the list,'' Policy said. ``And Dwight said, 
`Now, are you sure you understand what I'm saying, you can't even 
hint?' And I said, `Right, Dwight, I promise, I won't.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week the 26 teams not currently playing football  
were required to submit their lists of the five players they would 
make available to the Browns for the Feb. 9 expansion draft in 
Canton. 
</P>
<P>
	The four teams involved in this weekend's conference  
championship games will file their lists once their seasons are 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the names began trickling out before Friday, when the  
league released its official list to the Browns. Among the notable 
names: 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago linebacker Andre Collins; Cincinnati linebacker James  
Francis; Dallas fullback Daryl Johnston; Green Bay wide receiver 
Robert Brooks, kick returner Roell Preston, and defensive tackle 
Reggie White, who is planning to retire; Kansas City offensive 
tackle Jeff Criswell; New England running back Sedrick Shaw; New 
Orleans QB Heath Shuler and wideout Qadry Ismail; Oakland wide 
receiver Desmond Howard; Philadelphia wide receiver Jeff Graham; 
St. Louis center John Flannery; Seattle center Kevin Glover; Tampa 
Bay defensive tackle Marcus Jones; and Washington running back 
Terry Allen, quarterback Gus Frerotte and defensive back Cris 
Dishman, all former Pro Bowlers. 
</P>
<P>
	The list also includes several former Browns, including  
Baltimore wide receiver Michael Jackson and defensive back Stevon 
Moore, San Francisco defensive back Antonio Langham and center 
Randy Kirk, and San Diego tight end Frank Hartley. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who was in California for the East-West Shrine Bowl, said  
in a statement the Browns would not comment on any of the players 
``until we have an opportunity to properly and extensively evaluate 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Browns, who have already signed 14 free agents, can  
select 30-42 players in the expansion draft, and under provisions 
set up by the league, Cleveland must use up 38 percent of its 
projected $60 million salary cap on such players. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Browns select a player, a team can pull back one of its  
unprotected players. And after a second player is picked, a team 
can pull back both of its remaining players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns inherit the salary of any draftee, making the size of  
his contract as important as his ability or stature. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said who the Browns take in the expansion draft would  
have little bearing on their selections in the early rounds of 
April's college draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might come in and start affecting picks four and later,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Playwright Snubs Oxford Degree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Playwright Alan Bennett says he turned down an  
honorary degree from Oxford to protest the university's acceptance 
of money from that ``bully'' Rupert Murdoch. 
</P>
<P>
	In his diary of 1998, published in the London Review of Books,  
Bennett said he was offered the honor in November. He said he 
refused it because he believed Oxford was wrong in 1992 to accept 
about $5 million from Murdoch to endow a chair in language and 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch is probably best known in Britain as the owner of The  
Sun, the biggest-selling tabloid newspaper. Like Bennett, the media 
mogul is an Oxford graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware of the arguments about bad money being put to good  
uses, but I still think that Murdoch's is not a name with which 
Oxford should have associated itself,'' wrote Bennett, the author 
of ``Habeas Corpus'' and ``The Madness of George III.'' ``Murdoch 
is a bully and should be stood up to publicly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News International, the British subsidiary of Murdoch's News  
Corp., had no comment.

<HEADLINE> GOP Prosecutor: Believe Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling Monica Lewinsky a ``very credible''  
witness, a House prosecutor told senators in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial today that the former White House intern's 
testimony establishes that Clinton ``knowingly, intentionally'' 
sought to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, you cannot  
believe the president or accept the argument of his lawyers,'' Rep. 
Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said in a summary of evidence on behalf of 
the 13 House prosecutors on the second day of their presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum encouraged the senators to view the case against  
Clinton as ``one big obstruction'' in which the president ``thought 
his scheme out well'' in an effort to conceal his affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky from the court overseeing the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe the sworn testimony of Monica Lewinsky, if you  
believe her testimony that's in the record -- and she's very 
credible -- the president knowingly, intentionally and willfully set 
out on a course of conduct in December 1997 to lie to the Jones 
court, to hide his relationship and to encourage others to lie and 
hide evidence,'' McCollum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott confirmed today that there  
would be no postponement of next Tuesday's session, which is to 
conclude just before Clinton gives his State of the Union address. 
Across the Capitol, Speaker Dennis Hastert explained the decision 
in a letter to House members. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule would kept ``out of respect for the office of the  
presidency and for a desire to hear about the state of our 
nation,'' Hastert said. Some Republicans had suggested the speech 
be canceled, while Democrats had urged that the trial be postponed 
for a day to avoid an awkward juxtaposition of the two events. 
</P>
<P>
	The second full day of the trial seemed to capture less of the  
nation's interest. Major television networks that carried the start 
of Thursday's session did not do so across the nation today. The 
Senate gallery, packed on Thursday, was three-quarters full. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators returned to the Capitol still mostly divided along  
party lines on the crucial issues of calling trial witnesses and 
whether Clinton should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the president  
wouldn't come to testify, and he called Republican suggestions that 
Clinton do so ``a non-issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the House  
prosecutors' case an ``effective presentation'' but added that so 
far he believes the case ``would not rise to the level that was 
thought to be the standard by our Founding Fathers'' for removing a 
president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the chamber there was much discussion of potential  
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in favor of having witnesses if they can shed light,''  
said Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a moderate Republican the 
White House has hoped would join Democrats in opposing the calling 
of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can do it in an effective way. Have them stick just  
to the narrow points. We don't want them wandering all over the 
place. We don't want an army of witnesses, but I think a few would 
be helpful,'' Chaffee said in an interview on CNN outside the 
Capitol just before the trial resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton addressed a reinventing government forum at the State  
Department before flying to New York City today to unveil a new 
economic initiative designed to encourage investment in underserved 
inner-city and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the president  
received a 10-15 minute ``rundown'' from his lawyers Thursday night 
on developments in the trial's first day. He attacked the case so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no testimony that proves the president committed  
perjury. There's no testimony that proves the president obstructed 
justice In fact there is direct testimony to the contrary,'' 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn, said his fellow House prosecutors would  
be interested in calling ``three to eight'' witnesses. ``It's the 
usual people. No surprises,'' he said. Among those that have been 
mentioned are Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and 
Oval Office secretary Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeatedly, McCollum called the case against the president and  
the conclusions his Republican colleagues had drawn ``common 
sense'' and ``logical.'' And he repeatedly attacked the president's 
likely defenses on the key events that the prosecutors say were 
acts of obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Focusing on the efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job, McCollum  
said the president's lawyers are likely to argue that she was 
``looking for a job in New York a long time before ... the 
president had reason'' to believe she would become a witness 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question about that,'' McCollum said. ``The  
question is whether or not the president intensified his efforts to 
get her a job and make sure she got one after it became clear to 
him that he would need her to lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum cited some of the more lurid details of Ms. Lewinsky's  
testimony about her sexual contacts with Clinton, each time arguing 
that her version of events was correct and that ``the evidence 
indicates that he (Clinton) lied.'' One time the lawmaker called 
Clinton's alleged perjury before a grand jury ``big time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., chided Democrats in a written statement for  
commenting on the substance of the case after Wednesday's session -- 
contending most Republicans followed his admonition to hold their 
political fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in  
two articles of impeachment approved Dec. 19 by the House along 
partisan lines. It takes a two-thirds vote in the Senate to remove 
the president from office, meaning a dozen Democrats would have to 
join the 55 Republicans to convict him.

<HEADLINE> Harvard-Russia Aid Funds Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two Harvard University staffers who took part in a  
federally funded program to establish capitalism in Russia are 
being investigated to determine if they profited from stock 
investments there at the same time, The Boston Globe reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei Shleifer, an economics professor, and lawyer Jonathan Hay  
both worked for the Harvard Institute for International 
Development, which was paid $43 million by the U.S. Agency for 
International Development (USAID) to advise Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and his economists. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators want to know if Shleifer and Hay violated  
federal law by profiting from investments made in Russia's stock 
market by Shleifer's wife and Hay's girlfriend, the Globe reported, 
citing anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	USAID's own investigation already concluded that Shleifer and  
Hay gained influence over Russian capital markets they were helping 
establish, and had ``abused the trust of the United States 
government by using personal relationships ... for private gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	USAID canceled its contract with the institute in 1997 and  
eliminated the final $14 million of a $57 million grant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard institute's rules prohibit employees or members of  
their families from investing in the country they are advising. 
</P>
<P>
	Shleifer and Hay, who were dismissed from the institute, have  
denied the allegations. Shleifer's wife, Nancy Zimmerman, and Hay's 
girlfriend, Elizabeth Hebert, denied any conflict of interest in 
their investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the allegations: that Hay invested in Russian government  
securities while advising the Yeltsin government on capital 
markets, and the he helped Hebert establish a Russian mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Hay is no longer associated with Harvard; Shleifer is still a  
professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Shleifer's lawyer, Earl Nemser, acknowledged that there is an  
investigation, but said he understands it does not involve his 
client.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Travolta fans may have forgotten he's a  
singer, a talent that will have him back in the spotlight in 
``Standing Room Only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta, who stars as a lawyer in ``A Civil Action,'' will take  
center stage portraying Jimmy Roselli, whose career took a hit 
after he got blacklisted by the mob around 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Travolta's first singing part since ``Grease'' in  
1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``People might forget that John has a wonderful voice, did all  
his singing in ``Grease,' and recently sang with Carly Simon on her 
album,'' said Travolta manager Jonathan Krane. ``He'll be the 
`Raging Bull' of lounge singers, but with the humor John brings to 
the role.''

<HEADLINE> Latin American Markets Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Stock markets across Latin America rose  
Friday as Brazil changed its policy and refused to prop up its 
faltering currency -- a move that restored investor confidence and 
provoked a flurry of bargain shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, as well as the International Monetary Fund, applauded  
Brazil's decision to end its short-lived currency crisis. The move 
made Brazilian stocks suddenly cheaper for foreign buyers, sparking 
a rally in Latin American debt and equity instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican stocks soared 7.8 percent Friday, the market's biggest  
gain since Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of a devaluation in Brazil had weighed on Mexican stocks  
since the beginning of last year and especially during the first 
two weeks of 1999. The market's key IPC index tumbled 16.6 percent 
during the first eight trading days of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's gains were ``a natural reaction'' to the removal of a  
cloud that has long hurt Mexican shares, said Francisco Rivero, 
director of research at Valores Finamex brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	In Venezuela, the main index of the Caracas stock exchange was  
up 1.5 percent Friday from Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chile, the Santiago Stock Exchange's 40-share selected index,  
known as IPSA, closed 2.74 percent up from Thursday's figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina's Merval Index bounced back on Friday, closing at  
382.37, a 12.3 percent increase from Thursday's closing price of 
340.61. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo market, Latin America's largest, soared to close  
up 33.3 percent -- the second highest rise in the exchange's 
history. Share prices at the smaller Rio de Janeiro exchange closed 
up 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average also rebounded, rising 219.62  
to close at 9,340.55. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian central bank revoked the real's foreign exchange  
trading band against the U.S. dollar and said it wouldn't intervene 
in the foreign exchange market Friday. The currency plunged as low 
as 1.60 to the U.S. dollar before strengthening slightly to 1.43 at 
the close of trading, still below the 1.32 at the close of trading 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers cautioned, however, that a sustained rebound in local  
share prices will depend on how emerging markets react to the 
Brazilian central bank's announcement of a new foreign exchange 
policy Monday.

<HEADLINE> Volvo Talks Of Merger With Scania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The Swedish auto and truck maker Volvo  
bought a 12.85 percent share in rival truck maker Scania and wants 
to discuss a merger of the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A combination of Volvo and Scania would create Europe's largest  
and the world's second largest manufacturer of heavy trucks and 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the main owner of Scania, Investor AB, believes the time is  
not right for a merger discussion and Volvo has no immediate plans 
to make a public offer for Scania shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Scania chief executive Leif Oestling told reporters at an auto  
conference in Brussels, Belgium, that he'd had no advance knowledge 
of Volvo's move and characterized it as ``close to hostile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement today came amid speculation that Volvo is  
looking to sell or merge its automobile division with a larger car 
company in order to concentrate on its heavy vehicles business. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo chief executive Leif Johansson would not comment today on  
recent reports that Volvo has engaged a U.S. investment bank to 
search for buyers for its car division. Ford, Fiat and Volkswagen 
all have been rumored to be interested in Volvo's automobile 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
		   Analysts said Friday that selling the car division would likely  
bring in about 40 billion kronor ($5 billion) which combined with 
Volvo's other assets would give it enough to purchase Scania, which 
would likely cost about 60 billion kronor ($7.5 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	A merger with Scania would create a manufacturer with strong  
brands, significant development resources and large volumes, Volvo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Volvo believes that Scania and Volvo are similar in  
terms of company culture and business values and ``these strengths 
would enhance the combined entity's ability to compete globally and 
to create significant shareholder value,'' the company said.

	GOP Prosecutor: Believe Lewinsky  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling Monica Lewinsky a ``very credible''  
witness, a House prosecutor told senators in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial today that the former White House intern's 
testimony establishes that he ``knowingly, intentionally'' sought 
to obstruct justice. Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., encouraged the 
senators to view the case against Clinton as ``one big 
obstruction'' in which the president ``thought his scheme out 
well'' in an effort to conceal his affair with Ms. Lewinsky from 
the court overseeing the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.

	Dow Ends Up 219.62  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rose aggressively today, bouncing  
back from four days of losses, as investors cheered Brazil's plan 
to stop defending its troubled currency. The Dow Jones industrial 
average ended up 219.62 points to close at 9,340.55, making back a 
good portion of the 353 points that it lost on Wednesday and 
yesterday. NYSE advancers led decliners 2,189-858. The Nasdaq was 
up 71.42 to 2,348.24.

	Brazilian Currency Tumbles

<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian currency tumbled  
sharply today after the Central Bank refused to prop up the 
faltering real in world financial markets. The abrupt move -- 
reversing the government's pledges -- was taken to try to halt the 
financial crisis that has engulfed Latin America's largest economy. 
The main stock market in Sao Paulo soared, as Brazilian shares 
suddenly became cheaper for foreign investors.

	ABC Union Lockout Ends  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC's lockout of 2,400 employees in five cities  
came to an end today. ``We're done. The lockout ends at 5 p.m.,'' 
said Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the National Association of 
Broadcast Employees and Technicians, declaring that union members 
would be returning to their jobs at ABC after 11 weeks on picket 
lines. These employees, who include camera operators, producers and 
other behind-the-scenes workers, will be back on the job within 72 
hours, ABC said. NABET members at the network, who had been without 
a contract since 1997, had been locked out since a one-day strike 
in November. A vote on the new offer is planned.

	Court Allows Daytrips for Hinckley  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A divided appeals court panel cleared the way  
today for would-be presidential assassin John W. Hinckley Jr. to 
make supervised daytrips away from the mental hospital where he has 
been confined for 18 years. The ruling by two judges said the 
decisions on such trips should not be decided by the court, but 
should be at the discretion of the doctors treating Hinckley at St. 
Elizabeths Hospital. He was confined to the hospital in 1982, a 
year after he tried to kill President Reagan.

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- At least 15 ethnic Albanian rebels  
were killed today in clashes with Serb forces in southern Kosovo, 
Serb sources reported today. Officials and eyewitnesses said 
Yugoslav army troops and tanks joined Serbian police in shelling 
and firing automatic weapons on villages south of Pristina. The 
Serb-run Media Center said Serb police confiscated large quantities 
of arms and drove off the KLA rebels. Two international monitors 
were shot and wounded elsewhere in the province.

	U.S. To Give Missile to Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, responding to a  
Turkish government request, has agreed to provide a Patriot missile 
battery as extra protection against a potential Iraqi attack, 
American officials said today. U.S. officials stressed there was no 
specific Iraqi threat against Turkey, but that Ankara's request was 
deemed reasonable in light of the recent ``no-fly'' zone 
confrontations. After four days of incidents in the ``no-fly'' 
zone, U.S. officials said there were none today.

	Snow, Freezing Rain Cover East

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Snow and freezing rain put a hard-shell finish  
on the East today, causing deadly highway accidents, backing up 
airline flights and knocking out power to nearly half a million 
people. The snow that blanketed the Northeast yesterday was topped 
by freezing rain today, creating a slick coating over much of the 
region during the morning rush hour. At least six people died in 
traffic accidents in West Virginia and Maryland that were blamed on 
ice.

</P>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
will hold an emergency assembly in March to vote on expelling 
members and tightening procedures for selecting host cities of the 
Winter and Summer Games. Nine members are accused of ``serious'' 
offenses that could result in expulsion, and four are cited for 
minor violations. Four separate investigations are under way into 
allegations that IOC members or their relatives received cash 
payments, scholarships, jobs, free medical care, real estate deals, 
lavish gifts and other inducements from Salt Lake boosters.

<HEADLINE> Maytag Buying Appliance Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Iowa (AP) -- Maytag Corp., which has been expanding its  
business in the commercial kitchen sector, is buying Jade Range, a 
California company that specializes in premium commercial ranges. 
</P>
<P>
	Maytag will pay $20 million to $25 million for the privately  
held company. 
</P>
<P>
	Jade produces ranges, grills and refrigerators with a primary  
focus on premium commercial ranges under the Jade name. It also 
makes ranges and outdoor grills for the residential market under 
the Dynasty brand. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Maytag announced an alliance with TurboChef Inc.,  
a Dallas company that designs high-speed cooking systems for 
commercial kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Maytag completed the purchase of G.S. Bodgett Crop.,  
a Vermont-based manufacturer of commercial ovens, fryers and 
charbroilers for the food service industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Jade has about 160 employees at its manufacturing plant in  
Commerce, Calif. It had 1998 sales of about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Maytag, based in Newton, Iowa, is a leading producer of home  
appliances, floor care products and vending machines. Its main 
brands include Maytag, Hoover, Jenn-Air and Magic Chef. Maytag 
employs about 23,800 people at 17 manufacturing plants in North

<HEADLINE> Law Students Deadlocked on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A law school exercise that let students vote  
on whether President Clinton committed impeachable offenses won't 
offer much guidance to the Senate. The vote ended in a hung jury -- 
split right down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	The exercise Thursday involved 14 students and two professors at  
Loyola University Law School's hastily organized seminar on 
impeachment. Debate was lively from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think President Clinton betrayed his wife and child but not  
his country,'' said Tamara Boyer, a second-year student who voted 
no on the question posed by professors Lawrence Solum and Karl 
Manheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Her classmate, Robert Serna, responded, ``I don't think betrayal  
is the standard. People say politicians lie all the time. But when 
you take an oath to tell the truth, it rises to a different level. 
I would vote that it is impeachable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so it went in the seminar designed to pique students'  
interest by tying the law to a real-life constitutional issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This course caught my eye,'' said second-year student  
Cassandra Lopez. ``I watched everything (on TV). I may as well get 
credit for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Associate Dean Laurie Levenson, who oversees classes at Loyola,  
called the trial the ``ultimate learning experience'' for students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ordinarily we teach them something and they have to wait to  
get out of school to see how it affects them,'' she said. ``Here 
they are looking at a trial that affects their lives. And it's a 
class where they can't be wrong. They know as much as their 
professors do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools are using the historic trial to reach students.  
DePaul University's law school held its first seminar on the issue 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Impeachment hasn't been among Loyola's constitutional law  
curricula before, Levenson said, because ``it seemed so arcane. Now 
it's not arcane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Student Catrina Archieta said she wondered whether the framers  
of the Constitution envisioned behavior such as Clinton's when they 
devised impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so,'' she said. ``Let's look at Reagan and  
Iran-Contra. That seems like a much more impeachable offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the students voted 7-7 on the issue. Four of five  
women said Clinton's behavior wasn't impeachable. Six of the nine 
men said it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Manheim was so impressed with the first day's responses, he  
said, ``Maybe this should become a permanent course.''

<HEADLINE> LAPD Chief Snubbed at Funerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Some city police officers dislike Chief  
Bernard Parks so much they have asked that he be barred from 
attending their funerals should they die in the line of duty, the 
Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks succeeded former Chief Willie Williams in August 1997.  
Officers interviewed by the Times said they dislike Parks because 
they believe he is overly strict. Last year, the LAPD fired 54 
officers, compared to 11 in 1997 and 13 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want somebody I don't respect at my funeral,'' said  
Officer Lisa Golt, recently suspended for allegedly giving false 
and misleading statements. ``He has no feelings whatsoever for the 
officers. He only goes for political reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Fullerton, director of the Los Angeles Police Protective  
League, a police union, said morale on the force is terrible. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the worst it's been in many a year,'' he said ``He's done  
absolutely nothing to rally the troops around him. He's heartless 
and could care less about the officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parks, through a spokesman, told the Times he had not heard of  
the officers' requests and had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how many officers have joined the effort to bar him  
from their funerals. Many of them have been disciplined by the 
department or have friends who also have been disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
	Some law enforcement experts said the plan was misguided.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that any members of an organization would  
feel compelled to make comments that are not productive,'' said 
Timm Browne, spokesman for the California Peace Officer's 
Association. ``That's a pretty bleak and disruptive view.''

<HEADLINE> ABC's Union Lockout Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC's lockout of 2,400 employees ended Friday,  
following a union agreement to give the network advance warning of 
any future strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're done,'' said Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the National  
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, declaring that 
union members would be returning to their jobs at ABC after 11 
weeks on picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Those camera operators, producers and other behind-the-scenes  
workers in five cities will be back no later than Monday afternoon, 
the network said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC anticipated the agreement would be reached and had begun to  
work out assignments for employees, said network spokeswoman Julie 
Hoover. The assignments will determine exactly when each individual 
returns, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The return of our NABET-represented employees and the closing  
of what has been a difficult period for all concerned ... is a very 
welcome development,'' said ABC president Robert Iger. 
</P>
<P>
	NABET members at the network, who have been without a contract  
since March 1997, had staged a one-day strike over health benefits 
on Nov. 2. The next day, ABC locked them out of their jobs until 
they promised advance warning on future job actions. Until 
Wednesday, the union had refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue said the final sticking point to a back-to-work  
agreement centered on ``a handful of firings'' of NABET members 
during the lockout. Under terms arrived at Friday, the dismissals 
will be put to binding arbitration before, not after, the union 
votes on a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union's commitment to those individuals, whose careers and  
families were threatened, was what held up completion of the 
agreement,'' Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
	He credited help from Communications Workers of America  
President Morton Bahr and Labor Secretary Alexis Herman for helping 
reach the back-to-work agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The union must now submit the contract offer to its members for  
a vote within two weeks, Donahue said, with a decision expected 
within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overarching point is that we succeeded in getting our  
members back inside, off the picket lines, while they consider the 
company's final offer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the lockout, ABC used temporary workers while NABET  
members walked picket lines at network facilities in New York, 
Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Though technical glitches were sometimes evident, the biggest  
impact on viewers was the refusal of entertainers and Democratic 
politicians to appear on ABC shows like ``Nightline,'' ``Good 
Morning America'' and ``This Week.'' Friday, NABET officially 
called off this boycott.

<HEADLINE> Hall Wants Divorce From Mick Jagger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Jerry Hall has filed for divorce from Rolling  
Stone Mick Jagger, seeking to end their stormy eight-year marriage, 
her lawyers said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The law firm Mishcon de Reya said in a statement that it had  
initiated proceedings on behalf of the 42-year-old Texas-born 
model. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no further comment at this stage,'' said the firm,  
which also represented Princess Diana in her divorce from Prince 
Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at the Rolling Stones' London office, who declined  
to give her name, said Jagger had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall had previously threatened to divorce Jagger, 55, over a  
number of well-publicized indiscretions. The latest involved a 
Brazilian model, Luciana Gimenez Morad, who claims she is pregnant 
with his child. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall and Jagger have lived together since the late 1970s and  
married in 1990. They have four children -- Elizabeth, 14; James, 
13; Georgia May, 6; and Gabriel, 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall first separated from the Rolling Stones frontman in  
1992 after he was linked to Italian model Carla Bruni. 
</P>
<P>
	``I supposed we will divorce,'' she was quoted as saying. ``It's  
very heartbreaking.'' Months later, however, she and Jagger flew 
off for a vacation together and she soon publicly forgave him. 
</P>
<P>
	More trouble brewed two years ago after Jagger was linked to a  
string of women, including actress Uma Thurman and model Nicole 
Kruk. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall consulted Mishcon de Reya, but never filed divorce  
papers. Jagger wooed her with flowers, love notes and presents and, 
a year later, their son Gabriel was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall recently explained that staying jealous is the secret  
of keeping a marriage alive, adding, ``I don't remember anything 
bad for very long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers speculating about a possible divorce action estimated  
Friday that Ms. Hall would seek a settlement of at least $49.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger divorced his first wife, Bianca, in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Commutes Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- In one of his final acts in office, Gov.  
Fob James commuted the death sentence Friday of a woman convicted 
in the slaying of a 13-year-old girl who was injected with drain 
cleaner, shot and thrown into a canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	James, who leaves office Monday, gave no reason for commuting  
34-year-old Judith Ann Neelley's sentence to life in prison. The 
governor was duck hunting when the decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Neelley was convicted in one of Alabama's most notorious  
crimes: the 1982 killing of Lisa Ann Millican. She was abducted 
from a Georgia shopping mall, sexually abused and tortured. Mrs. 
Neelley was 18 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Neelley claimed to be a battered wife acting blindly at the  
direction of her husband, who wanted the girl for sex. He is 
serving a life sentence in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had expected Mrs. Neelley to be executed this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Neelley would become eligible for parole since her sentence  
was commuted to life imprisonment instead of life without parole, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the tragedy,'' said DeKalb County District Attorney  
Mike O'Dell, who prosecuted Mrs. Neelley in 1983. He called James' 
action ``incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Neelley's attorney, Barry Ragsdale, said James' decision  
followed a recent clemency request that cited her conversion to 
Christianity and included letters from clergymen and relatives and 
a poem from her 18-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	James is an evangelical Christian known for promoting  
conservative religious causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he concluded this was a woman who was worth more than  
her worst act,'' Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Neelley ``broke down and cried for about 10 minutes'' when  
informed of James' decision, her lawyer said. ``She wanted to call 
her children and tell them,'' said Ragsdale.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Cigarette Tax Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking to pay for an abundance of new  
programs, President Clinton plans to offer a new 55-cent-a-pack 
cigarette tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan recalls the president's budget a year ago when he  
counted on a massive fine on the tobacco industry to pay for his 
spending initiatives. Tobacco legislation never passed last year, 
although the president got some of his spending requests 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	The new tax plan, certain to be opposed by congressional  
Republicans, would raise $8 billion for the fiscal year beginning 
Oct. 1, an administration official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Now at 24 cents a pack, the federal cigarette tax already is set  
to jump to 39 cents in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also will insist that states turn  
over some of the money they will get from a giant settlement with 
tobacco companies, but not this year. Clinton's plan does not count 
on that money until 2001, meaning he does not need it for the 
fiscal 2000 budget he will submit to Congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Clinton has touted a number of new ideas but  
avoided discussing how he would pay for them. Still, he has 
promised his budget will be balanced without reaching into the 
budget surplus, which makes it almost impossible to pay for new 
spending without new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, proposals have included more money for after-school  
programs, new defense spending, tax incentives for long-term care 
and money to help disabled people go to work. Plans announced 
Thursday were for money to fight crime and to aid people with 
mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans have consistently warned Clinton  
against paying for his plans with increased taxes, including 
cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raising taxes has never been the answer to our nation's  
problems,'' Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, wrote the president last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's tobacco legislation fell apart under criticism that  
it was too hard on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The states responded by settling lawsuits with tobacco companies  
on their own. Cigarette makers agreed to pay 46 states $206 billion 
over 25 years, raising prices by 45 cents a pack. That contributed 
to a 30 percent jump in cigarette prices in December, the 
government reported. Four other states previously had settled their 
suits independently. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers and governors are already debating how to spend  
the money, but the federal government has long held that it has a 
right to much of it. Many state lawsuits had sought to recover 
money spent by Medicaid on sick smokers, and the federal government 
pays for at least half of Medicaid costs in every state. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, it seemed a deal was possible. Administration  
officials indicated they might let states keep the money if they 
agreed to spend it on certain public health, anti-smoking programs. 
But now Clinton envisions using some of the money for the federal 
budget, beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House still wants federal legislation that would  
impose new restrictions on the tobacco industry while giving the 
federal government a financial settlement of its own. But that 
requires congressional action, and the administration hopes states 
will press Congress for such legislation if their settlement money 
is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an attempt to create an environment and pressure for a  
bipartisan agreement on tobacco,'' an administration official 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The states are not pleased. They argue that some of the suits

federal government should file its own lawsuit if it wants money. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire was told  
about the administration's plans and spread the word to other 
states Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position very emphatically is this money should go to the  
states,'' said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. 
``We believe we have a moral and a political claim because we are 
the ones who brought the lawsuits.''

<HEADLINE> Justice OKs EchoStar Satellite Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department urged federal  
regulators Thursday to approve EchoStar Communications Corp.'s 
acquisition of the last national license to beam TV and other 
services directly to homes via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	EchoStar, based in Littleton, Colo., announced plans in November  
to buy the direct-broadcast satellite, or DBS, license from Rupert 
Murdoch's News Corp. and MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is reviewing the deal to  
determine whether it would be good for consumers and for 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the merger would be good on both  
counts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The transaction will greatly increase EchoStar's capacity to  
transmit video programming and will enhance its ability to compete 
aggressively and effectively against other distributors of 
multichannel programming, including the cable companies that 
dominate these distribution markets,'' the department said in a 
filing to the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, EchoStar will acquire the satellite license and  
other assets now held by News Corp. and MCI, including two 
satellites now being built. The assets, valued at $1.25 billion, 
will be paid for with EchoStar stock. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. and MCI, however, will be investors in EchoStar.  
Together they will have a 37 percent stake in the company and 8.5 
percent of its voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
	For consumers, the deal means more channels and services by  
early 2000. It also helps EchoStar's technical efforts to provide 
satellite TV viewers who use pizza-sized dishes with local 
broadcast channels -- a move that requires both extra channel space 
and federal legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year News Corp. had plans to merge its U.S. satellite  
operation with Primestar, a satellite TV company owned by big cable 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Justice Department in May sued to block that deal,  
saying it would blunt competition. Primestar and Murdoch called off 
the planned merger in October.

<HEADLINE> Monsanto Ends Research on 2 Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- After a massive research effort, Monsanto killed  
the development of two drugs designed to prevent heart failure, the 
company said Friday. The drugs had reached advanced stages of 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto officials determined the drugs -- xemilogiban and  
orbofiban -- did not reduce the likelihood that patients would die, 
or would need surgery to restore blood flow to the heart. They 
stressed the drugs were safe, but simply did not work as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Monsanto fell $3.25, or 7.7 percent, to close at $39  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	While several drugs are available to help patients with acute  
coronary artery disease, they all must be given intravenously, 
which usually means patients must be in the hospital. Searle, 
Monsanto's pharmaceutical subsidiary based in Skokie, Ill., was 
trying to develop drugs that could be taken in a pill form. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto had tested the drugs on more than 20,000 patients  
worldwide over the last decade, and spent millions on research. 
</P>
<P>
	Both drugs had the potential to garner a combined $500 million  
in annual sales, making them significant sellers but not 
blockbusters, said Sergio Traversa, an analyst for Mehta Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the heart drugs' failure is a costly blow to the  
life sciences company, although it has strong prospects in other 
areas. Last month, Monsanto became the first company to get Food 
and Drug Administration approval for a new class of painkillers 
called Cox-2 inhibitors that are aimed at arthritis patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto said they have several other drugs in advanced stages  
of testing, and they don't think Friday's decision will have a big 
impact on overall sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling is optimistic, even though we were disappointed  
about this program,'' said Dr. Holly Kleinert, Searle's vice 
president of global cardiovascular franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Xemilofiban was given to patients undergoing balloon  
angioplasty, a procedure to open up clogged arteries. Orbofiban was 
tested on patients with angina, or severe chest pains. Both drugs 
tried to reduce heart attack risk by trying to prevent platelets in 
blood from clinging together. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither drug was expected to be on the market before the end of  
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto had warned Wall Street in November that the human  
trials were not going well. 
</P>
<P>
	``These drugs were already in the intensive care unit,'' said  
Christine Heuer, analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.

<HEADLINE> Falwell: Antichrist Probably Jewish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell said the  
Antichrist is probably alive today and is a male Jew. He also 
believes the second coming of Christ probably will be within 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Thursday about the concern people have over the new  
millennium, Falwell told about 1,500 people at a conference on 
evangelism at Kingsport, Tenn., that the Antichrist is male and is 
a Jew. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who will the antichrist be? I don't know. Nobody else knows,''  
said Falwell, whose Sunday morning services at Thomas Road Baptist 
Church in Lynchburg are carried by television stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is he alive and here today? Probably. Because when he appears  
during the Tribulation period he will be a full-grown counterfeit 
of Christ. Of course he'll be Jewish. Of course he'll pretend to be 
Christ. And if in fact the Lord is coming soon, and he'll be an 
adult at the presentation of himself, he must be alive somewhere 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Bible, the Antichrist will spread universal  
evil before the end of the world but will be finally conquered at 
the second coming of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell, the chancellor of Liberty University in Lynchburg and  
founder of the now-defunct Moral Majority, said Friday in 
Williamsburg that he did not intend for his statement to be 
anti-Jewish. He said he meant only that the Antichrist must be 
Jewish because Jesus Christ was a Jew. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's going to be the counterfeit of Christ, he has to be  
Jewish,'' Falwell said. ``The only thing we know is he must be male 
and Jewish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi James Rudin, the director of inter-religious affairs for  
the American Jewish Committee in New York, said the comment 
surprised him because he knows Falwell is a strong supporter of 
Israel and is not anti-Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is part of what I call millennial madness,'' Rudin said.  
``To single out any one man and particularly to identify him as 
Jewish plays into some latent and historical anti-Semitism from the 
past.''

<HEADLINE> Lopez in $1.8M Deal with Devil Rays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Reliever Albie Lopez, who set  
personal bests for wins and innings pitched with the Tampa Bay 
Devil Rays last season, agreed Friday to a $1.35 million, two-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, who was eligible for arbitration, appeared in a  
career-high 54 games for the expansion team in 1998, going 7-4 with 
a 2.60 ERA in 79 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, who made $245,000 last season, gets $550,000 this year  
and $800,000 in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season was Lopez's first in which he worked exclusively out  
of the bullpen. The 27-year-old right-hander was Tampa Bay's 24th 
selection in the expansion draft, coming from the Cleveland 
Indians.

	``Whether attempting to persuade a person to testify falsely or  
to ignore court orders or to produce objects, whether suggesting to 
an innocent person a false story in the hopes that he or she will 
repeat it in a judicial proceeding or testifying falsely in the 
hopes of blocking other parties' pursuit of the truth, all these 
acts obstruct justice. All these acts are federal felony crimes. 
All these acts were committed by William Jefferson Clinton.'' -- 
Rep. Charles Cannon, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not want to usurp your duty, your responsibility, given  
to you by the Constitution as the trier of fact. We are not that 
presumptuous. It is your responsibility, it is your solemn duty, to 
be the trier of fact. That is very different from our solemn duty, 
which I believe the House performed admirably in essentially 
reaching the conclusion that there is probable cause to convict the 
president of perjury and obstruction of justice.'' -- Rep. Bob Barr, 
R-Ga.

<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, the fact of the matter is, it is a principle of long and  
consistent standing in every federal court in our land, and I 
suspect every state court in our land, that, as directed by every 
federal judge to every federal jury taking evidence, circumstantial 
evidence is to be, and shall not be afforded any less weight than 
direct evidence. And triers of fact are directed by judges in every 
case not to accord less weight to one type of evidence as opposed 
to the other.'' -- Barr.

<P>
	``Our job as managers is to make sure we do not abuse that  
necessity and that we do not in fact offer repetitive notions, 
repetitive references, without having a very clear and specific 
purpose such as I mentioned for that process.'' -- Barr. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, before turning to that merger of the law and the  
facts, which I believe will illustrate conclusively that this 
president has committed and ought to be convicted on perjury and 
obstruction of justice, I would respectfully ask that you remember 
that under the law of impeachment based on our Constitution, proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the president committed each and 
every element of one or more violations of provisions of the 
federal criminal code has never been required to sustain a 
conviction in any prior impeachment trial in the Senate.'' -- Barr.

<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Perjury and obstruction. We respectfully ask you to strike  
down these insidious cancers that eat at the heart of our system of 
government and laws. Strike them down with the Constitution, so 
they might not fester as a gaping wound poisoning future 
generations of children, poisoning our court system, and perhaps 
even future generations of political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as members of both Houses of Congress have, unfortunately,  
over the years been convicted and removed from office for perjury 
and obstruction And just as federal judges have been removed from 
life tenure for perjury and obstruction, so must a president, so 
sadly should this president and just as federal judges have been

<HEADLINE> Colo. School Adopts New HIV Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- In a move critics call  
discriminatory, a local school district has adopted a new policy 
that could bar students with HIV and AIDS from playing school 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Poudre School District now requires a committee of parents,  
health professionals and school officials to decide whether an 
infected student may participate in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy, approved unanimously Monday by the district board,  
applies to all sports and all ``serious communicable diseases,'' 
but only HIV and AIDS are specified. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Diehl of the National Federation of State High School  
Associations in Kansas City, Mo., said he knows of no other school 
districts that have enacted such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not automatically excluding anybody,'' said Joe  
Hendrickson, the district's director of pupil services and the 
policy's lead author. ``Our intention was to find a policy that did 
not discriminate, that would only consider exclusion if there were 
a medically sound recommendation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say the policy does discriminate and raises concerns  
about privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the face of it, you're taking a group of people and, based  
on their health status, potentially excluding them,'' said Peter 
Brown of the Colorado AIDS Project. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy is triggered only when a student athlete reveals he  
or she has an infectious disease, which makes it difficult for the 
rule to be fairly enforced, said lawyers with the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Colorado. Students often don't know they are 
HIV-positive and, even if they do know, Colorado law does not 
compel them to disclose it. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU would consider challenging the policy if a student is  
kicked off a team, said Christine Cimini, an attorney for the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Health experts say there is only a minute risk that an  
HIV-infected athlete could transmit the disease, even during 
contact sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``In day-to-day sport contact, it's really not an issue unless  
someone has an open cut,'' said Dr. Ken Greenberg, who works with 
AIDS patients at Denver Infectious Disease Consultants. ``HIV can't 
be transmitted through sweat. It can't be transmitted through 
saliva.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Sign Perez, 2 Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers avoided salary  
arbitration with three players, agreeing Friday to a $15.5 million, 
three-year contract with Carlos Perez and one-year deals with 
Ismael Valdes and Todd Hollandsworth. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, a 28-year-old left-hander who made $1.5 million in 1998,  
was acquired by the Dodgers midway through the 1998 season from the 
Montreal Expos. He gets a $1 million signing bonus, $2 million in 
1999, $5 million in 2000 and $7.5 million in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes, a 25-year-old right-hander, gets $4,275,000, up from  
$2.8 million last year. Hollandsworth, the 1996 NL Rookie of the 
Year who figures to play in a reserve role if he's not traded, gets 
$850,000, a $150,000 raise. 
</P>
<P>
	The signings leave two Dodgers in arbitration: right-hander  
Darren Dreifort and shortstop Mark Grudzielanek, who came to Los 
Angeles from Montreal alnng with Perez. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes was 11-10 with a 3.98 ERA for the Dodgers last season. He  
pitched in 27 games, all starts, and completed two, both shutouts. 
He worked 174 innings with 66 walks and 122 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes, who signed as a free agent with the Dodgers on June 14,  
1991, first pitched in the majors in 1994 and has a career record 
of 52-40. He had his best year in 1996, when he went 15-7 with a 
3.32 ERA while making 33 starts, pitching 225 innings and striking 
out 173 -- all career-highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez was 11-14 with a 3.59 ERA while pitching for the Expos and  
Dodgers last season. He pitched in 34 games, all starts, and 
completed seven with two shutouts. He worked 241 innings with 63 
walks and 128 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez began his big league career with the Expos in 1995 and  
didn't play in 1996 following surgery on his pitching shoulder. He 
has a major league record of 33-35, having gone 10-8 in 1995 and 
12-13 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollandsworth, 25, hit .269 with three homers and 20 RBIs in 55  
games for the Dodgers last year. He missed the team's final 103 
games after suffering a cartilage tear in his left shoulder. 
Hollandsworth has a career average of .269 with 24 homers and 123 
RBIs in his four seasons with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers also announced the signing of infielder Scott  
Livingstone and left-handed pitcher Ricardo Jordan to minor league 
contracts, and said both will attend spring training as non-roster 
invitees. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also invited three other minor leaguers -- right-hander  
Dan Hubbs, outfielder Bubba Crosby and infielder Damian Rolls -- to 
spring training.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Wood Looms With Jordan Gone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Kerry Wood's elbow is fine, thanks. So is his ego  
after a rookie season that will make him one of Chicago's most 
popular athletes now that a certain basketball player has retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood tied a major league record by striking out 20 batters in a  
nine-inning game, went 13-6 to help the Cubs make the playoffs for 
the first time since 1989 and then capped it by winning the NL 
Rookie of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
	But replaying that fabulous first year is not something the  
21-year-old right-hander has done this offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just never really sat down and put too much thought into  
it. You are keeping busy and not dwelling on it too much,'' Wood 
said Friday during the Cubs' winter convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a pretty good year the way I look at it. I got the  
first year out of the way and had some luck and was able to 
experience the whole playoff atmosphere. I think that's the most 
important thing at an early age -- to have that experience. It was a 
fun season and I was just sorry to see it end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood didn't start a regular-season game after Aug. 31 because of  
a sprained elbow ligament. He returned for Game 3 of the opening 
round of the NL playoffs against Atlanta and allowed one run as the 
Cubs were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said he's just begun to throw a ball around but has not yet  
pitched off a mound or experimented with breaking pitches. He 
reiterated that his arm is sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels fine. We had a followup exam about a month ago and  
everything looks great,'' Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood will be reunited with pitching coach Marty DeMerritt, who  
worked with him in Triple-A and helped both his confidence and his 
breaking ball. DeMerritt replaced Phil Regan as pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kerry doesn't make things complicated and that's the way you  
need to be when you are an individual with the status he has now,'' 
DeMerritt said. ``I think is personality is suited for him being so 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood has no aspirations to replace Michael Jordan as the city's  
most popular athlete, a chore that could easily go to his Cubs 
teammate Sammy Sosa, who has spent much of the offseason raising 
money for hurricane relief in the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood also isn't worried about the expectations that will follow  
him this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is going to overlook the fact that Jordan is not coming  
back. But if the fans need to have a team to look for, we're here 
and we're going to try and win the thing,'' Wood promised. ``I 
don't feel any pressure because that was last season. It's just 
like starting over.''

<HEADLINE> IMG Lands Pak in Three-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Se Ri Pak, the South Korean star who  
won two major championships in the her first season on the LPGA 
Tour, will be represented by the International Management Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung, the South Korean electronics giant, said today it  
signed a three-year deal with IMG to manage Pak's career. Samsung 
said it will continue to act as Pak's corporate sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak, 21, signed a 10-year exclusive managerial and sponsorship  
deal with Samsung in 1996 that pays her about $1 million a year and 
unspecified performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the systematic and scientific management through IMG  
will help Pak remain a top-notch player,'' Samsung spokesman Ahn 
Ho-moon said. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG will seek endorsement deals with golf equipment makers and  
other companies and split 30 percent of the profits with Samsung. 
Pak will receive the remaining 70 percent, Samsung officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak, The Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year, won the  
LPGA Championship in May, and became the youngest winner of the 
U.S. Women's Open in early July. She won two other tour events and 
finished second on the money list with $872,170.

<HEADLINE> Friday's Impeachment Highlights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from Friday's proceedings in the impeachment trial:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Republican House managers urged the Senate to call witnesses  
to support allegations against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida told senators Monica Lewinsky  
was a ``very credible'' witness whose testimony established that 
Clinton ``knowingly, intentionally'' sought to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Reps. George Gekas of Pennsylvania, Steve Chabot of Ohio, Bob  
Barr of Georgia and Chris Cannon of Utah briefed senators on 
perjury laws, obstruction of justice laws and the articles of 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, made the first senatorial objection  
of the trial, asking that the House managers refrain from referring 
to the senators as ``jurors'' in the trial. Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist supported Harkin's motion that senators be referred to as 
``triers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- White House spokesman Joe Lockhart dismissed the allegations  
brought by the House. ``There's no testimony that proves the 
president committed perjury. There's no testimony that proves the 
president obstructed justice. In fact there is direct testimony to 
the contrary,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Clinton traveled to New York to speak to Wall Street  
executives. He did not mention the trial.

<HEADLINE>  Cameras Catch Coach's Profanity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The camera zooms in so close no lip reader is needed. The  
networks have captured yet another profanity-laced tirade by an NFL 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it's Bill Parcells. Other times it's Mike Ditka, Jim  
Mora or Tom Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
	And the networks don't seem to care.  
</P>
<P>
	They keep their cameras on the red-hot coaches long enough for  
children watching to add a few words to their vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Carter, Grandson Feel Like Outcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Carter says he and his Peace  
Corps grandson share a common bond: Both are members of outcast 
generations in a world run by the middle-aged. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, 74, and Jason Carter, 23, are both heading back to  
Africa in the next few days -- the grandfather to Nigeria on one of 
his election monitoring trips, the grandson to return to his post 
as a Peace Corps volunteer in Lochiel, four hours drive east of 
Johannesburg, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	They were in Washington this week for a Global Meeting of  
Generations, an international forum aimed at getting the old and 
young together to address world problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Carter loves speaking Zulu and living as the only white  
man in a rural South African neighborhood, but things have changed 
since ``Miss Lillian'' had a similar role in India three decades 
ago. ``It's not my great-grandmother's Peace Corps,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old volunteer has running water and communicates  
regularly with grandpa Jimmy Carter by e-mail. That is something 
Lillian Carter could not do when she joined the Peace Corps in 1966 
as her son was losing a race for Georgia governor. 
</P>
<P>
	In conversation at the generations forum Thursday night, the  
two, despite a half-century age difference, found agreement on 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``My generation and Jason's are kind of the outcasts,'' said the  
elder Carter, ``because it's the generation between us that really 
controls government and controls finances and controls policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed ``a kind of partnership between my generation and  
Jason's, where we look for inspiration and idealism and activism 
from Jason and he looks for advice from people like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And money,'' his grandson added.  
</P>
<P>
	``And money from my generation,'' the grandfather agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Jason says most of his South African friends have no idea he is  
the grandson of a U.S. president, but it takes him places not all 
volunteers go, such as back to Washington for a few days in the 
middle of his two-year stint. And his grandfather visited during 
his in-country training a year ago and introduced him to South 
African President Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Carter is one of about 60 Peace Corps volunteers in the  
country, working in education and other fields and living on a 
subsistence allowance. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Carters chatted about the environment, learning from  
other countries, the gap between rich and poor and declining U.S. 
foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been president of this country, and I'm responsible  
partially,'' Carter said, for what he called ``probably the 
stingiest country in the world,'' with per capita foreign aid 
1/20th that of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Carter says he never really worried about what his  
four children thought of him but is eager to have his grandchildren 
approve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I approve,'' Jason said, crediting his grandfather for  
teaching him ``never to stop taking advantage of your 
opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Good luck to you, man, I love you,'' Carter said as the two  
parted. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason, the eldest of eight Carter grandchildren, is the son of  
Jack Carter, who now lives in Bermuda, and Judy Langford of 
Chicago. His parents have divorced and both have second marriages.

<HEADLINE> Arco To Cut 300 More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Atlantic Richfield Co. will eliminate another  
300 jobs and take charges of $890 million in the fourth quarter, 
continuing a trend of cutbacks and consolidation in an oil industry 
battered by low crude prices and weak demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-quarter, after-tax charge includes writedowns to  
reflect the shrinking value of oil holdings in the Middle East, 
North Africa and the North Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	As crude prices have fallen, so has the estimated value of  
Arco's holdings. Crude prices are at their lowest levels in more 
than a decade, with light sweet crude selling for $12.23 per barrel 
in spot trading Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of another 300 layoffs at Arco follows the  
company's decision last October to eliminate 900 jobs company-wide 
as part of a cost-cutting campaign designed to lower operating 
costs by $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the company has found other areas where it can cut  
payroll, said spokeswoman Linda Dozier. The new reductions will 
include administrative and production workers at Arco operations in 
the United States, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge includes $180 million to cover the cost of the 1,200  
job cuts and other restructuring expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. have estimated the company  
would earn 4 cents per share in the fourth quarter. Dozier said the 
company was ``comfortable'' with estimates in that range. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, with markets rising sharply, Arco stock gained  
43 3/4 cents Friday to close at $61 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Restructuring has become commonplace in the oil industry in  
light of the price crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually every major oil company has in one way or another  
been adjusting their expectations,'' said Eugene L. Nowak, an 
analyst with ABN Amro in New York. ``It's now looking like a 
company that will not do this in the fourth quarter will be the 
exception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips Petroleum Co. announced last week it would eliminate  
1,400 jobs to cut costs, and Conoco Inc. said in December that it 
would eliminate nearly 1,000. Texaco Inc. also said it would 
eliminate about 1,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Low prices provided an impetus for the planned merger of giants  
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., which expect $2.8 billion in cost 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in crude prices has been blamed on a variety of  
factors, including overproduction and the Asian economic crisis, 
reduced demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to say everything went wrong,'' Nowak said.  
``It doesn't surprise us we're seeing this massive turndown in 
expenditures plans.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Challenges Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is challenging Wall Street  
to invest in the underserved markets of America and ensure that the 
nation's downtowns share the good economic times with impoverished 
inner-city and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Help make sure no family is left behind,'' the president said  
Thursday in taped greetings from the White House to Wall Street 
executives meeting in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting a section of his fiscal 2000 budget proposal,  
Clinton planned today to unveil a bundle of tax incentives and loan 
guarantees designed to attract venture capital to distressed areas 
from the barrios of Los Angeles to the hamlets of Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
	``As leaders of the companies of on the `Big Board,' as the men  
and women who have helped transform American into the world's 
economic superpower, you must help build the bridge between those 
who work in our gleaming office towers and those who live in their 
shadows,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Senate impeachment trial against him proceeding,  
Clinton addressed a morning conference of world leaders studying 
government reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his administration's theory on the relationship of  
government to private sectors is ``to do less regulation, and 
instead create incentives and frameworks to solve problems and meet 
national goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From that forum at the State Department, he headed to New York,  
where he planned to unveil the new initiative at an economic 
conference organized by Jesse Jackson's Wall Street Project, a 
coalition of executives from top Wall Street firms and some of the 
biggest U.S. companies dedicated to expanding business 
opportunities for minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plans to travel Thursday night and attend the  
project's gala dinner were stymied by ice and snow on the East 
Coast. He was expected back in Washington tonight to attend a 
Democratic fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal was developed by an administration task  
force that consulted with investment advisers and pioneers in 
community development as well as members of Congress. In some ways 
it mirrored federal efforts to boost struggling economies abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a domestic version of these vehicles,'' Jackson said.  
``Whether it's the Ozarks, East L.A. or Harlem, there must be 
vehicles ... to transport capital to people who need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would seek to stimulate billions of dollars in new  
private capital investments, building a network of private 
investment institutions to funnel credit and technical assistance 
to businesses in these underserved areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The details of the proposal include:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $1 billion tax credit designed to spur $6 billion in new  
equity capital for investment in the targeted markets. The 
administration hopes the 25 percent credit will attract investors, 
who in turn could support small technology companies, inner-city 
shopping centers, manufacturers, retail stores and other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Creation of new private investment partnerships to be known as  
America's Private Investment Companies patterned after the Overseas 
Private Investment Corp. APIC would make equity investments into 
larger businesses that expand or relocate to inner cities or rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--Targeting of the SBA's Small Business Investment Program to  
low- and moderate-income areas. This program provides equity and 
debt financing to small companies that are looking to grow. America 
Online and Staples are two examples of companies that have 
benefited from this program, but the White House says it has been 
of little benefit to inner cities and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the SBA would authorize establishment of new  
markets venture capital firms and approve nonbank lenders that will 
target their lending to underserved areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's budget also will include seed money for  
BusinessLink, a public-private partnership to demonstrate to large 
firms the business benefits of developing small and minority 
business partners.

<HEADLINE> Winter Punishes Northeast, Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Snow and freezing rain fell again early today across the East,  
where storm after storm has collapsed roofs, grounded hundreds of 
flights and knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	``These roads are all horrendous,'' said Karl Sutton, head of  
emergency services for Hancock County, W.Va. ``My guys are working 
12 hours a day, seven days a week, and they're dying. They're just 
beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were killed early today when their car swerved on  
ice and snow and smashed into a tractor-trailer near Clarksburg, 
W.Va., said Sgt. Robert Crawford of Harrison County Bureau of 
Emergency Services. Another man was killed in an accident Thursday 
in West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, icy weather was blamed for at least two fatal  
accidents Thursday. A man was killed when his car ran into a guard 
rail on Interstate 70 near Hagerstown, and a Pennsylvania man died 
after his car skidded off I-70 and hit a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Major power outages were reported in suburban Washington, with  
195,000 Pepco customers without electricity in Maryland and 119,000 
Virginia Power customers in the dark in northern Virginia. And more 
than 100,000 customers were without power in the Baltimore area. 
</P>
<P>
	There were less widespread outages in New Jersey, New York and  
Washington, D.C., and around Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, streets that were coated and slippery before  
dawn today turned to streams of slush as rain fell and rising 
temperatures melted snow and ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weather is for the birds -- ducks,'' said Efrain Burgos, a  
Manhattan doorman. ``But if it wouldn't have rained, we'd have 2 
feet of snow by now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday the storm dumped more than a foot of snow on some  
areas south of Boston, locking up traffic and forcing dozens of 
drivers to abandon their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday evening's rush hour was ``probably one of the worst  
commutes since the Blizzard of '78,'' state police Sgt. Shawn Lydon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	By today, the snow had changed to freezing rain, forcing  
Boston's Logan International Airport to close temporarily to de-ice 
runways. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 flights were canceled Thursday at the three major  
airports serving New York City, where up to 3 inches of snow fell 
into this morning before turning to freezing rain. Additional 
flights were canceled today, and President Clinton's trip to New 
York was delayed until today. 
</P>
<P>
	The only good news: Unseasonably high temperatures have been  
forecast for much of the region by Saturday. That could melt the 
ice, and would be welcome news in places like Allagash, Maine, 
which recorded the lowest temperature ever for the state early 
Thursday -- 55 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also expected to be warmer later today in parts of  
Missouri. Some students in the state haven't been in school since 
December because of snow and ice. Schools in eastern Missouri's St. 
Francois County were closed again today for the 10th straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	Parking lots, sidewalks and driveways remain dangerously slick  
in St. Louis, where public schools have been closed six times since 
Jan 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Things even froze over in Hell, Mich., an unincorporated village  
about 60 miles west of Detroit, where it was near zero Thursday. 
And in Commerce Township, northwest of Detroit, a 40- to 50-foot 
section of roof crashed onto the lanes at the Wonderland Lanes 
bowling alley Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The same problem has hit the Buffalo, N.Y., area, where more  
than 50 inches of snowfall since Jan. 1 has brought down barns, 
churches and other buildings. Part of a roof on a barn in 
Martinsburg also collapsed Thursday night, killing 20 cows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing fell in like an accordion,'' Charles Spencer  
Jr. said of a roof in one room of his home. ``Anybody who was out 
in that room would have been dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Icy conditions forced officials to close a 20-mile stretch of  
Interstate 87 north of Albany, N.Y., today. Slick roads also caused 
two multivehicle pileups on interstate ramps near Parsippany, N.J., 
about 25 miles west of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	About 135 state prison inmates were out with shovels uncovering  
fire hydrants and sewer receptacles in downtown Buffalo, and New 
York Gov. George Pataki declared a state of emergency so several 
counties would be eligible for state assistance. The area was 
getting more snow this morning, on top of freezing rain that fell 
overnight.

<HEADLINE>  Cameras Catch Coach's Profanity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The camera zooms in so close no lip reader is needed. The  
networks have captured yet another profanity-laced tirade by an NFL 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it's Bill Parcells. Other times it's Mike Ditka, Jim  
Mora or Tom Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
	And the networks don't seem to care.  
</P>
<P>
	They keep their cameras on the red-hot coaches long enough for  
children watching to add a few words to their vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're more sensitive to hearing profanity than seeing  
it,'' said CBS Sports coordinating director Larry Cavolina, whose

<HEADLINE> Jury Role in Cop Force Cases Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Friday to use a  
Louisiana case to decide whether a jury that determines a police 
officer used excessive force can also shield the officer from 
paying monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, in a ruling expected by July, will determine  
whether or not such a dual jury verdict is irreconcilable. 
</P>
<P>
	James Snyder has been paralyzed from the waist down since he was  
shot in the back by a New Orleans policeman, Sidney Trepagnier, on 
July 4, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder had been the passenger in a car that eluded police during  
a high-speed chase. The car's two occupants eventually fled on foot 
into a swampy area. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's version of what happened differs greatly from  
Trepagnier's. Snyder's lawsuit said the officer shot him while 
keeping him restrained face down in the mud and told him, ``The 
swamp's a hell of a place to die, ain't it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trepagnier said he shot Snyder while pursuing him through the  
swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury ruled that Trepagnier had violated Snyder's  
constitutional rights but was entitled to qualified immunity for 
having done so and therefore could not be forced to pay monetary 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's lawsuit also had named the city as a defendant, and the  
jury ordered New Orleans to pay him $1.96 million -- the amount of 
his past and future medical payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The presiding trial judge upheld Trepagnier's immunity and the  
jury's finding of liability against the city, but ordered a new 
trial to increase the amount of money Snyder could collect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is inconceivable for a jury to find that an individual who  
has been shot in the back, subjected to multiple operations, 
hospitalized for several months and will be confined for the rest 
of his life to a wheel chair endured no pain and suffering and 
permanent disability,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury had refused to award any money under those categories.  
</P>
<P>
	The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year found no  
discrepancy in the jury's finding that Trepagnier had violated the 
Constitution but could not be forced to pay damages. And the 
appeals court ruled that the city could not be held liable -- 
leaving Snyder with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on Friday, Snyder's lawyers argued that the  
judge, not the jury, should have decided whether Trepagnier was 
entitled to the qualified immunity he received. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Snyder vs. Trepagnier, 98-507.

	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota receiver Jake Reed won't

<HEADLINE> Farm-State Senators Petition Reno </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As concerns grow about consolidation in  
agriculture, farm state Democratic senators have asked Attorney 
General Janet Reno to investigate concentration in livestock and 
farm commodity markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe conditions have reached a point that our producers  
are being denied the opportunity to receive a fair price for their 
products through fair, free and open markets,'' said the letter, 
dated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was signed by Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad of North  
Dakota, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, 
Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, as well as Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Reno did not immediately return calls for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman recently asked the Justice  
Department and the Federal Trade Commission to examine pricing 
problems within the pork industry, where farmers are receiving 
record-low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers have expressed concern about plans by Cargill  
Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's No. 1 grain company, to buy the 
worldwide grain operations of second-ranked Continental Grain Co. 
Justice is reviewing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Dick Lugar, R-Ind., has  
scheduled a hearing Jan. 26 on the concentration issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators wrote that the top four firms control 87 percent of  
beef slaughter, 60 percent of pork slaughter and 73 percent of 
sheep slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the same in commodities markets, they said, writing that  
four firms control 59 percent of port facilities, 62 percent of 
flour milling, 74 percent of wet corn milling and 76 percent of 
soybean crushing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department should investigate ``whether such  
powerful concentration is squeezing farm prices and denying farmers 
the opportunity to receive a fair return for their production,'' 
the letter said.

<HEADLINE> Online Trading Surge Tests Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Once again, the rush to cyberspace has proven  
too much for the Internet to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	In much the same way that America Online's network was snarled  
by enthusiastic new customers two years ago, online brokers, 
including industry leaders Charles Schwab and E Trade Group, have 
been plagued by delays in filling customer orders amid a crush of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day like Wednesday, when shares of Internet giant Yahoo!  
plunged $70 in the opening minutes of trading and wiped out the 
entire loss within two hours, any delay can be costly. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be no quick fix, since even the latest network  
hardware is constantly being challenged by the unrelenting march 
toward faster and cheaper computers for consumers. Adding to that 
burden are the speedier connections and sweeter deals being offered 
by Internet access providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Online brokers have thus far averted the type of outcry directed  
at AOL in late 1996 and early 1997, when the online network was 
swamped by new members enticed by a new monthly plan featuring a 
flat rate and no time limits for use. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps online investors are savvy enough about computers to  
understand the current limitations of doing business on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've pretty much assumed that if there's a bum rush going on  
in the market that there's going to be a (trading) bottleneck 
because the overall Internet will be bogged down,'' said Keith 
Christensen of Wappingers Falls, N.Y., a customer of the online 
brokerage DLJ Direct. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen, 35, said periodic slowdowns while using his online  
account is nothing new. ``I've noticed (system delays) from the 
beginning. A lot of the time I will ask for a page and it will tell 
me that it's unavailable. It happened today when I went to look for 
a price on one of my stocks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the recent spate of slowdowns and system outages,  
most online brokerages had been continually upgrading their 
networks to handle the growing traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	But just as the incredible Internet-stock rally is being fueled  
by a spike in online activity that few ever imagined, it's only a 
guessing game to predict when the surge in online trading may 
plateau. 
</P>
<P>
	``The growth of trading on the Internet has been phenomenal and  
it's hard for (online brokerages) to shut off the faucet. When 
someone wants to open an account, it's hard to say, `No, we don't 
have capacity for a new account,''' said Junius Peake, a professor 
of finance at the University of Northern Colorado in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging from the increase in volume being reported by leading  
online brokers, it's easy to see why these troubles are popping up 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritrade Holding, a company that helped set off an industry  
price war with an $8-per-trade offer, estimates that it handled an 
average of 32,000 trades per day during the final three months of 
1998, an increase of more than 30 percent from the prior quarter. 
National Discount Brokers is now handling between 10,000 and 12,000 
online trades a day, up from 8,000 back in late November and early 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not have any outages this week, but we did experience  
slowdowns, which have typically occurred at the opening and the 
close,'' said Kris Lutz, a spokesperson for Ameritrade, which is 
based in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason why online traders may not be lashing out is that,  
despite the assertions of full-service brokers, there's little 
difference between waiting to make a trade online and waiting to 
make a trade by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The big guns such as Merrill Lynch maintain that many investors  
are far better off with a professional advisor to guide investors, 
especially during euphoric or panicky times in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	However even that system has its limits.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a guy holding your hand and he has 200 customers  
and they all call to sell at same time, he only has one mouth and 
two ears,'' said Peake.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Warms to Surprising Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The night after the biggest victory in the  
Atlanta Falcons' 33-year history, participants in a radio ``sports 
roundtable'' chatted about the playoff win over San Francisco, the 
upcoming game against Minnesota, then opened up the phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Caller one wanted to talk about the pitching staff of the  
Atlanta Braves, whose season starts in four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Caller two asked about a prospective recruit for the Georgia  
football team. 
</P>
<P>
	And caller three asked a question about high school sports.  
</P>
<P>
	``Falcons Fever'' has been slow to spread to Atlanta sports fans  
immunized by years of futility, or distracted by other sports 
loyalties in an area in which the most popular former player is a 
professional wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assume that's because of the Falcons' history,'' said Rick  
Fowler, a systems programmer and sports fan. ``I think this has 
snuck up on people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But fervor is building on the eve of the Falcons' first  
conference championship game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks are digging out black sweatshirts and pants to wear,  
sports bars display newly nailed-up Falcons banners, and 
schoolchildren are dancing the ``Dirty Bird,'' a combination of the 
Macarena and the ``Ickey Shuffle'' of 1980s Cincinnati Bengals star 
Ickey Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting to be a part of this for the city of Atlanta,  
and particularly the fans,'' star running back Jamal Anderson said. 
``I like when I'm out and I see people wearing Falcons clothes and 
hats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson grinned about his own Braves-style cap with an ``A''  
above the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even have a Falcons hat, but it's all Atlanta so it  
all works,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, veteran sports fans say the current enthusiasm doesn't  
compare with college football title runs by Georgia during the 
early 1980s, Georgia Tech in 1990 or the first of the Braves' seven 
straight playoff appearances in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a 7-2 start, the Falcons didn't sell out the Georgia  
Dome until their Nov. 15 NFC West showdown against San Francisco, 
their first sellout since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Hulsey, a Falcons season-ticket holder since 1980,  
suggested fans have held back because of lingering trauma from that 
season, when the Falcons blew a 10-point lead in the final five 
minutes of their playoff game against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people had a big letdown in 1980, and people  
have been hesitant to jump back on the bandwagon,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, many local fans weren't even around then. The  
fast-growing metro Atlanta area has added 415,000 residents from 
out of state since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Many newly arrived fans saw no reason to abandon their old  
teams, and Falcons players recall home games in which spectators 
rooting for Dallas outnumbered their own fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Even DC the Brain Supreme, producer of a single called ``The  
Dirty Bird Groove,'' had to laugh nervously when asked about his 
loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up with the Broncos and my heart is with the Broncos,''  
said the Denver native, whose real name is Cecil Glenn. ``But I 
love the Falcons because I live here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons also have to compete with intense loyalties to  
college and high school football teams in a region where, for some, 
a year has four seasons: regularly scheduled football games, bowl 
games, spring practice and recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pride in the strength of sectional football teams took its  
place along with pride in the valor of the Confederate army as a 
major source of Southern chauvinism,'' says ``A History of the 
South,'' published in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Falcons didn't inspire much Southern pride, winning only  
six games in their first three seasons and posting only two winning 
records in their first 12. They also now have nearby NFL franchises 
to compete with in North Carolina, Tennessee and Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Hulsey works for BellSouth Corp., whose corporate suite was  
rarely filled for Falcons games until this season, when one of its 
sales groups even bought a second suite to use as an incentive for 
salespeople.	   The excitement delights ``a close-knit family'' of veteran 
Falcons fans used to going it alone, Hulsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like having a new baby,'' she said. ``I'm getting  
goosebumps just talking about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons got another boost from World Championship Wrestling  
star Bill Goldberg, who led cheers and had Falcons players join him 
in the ring at the end of the Jan. 4 ``WCW Nitro'' event at the 
Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to do everything I can to give them as much credit  
as possible. They deserve it,'' said Goldberg, a Falcons nose 
tackle from 1992-94. ``Hopefully, everybody's not just jumping on 
the bandwagon.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Leg Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration approved the  
first drug in 15 years to help several million Americans with a 
circulatory disorder so painful it inhibits walking. 
</P>
<P>
	But the approval of Pletal on Friday for the painful leg  
syndrome known as intermittent claudication, the Latin word for 
limping, came amid criticism that the drug may endanger certain 
heart patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The disorder occurs in people, mostly the elderly, who have poor  
blood circulation in their legs. 
</P>
<P>
	The cholesterol that clogs heart arteries to cause heart attacks  
also can block leg arteries, causing peripheral vascular disease, 
mostly in elderly people. Intermittent claudication is a top 
symptom: Patients walk for a few minutes and then suddenly feel 
debilitating pain, cramping, numbness or severe fatigue in their 
leg muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, exercise is considered the best treatment. Studies  
show exercise programs that make patients walk 30 minutes to an 
hour a day significantly can increase the time that patients spend 
on their feet without pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approved Pletal, known chemically as cilostazol, based  
on studies that showed adding the prescription-only drug to 
exercise for six months could increase patients' walking distance 
by about two or three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``To healthy people this may not seem significant, but to this  
patient population, it could mean the difference between being 
homebound and actively living,'' said Dr. Gary Ingenito of the 
drug's manufacturer, Otsuka America Pharmaceutical Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the studies, most patients had difficulty  
walking half a block -- or 150 feet -- without pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can only walk a block, then being able to walk a couple  
more blocks is a really big improvement and might change your 
quality of life,'' agreed Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's 
Center for Drug Evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	But patients with heart failure -- a fairly frequent co-disease  
among people with poor leg circulation -- never should take Pletal, 
the FDA warned. 
</P>
<P>
	That is because Pletal is part of a class of drugs called  
phosphodiesterase inhibitors that can increase the risk of sudden 
death when taken by people with heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies of Pletal were too small and too short to tell whether  
it had any effect on patients' mortality, Woodcock said. But 
patients with any degree of heart failure should not take the drug 
because of the known danger of similar medicines. Brochures given 
to every patient will stress that warning. 
</P>
<P>
	But few doctors have the time to read FDA warnings anymore,  
meaning heart failure patients may wind up taking Pletal, said Dr. 
Lemuel Moye of the University of Texas, Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, some Pletal patients in the clinical trials  
experienced unexpected side effects of irregular heartbeats and a 
slightly increased heart rate. The FDA had asked its cardiac 
advisers whether this signaled a problem that should be studied 
further, and they ultimately voted 7-3 that the agency should 
approve Pletal. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``if it were my sister or my mother, I'd say to wait a  
year'' before trying Pletal to see if the concerns are real, said 
Moye, an FDA adviser who opposed Pletal. ``That's a terrible 
recommendation to have to make, but the haste with which these 
drugs are approved demands that physicians and patients be 
ultra-careful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pletal's main side effects were headache, heart palpitations and  
diarrhea, Woodcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Claudication patients also take blood-thinning drugs. Pletal has  
blood-thinning properties, too, but did not appear to cause 
bleeding problems when used together with aspirin. The FDA, 
however, warned that no one knows if it is safe when used with a 
new blood-thinner called Clopidogril that many claudication 
patients may begin using. It ordered Otsuka to continue studying 
that, as well as whether Pletal has any effect on the number of 
patient deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Otsuka said Pletal will be on pharmacy shelves within two  
months. A price has not been set.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Says He'll Serve Out Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch says he  
won't resign over the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, declaring he 
will remain IOC president ``until the last minute'' of his term. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Samaranch dismissed  
calls by several Olympic-related officials that he should step down 
to accept responsibility for misconduct committed by IOC members 
during his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are saying this, but I have been elected by the  
IOC members, and if I have the confidence of the members of the 
IOC, I will remain as president of the IOC until the last minute of 
my mandate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been president since 1980, is scheduled to  
complete his final term in 2001, when he will be 81. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 13 IOC members were identified in the internal inquiry  
into allegations of corruption in the awarding of the 2002 Winter 
Games to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said nine members were accused of serious offenses  
punishable by possible expulsion, while four others were cited for 
lesser violations. He declined to name the members or the offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC is considering a code of ethics for its  
members. This would replace a previous set of ethics rules drawn up 
by Marc Hodler, the Swiss executive who rocked the IOC last month 
with allegations of widespread Olympic corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe (Hodler's rules) are not enough,'' Samaranch said.  
``Maybe for the future, we must think to have an ethics code. This 
is something we are studying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch spoke for 40 minutes Thursday in his first one-on-one  
interview with the international media since the worst corruption 
scandal in Olympic history broke last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had wonderful years,'' he said. ``We had very successful  
games. And now we are in a storm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, calls for Samaranch's resignation have come from  
officials outside the Olympic inner circle: Ken Bullock, a member 
of the Salt Lake organizing committee; Robert Helmick, a former 
U.S. member of the IOC who resigned in an ethics scandal in 1991; 
and Rene Paquet, who headed the losing 2002 bid from Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch's position appears rock solid within the IOC.  
Executive board officials and rank-and-file members have all 
rejected calls for his resignation and expressed confidence he can 
lead a clean-up of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have received many, many letters from members of the IOC  
supporting the IOC, supporting me,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he should accept some of the blame for the crisis,  
Samaranch said, ``I think the blame is not only for the president, 
the blame is also for the International Olympic Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch set up a high-level IOC panel last month to  
investigate allegations that IOC members or their relatives 
received cash payments, scholarships, jobs, free medical care, 
lavish gifts and other inducements from Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC sent letters this week demanding  
explanations from the 13 members cited in the Salt Lake 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said four members had replied by Thursday; the deadline is  
next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least seven IOC members have been linked with the Salt Lake  
City investigation by Olympic officials, investigators, press 
reports or the members themselves -- Jean-Claude Ganga (Republic of 
Congo), David Sibandze (Swaziland), Bashir Attarabulsi (Libya), 
Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador), Sergio Santander (Chile), Anton Geesink 
(Netherlands) and Pirjo Haeggman (Finland). 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said some of the members may ask to appear before the  
six-man investigative panel when it meets in Lausanne on Jan. 23. 
The panel will report to the executive board the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	If investigators recommend that members be expelled, the board  
will suspend them immediately, Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Actual expulsion must wait until the next meeting of the full  
IOC assembly, scheduled next June in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Olympic Charter, expulsion requires a two-thirds  
majority vote of the IOC session. However, any members facing 
expulsion would be free to resign before then, Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC leader said it was still uncertain what action would be  
taken against members cited for lesser violations. He said official 
warnings were possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch did not completely close the door on the possibility  
that the 2002 Games could be moved from Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can speak only on behalf of the International Olympic  
Committee,'' he said. ``The hope, the desire of the IOC, is that 
the games will go on as planned in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler, the Swiss IOC executive who alleged widespread Olympic  
corruption last month, has suggested the games could be moved -- or 
some events held at other venues -- if Salt Lake City fails to meet 
its $1.45 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch said the IOC had no contingency plans in the event  
Salt Lake City organizers face a shortage of sponsorship funds and 
public support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sponsors and public opinion are waiting for the  
reaction of the IOC, how we can clean our house,'' he said. ``The 
reaction will be on the 24th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC has three priorities: close the Salt Lake  
City scandal, adopt special measures for the bidding on the 2006 
Winter Olympics and change the voting procedure for all future site 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system we have today is not working,'' he said. ``We have  
to change the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the executive board would consider recommendations to  
ban visits by IOC members to the six 2006 Winter Games candidates 
and leave the selection of future host cities to the board or other 
small ``electoral college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he may call a special session in the next few months to  
get changes adopted by the assembly before the 2006 site is 
selected at the June meeting in Seoul.

<HEADLINE> Hendrick Back As Head of Race Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, N.C. (AP) -- Now that the most successful team in  
Winston Cup racing has its leader back, Jeff Gordon has come up 
with what he thinks is the perfect gift to mark the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Hendrick, banished from the sport for a year as part of his  
sentence on a mail-fraud conviction, made a tearful return Friday 
to the team that has won the last four championships on NASCAR's 
top circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of those titles were captured by Gordon, who last year  
tied a series record by winning 13 races. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure that we keep that level of competition up  
so that we can see that excitement in his face in Victory Lane,'' 
Gordon said. ``Our first priority is to go to Daytona and get Rick 
to Victory Lane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrick isn't setting his sights that high, at least not yet.  
For now, he's just happy to be able to show up at the sprawling 
Hendrick Motorsports complex and get involved again in the team's 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just so special, it's hard to put into words,'' he said.  
``I think this is the greatest sport in the world, and I'm just 
privileged to be able to have fun in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Hendrick's first public appearance since he was sentenced  
Dec. 31, 1997, for his role in the American Honda Motor Co. bribery 
and kickback scandal. Hendrick was fined $250,000 and was ordered 
to stay in his Charlotte home and avoid the car business and his 
race team for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrick, who is fighting leukemia and is getting chemotherapy  
treatments, looked tired and moved slowly during a news conference 
held as part of the Charlotte Motor Speedway Media Tour. He refused 
to discuss his guilty plea or anything else about the Honda case. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's history. Let's talk about racing,'' said Hendrick, who  
has acknowledged giving hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, 
BMWs and houses to Honda executives, but claims he received nothing 
in return. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the questions during the news conference prompted  
emotional responses from Hendrick, who couldn't contain himself 
during one answer about his medical outlook. His voice began 
breaking and he lowered the microphone he was holding, turned away 
from the several hundred reporters in the room and wiped his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon patted Hendrick on the shoulder and tried to put his boss  
at ease. 
</P>
<P>
	``That helped me in New York,'' Gordon said, referring to his  
tearful acceptance speeches in the 1995 and 1997 Winston Cup awards 
banquets. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrick's younger brother, John, had no prior racing experience  
but took over the day-to-day oversight of Hendrick Motorsports 
during his brother's absence. Now that Rick is back, he will hold 
the title of chief executive office and John will be the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I want to make real clear is he's making all the  
decisions this year,'' John said, ``and I'm real happy about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Hendrick said he plans on being in Florida next month for  
the season-opening Daytona 500 and will attend as many of the 
circuit's 34 races as his health permits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan to go to them all, but I know that's not possible,'' he  
said. ``My old body's tired, but my mind's zooming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrick, 49, said his doctors are hopeful that the chemotherapy  
treatments will soon wipe out the leukemia, and he used a racing 
analogy to describe his prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one time I was a lap down, but I think I'm going to get to  
the finish line now,'' he said. ``I've still got maybe 100 more 
laps of a 500-mile race, so it's going to take a little bit more 
time. But the good news is it's working.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- AirTouch Communications is being sold to  
Britain's Vodafone Group PLC in a $56 billion cash-and-stock deal, 
creating the world's largest cellular phone company. The 
announcement late today ended a two-week bidding war. Just hours 
before, Bell Atlantic said it had broken off talks with AirTouch, 
the nation's second-largest independent cellular phone company. By

	House: Clinton Witnesses Needed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House GOP managers said today the Senate  
should summon witnesses to testify in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. They suggested that Clinton himself could be 
invited to appear. Arguing the need for witnesses, Rep. Bill 
McCollum said common sense indicates ``it's the president who is 
not telling the truth.'' He said if senators have doubts they 
should bring in others to testify. The White House said Republicans 
want witnesses only because ``they do not have a case.''

	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An abortion rights case erupted into calls  
for a mistrial today when a federal judge told a witness: 
``Truthful means truthful.... This is not a Clinton deposition!'' 
Judge Robert E. Jones quickly apologized for what he described as a 
jest at the end of a long week of testimony. The defense asked for 
a mistrial, which Jones denied. A dozen defendants across the 
nation acknowledge that a Web site called ``The Nuremberg Files'' 
contain strong anti-abortion statements and graphic images. But 
they claim it is constitutionally protected political speech.

Clinton lawyer Paul Gaffney questioned Mrs. Tripp during a civil 
deposition this week that was unrelated to the president's trial. 
Mrs. Tripp acknowledged she was ``not complete under oath'' in 1995

<HEADLINE> Industrial Production Growth Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a pickup during the last few months of  
the year, growth in production at the nation's factories, mines and 
utilities declined in 1998 to the slowest pace in five years, 
reflecting economic turmoil abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial production increased 0.2 percent in December from the  
month before and 3.7 percent in 1998 from the year before, the 
Federal Reserve said today. The latter was the slowest rate of 
increase since a 3.5 percent gain in 1993 and followed a robust 6 
percent advance in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	American manufacturers were hard hit by loss of export sales to  
Asian nations and other countries hard-hit by the slump that began 
in Thailand in mid-1997, spread through Asia and has since hit both 
Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	But, there were some signs of recovery during the final three  
months of the year. Industrial production advanced at a 3.2 percent 
annual rate after a gain at a meager 0.9 percent rate in the 
July-September quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The pickup occurred even though output at utilities declined at  
a 12.5 percent annual rate during the quarter, the result of 
unusually mild weather. Just at factories, the production pace 
picked up from 0.4 percent in the third quarter to 5.1 percent in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the acceleration in manufacturing reflected a rebound at  
auto manufacturing plants following strikes that idled General 
Motors in June and July. Nevertheless, the output of other 
manufacturing industries grew at a 3.3 percent rate in the fourth 
quarter after little change in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in December, manufacturing output increased 0.1 percent,  
mining output -- including oil wells -- fell 0.6 percent and utility 
production rebounded 1.6 percent after steep drops during October 
and November. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, as output growth slowed, industrial companies  
continued to expand their capacity to produce at a brisk rate. It 
rose 5 percent, the third consecutive year at 5 percent or better. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, industrial firms had excess capacity. They were  
using 80.9 percent of it, the lowest level since October 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, some industries -- such as manufacturers of  
computers and office equipment -- continued to expand rapidly. 
Output grew 54.1 percent from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the 
fourth quarter of 1998. It rose 29.2 percent for semiconductors and 
28.5 percent for home electronic equipment but fell 13 percent for 
iron and steel, 8.7 percent for tobacco, 7.4 percent for oil and 
gas, 5.9 percent for apparel and 2.1 percent for chemical products. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department said today that inventories  
at American businesses rose a moderate 0.4 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted $1.09 trillion in November, in line with an identical gain 
in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say backlogs of unsold goods were relatively lean  
heading into 1999. Too big a buildup can signal production cutbacks 
as businesses work to reduce backlogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Business sales rose 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted $785  
billion. There were enough goods on shelves and backlots to meet 
demand for 1.39 months at the current sales pace, the same as the 
previous two months.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Starts Farmers' Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- In a bid to assist farmers financially hurt  
by a multistate tobacco deal, Philip Morris will contribute $300 
million to a trust fund that eventually could grow many times 
larger. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter obtained Friday by The Associated Press, the company  
said it would put the money into the fund regardless of whether 
other tobacco companies decide to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris would make additional payments over the next nine  
years if the three other cigarette companies -- R.J. Reynolds, Brown 
&AMP; Williamson and Lorillard -- decide to contribute as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the proposed fund could grow to $5.15 billion --  
helping tobacco farmers offset losses stemming from a declining 
demand for their product. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Parrish, Philip Morris' senior vice president of  
corporate affairs, said in the letter that the company believes the 
fund is the ``best long-term approach to help stabilize the 
economic future of the tobacco community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers' trust fund would be the second phase of the huge  
$206 billion tobacco settlement signed Nov. 23 by tobacco companies 
and 46 states to settle lawsuits over the costs of treating sick 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish's letter said the settlement will result in a  
significant reduction in demand for tobacco nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, flue-cured tobacco quotas are 30 percent less than two  
years ago, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced buyers 
will purchase only 292 million pounds of burley tobacco this year, 
down from 421.1 million pounds last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in no one's best long-term interest to devise a system  
which merely makes a bad situation worse by encouraging growers to 
produce tobacco for which there is no demand,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe growers should be encouraged to grow as much  
tobacco as can be sold, and that both growers and quota holders 
should be compensated for the economic harm they suffer as a result 
of the state settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson spokesman Mark Smith described the Philip  
Morris move as positive.

	``We've said before we're very supportive of that plan,'' he  
said. ``We're hoping that all four companies are involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Reynolds initially opposed the trust fund, saying a  
better way to help farmers is to promise to buy more American-grown 
tobacco. But Reynolds spokesman Nat Walker said the company still 
has an open mind about the deal.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Drug Targets Hispanics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ad for a controversial diabetes drug  
targets Hispanics, who are at high risk for diabetes, and touts the 
drug in Spanish: ``I only have to take Rezulin once a day, which 
really makes my life easier,'' the smiling diabetic says. 
</P>
<P>
	Turn the magazine page and there is the ad's official warning  
that Rezulin may cause liver failure. But the text is in English. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rezulin campaign is the latest in an explosion of  
prescription drug advertising aimed at patients, $620 million worth 
in the first half of 1998 alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Turn on the TV or open a magazine and you are sure to find  
advertising of prescription drugs for whatever ails you. Allergy 
sufferers scale mountain peaks with Zyrtec. Valtrex touts help for 
genital herpes with just one dose a day. The morning you forget 
your keys you spot the Aricept ad: ``Is it just forgetfulness... or 
Alzheimer's disease?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even former presidential candidate Bob Dole is pitching  
prescriptions, on soon-to-debut TV ads for the impotence pill 
Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say the ads cause them a headache.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's looking for the magic bullet,'' said Dr. Edward  
Hill, a family physician in Tupelo, Miss. He helped compile a new 
American Medical Association report that found doctors are 
``bombarded with misinformed requests for prescriptions, and met 
with suspicion and hostility when they deny the request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of 2,500 doctors by IMS Health found 53 percent had a  
``significant increase'' in patients requesting prescriptions by 
brand name last year. Most popular: Claritin for allergies, long 
the most advertised drug; Viagra; and allergy competitor Allegra. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug industry says ads are valuable because they alert  
consumers to medicines they might otherwise never know about -- and 
anyway, doctors still control prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``At their best, ads can also help patients to recognize  
symptoms and prompt them to tell their doctors,'' Richard Jay 
Kogan, chairman of Claritin manufacturer Schering-Plough Corp., 
wrote in a recent editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Some do stress risks.  
</P>
<P>
	After touting Propecia, the anti-baldness pill for men, a stern  
voice on the TV ad warns women not to even touch the pills for fear 
of birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
	But ads full of smiling, healthy-looking people imply ``it's a  
wonder drug, and downplays the side effects,'' said the AMA's Hill. 
He has told patients that a drug on TV ``may be exactly the same 
class of drug they already take and not as good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor are doctors infallible.  
</P>
<P>
	A study of ads in the medical journals doctors read found  
inaccuracies and misleading statements that could lead to improper 
prescriptions in 44 percent of cases. Add patients demanding a 
highly advertised drug, and the result can be dangerous, contends 
Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	He cites the Spanish Rezulin ad accompanied by the warning label  
in English, and asked the Food and Drug Administration to make 
manufacturer Parke Davis run a correction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It clearly was an inadvertent error'' by the company's outside  
advertising agency that already has been fixed, said spokeswoman 
Carol Goodrich. Although the ads appeared in bilingual 
publications, ``this is something we do not do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ensuring drug ads are accurate is the FDA's job, but it  
typically does not see ads before they're published. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA agrees fair advertising can educate, and the agency  
actually sparked the ad boom two years ago by easing restrictions 
on TV ads. Since then, the FDA counts 29 prescription drugs 
advertised on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA has warned their makers 17 times about violations such  
as downplaying risks or stretching benefits. One TV allergy ad, for 
example, read the drug's side effects so fast consumers could not 
hear them. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``most of the information is pretty decent,'' insists FDA's  
Nancy Ostrove. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, to discover what consumers learn from drug ads, the FDA  
is preparing a nationwide survey that may guide how it ultimately 
regulates them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, meanwhile, says doctors must frankly discuss drug choices  
with patients -- and research the facts behind ads. He did that, and 
thus said OK when an allergy patient requested Allegra. ``It did 
influence me,'' he said. ``But the evidence was very, very good.''

<HEADLINE> ABC's Union Lockout Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A agreement by the union representing 2,400 ABC  
employees to warn the network of any future strikes has brought an 
end to an 11-week lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're done,'' Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the National  
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Camera operators, producers and other behind-the-scenes workers  
in five cities will be back no later than Monday afternoon, the 
network said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The return of our NABET-represented employees and the closing  
of what has been a difficult period for all concerned ... is a very 
welcome development,'' said ABC president Robert Iger. 
</P>
<P>
	Working without a contract since March 1997, the network's NABET  
members staged a one-day strike over health benefits on Nov. 2. The 
next day, ABC locked them out of their jobs until they promised 
advance warning on future job actions. The union had refused until 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue said the final hitch to a back-to-work agreement  
centered on a disputed ``handful of firings'' of NABET members 
during the lockout. Under terms arrived at Friday, these members' 
job status will be determined through binding arbitration before, 
not after, the union votes on a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union's commitment to those individuals, whose careers and  
families were threatened, was what held up completion of the 
agreement,'' Donahue said. He credited ``vigorous assistance'' from 
Communications Workers of America President Morton Bahr and Labor 
Secretary Alexis Herman for helping reach the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The union must now put the contract offer to a vote within two  
weeks, Donahue said, with a decision from its membership expected 
within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overarching point is that we succeeded in getting our  
members back inside, off the picket lines, while they consider the 
company's final offer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the lockout, ABC used temporary workers while NABET  
members walked picket lines at network facilities in New York, 
Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Though technical glitches were sometimes evident to viewers,  
they felt a greater impact from the refusal of many entertainers 
and Democratic politicians to appear on ABC shows like 
``Nightline,'' ``Good Morning America'' and ``This Week.'' Friday, 
NABET officially called off its boycott.

motherhood and life's daily irritations appeared in the Tulsa World 
for 37 years, died Wednesday. She was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1943 she went to work as a reporter for International News

	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Jerzy Grotowski, an avant-garde Polish  
director who was one of the most influential theatrical innovators 
of his time, died Thursday from leukemia and a heart condition. He 
was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Grotowski studied acting and directing at the State Theater  
School in Krakow and in Moscow. He made his directorial debut in 
1959 at the Old Theater in Krakow with ``Chairs,'' by Eugene 
Ionesco. 
</P>
<P>
	He found world recognition with his Laboratory Theater, which he  
founded in the provincial town of Opole, 210 miles southwest of 
Warsaw. Grotowski left Poland in 1982 for the United States, and 
the company closed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after leaving Poland, he moved to Italy and opened a  
theater center in Pontedera.

who in the early 1980s survived an assassination attempt by the 
Irish Republican Army, died Friday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed a judge in 1964 and served as lord chief  
justice -- Northern Ireland's senior position overseeing the highest 
court of appeal -- from 1971 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowry was awarded an honorary lordship in 1979, and three years  
later survived an IRA bid on his life while visiting Queen's 
University in Belfast. None of the four bullets fired hit him, but 
one struck and wounded a professor nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Lowry took up a new senior judicial post in London.  
</P>
<P>
	He retired in 1994 on his 75th birthday.

credits for landmark buildings such as the John Hancock Tower, died 
Saturday of heart failure. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the John Hancock building, he was credited with  
the Christian Science Church extension and the Long Wharf Hotel in 
Boston, the Julliard School of Music in New York, the Toronto City 
Opera House, and the Embassy Suites Hotels in Boston and 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>

	PARIS (AP) -- Raymond Peynet, the cartoon illustrator whose  
drawings of young lovers embodied romance for generations of 
French, died Thursday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Peynet created his starry-eyed ``Lovers'' during World War II:  
they hold hands, kiss and simply embrace in an expression of tender 
devotion that his daughter, Annie Peynet, said reflected his own 
happy marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Peynet also designed a series of dolls portraying the women of  
Paris. Britain's Queen Elizabeth purchased a set on a state visit 
here in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	His drawings of ``Les Amoureux'' (The Lovers) were widely used  
in France to symbolize Valentine's Day; they were emblazoned on 
scarves, greeting cards, posters, jewelry, a postage stamp, and 
even national lottery tickets sold on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The postage stamp inspired French singer Georges Brassens to  
compose one of his best known melodies, ``Lovers on Park Benches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two museums in Japan and two in France are devoted solely to his  
work. Three statues of the Lovers were erected in Japan, including 
one in Hiroshima symbolizing love and peace.

	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Aldo van Eyck, considered the most  
important Dutch architect of the 20th century, died Thursday of a 
heart attack. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Eyck's most famous creation was the State Orphanage designed  
in Amsterdam in 1959, which was credited with smashing all 
architectural conventions of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The simple, village-like structure featured small houses for the  
children linked by covered plains and walkways. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Eyck, who often collaborated with his wife, Annie, also  
designed a colorful house for single mothers in the Dutch capital 
and dozens of children's playgrounds throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 magazine article named Van Eyck the nation's Architect of  
the Century. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Eyck also gained fame by designing the 1949 international  
exhibition of experimental art at Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum. The 
exhibition later became known as the Cobra exhibition, featuring 
works by Dutch, Belgian and Danish artists. The exhibition drew its 
name from the first letters of Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam.

<HEADLINE> Ice, Rain Glaze the East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Snow and freezing rain put a hard-shell finish on the East on  
Friday, causing deadly highway accidents, backing up airline 
flights and knocking out power to thousands of people. By 
afternoon, rain and melting snow caused a slushy mess for many. 
</P>
<P>
	``Snow, sleet, hail, ice, rain, floods,'' James Ellis of New  
Rochelle, N.Y., said, trying to remember all the weather he had 
seen in 48 hours. ``Slush, frozen slush, snowmelt. Lots of branches 
down. Ice, did I say ice?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The snow that blanketed the Northeast on Thursday was topped by  
freezing rain early Friday, creating a slick coating over much of 
the region during the morning rush hour. As the day wore on and 
temperatures climbed out of the teens, people found themselves 
slogging through slush and high water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aggghhhh,'' screeched Lori Gulliver, 39, as her stepped into a  
puddle of frigid slop while crossing a Boston street on her way to 
work. ``It's a mess!'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight people died Thursday and Friday in traffic  
accidents in West Virginia, Maryland and Massachusetts that were 
blamed on snow and ice. Earlier this month, at least 89 deaths were 
blamed on a major storm that hammered the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice forced the closing of a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 87  
north of Albany, N.Y. Slick roads also caused two pileups on 
interstate ramps near Parsippany, N.J. Numerous fender-benders were 
also reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, commuter trains were delayed and traffic slowed to  
a crawl. Subway travel was hampered in New York, Boston and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weather is for the birds -- ducks,'' said Efrain Burgos, a  
doorman in New York City. ``But if it wouldn't have rained, we'd 
have 2 feet of snow by now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three major airports serving the city canceled many early  
flights and worked to resume normal operation as the temperature 
rose. Boston's airport had to close temporarily to de-ice runways 
after snow changed to freezing rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airlines all woke up with lot of ice on their airplanes,''  
New York Port Authority spokesman Bill Cahill said. ``They spent 
the morning deicing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm glazed trees with ice, breaking off limbs and knocking  
out power from New York to Virginia. About 349,000 customers lost 
power in Maryland and the nation's capital at the height of the 
storm; 280,000 were still without power Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 customers lost service in Virginia, and there  
were smaller outages in New Jersey, New York and around 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to get even warmer through the weekend, with  
temperatures headed toward the 50s as far north as Boston on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, National Park Ranger David Wahlgren chopped  
away with a garden spade at patches of ice on the walk outside 
Independence Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even at Yellowstone and Yosemite, where I have worked before,  
you end up shoveling a lot of snow,'' said Wahlgren, a 26-year-old 
Oregon native. ``It's just part of the job.''

<HEADLINE> Alaskans Chime In on Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- Out here in the continent's frozen  
corner, far from the nation's slick urban dwellers and their 
citified ways, talk of President Clinton's predicament is ... 
startlingly similar to the rest of the nation's impeachment 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be surprising, because Alaskans consider themselves a  
people apart. ``The Last Frontier'' may be Alaska's license-plate 
motto, but ``We don't care how they do it Outside'' qualifies as 
its political mantra. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, Alaskans are as conflicted about the president's  
troubles as folks in just about any other place. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Bill Weith. Retired state trooper. Last summer he built a  
new saloon out of spruce logs, nearly single-handedly, because he 
thought this town needed a quiet place to drink tasty Alaska 
microbrews. 
</P>
<P>
	Weith fits the Wasilla profile. He's white and conservative, and  
this suburb an hour's drive north of Anchorage is known as one of 
the most conservative places in a state that gave Clinton just 33 
percent of its votes in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Surefire Clinton-hater, right?  
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, Clinton is no different than JFK or  
Dwight Eisenhower, and he's doing a heck of a job,'' Weith said 
while parked on a stool in his new bar, the Schwabenhof, which 
opened for business Monday. It still smells more like fresh wood 
than stale beer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first place, they never should have investigated him  
for it,'' he said, referring to Clinton's relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky. ``And I say that as a person who's been a Republican all 
my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With its boomtown, strip-malls-and-fast-food ambiance, Wasilla  
is the punch line for most of the redneck jokes told in Anchorage. 
In return, Wasilla's 5,100 residents tend to think Anchorage folks 
are a little too citified. 
</P>
<P>
	But in both places these days, people are relieved that they're  
so far outside the Beltway. Wasilla, 3,346 miles from the nation's 
capital, is about as far away from Clinton's troubles as an 
American can get while still being on the continent's road system. 
</P>
<P>
	Another former cop, parked on a bar stool across town at the  
Veteran of Foreign Wars, Susitna Post, used this analogy to explain 
why the effort to oust the president is a colossal waste of money: 
It's like a young officer going out on his first domestic violence 
call, Bill Sullivan said. You quickly learn that even though the 
wife may have two black eyes, she's probably not without sin 
herself. Not that Sullivan condones hitting a woman for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
	His point, delivered beneath the wary eye of his wife, Cherlon,  
one stool over, is that every cheating-heart story has two sides, 
and the smart cop learns to avoid getting in the middle of a 
couple's troubles. Same goes for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sex is a different thing,'' the Korean War veteran said. ``I'd  
feel worse about Clinton if he was lying about taking $20 from the 
U.S. Treasury rather than about an extramarital affair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Anita Wells, helping her husband close up his knife  
shop in the Cottonwood Creek Mall on a snowy Thursday evening. 
Saying the words ``Clinton'' and ``impeachment'' to the 39-year-old 
teacher fires her up like a well-tuned snowblower. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do I tell my 11- and 13-year-old kids? He doesn't have to  
follow the law because he's president?'' she asked. ``What do I 
tell my students? If you want to break the law get a powerful 
job?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shop's decor, a collection of broad swords, rapiers,  
crossbows, spears, hunting knives, blow guns and other weapons, 
seemed to add weight to her opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a predatory pattern toward women, toward lying,  
toward shaping the truth to fit his own needs,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Medicare To Adjust HMO Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare will pay private health plans more  
for patients who are sick and less for those who are healthy, 
starting in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incentives for plans, such as they are, to enroll only  
more healthy beneficiaries will be removed,'' said Medicare's 
deputy administrator, Michael Hash, who announced details of the 
change Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress ordered the payment change in the 1997 balanced budget  
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare officials estimate it will result in a net reduction of  
payments to health plans of $200 million next year, and $11.2 
billion over a five-year transition period. 
</P>
<P>
	Health plans appealed to lawmakers Friday to reconsider, saying  
that combined with recent payment curbs, the change could prompt 
more plans to pull out of Medicare. Already, health plans have 
dropped more than 400,000 elderly and disabled patients this year, 
citing lower-than-expected payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real losers in this fight will be Medicare  
beneficiaries,'' said Karen Ignagni, president of the American 
Association of Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most of Medicare's 39 million elderly and disabled  
beneficiaries have their individual medical bills paid directly by 
the government, about 15 percent have instead chosen to enroll in 
health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, that get fixed monthly 
payments from Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the health plan payments vary according to a Medicare  
patient's age, sex and medical costs where they live, regardless of 
their health. Some advocates for the elderly and disabled say that 
has led the plans to aim advertising and marketing mainly at the 
healthiest Medicare beneficiaries in order to make more money. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in 2000, Medicare will shift over five years to a  
system that will pay plans more for people who have been 
hospitalized recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Once fully phased in, the new extra payments will range from  
$1,910 a year to as much as $26,464, depending on the seriousness 
of the illness that led to a person's hospitalization and the 
likelihood that it will result in an increased need for medical 
care in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	For comparatively healthy people, the plans will get as much as  
20 percent less under the new system than they do now.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Clarifies Schedule Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- The legislation approved by the NCAA  
Division I Board of Directors last week will permit schools to 
participate in a maximum of 28 regular-season games but did not 
eliminate the certified events such as tournaments in Hawaii, 
Alaska and Puerto Rico or the Preseason NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	In a clarification Friday to the legislation approved Jan. 12,  
the NCAA said the new rule eliminates the exemption to the maximum 
number of regular-season games, not the events. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, teams that played in this season's Maui  
Invitational, Great Alaska Shootout, Puerto Rico Shootout or 
Preseason NIT did not have to count games played in those events 
toward their regular-season limit of 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with 1999-2000 season, a school participating in any of  
those events will have to count the games played there toward the 
new maximum of 28. The events, regardless of how many games are 
actually played, count as one game toward the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with the 2000-01 season, schools cannot play in more  
than one event in a season and not more than two of those events in 
a four-year period. They cannot be in the same event outside the 
continental United States more than once every four years or return 
to the same state or territory for another event during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	If a team does not participate in any of the certified events,  
it can schedule a 28th regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
	The postseason NIT is exempt from the requirement.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyer Interrogates Tripp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time since Linda Tripp's secret  
tape recording sparked an impeachment crisis, a lawyer for 
President Clinton and his wife interrogated the Pentagon worker and 
launched a wide-ranging attack on her motives and credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	During a civil deposition this week unrelated to the president's  
trial, Clinton lawyer Paul Gaffney got Mrs. Tripp to acknowledge 
she was ``not complete under oath'' in 1995 congressional testimony 
and that another time she was untruthful in a taped conversation 
with book agent Lucianne Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp frequently clashed with Gaffney, at one point even  
suggesting that Hillary Rodham Clinton was behind an ongoing 
investigation into whether Mrs. Tripp had violated Maryland's 
wiretap laws by recording Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you been given any indication by Maryland authorities  
that they cleared you of any criminal wrongdoing?'' Gaffney asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, certainly not,'' Mrs. Tripp retorted. ``Mrs. Clinton  
hasn't allowed them to do that yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony came in a lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch, a  
conservative group that has sued the Clinton administration over 
the White House's gathering of hundreds of FBI background files of 
Republican appointees. Mrs. Clinton is a defendant in the lawsuit. 
Mrs. Tripp is a witness because she worked in the White House 
counsel's office at the time the files were gathered. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton's impeachment trial didn't come up, his lawyers  
could display snippets of Mrs. Tripp's videotaped testimony later 
in the trial if they get permission from senators to bring in 
outside evidence. Presidential lawyer David Kendall declined 
comment Friday on that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's spokesman, Philip Coughter, said Friday that ``Mr.  
Gaffney's performance was of a piece with the White House tactics 
we have seen over and over again and which we have come to deplore, 
namely attempts to shift the focus from those who may have 
committed crimes to those who may have witnessed them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During two hours of cross-examination Wednesday, Mrs. Tripp said  
she had heard from ``press sources'' that ``Mrs. Clinton and her 
people'' had contacted Maryland political figures to trigger the 
wiretap probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no pressure put on this office by anybody,'' Steven  
Halpert, a law clerk in the prosecutor's office, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney repeatedly asked questions that touched on Mrs. Tripp's  
secret tape-recorded phone calls of Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm advising my client not to make any further comment ...  
because it could tend to incriminate her,'' interrupted Tripp 
lawyer Anthony Zaccagnini. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will you say for the record?'' Gaffney pressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``That I don't acknowledge the existence of tapes,'' Mrs. Tripp  
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't acknowledge the existence of tapes you may have  
made?'' Gaffney asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Mrs. Tripp replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney frequently challenged Mrs. Tripp's credibility, noting  
that she now says she saw a document with Mrs. Clinton's 
handwriting on it directing the purge of the 1993 White House 
travel office firings but did not mention the document in past 
testimony. No such document has been found. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not lie under oath'' but ``I was not complete under  
oath,'' Mrs. Tripp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney suggested that Mrs. Tripp, contrary to her grand jury  
testimony in the Lewinsky case, had been working on a book project 
on the Clinton White House that she says she walked away from in 
1996 and never rekindled. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney pulled out a transcript of a tape-recorded conversation  
between New York literary agent Ms. Goldberg and Mrs. Tripp in 
September 1997 in which Mrs. Tripp talks about having renewed the 
abandoned book project. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I represented to Lucianne that day and what was true are  
two separate things,'' Mrs. Tripp said, explaining she actually 
hadn't renewed work on the book. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you weren't telling Ms. Goldberg the truth there; is that  
fair to say?'' asked Gaffney. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's correct,'' Mrs. Tripp replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney also asked whether Mrs. Tripp is sending out  
fund-raising letters ``to people who one might expect to be hostile 
to the Clintons'' in order to raise money for her legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they get their lists from the DNC (Democratic  
National Committee),'' Mrs. Tripp snapped.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Say House Short on Charisma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican prosecutors are long on facts and  
short on charisma in laying out the impeachment case against 
President Clinton -- but that may not harm them, legal observers 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it great oratory? No. But is the jury likely to fall  
asleep? No,'' Denver lawyer Larry Pozner said. ``The case is so 
unlike any other case the rules don't apply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The House managers are politicians, not trial lawyers, and  
they present like politicians, but their audience is politicians 
and it will work,'' added Pozner, president of the National 
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The most interesting moment came at the end of Friday's  
proceedings when Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, objected to Rep. Bob 
Barr's frequent references to senators as jurors, said Los Angeles 
lawyer and former district attorney Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William Rehnquist, presiding over the trial,  
declared Harkins' point that senators are not the same as trial 
jurors well taken and asked attorneys to refrain from calling the 
senators jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	After four House prosecutors spent more than five hours Thursday  
methodically spelling out the facts underlying the perjury and 
obstruction of justice charges, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., gave an 
animated one-hour recap Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged senators to look at the ``big picture'' and rely on  
their common sense to convict the president and remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about a lot of lies. This is about a lot of perjury,''  
McCollum said. He said Clinton lied about his affair with Monica 
Lewinsky ``again and again ... and tried to get others to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Lubet, a Northwestern University law professor, gave  
McCollum high marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that really made it good was its spontaneity,''  
Lubet said. ``He had a clear mastery of the information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, on the opening day of House arguments Thursday,  
Reps. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., and James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., read 
closely from their scripts, and Sensenbrenner spoke almost in a 
monotone. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you read from a text it's virtually impossible for anyone  
to pay attention,'' said Reiner. ``If they put that aside and try 
to talk to you, it's a different matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., used no notes at all in a 20-minute  
presentation Friday that accused Clinton of creating a ``chain 
reaction of falsehoods under oath'' to withhold information about 
his affair with Ms. Lewinsky from Paula Jones' sex-harassment 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, used videotape clips Friday to  
illustrate his explanation of perjury's legal elements. Senators 
and TV viewers saw Clinton being sworn in at the federal grand jury 
and telling the grand jurors the answer to a question depended on 
``what the meaning of is, is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those same clips also were shown a day earlier, along with the  
well-known one of Clinton wagging his finger and telling Americans 
he did not have sexual relations ``with that woman, Miss 
Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson's presentation Thursday was praised by  
several legal observers as the best of that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson, a former U.S. attorney in Arkansas who once  
prosecuted President Clinton's half-brother Roger on drug charges, 
opened by saying, ``This is certainly a humbling experience for a 
small-town lawyer.'' But his largely memorized one-hour, 20-minute 
presentation on the obstruction charge was more dynamic than those 
that preceded him. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawyers thought the House members' presentations included  
so much interpretation of events they sounded more like the closing 
arguments of a trial rather than the opening. 
</P>
<P>
	New York lawyer Gerald Lefcourt made up a new word for it,  
``clopenings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't know if they're ever going to get to call  
witnesses, and this may be their only shot,'' said another New York 
lawyer, Bruce Yannett, who was a prosecutor in the Reagan- and 
Bush-era Iran-Contra arms for hostages case. 
</P>
<P>
	Yannett and others suggested that House members' decision to  
outline the case in great detail might undercut their effort to 
persuade the Senate to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really is nothing new. You get the sense that we've  
heard this song before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being thorough requires a methodical, systematic approach that  
may not be exciting to listen to,'' added Indiana University law 
professor Charles Geyh, who was special counsel to Pennsylvania 
state House members in the 1994 impeachment of a state Supreme 
Court justice.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Oregon St. Coach Settles Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A college softball coach fired from her  
job in 1994 says she hopes her $1.09 million settlement will show 
other women that they can make a living in a sports world still 
dominated by men. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's relief, knowing that I won't be in debt the rest of my  
natural born days,'' said Vickie Dugan, who won her 
gender-discrimination lawsuit against Oregon State and agreed to an 
out-of-court settlement this week. ``Win or lose, I knew I was 
doing what I had to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dugan was fired as interim softball coach after her teams went  
just 64-201 between 1988 and 1994. Then-athletic director Dutch 
Baughman launched a search for her replacement in 1994, after the 
Beavers went 0-24. 
</P>
<P>
	Dugan sued, claiming she was paid less than male coaches in  
similar jobs at the school, and that the department had violated 
her free-speech rights by retaliating against her for speaking out 
on gender-equity issues. 
</P>
<P>
	An all-woman jury in Eugene, Ore., sided with Dugan in November  
1997, awarding her $1.275 million -- $1.09 million from the school 
and $185,000 from Dutch Baughman. 
</P>
<P>
	The school appealed the verdict, and in July 1998 U.S. District  
Judge Michael Hogan lowered the damages to $623,000. But the State 
of Oregon, which represented the university during the trial, 
agreed to also pay Dugan's legal bills of more than $460,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point was to send a message,'' Dugan said. ``It  
shows that if women or girls want to go into coaching, they can 
earn enough to make it a career -- that it isn't just a profession 
for men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.09 million settlement will be paid by the state's Risk  
Management Division, which keeps a pool of money set aside for 
damage claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The university was disappointed with the original decision,  
but this settlement gives it some closure, and we're pleased to 
have it behind us,'' Oregon State spokesman Mark Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baughman, now living in Southlake, Texas, could not be reached  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dugan said she received the settlement check on Monday. She  
plans to make a donation to the New York-based Women's Sports 
Foundation, which was founded by Billie Jean King and specializes 
in Title IX issues. She also will reimburse the $17,000 given to 
her by the American Association of University Women Legal Advocacy 
Fund, based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Dugan was hired part-time to fill in for the full-time softball  
coach, who was on leave. Her salary was $9,750 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dugan, who now teaches physical education and coaches softball  
at a junior college in Portersville, Calif., said she doesn't see 
herself returning to NCAA coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told that this would probably cost me my career, and I  
think it did,'' she said. ``I hate to say there's still an old 
boys' network out there, but that's the reality.''

<HEADLINE> Graf Says She Can Win Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Three tough matches and a stomach  
illness have left Steffi Graf looking old beyond her 29 years and 
hardly a picture of health ahead of the Australian Open title in 
Melbourne next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But Graf, a winner of 21 Grand Slam titles, believes she has the  
game to worry the top seeds and the legs to carry her through seven 
rounds in a fortnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't ask for any more than where I am right now,'' Graf  
said Friday, after losing 6-2, 7-5 to world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport 
at the Adidas International. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf scored tough three-set wins against Serena and Venus  
Williams on consecutive days before falling to Davenport in 
Friday's semis. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport had too much class and accuracy Friday but the loss  
was probably better for Graf than another three-setter and a final 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good that I'm not going to do anything tomorrow, I'll  
relax and regain some energy and I should be fine for the 
tournament,'' said Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	While Graf rests, Davenport and No.2 Martina Hingis will beat  
each other up for the Sydney title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone exceptionally well this week. Looking back a week  
ago I didn't plan on playing and I've been in hard situations which 
have turned out well,'' Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
	A week earlier she was forced out of the final of a Hong Kong  
exhibition tournament because of a stomach illness. She would not 
elaborate on the exact problem but it clearly affected her more 
than she acknowledged in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've felt good about the way I was playing and the way I was  
getting through them,'' Graf said. ``And it's a lot easier in 
Melbourne, rather than playing day after day here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's victories over the Williams' sisters took all her fight  
as they tried to hammer her out of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	She is coming back after major knee and wrist surgery in the  
past two years and if she enjoys success in Melbourne it would stem 
from her efforts late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've pretty much beaten everybody in the last few tournaments  
and that gives me a good outlook for what's coming,'' Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
	She played Davenport five times last year for a 2-3 record,  
winning two of the last three. Graf won her only meeting against 
Hingis in 1998 and holds a 7-1 career advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``She played very well to get to the semis and was probably a  
little worn out today,'' Davenport said Friday. ``She can be 
unbelievable at times and when you've won 21 Grand Slams, you've 
got to count her as a favorite no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just relieved to see her on the other side of the  
draw.''

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bond Prices Fall / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices fell Friday, ending a big  
three-day rally that had resulted from a ``flight-to-safety'' rush 
to park money in U.S. government securities amid apprehension over 
Brazil's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 1/32  
points, or $10.31 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 5.12 percent from 5.05 percent 
late Thursday. But bonds still were well above levels of the end of 
last week, when yields were 5.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As Brazil stopped pumping money into the defense of its currency  
Friday, stocks surged higher worldwide Friday and cash began 
flowing out of the Treasury bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's refusal to prop up its currency, the real, was seen in  
financial markets as a way for Brazil to attract foreign investment 
and hold on to its currency reserves. It had been spending billions 
to support the battered currency, which was devalued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries that Brazil's plight would worsen and spread through the  
Western Hemisphere had driven many investors into bonds earlier in 
the week. U.S. Treasury bonds are perceived as among the safest 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	In other bond trading Friday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell between 7/32 point and 1/4 point, and intermediate 
maturities fell 13/16 point to 5/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market session was shortened Friday, ending at 2 p.m.  
EST, as traders got a head start on a holiday weekend. U.S. 
financial markets will be closed Monday in observance of Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 4.35 
points from late Thursday to 1,319.29 as of the early close Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.42 percent as the  
discount remained unchanged from late Thursday at 4.32 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.42 percent, as the discount rose 0.03 
percentage point to 4.28 percent. One-year yields were 4.45 percent 
as the discount rose by 0.05 percentage point to 4.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, remained unchanged at 4.81 compared to late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 124 19/32 Friday from 124 13/16 
Thursday. The average yield to maturity rose to 5.17 percent from 
5.16 percent.

<HEADLINE> USDA Makes Organic Meat Provision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers who want to expand their menu of  
organic foods soon will find organic meat and poultry products on 
store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department agreed Thursday to allow the labels  
while the agency continues work on national standards for all 
organic foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``This announcement means more information and more choice for  
American consumers,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. ``It 
will help organic family farmers and ranchers further expand their 
already growing markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organic certification generally means no pesticides, herbicides  
or preservatives have been sprayed on the growing fruits or 
vegetables. For livestock, organic producers mostly shun the use of 
antibiotics and confined feeding areas, opting instead to give 
organic animals access to the outdoors, fresh air and sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade  
Association, called the decision ``a victory for the organic 
industry and consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working on this issue for about eight years,''  
DiMatteo said. ``I think people have an interest in having choices 
in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMatteo said consumers will see the first organic meat, poultry  
and egg products in stores by early spring. Certified organic meat 
processors will have to apply to USDA for label approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally grown fruits, vegetables and other products have been  
allowed to carry the organic label for some time. Until Thursday, 
USDA had prohibited the label for meat, which is more strictly 
regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	To alleviate the disparity and respond to a growing organic  
industry, USDA is developing national standards to cover the entire 
industry. The rules would replace a hodgepodge of state and private 
certification programs that sometimes differ on their definition of 
organic. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman chose to allow meat labels in the interim, partly  
because development of national standards is taking longer than 
expected, officials said. Aides said he also thought the rule would 
provide a boost for organic farmers, who tend to be smaller family 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The organic industry has grown in recent years as more and more  
consumers become worried about health effects of pesticides and 
other chemicals in food and about Earth's ability to sustain 
conventional farming. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organic Trade Association estimates that the organic  
industry is growing at least 20 percent a year, with current 
overall sales of about $4.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Film Mired in Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYA BAY, Thailand (AP) -- In Leonardo DiCaprio's latest film his  
adversaries are not the sea but the people who love it, both in the 
screenplay and for real. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai environmentalists have chosen the setting of ``The Beach''  
as their latest battleground, and for once, they are getting some 
attention, if only because of DiCaprio's fame as star of the 
``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not give up, since this will be good example for  
enforcing the laws that everyone has to follow,'' said Manit 
Sriwatchaphum, a leading environmentalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice this week, a court refused to grant environmentalists an  
injunction that would stop the filming, which was to take place 
over the next few weeks on the white-sand beach of Maya Bay on Phi 
Phi Le,an island in the national park in the Andaman Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Ringed by high cliffs and kissed by sparkling waters, Phi Phi Le  
is one of a shrinking number of islands unspoiled by tourist 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists say Thai officials broke laws in granting 20th  
Century Fox permission to use the beach and that the ecosystem will 
be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very relieved the court ruled in our favor,'' producer  
Andrew McDonald said in an interview. ``We have followed all 
regulations and obtained all the correct official documents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Alex Garland's best-selling novel, ``The Beach'' tells  
the story of a young backpacker, Richard, who stumbles upon a map 
that leads him to an almost secret island. 
</P>
<P>
	He meets like-minded travelers sick of how mass tourism has  
wrecked one island after another. They create an idealized 
community until growing paranoia their paradise might be discovered 
leads to savage bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
	The story is set on a Thai island inaccessible and unspoiled  
because it is in a national park. 
</P>
<P>
	In nonfiction, being part of a national park offers no guarantee  
against development because a desire for tourist dollars prompts 
officials to strike deals with businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Protests by environmentalists attract little attention and have  
never succeeded in uprooting any the hotels, bars and pizza parlors 
that have sprung up in the past 20 years on many islands supposedly 
off limits to development. 
</P>
<P>
	The producers of ``The Beach,'' which is costing $40 million to  
make, did everything by the book, obtaining permission from the 
Royal Forestry Department and paying a $110,000 deposit against any 
potential damage. 
</P>
<P>
	They planned to smooth over some of the dunes and plant a grove  
of nonnative coconut trees to go with the story line. 
</P>
<P>
	Outrage followed. Environmentalists from Bangkok teamed up with  
locals complaining that heavy equipment would damage coral and chew 
up dunes. And who needed coconut trees, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
	They accused Forestry Chief Plodprasop Suraswadi of violating  
park laws and said local gangsters were raping the last beach in 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmakers repeatedly pledged to return the beach to its  
natural state. But activists started staging daily protests and 
took the unusual step in Thailand of filing suit. However, the 
project will largely be wrapped up by the next court date March 26. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCaprio is not meeting the press. The set is closed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has been diving, sun-bathing and having parties,'' McDonald  
said. ``He is a regular young man and likes to go out to experience 
Thai food and life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans have flooded telephone lines of the hotel on the nearby  
resort island of Phuket where DiCaprio is staying. Local media 
report his appearances here and there, protected by bodyguards, and 
say a woman who gave him a massage fled the area to avoid news 
hounds.

<HEADLINE> It's Hard To Predict 106th Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The prospects for the White House and Congress  
to strike deals this year revamping Social Security, cutting taxes 
and on other major issues are extraordinarily unpredictable, 
participants and analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest wild card is the impeachment trial of President  
Clinton. Even assuming the Senate leaves him in office, the two 
sides could be left hostile and eager to vilify each other in the 
run-up to the 2000 elections, or yearning to cooperate and produce 
results to prove they can still govern. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could just as much write a script for a bust Congress or for  
a boom Congress,'' said Ellen Nissenbaum, who monitors Congress for 
the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who has  
pressured GOP Senate leaders to push for more legislative 
accomplishments. He said that although lawmakers might ``dig deep'' 
and work together after the trial, its aftermath will be ``a dark 
cloud that will hang over this country for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Front and center is how to bolster Social Security for the  
retirement of the giant baby boom generation, which begins in a 
decade, and whether they will do it at all. 
</P>
<P>
	In coming days, new official projections are expected to show  
federal surpluses totaling about $2 trillion over the next decade. 
Politicians are eyeing that pot -- $500 billion more than was 
estimated last summer -- to pay for Social Security, tax cuts and 
more spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But there remains no consensus over how to fix the huge,  
politically sensitive Social Security, with Republicans generally 
more willing than Democrats to invest funds in the stock market. 
Both parties are reluctant to offer the first detailed plan for 
fear of withering attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the political positioning under way, new House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., plans to make H.R.1 -- House 
Republicans' first bill of the 106th Congress -- a blank, to prod 
Clinton to offer his own Social Security proposal first. Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., is considering the same for 
S.1, the first Senate GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici,  
R-N.M., is crafting a budget for 2000 setting aside $1.5 trillion -- 
the portion of the surplus generated by Social Security revenues -- 
to strengthen the program. He said he was working toward using the 
rest, plus extra money generated by closing tax loopholes, for 
across-the-board tax cuts starting at 4 percent and rising 
gradually to 14 percent, and wants increased spending for education 
and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, Clinton and the same Republicans trying to oust him  
from office will have incentives to cooperate if he survives the 
impeachment trial, which seems likely. That could yield a landmark 
pact revamping Social Security, cutting taxes and boosting spending 
for domestic and defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddled forever as only the second president impeached by the  
House, Clinton probably would welcome proving his relevance with 
solid achievements like reinforcing Social Security and beefing up 
federal support for schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, meanwhile, would be eager to avoid the label of a  
Congress obsessed with impeachment but achieving nothing else. If 
they strike a deal overhauling Social Security and removing it from 
the Democrats' arsenal of political weapons, while also achieving 
the longtime GOP goal of big tax cuts, so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats would gain by winning extra spending for  
favorite social programs. But many believe that with a real chance 
of capturing congressional control in the 2000 elections, they have 
the least incentive for a deal that deprives them of the Social 
Security issue while handing Republicans a record of achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is whether congressional Democrats want it to  
happen, and whether the White House can strike a deal with 
Republicans if Democrats don't want it to happen,'' said Marshall 
Wittman, congressional affairs director for the conservative 
Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The betting remains that Clinton and Republicans won't reach a  
compromise on Social Security, and not simply because of complex 
substantive conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton might not want to strike an agreement with Republicans  
that angers core Democratic voters who want no radical changes in 
Social Security. He also might be reluctant to rob Democrats -- 
including Vice President Al Gore, a friend and 2000 presidential 
hopeful -- of their ability to attack Republicans for imperiling 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	For the GOP, if core conservative voters are disaffected by a  
Clinton acquittal, conservative lawmakers might be loathe to 
surrender much in negotiations with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the best of times, it's very, very difficult for a  
Republican Congress and Democratic president to work out programs 
like Social Security,'' said Carol Cox Wait, president of the 
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan budget 
watchdog. ``You take this particular Congress and president, 
working with the backdrop of impeachment ... that doesn't strike me 
as a very good starting point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without a Social Security deal, the likelihood is for either a  
compromise using small portions of the surplus for tax cuts and 
some spending increases, or a status quo year in which little is 
achieved.

<HEADLINE> A Look at Indian Health Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Facts about the Indian Health Service:  
</P>
<P>
	--Serves about 1.3 million of the 2.4 million American Indians  
and Alaskan natives. 
</P>
<P>
	--Offers care through a network of 49 hospitals, 209 health  
centers, 121 health stations, 168 village clinics and 34 urban 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provides money for tribes to run their own health systems, if  
they so desire, through a compact or a more closely managed 
contract. These are becoming increasingly popular options. 
</P>
<P>
	--For 55 percent of Indians, the service is the sole provider of  
care. Seventeen percent also have other public coverage such as 
Medicaid or Medicare. An additional 28 percent have private health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	--Indian health service facilities can bill private insurance  
companies and the government when they treat patients who are 
covered by other insurance programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Likewise, Indians with other insurance can go outside the  
Indian Health Service for care -- but often there are no other 
facilities in the rural areas where many Indians live.

</P>
<P>
	In 1943 she went to work as a reporter for International News

	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Jerzy Grotowski, an avant-garde Polish  
director who was one of the most influential theatrical innovators 
of his time, died Thursday from leukemia and a heart condition. He 
was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Grotowski studied acting and directing at the State Theater  
School in Krakow and in Moscow. He made his directorial debut in 
1959 at the Old Theater in Krakow with ``Chairs,'' by Eugene 
Ionesco. 
</P>
<P>
	He found world recognition with his Laboratory Theater, which he  
founded in the provincial town of Opole, 210 miles southwest of 
Warsaw. Grotowski left Poland in 1982 for the United States, and 
the company closed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after leaving Poland, he moved to Italy and opened a  
theater center in Pontedera.

<P>
	He was appointed a judge in 1964 and served as lord chief  
justice -- Northern Ireland's senior position overseeing the highest 
court of appeal -- from 1971 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowry was awarded an honorary lordship in 1979, and three years  
later survived an IRA bid on his life while visiting Queen's 
University in Belfast. None of the four bullets fired hit him, but 
one struck and wounded a professor nearby. 
</P>

Saturday of heart failure. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the John Hancock building, he was credited with  
the Christian Science Church extension and the Long Wharf Hotel in 
Boston, the Juilliard School of Music in New York, the Toronto City 
Opera House, and the Embassy Suites Hotels in Boston and 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, he completed work on the Shapiro Clinical Center at

</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Raymond Peynet, the cartoon illustrator whose  
drawings of young lovers embodied romance for generations of 
French, died Thursday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Peynet created his starry-eyed ``Lovers'' during World War II:  
they hold hands, kiss and simply embrace in an expression of tender 
devotion that his daughter, Annie Peynet, said reflected his own 
happy marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Peynet also designed a series of dolls portraying the women of  
Paris. Britain's Queen Elizabeth purchased a set on a state visit 
here in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	His drawings of ``Les Amoureux'' (The Lovers) were widely used  
in France to symbolize Valentine's Day; they were emblazoned on 
scarves, greeting cards, posters, jewelry, a postage stamp, and 
even national lottery tickets sold on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The postage stamp inspired French singer Georges Brassens to  
compose one of his best known melodies, ``Lovers on Park Benches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two museums in Japan and two in France are devoted solely to his  
work. Three statues of the Lovers were erected in Japan, including 
one in Hiroshima symbolizing love and peace.

	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Aldo van Eyck, considered the most  
important Dutch architect of the 20th century, died Thursday of a 
heart attack. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Eyck's most famous creation was the State Orphanage designed  
in Amsterdam in 1959, which was credited with smashing all 
architectural conventions of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The simple, village-like structure featured small houses for the  
children linked by covered plains and walkways. 
</P>

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Right-hander Jason Bere agreed to a $1.2  
million, one-year contract with Cincinnati on Friday, leaving 
outfielder Michael Tucker and pitcher John Hudek the only Reds in 
salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Bere, 27, started last season with the Chicago White Sox and was  
3-7 with a 6.45 ERA in 18 games. He was claimed off waivers on July 
21 and was 3-2 with a 4.12 ERA in nine games with Cincinnati. He 
made $700,000.

<P>
	Bere went 12-5 for the White Sox in 1994 and 12-2 a year later.  
He slipped to 8-15 in 1995 and spent most of 1996 on the disabled 
list with a sore elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Andrews removed dead muscle tissue, reinforced the  
elbow ligaments and reattached muscles on Sept. 13, 1996. Bere was 
4-2 with a 4.71 ERA in six starts in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Returns to Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Nineteen months after he bit a chunk off  
Evander Holyfield's ears, Mike Tyson finally returns to the one 
place he feels most comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be inside a 20-foot-square ring tonight at the MGM Grand  
hotel, with only Francois Botha and referee Richard Steele as 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fighting is the only thing I really know how to do right,''  
Tyson said. ``It's all the other things I do that get me in 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banished from boxing for his infamous bites, Tyson begins his  
second comeback from an enforced ring absence when he meets Botha 
in a scheduled 10-round fight. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a comeback that Tyson and his new handlers hopes culminates  
in a third fight against Holyfield in November that not only could 
be the richest fight ever, but could also help Tyson erase the 
demons of two consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kills me to think that someone could get the better of  
me,'' Tyson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Tyson, who weighed in Thursday at 223 pounds,  
his heaviest ever for a fight, is a 6-1 favorite against Botha, who 
briefly held the IBF title and has lost only once in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson enters the ring this time stripped of some of the mystique  
that made other fighters scared to trade punches with him. 
Holyfield took care of that by giving Tyson a beating in their 
first fight and frustrating him so badly in the second that Tyson 
snapped and bit his ears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be intimidated,'' Botha said. ``I won't be  
intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha himself is a much more credible opponent that Peter  
McNeeley, who Tyson beat into submission in the first round of his 
first comeback fight after being released from prison in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha is 39-1, with his only loss coming when Michael Moorer  
stopped him in the 12th round of their IBF title fight on the 
undercard of the first Tyson-Holyfield fight on Nov. 9, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think he's the best heavyweight out there,'' Botha  
said of Tyson. ``It's a great opportunity for me to be where I want 
to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha has 24 knockouts, but is not known for his punching power.  
At 6-foot-2 he holds a size advantage of about three inches over 
Tyson and at 233 pounds outweighs him by 10 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, though, appears to still have the quickness that allows  
him to get inside on bigger fighters and he worked especially hard 
in training camp on left hooks to the body that could be the 
biggest punches of the fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he knew about Botha, Tyson said: ``He's white and he  
can't beat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who has spent more than five years of the 12 years since  
winning the heavyweight title with a knockout of Trevor Berbick at 
the age of 20 in enforced absences from the sport, will be fighting 
for only the seventh time in the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a record of 45-3 with 39 knockouts, but two of those  
losses came in his last two fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know he still has his power'' said Tommy Brooks, who became  
Tyson's fifth different trainer when he took over his training for 
the latest comeback. ``It's just a matter of getting that power to 
his opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is getting $10 million for the fight, which will be  
televised by Showtime on a pay-per-view basis. Botha's purse is 
$1.85 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecast will begin at 9 p.m. EST, with the Tyson-Botha  
match to start no later than 11:30 p.m. It will be preceded by a 
12-round lightweight bout between Goyo Vargas of Mexico and Ben 
Tackie of Ghana and an IBF junior lightweight title defense by 
Roberto Garcia of Oxnard, Calif., against John Molina of Puerto 
Rico.

<HEADLINE> The Marketing of Martin Luther King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- As thousands trek south to recall a civil rights  
martyr, a new cartoon video and a controversial book on Martin 
Luther King's life have rekindled worries that King's rich legacy 
of selflessness is on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
	King's youngest son, Dexter, 37, hasn't been subtle in changing  
the direction of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent 
Social Change here. Originally it was intended as a training ground 
for future civil rights crusaders; critics say it has become an 
enterprise that puts profit ahead of principle. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, as devotees journey to the King center on what would  
have been MLK's 70th birthday, the criticism is growing since the 
family has helped produce an ``autobiography'' that King didn't 
write and an animated video about the civil rights legend, who 
ranks among the most admired Americans of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the King family agreed to sell the King center,  
Coretta Scott King's current home and hundreds of King's personal 
items to the National Park Service. But no price has been agreed 
upon. 
</P>
<P>
	Items already identified as part of the sale include King's  
light blue 1960 Chevrolet Impala and the funeral wagon that carried 
the slain civil right's leader's body through Atlanta in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The center itself has been one target of the criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``People don't feel the impact of the center, programs to  
improve the quality of people lives. Since Dexter has been running 
it, you get the feeling it's nothing more than a moneymaking 
machine,'' said Rev. Joseph Lowery, a former King associate and 
past president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference that 
King founded. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the cartoon, titled ``My Friend, Martin,'' Lowery said he  
wouldn't pass judgment until he sees it for himself. But the image 
of his former colleague as an animated figure leaves him a bit 
queasy. 
</P>
<P>
	The cartoon features a multiracial group of children who get  
transported back in time and meet Martin Luther King as a 
teen-ager. It features the voices of LeVar Burton and James Earl 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand in fear and am trembling that Martin is going to be  
Mickey Moused and Fat Albertized. What I've heard about so far has 
been negative,'' Lowery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Dexter King nor Coretta Scott King would agree to be  
interviewed for this article. 
</P>
<P>
	Dexter King, however, has said in the past that he sought to  
bring fiscal order to what has been a cash-strapped program at the 
center. He also said he has little interest in succeeding his 
father as a civil rights figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to be preachy or be on a pedestal,'' Dexter  
King said in a 1997 interview. ``I'm not trying to effect change on 
that level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say a change for the worse is the best way to describe  
the moves Dexter King has made since succeeding his mother, Coretta 
Scott King, as chief steward of the King center in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Dexter King trimmed the center's staff, closed a child-care  
center and bickered with the National Park Service over a site he 
wanted for an interactive museum. No museum has been built. 
</P>
<P>
	He also began to enforce aggressively the family's control over  
words and images of the slain civil rights advocate to the point 
where the estate sued news organizations for excerpting King's 
famed ``I Have a Dream'' speech. 
</P>
<P>
	And his absolution of James Earl Ray, the man convicted of the  
1968 murder of his father, left civil rights stalwarts who worked 
with MLK including Lowery, Julian Bond and the Rev. Samuel Billy 
Kyles shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	MLK's view on money during his life isn't easy to ascertain,  
Bond said. While King donated the $54,000 he received with his 1964 
Nobel Peace Prize to civil rights groups, he also copyrighted his 
speeches and books. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know money wasn't the driving force of his life,'' Bond  
said. ``He might have looked askance at some of the fund-raising 
activities of his progeny, but these are different times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From omnipresent banners on street signs to statues and carvings  
on street corners, the visage of slain civil rights leader Martin 
Luther King can be found everywhere in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	At the King center, in a run-down section of the city, the smell  
of fresh paint wafts through the corridors of the exhibit hall as 
workers spruce it up for an expected throng. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups of children peer at display cases of King memorabilia.  
But there's scant involvement in the lives of the people residing 
near the center. 
</P>
<P>
	``The center used to have a community liaison who was very  
active,'' Bond said. ``But now I sense it has little or no 
involvement in the larger community outside their door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David J. Garrow, Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of King,  
said, ``I don't think anyone can challenge the family's right to 
make money. But the reputation damage the Kings have suffered in 
recent years can't be worth the money they've made. It's a matter 
of degree, scale and style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issues of degree, scale and style are among concerns raised by  
some with the release of a new ``autobiography'' engineered by the 
King family as part of a multimillion dollar deal with Warner Books 
to expand Martin Luther King's presence in popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerstone of the effort is the recently published ``The  
Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.,'' edited by Stanford 
University history professor Clayborne Carson, a King scholar. 
</P>
<P>
	Other works planned as part of the Warner Books deal are an  
Internet site, recordings of his speeches and books by both Coretta 
Scott King and Dexter King. 
</P>
<P>
	A few reviews have credited Carson for researching hundreds of  
thousands of documents MLK penned about his life to cobble the book 
together. But eyebrows have been raised by the use of the word 
autobiography in the title for a book King clearly didn't write. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite a curious product,'' said Calvin Reid, news editor  
at Publisher's Weekly. ``I think its a mistake calling it an 
autobiography. It raises questions about who you are trying to 
fool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carson said he is solely responsible for the book's title and  
shrugs off concerns about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized some people might see it as presumptuous to call it  
an autobiography, but its a silly controversy,'' Carson said. ``I 
wish people would just accept it for what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carson said he expressed his own concerns to Dexter King about  
the suggestion that money interests trumped an earnest desire to 
spread his father's legacy to future generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Dexter there were some mistakes made when they  
emphasized how much money was going to be made on the deal and not 
what was the most important aspect -- to get the word out to a whole 
new generation on what King stood for,'' Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson said the debate has him feeling trapped.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like the message of the book is getting lost in this  
battle over the King family,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Roberts, pastor of Dr. King's Ebenezer Baptist Church,  
said critics of the King family might be more willing to allow for 
a few mistakes if they saw the King Center doing more to address 
the societal ills Martin Luther King would have fought today. 
</P>
<P>
	But any reservoir of good will the King family might have built  
up is pretty dry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only they can answer whether they have any grand plans or  
programs'' for the community, Roberts said. ``I can say the 
movement has taken a different direction from the time of Dr. 
King.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Recruiting More Non-Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy, faced with a worrisome 22,000 job  
vacancies, has decided to start accepting more recruits who have 
not earned a high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the decision Friday, Navy Secretary Richard Danzig  
said it was among a series of moves intended to improve the Navy's 
war preparedness and raise morale. The job gap has meant that some 
sailors among the 372,000 on active duty are forced to fill 
positions outside their own specialty or to do double duty, he 
said. Of the 22,000 unfilled jobs, 18,000 are aboard ships at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Undermanning the Navy is simply not acceptable to me,  
especially when more quality personnel can be recruited or 
high-quality sailors can be retained,'' Danzig said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Navy would increase the proportion of recruits who  
have not graduated from high school to 10 percent from 5 percent. 
Ten percent is the maximum allowed under Defense Department 
regulations, but the individual services can set stricter limits of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, the Army loosened its limit of non-high school  
graduates from 5 percent to 10 percent. The Marine Corps takes no 
more than 5 percent. The Air Force's maximum is 10 percent, 
although it has not had more than 1 percent in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other changes announced by Danzig is a planned revision of  
the Navy's physical fitness and health standards. He said new 
standards would be set within a year. In the meantime, sailors will 
not be discharged solely on the basis of failing to meet the 
current standard. Danzig said this could mean keeping 2,000 sailors 
who otherwise would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced steps intended to improve the management of  
recruit training. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 95 percent of Navy recruits were high school  
graduates, but the Navy fell nearly 7,000 short of its recruiting 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Danzig said the Navy believes that by taking more non-high  
school graduates it will get an extra 2,600 boot camp entrants this 
year. It expects to get an additional 4,500 through other new 
measures, including increased advertising and more enlistment 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy secretary said he believes that having a smaller  
proportion of high school graduates in boot camp will not dilute 
the talent pool. He said non-graduates who sign up will have to 
score above average on Navy entrance exams and have good 
references. 
</P>
<P>
	``A high school diploma is an important validation of ability to  
succeed,'' Danzig said. ``It is not, however, the 'be-all' or 
'end-all' of a potential recruit's measure of worth.'' He said the 
Navy wants ``proven performers,'' even if they have left school 
because of financial need, personal circumstances, home schooling 
or because it was ``not the right place for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience shows these 'proven performers' make good -- indeed,  
sometimes exceptional -- sailors,'' Danzig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recruits without high school diplomas historically have failed  
to complete recruit training at a rate about 10 percent greater 
than those who did finish school, the Navy secretary said. But he 
said the recruits without diplomas who do succeed in boot camp 
usually stay in the Navy longer.

<HEADLINE> Jaquars' Palmer Eyed for Browns Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Chris Palmer doesn't look like NFL coaching  
material. With his wire-rimmed glasses, he looks more like a high 
school English teacher who could diagram a sentence more easily 
than a play-action pass. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Browns president found out, Palmer's favorite subject is  
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's smart,'' said Policy. ``He's cerebral, but he's not an  
egg head. I actually found him to be engaging, funny, a bit of a 
character. I see a dimension to the man I couldn't get from TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, the Jacksonville Jaguars' offensive coordinator, became  
the fourth candidate to interview with Policy for the Cleveland 
Browns' head coaching job on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy, who has previously met with Minnesota offensive  
coordinator Brian Billick, Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak 
and Atlanta offensive line coach Art Shell, was impressed by much 
more than Palmer's extensive coaching resume. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked actually,'' said Policy. ``He just did his  
homework. I think that preparation for any important event is 
critical and certainly there's no greater attribute a coach can 
have than to be well prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second NFL head coaching interview this week for the  
49-year-old Palmer, who said he had another scheduled for next week 
but wouldn't divulge with whom. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Palmer met with Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell,  
the former owner of the Browns who is still despised in Cleveland 
for leaving town with the old franchise in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was asked to compare the two interviews, Palmer laughed  
as Policy moved away from the podium momentarily to hear his 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both were professional,'' Palmer said. ``Both were  
informative. Both were a situation where you wanted to get to know 
each other, and I think both went very, very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike both Billick and Kubiak, Palmer has some head coaching  
experience, although it was at the college level with New Haven and 
Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
	However, his background working under Bill Parcells as  
quarterbacks coach in New England, where he tutored Drew Bledsoe, 
as well as his time with the Jaguars -- a recent expansion team like 
the Browns -- could give him an advantage over other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns own the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, and are likely  
to select either Texas running back Ricky Williams or Kentucky 
quarterback Tim Couch, who is skipping his senior college season 
and wants to play in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy has previously said he'd prefer to build the Browns  
around a ``franchise quarterback'' and Palmer seems to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the draft, you have to have a quarterback no matter what  
level of play whether it's high school, college or pro,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jacksonville QB Mark Brunell was injured late this season,  
Palmer was able to force feed the Jaguars' offensive system to 
rookie Jonathan Quinn, who guided the team to a win over Pittsburgh 
in Week 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've demonstrated that we can develop a young player to be  
able to take and play at a high level in an NFL game in a short 
period of time,'' Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer may have moved up on the Browns' list with his impressive  
interview, but Policy is not done conducting interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he planned to interview Oakland defensive coordinator  
Willie Shaw next week. Policy, who said his list of potential 
candidates is shrinking, became interested in Shaw after seeing him 
on a videotape the NFL had distributed for minority coaching 
candidates.

<HEADLINE> FBI Identifies Missing Calif. Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEASIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Gasping for words, shuddering and  
clinging to each other, the parents of a 13-year-old girl whose 
body was discovered seven months after she disappeared lashed out 
at the unknown killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know who you are,'' screamed Alice Williams, whose  
daughter Christina Marie took her dog for a walk on June 12 and 
never came back. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Williams' words rang out Thursday through a broad  
cul-de-sac on the former Ft. Ord Army Base. Just hours before, the 
Monterey County coroner's office had confirmed the identity of 
Christina's body through dental records. 
</P>
<P>
	Christina had flawless teeth. No fillings. No cracks.  
</P>
<P>
	Her bones, a few strands of hair and some weathered clothing  
were found Tuesday by an ecological surveyor working on a small 
University of California nature reserve three miles from the 
Williamses' home. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Alex Kerekes said the area where Christina's body  
was found had been searched soon after she disappeared, once with 
dogs, once on all-terrain vehicles. Investigators said it's 
possible the body was placed there after the search. 
</P>
<P>
	A cause of death has not been determined, but the FBI said it  
was intensifying its hunt for two men that a witness said she saw 
soon after Christina disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know these bad people, they are around,'' a sobbing Mrs.  
Williams said. ``They are around us, driving around, looking for 
innocent children like our daughter Christina. Don't be surprised 
when one of these days (there is) another victim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband Michael, a Navy meteorologist who has become a  
devout Christian since his daughter's disappearance, said he's 
hoping to channel his anger into something positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should never, ever, ever, be allowed to happen,'' he  
said. ``Never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a possibly related development, police in Petaluma, about 40  
miles north of San Francisco, on Thursday released sketches of two 
kidnapping suspects who appear similar to the suspects sought in 
Williams' case. 
</P>
<P>
	``They look exactly like the guys,'' said the Petaluma victim,  
Noelani Burleson, 17, who escaped as the two men were trying to 
take her clothes off on Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman George Grotz said the agency was looking into the  
similarities but stressed there was no evidence linking the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Forensic artist Jeanne Boylan said the men in Monterey were  
described as Asian and the men in Petaluma spoke Spanish and 
appeared to be Latino.

<HEADLINE> Reclusive Man Found Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RINGGOLD, Ga. (AP) -- A reclusive mountain man accused of holding  
his wife hostage for 30 years and eventually smothering her to 
death was acquitted of murder charges Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvin Ridley smiled, nodded his head, embraced his lawyer and  
cried as he was cleared on charges of murder, felony murder and 
aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been innocent,'' he said. ``I loved my wife.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ridley 56, said he awoke Oct. 4, 1997, and found his wife lying  
face down and unresponsive, but could not revive her. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Ken Poston argued Virginia Ridley died after an  
epileptic seizure. An autopsy and medical experts said a cause of 
death was impossible to pin down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just didn't feel like it was proven that he put his hands  
on her and that he smothered her,'' juror Kimberly Clark-Barnes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridley and his wife married in 1966 and she had not been seen in  
public for at least 25 years. Police said she was a prisoner in the 
couple's dilapidated, roach-infested home and that relatives had 
been chased off when they came around. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridley's lifestyle and cantankerous nature were central parts of  
the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
	Poston admitted his client, a former television repairman, was  
antisocial and oblivious to his own stench and filthy home. But 
Poston noted that there was no evidence that Mrs. Ridley she was 
ever a captive. For years, she wrote diary entries, letters and 
postcards detailing her life in this Appalachian foothill town just 
south of Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``She blessed him for years by dating and signing all types of  
things that indicated she lived a very happy life with her husband 
for over 30 years,'' Poston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Buzz Franklin said Ridley was a lifelong liar, and  
that the evidence against him was ``subtle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like a case where there's a gunshot wound or stab  
wound,'' Franklin said. ``It wasn't immediately obvious what the 
nature of the death was.''

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Excerpts-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``But that's what the importance was of what you have heard up  
to now, the complete record woven together, step by step, so that 
no one in this chamber at this juncture does not know all the facts 
that are pertinent to this case. That is a magnificent 
accomplishment on the part of the managers.'' -- Rep. George Gekas, 
R-Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Because that fellow American, Paula Jones, no matter how she  
may have been described by commentators and pundits and talking 
heads, did have a bundle of rights at her command. And those rights 
went even to the core of our system of justice to bring the 
president into the case as a defendant. That is an awesome, a grand 
result of the Supreme Court decision at that juncture.'' -- Gekas. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This little innocuous piece of paper called interrogatories  
was placed before the president, presumably with or without 
counsel, but let's even presume with counsel, and it was a straight 
question, not with any definitions, no confusing colloquy between a 
judge and a gaggle of lawyers, no interpretive -- interpretation 
being put on any particular word in the interrogatories, but 
whether or not sexual relations had been urged or participated in 
by the president of the United States. And the answer was none, in 
naming those persons. 
</P>
<P>
	What does that mean to you?'' -- Gekas.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone, a member of your family, or someone who is a  
witness to these proceedings, had a serious case in which oneself, 
one's property, one's family has been severely damaged, would you 
suffer without a whimper perjurious testimony given against you? 
Would you know down deep that at the end of the day has caused you 
to lose your chance at retribution, a chance to be compensated for 
damages, to restore your family life? Isn't that what our system is 
all about? Isn't that what the adverse consequence is of the 
attempt to obliterate the Paula Jones civil suit?'' -- Gekas. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice to an  
individual or to a family. To take from Paula Jones and telescope 
it upwards to every to community and every courthouse and every 
state and every community in our land. And there is a Paul Jones 
eager to assert certain rights. And then, be confronted with 
someone who would tear it down by false testimony, by lies under 
oath.'' -- Gekas. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's continued inability to tell the truth, the  
whole truth and nothing but the truth has forced this body, this 
jury, to determine the president's true intent.'' -- Rep. Steve 
Chabot, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The law regarding the materiality of false statements before a  
grand jury is very straightforward. Because a grand jury's 
authorities to investigate is broad, the realm of declarations 
regarded as material is broad. The president's false statements to 
the grand jury were material, because the grand jury was 
investigating whether the president had obstructed justice and 
committed perjury in a civil deposition.'' -- Chabot. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is that the language of the impeachment article did  
not use these terms as terms of art, as they are defined and used 
in various criminal statutes. While the article of impeachment does 
not draw a distinction between the standards, evidence has been 
presented over the last two days that demonstrates that the 
president did knowingly and willfully lie under oath regarding 
material matters before a grand jury.'' -- Chabot. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Senate, throughout this long  
and difficult process, apologists for the president have maintained 
that his actions might well have been reprehensible but are not 
necessarily worthy of impeachment and removal from office. I would 
submit, however, that telling the truth under oath is critically 
important to our judicial system, and that perjury, of which I 
believe a compelling case is being made, strikes a terrible blow 
against the machinery of justice in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the United States, the chief law enforcement  
officer of this land, lied under oath.'' -- Chabot. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``By lying under oath, the president did not just commit perjury  
-- an offense punishable under our criminal code -- but he chipped 
away at the very cornerstone of our judicial system.'' -- Chabot. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Why has the president been impeached by the United States  
House of Representatives? Why he is on trial here today in the 
United States Senate? Because he lied under oath. Because he 
committed perjury. Because if oaths cease to be held sacred, our 
dearest and most valuable rights will become insecure.'' -- Chabot.

<HEADLINE> Radar Downed at Seattle Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A power outage and the failure of a backup  
generator at an air traffic control center shut down radar and 
radio communications for about 35 minutes Friday at Seattle-Tacoma 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The outage at the air traffic control center in suburban Auburn  
began at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers at the airport used backup communications to speak  
with pilots and increase separation between planes, said Mitch 
Barker, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-bound planes at distant airports were held up until the  
system was restored, and outbound flights were put on hold as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes that were within 10 miles of the airport were allowed to  
land because at that point, they were controlled by radar and radio 
at the airport, which were not affected. Planes farther out circled 
until the problem was fixed, airport spokesman Bob Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Normal operations had resumed by 4:30 p.m., Barker said.

<HEADLINE> Light Plane Veers Near White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Security agents fired a red warning flare from  
the White House roof Friday at a twin-engine propeller plane that 
strayed too close as President Clinton headed home in a helicopter. 
The plane turned and flew away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service said the light plane, a Piper Navajo, had  
been force by high winds and weather conditions into the restricted 
airspace around the White House and was not considered a security 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was in touch with the tower at Reagan National  
Airport, where the plane had taken off, and the flare was fired to 
help him get a sense of direction and the boundaries of the 
restricted air space, said Secret Service spokesman John Tomlinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred about 10 minutes before Clinton's  
helicopter landed on the White House lawn, returning him from 
Andrews Air Force Base after a brief trip to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Preliminary indications are that it was benign. However a full  
review of the incident is under way,'' said Tomlinson. He said the 
firing of a flare is ``certainly not routine,'' adding that the 
review would determine whether any action is taken against the 
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unusual for planes to be directed to skirt restricted  
airspace. The winds in this case played havoc with the pilot's 
ability to stay outside of restricted airspace,'' Tomlinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the flare was fired, the pilot was able to get back into  
the proper flight pattern and flew away. The plane came from the 
east after departing from Reagan National and was on a westward 
course over the National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a flurry of activity on the ground as the small plane  
neared the White House. Secret Service agents stepped from watch 
booths to keep an eye on what was happening. The red flare was 
fired from atop the White House, where security agents keep watch 
over the executive mansion compound.

<HEADLINE> NBC Aims for Less Sex in Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NBC is turning a cold shower on  
overheated shows. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa said Thursday the  
network, home of such sexy comedies as ``Friends'' and ``Veronica's 
Closet,'' needs to put less emphasis on bedroom antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, we could use a few more words between `Hello'  
and `Would you sleep with me?''' Sassa told the Television Critics 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa, who took over as top programmer last fall, said he also  
wants NBC to show more traditional two-parent families, more 
diversity and more programs set somewhere other than New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his remark about toning down the sexual content in  
series that prompted the most questions from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa was quick to explain that he didn't mean NBC was turning  
puritanical. ``We're not trying to create The Family Channel 
here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For a show like ``Friends,'' about singles living in the big  
city, sexuality is a logical part of the formula, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying no sex. I'm saying less sex, and it depends on  
the kind of show it is,'' Sassa said. ``When sex is used in a smart 
way, it works out OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Friends'' airs at 8 p.m. in many markets, and NBC, which also  
focuses on young singles with comedies like ``Caroline in the 
City'' and ``Just Shoot Me,'' has taken heat for scheduling racy 
fare early in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa also acknowledged that NBC has weak spots in its schedule  
outside of its key Thursday night lineup that includes ``ER'' and 
``Friends,'' but he said the network has several shows in 
development for spring. 
</P>
<P>
	They include ``Everything's Relative'' with Jeffrey Tambor (who  
played Hank on ``The Larry Sanders Show'') and another sitcom 
called ``Cold Feet,'' based on a British series. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to predict what effect Michael Jordan's retirement would  
have on NBC's broadcast of NBA games, Sassa reached back to 
Jordan's first retirement in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings dipped 5 percent then, Sassa said, although the lockout  
and the shortened season makes this year's situation more difficult 
to gauge.

<HEADLINE> US West To Forward Olympics Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- U S WEST President Sol Trujillo said the  
telecommunications company will forward a $5 million Olympics 
sponsorship payment it had reneged on now that it has been 
reassured of a new beginning at the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The payment, part of U S West's $50 million commitment as a 2002  
Winter Games sponsor, was in jeopardy because of allegations that 
Salt Lake's bid boosters bribed members of the International 
Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver-based company had said last week that it would  
withhold the $5 million due at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, Trujillo said the company's sponsorship is secure  
and praised the ``decisive actions'' of Gov. Mike Leavitt and the 
Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A major housecleaning at SLOC a week ago resulted in the  
resignation senior vice president Dave Johnson, who was 
instrumental in the bid, and president Frank Joklik. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik, who denies any knowledge of lavish gifts and cash  
payments to IOC members, remains on the job until a replacement is 
found. Former president Tom Welch was stripped of his consulting 
contract and pension and two senior executives were put on paid 
leave while their roles in the bid are scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik said SLOC investigators had found evidence that bid  
officials gave cash to IOC members, in one case more than $70,000, 
as well as free education and medical help and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC now is awaiting the report of its independent ethics panel  
to determine whether more sanctions are in order. The report is due 
Feb. 11, but one panel member said it could be ready next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee detailed a new organizational structure  
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a new beginning -- one that is driven by the culture of  
Utah and the West, not by the culture of the IOC bid process,'' 
Trujillo said in a written statement. ``We believe the actions 
taken by Gov. Leavitt -- and the actions that remain to be taken -- 
will provide the new foundations needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile on Friday, the Mormon church said that businesses  
owned by the Salt Lake-based church gave $210,938 between 1985 and 
1995 to the bid committee in a ``spirit of good corporate 
citizenship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press had asked for an accounting of any church  
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Those businesses included Bonneville Communications, which owns  
television and radio stations, and the Deseret News newspaper, 
according to Bruce Olsen, director of the church's public affairs 
office. Bonneville Communications also gave help on multi-media 
projects for the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the money came from church member contributions. All  
of it came from for-profit corporations,'' Olsen said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Mike Otterson said late Friday that the church itself  
made no contributions to the Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid effort stretching back to the mid-1980s and the  
unsuccessful bid for the 1998 Winter Games was funded by $15 
million in contributions from companies and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the recent turn of events is concerned, The Church  
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is deeply disappointed. It 
believes the highest ethical and moral standards ought to apply in 
the Olympics as in any field of endeavor,'' the church's statement 
said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Signs 3-Year Contract With IMG  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Maybe now Se Ri Pak will be able to  
concentrate only on golf. 
</P>
<P>
	After a sensational season on the course and a muddled situation  
outside the ropes, Pak signed a contract with International 
Management Group, the same agency that represents Tiger Woods, 
David Duval and Annika Sorenstam. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was signed Thursday night over dinner. Pak had been  
scheduled to hear a last-ditch offer from Cornerstone Sports, but 
signed with IMG before the latter meeting was held. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG declined comment, but the deal was confirmed Friday by  
family adviser Yeong Shin by Samsung, Pak's corporate sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``IMG will handle everything,'' said Shin, as he and her father,  
Jun-Chul Pak, watched her struggle to a 2-over 74 in the first 
round of the HealthSouth Inaugural. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak, who became the youngest winner of the U.S. Women's Open and  
the first rookie in 14 years to win two majors, had been shopping 
for a management firm since last month, when Samsung agreed to give 
up management of the South Korean star. 
</P>
<P>
	Shin said he expects endorsement contracts to follow shortly.  
Pak has played the Callaway Big Bertha irons and the Maxfli 
Revolution ball, although she did not have deals with any other 
company except Samsung. 
</P>
<P>
	``Samsung will still be primary sponsor,'' Shin said. ``She will  
still have Samsung on the hat and Astra on the shirt. But IMG will 
negotiate with Callaway and for other equipment endorsements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the systematic and scientific management through IMG  
will help Pak remain a top-notch player,'' Samsung spokesman Ahn 
Ho-moon said from South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG will split 30 percent of the profits with Samsung. Pak will  
receive the remaining 70 percent, Samsung officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung, the Korean electronics magnate, signed Pak to a 10-year  
contract in 1996, then sent her to the United States to work with 
swing coach David Leadbetter. 
</P>
<P>
	She tied for first in the LPGA qualifying school, then  
challenged Sorenstam as the top player in the world with the most 
remarkable rookie season on the LPGA Tour since Nancy Lopez in 
1978. She was voted AP Female Athlete of the Year, and was voted 
player of the year by the Golf Writers Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with winning the U.S. Open in a 20-hole playoff and the  
LPGA Championship, Pak won two other tournaments -- all in a 10-week 
stretch -- and set two scoring records in one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	But off the course, her life was far from smooth.  
</P>
<P>
	Leadbetter said she was playing too much. Pak played six  
straight tournaments on two occasions late in the year and 
complained of a sore shoulder and fatigue. She also was 
hospitalized for fatigue during her celebrated homecoming to South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	When the season ended, Pak fired manager Steven Kil, rehired him  
and fired him again -- all within two weeks. She also ditched 
Leadbetter, decided to go back to him, then received notice that he 
was leaving her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to find very strong people to take care of everything --  
interviews, schedule, practice and time for me to relax,'' Pak said 
recently.

<HEADLINE> Airline in Challenge to Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Charter carrier Sun Country Airlines plans to  
institute regularly scheduled daily service on June 1, hoping to 
compete directly with Northwest Airlines on several routes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill La Macchia Jr., Sun Country's president and chief  
executive, said Friday the airline was responding to demand from 
business and leisure travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Country, which has only 15 planes, will offer daily nonstop  
flights between the Twin Cities and New York-JFK, 
Washington-Dulles, Boston, Detroit, Orlando, Las Vegas, Phoenix, 
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Other carriers serving Minneapolis-St. Paul International  
Airport, including American, United and Delta, fly to more 
destinations, but travelers must make intermediate stops at the 
airlines' hubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will mean Sun Country will be using most of its planes  
to offer low-fare, regularly scheduled service rather than charter 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier, based in Mendota Heights, Minn., will not require  
passengers to stay over a Saturday night to obtain a low fare. Sun 
Country does not require a minimum stay and passengers do not need 
to make reservations more than two days in advance to get the low 
fares. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Country, which has four wide-body DC10 and 11 Boeing 727  
aircraft, also plans to initiate a customer loyalty program to 
reward repeat passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Metropolitan Airports Commission recently authorized  
research intended to create more competition in response to 
criticism of Northwest's local dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators also have been looking into airline fares in  
cities dominated by a single carrier amid allegations that fares in 
such cities, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, are excessively high. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, dominant carriers have matched lower fares  
offered by other airlines, in many cases forcing the smaller 
airlines to abandon the market because they can't make enough money 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest spokeswoman Marta Laughlin said Sun Country already is  
a strong Northwest competitor in the Twin Cities.

<HEADLINE> Cocoa Prices Lowest in About 2 Yrs.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cocoa futures prices fell to their lowest levels in nearly two  
years in trading on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange as 
Brazil's decision to let its currency float continues to affect 
commodities markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures also were pushed lower by technical factors,  
including traders' reluctance to hold positions over the three-day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures prices fell, crude oil futures  
drifted lower, grain futures were mixed and soybean futures prices 
were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures prices reached their lowest levels since March  
1997 as cocoa production in the Ivory Coast and Ghana continues at 
a better-than-expected pace, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributing to the selloff was trader unwillingness to hold  
unhedged position into the holiday. London's LIFFE will be open 
Monday, the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, while the Coffee, Sugar 
&AMP; Cocoa Exchange will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa for March delivery was $31 lower at $1,350 a ton.  
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures prices fell on fears the devaluation of the  
Brazilian real will result in a flood of exports from the world's 
largest coffee grower. 
</P>
<P>
	Also pushing prices lower were ideas that Green Coffee  
Association warehouse stock data will be bearish for the market. 
After the close of trading, the GSA released data showing coffee 
stocks increased by 140,000 bags. 
</P>
<P>
	March coffee was 2.75 cents lower at $1.155 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures prices drifted lower on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange in quiet trading as the International Energy 
Agency cut its forecasts for 1999 oil demand. 
</P>
<P>
	In its monthly report, the agency estimated oil demand will  
total 75 million barrels a day, higher than last year's usage, but 
a decrease from the IEA's previous estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Milder temperatures in the northeast United States also  
contributed to the decline, with the resulting in less demand for 
heating oil. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Virginia Talks Trash With New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Gov. Jim Gilmore is talking trash.  
Specifically, New York City's trash. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore said Friday that his state has ``has no intention of  
becoming New York's dumping grounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday that  
Virginia and other states should stop complaining about taking 
thousands of tons of trash from the nation's largest city. It is, 
after all, their residents who visit and revel in its glitzy 
cultural and business swirl, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter of response, Gilmore said that ``like millions of  
people living from Maine to Florida, I am offended by your 
suggestion that New York's substantial cultural achievements, such 
as they are, obligate Virginia and other states to accept your 
garbage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Giuliani spokesman was not sure if the letter had been  
received and had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some landfills run by private operators and governments have no  
problem taking garbage from New York or anywhere else, as long as 
they're paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gilmore wants to slow the crush of garbage being brought  
into his state. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia imports 3.2 million tons of out-of-state trash  
annually, second only to Pennsylvania. Much of that garbage came 
from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest stink came after a Texas-based waste disposal company  
said this week it wants to dump an additional 4,000 tons of New 
York City trash per day in Virginia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Help Turkey With Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is preparing to send a Patriot  
missile battery to Turkey in response to the Turkish government's 
request for extra protection against possible Iraqi Scud missile 
attacks, U.S. defense officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's request, announced in Ankara on Thursday, comes amid  
heightened tensions in the area. Iraq has been challenging U.S. and 
British enforcement of a ``no-fly'' zone in northern Iraq. The 
allied planes operate from Incirlik Air Base in south-central 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	After four days of incidents in the ``no-fly'' zone, U.S.  
officials said there were none today. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq is believed to have some number of Scud missiles capable of  
reaching Incirlik, although it has not launched any Scuds since the 
1991 Gulf War, when it used them against several neighboring 
countries supporting the U.S.-led coalition, including Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialists from U.S. European Command in Germany were going to  
Incirlik to make final arrangements for the deployment, the U.S. 
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Patriot 
battery can include three to eight launchers, depending on the 
perceived threat, plus support equipment. It normally includes 
roughly 100 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not responding to any specific threat (to Turkey),'' one  
official said. ``The Turkish government made a request which we 
consider to be a prudent one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A formal deployment order was expected to be signed soon, one  
official said. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who would sign such 
an order, was en route to Washington from South Korea today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no indication that we won't go ahead with this,'' the  
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots, operated by U.S. Army crews, originally were  
designed to shoot down aircraft, but they have been modified for 
use against shorter-range ballistic missiles. Patriot batteries 
already are deployed in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday  
would not say whether Washington intended to honor Turkey's request 
for the Patriot missiles. ``We are interested in being as 
supportive as we can to any of our coalition partners who are 
involved in this operation,'' Doubleday said, referring to 
enforcement of the ``no-fly'' zone. ``And we will be looking at 
their request and reach a decision on that very soon.''

<HEADLINE> Jets' Glenn Unlikely To Play Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The New York Jets likely will be without Pro Bowl  
cornerback Aaron Glenn for Sunday's AFC Championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Parcells said Friday upon his team's arrival in  
Denver that Glenn, while listed as questionable with an ankle 
injury, ``doesn't look like he will play.'' Glenn aggravated the 
ankle during practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't cancel him out at this moment,'' Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
	While Glenn's absence could be a significant problem for New  
York's secondary, replacement Ray Mickens has played very well 
since Glenn was hurt on Dec. 6 against Seattle. Mickens, who 
usually plays as the nickel back and guards the slot receiver, was 
solid as a starter on the corner against Miami, Buffalo, New 
England and in last Sunday's playoff victory over Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn, who made the Pro Bowl for the second straight year and  
led the Jets with six interceptions, was hurt making his last 
pickoff of the season. He had been beaten for two long touchdowns 
by Joey Galloway in the first quarter in man coverage -- Glenn's 
strength. He leaped to grab Jon Kitna's bomb for Galloway and was 
hurt when he landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Glenn admitted the right ankle will hurt him  
until next season, but was hopeful of playing. Parcells wasn't so 
sure on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played a lot the last 5-6 weeks without him,'' the coach  
said. ``He had a limited role last week. We'll keep doing with the 
players who are in there what we've been doing without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said Glenn twisted the ankle in practice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it was too serious, but he was not getting  
around too well,'' Parcells said of Glenn, who played almost 
exclusively in nickel situations last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's other starting cornerback, Otis Smith, had a good  
season, but struggled against Jacksonville, allowing two 
touchdowns. Parcells said Smith was directly responsible for one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	If Glenn can't go, the Jets might use rookie Kevin Williams, a  
converted safety, and veteran Marcus Coleman at cornerback behind 
Smith and Mickens.

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Makes Clinton Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- After the first week of tense testimony in  
a closely watched abortion trial, tempers flared when a federal 
judge chided a witness by saying: ``Truthful means truthful. ... 
This is not a Clinton deposition!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remark Friday, which prompted a call for a mistrial from  
defense lawyers, came just minutes before U.S. District Robert E. 
Jones was about to recess the jury for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	He quickly downplayed the statement as an ill-timed joke.  
</P>
<P>
	``I sincerely apologize,'' Jones told a courtroom echoing with  
both gasps and laughter. ``May the record reflect that the court is 
smiling and the witness is smiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers, however, weren't smiling. They accused the  
judge of ruining the credibility of their witness, Wisconsin 
anti-abortion activist Monica Miller, who had simply responded to a 
question by asking: ``What do you mean by truthful?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You yelled at this witness,'' defense attorney Denis Brenan  
told Jones. ``You've impugned this witness' credibility with your 
outburst. I call for a mistrial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones denied the motion and moved on from the gaffe, which for  
the moment overshadowed a case that during its first week has put 
the tactics of abortion foes on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs -- including Planned Parenthood and several abortion  
doctors -- claim that posters targeting abortion doctors and a Web 
site detailing personal information on ``baby butchers'' violate a 
1994 federal law that bars threats of force against abortion 
doctors and their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for more than a dozen defendants acknowledged the  
posters and ``The Nuremberg Files'' Web site contain strong 
statements and graphic images, but they maintain it is only 
constitutionally protected political speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site attracted national attention last October when it  
crossed through the name of Dr. Barnett Slepian after he was killed 
by sniper fire in his home outside Buffalo, N.Y. Other doctors who 
have been killed are also checked off, and those merely wounded are 
shaded out in light gray.

<HEADLINE> Court To Consider Casino Ad Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court will decide whether a  
disputed federal law violates free-speech rights or effectively 
protects compulsive gamblers from the lure of casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Friday it will judge the validity of a ban on  
television and radio ads that promote casinos not owned by Indian 
tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban is only in effect in some parts of the nation because  
some federal appeals courts have ruled it unconstitutional while 
others have upheld it. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down  
the ban last year, blocking its enforcement in nine Western states 
-- Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, 
Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court refused last February to review that 9th  
Circuit court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The longstanding federal law bans broadcast advertising for  
``any lottery, gift enterprise or similar scheme offering prizes 
dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress in the past 20 years has amended the anti-broacast  
law to allow airing ads for casinos on Indian reservations, 
state-run lotteries or any gambling sponsored by nonprofit 
promoters working for charitable purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, 37 states and the District of Columbia sponsor -- and  
aggressively advertise -- lotteries, and more than two-thirds of the 
states are home to Indian-owned casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-Indian casinos are legal in 22 states, and the appeal acted  
on Friday focuses on how the federal ban affects advertising for 
those establishments. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals upheld the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers say the New Orleans court was right.  
They point to studies detailing economic and social problems, such 
as compulsive gambling and organized crime, associated with casino 
gambling and other gaming activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Broadcast advertising of casino gambling would directly  
contribute to compulsive gambling,'' government lawyers said in a 
New Jersey case the justices last week refused to give expedited 
review. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking to have the 5th Circuit court's ruling overturned,  
the Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association and individual 
radio and television stations contend that the government's stated 
concern for compulsive gamblers is hard to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Broadcasters are encouraged to air advertisements that feature  
gaming conducted on Indian reservations and are permitted to 
broadcast advertisements that feature pari-mutuel betting and other 
sports betting,'' they noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent Supreme Court rulings appeared to cut against such an  
advertising ban. The court ruled in a Rhode Island case last year 
that states may not ban all advertising that refers to liquor 
prices in efforts to promote sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters Friday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to decide in a case from Illinois whether the Equal  
Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency that protects workers 
against on-the-job bias, can order other federal agencies to pay 
damages to employees they discriminate against. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said it will use a Louisiana case to decide whether a jury that  
determines a police officer used excessive force also can shield 
the officer from paying monetary damages.

<HEADLINE> Man Apologizes for 1979 Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLATHE, Kan. (AP) -- Calling himself a coward, Daniel Crocker  
said he was sorry for killing a young woman nearly 20 years ago and 
then was sent to prison for a crime authorities had lost hope of 
solving until his surrender last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Crocker, 38, waited years before his Christian faith compelled  
him to confess to killing Tracy Fresquez, 19. He said he smothered 
her during a sexual assault because he thought he heard someone 
approaching and didn't want to get caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sacrificed her life for my own,'' he said in court Thursday.  
``I didn't come here professing to be anything less than a 
coward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crocker was sentenced to 20 to 60 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	The crime went unsolved until last September, when Crocker,  
living with his wife and children in Chantilly, Va., flew to Kansas 
City to finally tell what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's relatives asked the judge to impose the maximum  
sentence of 15 years to life in prison. Her sister, brother and 
father, each bearing a photograph of the teen-ager, spoke of the 
pain Crocker had caused. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Fresquez, once under suspicion in the slaying, said the  
murder hastened the death of his wife, who was already seriously 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had her spirit and her will to live taken away from her,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was ``haunted daily'' by the memory of placing his  
wife's hand on their daughter's cold body as they viewed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy was living with her fiancee in a Shawnee apartment when  
she was found strangled in her bed on Oct. 6, 1979. Last November, 
Crocker pleaded guilty to charges of second-degree murder and 
attempted rape. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sentencing, Crocker's wife Nicollete grasped hands  
with Jay Fresquez, who gently patted her back as they spoke softly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know. I didn't know,'' she told him repeatedly.  
</P>
<P>
	Crocker told her about the incident before they were married in  
1987, but led her to believe that it was an accidental death caused 
by drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Crocker said her son, Isaac, 9, and daughter, Analiese, 8,  
know their father is doing what had to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no hate or bitterness,'' she said. ``They love their  
dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the future of her marriage, Mrs. Crocker said it's a  
``personal issue that Daniel and I will work out together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> NRA, Businesses Defend Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The recent round of lawsuits against gun  
manufacturers has attracted the attention of broader-based business 
groups, wondering which industry will be next. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal  
Reform plan to meet next week to discuss what steps to take in 
support of the gun manufacturers. Meanwhile, the National Rifle 
Association already has entered the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are lawsuits filed by Chicago and New Orleans, and  
maybe other cities, asking gun manufacturers to pay the costs of 
treating gunshot victims and responding to gun-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are modeled after the just-settled tobacco lawsuits,  
which will bring millions of dollars into municipal treasuries and 
impose new restrictions on cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns are the only unregulated consumer product in America,''  
said Bob Walker, president of Handgun Control Inc., a gun control 
group whose educational and legal arm, the Center to Prevent 
Handgun Violence, is helping in the New Orleans suit. ``At the 
moment, the courts are the best means available of assuring that 
gun manufacturers are held to a reasonable standard of 
accountability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the cigarette manufacturers, the gun manufacturers want to  
shift the debate away from their industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people out there who feel the courts and  
judges are out of control,'' said Bob Ricker, director of 
government affairs for the American Shooting Sports Council, the 
trade association for gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun manufacturers plan to ask both Congress and state  
legislatures for legislation that would restrict the cities from 
going to court, either by requiring states to approve all lawsuits 
or by prohibiting suits where the lawyers work on contingency, 
getting paid only if they win. 
</P>
<P>
	To bolster their efforts, the gun manufacturers are trying to  
make common cause with business groups that have long favored 
limits on liability suits, the same way the tobacco industry 
enlisted the support of organizations opposed to government 
regulations and higher taxes and framed the tobacco debate that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't going to stop with guns,'' Ricker said. ``They've  
already got their sights on the alcohol industry, fast food, 
automobiles. We're going to try to do whatever we can to shape 
public opinion to really expose these rich trial lawyers for what 
they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chamber of Commerce, which backed the tobacco industry, is  
ready to do the same for the gun manufacturers, said Larry Kraus, 
president of the chamber's Institute for Legal Reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt an obligation with tobacco to stand up and speak  
out,'' Kraus said. ``We did it there, we'll do it with guns and 
we'll do it with every target until we can put a stop to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also intervening on the side of the gun manufacturers is the  
NRA, one of Washington's most potent lobbying groups. The NRA plans 
to conduct its own campaigns in support of legislation curbing the 
lawsuits, but will coordinate its efforts with the gun 
manufacturers, Ricker said. NRA officials were unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker of Handgun Control said the NRA's loyalties were  
misguided. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the NRA was serious about protecting the interests of gun  
owners and their families, they too would be suing the gun 
manufacturers,'' Walker said. ``The Triple A never tried to protect 
the rights of car manufacturers to make unsafe cars. Why should the 
NRA protect the rights of gun manufacturers to make unsafe guns?''

<HEADLINE> Marines' Lawyers Discuss Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Attorneys for two Marine aviators  
facing courts-martial next month for an Italian ski gondola tragedy 
that killed 20 people suggested Friday some evidence was open to 
tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph Schweitzer,  
31, the navigator, are each charged with 20 counts of involuntary 
manslaughter and negligent homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Their EA-6B Prowler jet cut a cable Feb. 3 in the Italian Alps,  
sending the ski gondola plummeting hundreds of feet into a mountain 
valley. Prosecutors claim the jet was flying too low and too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense lawyers said at a hearing there was ample  
opportunity for someone to tamper with evidence from the jet. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers said exhibits were spread out on a table in a room  
where investigators met, that some evidence was not locked up, and 
that an inventory was not done until the day after the tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Lott Distances Self From Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott  
distanced himself Friday from an ultra-conservative group that has 
been accused of supporting the notion of white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	His uncle, a member of the Mississippi chapter of the Council of  
Conservative Citizens, had said Lott is an honorary member. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have made my condemnation of the white supremacist and  
racist views espoused by this or any other group clear,'' Lott, 
R-Miss., said in a statement. ``Any use of my name to publicize 
their beliefs is not only unauthorized, it is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Lord, coordinator of the chapter, backed up Lott's  
assertion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have members from all over the country but Trent Lott is  
not among them, honorary or otherwise, and never has been,'' Lord 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	To many in Mississippi, Lord's organization and its priorities  
conjure up memories of the notorious segregationist Citizens 
Councils of the Civil Rights era. 
</P>
<P>
	The Council of Conservative Citizens, created in the mid-1980s,  
has attracted little attention as it has pushed a variety of issues 
dear to many Southern white conservatives. Those issues range from 
challenging federal control to upholding the right to display the 
Confederate flag. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Dec. 18 report, the Southern Poverty Law Center called the  
group ``the incarnation of the infamous white Citizens Councils'' 
and said it was ``shot through with white supremacist views, 
members and political positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's uncle Arnie Watson, a former state senator, tax assessor  
and a CCC board member, said there was no doubt Lott has been an 
honorary member of the group for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just made him an honorary member during a Trent Lott Day  
in Carrollton,'' Watson said Friday. ``It was when he spoke up here 
and when he was first running for Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson said he was unsure whether Lott's name was still on any  
membership list. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord and Watson agreed that Lott addressed a council-sponsored  
political rally four years ago. Lord said that Lott spoke on issues 
pending before Congress and that candidates also addressed the 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord denied the organization is racist. He said there were black  
members, but he gave no numbers or names. He said the group counts 
34 Mississippi legislators as well as public officials in a number 
of states among its 15,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., last month defended his appearance at one  
of the council's meetings, saying he was discussing impeachment and 
strongly disagrees ``with many of this group's ridiculous views.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from House managers' presentation before the Senate  
Friday in the impeachment trial of President Clinton, as 
transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 

</P>
<P>
	``It's only if you determine he committed the crimes of perjury,  
obstruction of justice and witness tampering that you ever move on 
to the question of whether he is removed from office. In fact, no 
one, none of us would argue to you that the president should be 
removed from office unless you conclude he committed the crimes 
that he is alleged to have committed.'' -- Rep. Bill McCollum, 
R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe the sworn testimony of Monica Lewinsky, if you  
believe her testimony that's in the record -- and she's very 
credible. The president knowingly, intentionally and willfully set 
out on a course of conduct in December 1997 to lie to the Jones 
court, to hide his relationship and to encourage others to lie and 
hide evidence. And to conceal the relationship with Monica Lewinsky 
from the court.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The record is so clear on this that if you have any  
significant doubt about Monica Lewinsky's credibility or testimony 
you should bring her in here and let us examine her face to face so 
you can judge her credibility for yourself.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``To keep his relationship with Monica Lewinsky from the court,  
once Judge Wright issued her ruling, he knew he would have to lie 
to the court. To succeed at this, he decided that he had to get 
Monica Lewinsky to file a false affidavit, to try to avoid having 
her testify. And he needed to get her a job to make her happy. To 
make sure she executed that false affidavit, and then stick with 
her lies when she was questioned about it.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Long before the president was called to give a deposition or  
Monica Lewinsky was named on the witness list in the Jones case, 
the evidence shows that she and the president had concocted cover 
stories, that they had an understanding that she would lie about 
the relationship and so would he if anybody asked about it.'' -- 
McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In her grand jury testimony, Monica Lewinsky says the  
president didn't tell her to lie. But because of their previous 
understanding, she assumed that they both expected that she would 
lie in that affidavit.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe Monica Lewinsky, can there be any doubt that  
the president was suggesting that she file an affidavit that 
contains lies and falsehoods that might keep her from every having 
to testify in the Jones case and give the president the kind of 
protection that he needed when he testified?'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Monica Lewinsky saw him (the president) a lot of other times,  
and the president certainly knew that.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how anybody can say this man wasn't paying  
attention (during the Jones deposition). He certainly wasn't 
thinking about anything else. And that was very obvious from 
looking at that video.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I implore you not to get hung up on some of the details in  
this. It's absurd, some of the arguments that are being made and 
have been made by the president and his attorneys to try to explain 
this stuff. This is a perfect example of that. We start looking 
around at this. You can't see the forest sometimes for the trees.'' 
-- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense that the president's secretary, who is  
so close to him ... that she would have taken these gifts and would 
have hidden them under her bed and never talked with the president 
about doing so before or after she did so. That just doesn't make 
sense.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In the context of everything, it seems abundantly clear that  
the president was trying to make sure that Betty Currie 
corroborated his lies and cover stories from the deposition if she 
were ever called to testify in the Jones case or before the grand 
jury or in any other court proceeding. That's what he was doing. In 
doing so, the president committed the crimes of witness tampering 
and obstruction of justice.'' -- McCollum.

<HEADLINE> Higher Speed Limits Increase Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The adage is ``speed kills.'' A new study by a  
leading insurance group shows that more speed kills more people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety reported Thursday that  
highway deaths have increased roughly 15 percent in states that 
have increased their speed limits since Congress abolished the 
national 55-mph limit in late 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In states that have maintained the old limit, deaths have  
remained fairly constant. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute's findings buttress a similar report to Congress  
last year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
They also expand on an earlier institute report, which found that 
highway deaths increased about 12 percent in the first 12 states to 
raise speed limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear from this study that the current round of speed  
limit increases, like increases on rural interstates in the 1980s, 
is costing hundreds of lives per year,'' said institute president 
Brian O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Motorists Association, a Wisconsin-based drivers  
organization that fought for the speed limit increase, concedes 
that highway deaths may be up. It maintains, however, that deaths 
have not increased in proportion to increased driving spurred by 
low gasoline prices and the booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The group noted NHTSA reported recently that overall traffic  
fatalities -- those that occur on roads as well as highways -- have 
been declining in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the last year for which complete statistics are  
available, 41,967 people were killed in automobile accidents. The 
year before, 42,085 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	Since people drove a little more than 2.5 trillion miles in  
1997, the death rate was 1.6 per 100 million miles traveled -- an 
all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
	``The faster you're going, the more distance it takes to stop,''  
said Jim Baxter, president of the National Motorists Association. 
``The corollary is that you're usually more attentive to what 
you're doing, you're spending less time on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress established the national 55-mph speed limit in 1974 in  
response to the energy crisis. In 1987, with fuel again abundant, 
Congress allowed states to repeal the limit on rural interstates. 
In December 1995, the national limit on all highways and freeways 
was abolished. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, 43 states have changed their speed limits. The  
insurance institute decided to study 24, excluding the other 19 
because they had too few miles of highway or because their speed 
limit changes were restricted to certain sections of interstate. 
</P>
<P>
	It compared highway deaths in the 24 states with seven that have  
not changed speed limits. Using a complex statistical formula, the 
institute concluded that deaths in the states with speed limit 
changes increased by 15 percent. In states that did not change, the 
numbers were steady.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Ends First Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The prosecution's tale of perjury and  
obstruction is unfolding before a jury of 100 hushed senators in 
President Clinton's impeachment trial, but Democrats who would have 
to provide the margin for conviction say they are unmoved so far by 
the presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising from their curved, custom-built tables in a chamber  
steeped with history, House ``managers'' took turns in their 
opening statements Thursday to argue for removing the 42nd 
president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The second of three days set aside for the House's presentation  
was continuing today with a summation of evidence and arguments 
that the president's conduct violated criminal law. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton carried on at the White House on Thursday, preparing for  
next Tuesday's State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Today he was scheduled to address a reinventing government forum  
at the State Department before flying to New York City to unveil a 
new economic initiative designed to encourage investment in 
underserved inner-city and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The first presidential impeachment trial this century was  
carried out with decorum inside the Senate chamber, where senators 
sat in silence for nearly six hours with just two quick recesses. 
But once senators stepped outside into the hallways, the opening 
volleys of a political free-for-all got under way. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesmen derided the case by the all-Republican  
prosecution team. Democratic senators said they had heard nothing 
new. Republicans praised the prosecutors' presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., chided Democrats in  
a written statement for commenting on the substance of the case -- 
contending most Republicans followed his admonition to hold their 
political fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we heard today was nothing new,'' said freshman Sen.  
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who had the unique circumstance of serving 
on the House Judiciary Committee as that panel built the 
impeachment case with sharp partisan divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some in the House hope if we keep saying it enough,  
maybe (pro-Clinton) public opinion will change. I don't think so,'' 
Schumer told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, countered that the prosecution  
brought the jurors ``a chronology we've not had. ... The 
presentations were very meaningful and very strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A team of White House lawyers sat at their own curved table  
opposite the prosecution team, waiting to present their case next 
week but unable under Senate rules to raise any objections. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, presidential spokesman James Kennedy  
attacked the Republican case as ``both unsubstantial and 
circumstantial. We look forward to presenting our defense based on 
the facts, the law and the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in  
two articles of impeachment approved Dec. 19 by the House along 
partisan lines. It takes a two-thirds vote in the Senate to remove 
the president from office, meaning a dozen Democrats would have to 
join the 55 Republicans to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., presenting the case for  
obstruction, methodically weaved together a series of presidential 
actions in late 1997 and into 1998 that, he said, were designed to 
keep Clinton's extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky from the 
Paula Jones lawyers at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning on Dec. 5, 1997, when Ms. Lewinsky was added to the  
potential list of witnesses in Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment 
lawsuit against the president, ``the wheels of obstruction started 
rolling and they did not stop until the president successfully 
blocked the truth from coming out on a civil rights case,'' 
Hutchinson argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., presenting the perjury case against  
Clinton, showed videotape from the president's grand jury testimony 
to pick apart his statements about his relationship with Ms. 
Lewinsky, a former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a trial is permitted before this body where live witnesses  
can be called, and their credibility can be scrutinized, the 
evidence will show the president charted a course of perjury,'' 
Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the chamber Rogan said, ``I don't see how the case can  
be presented without witnesses'' including Ms. Lewinsky, 
presidential secretary Betty Currie, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan 
and the president himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has put off a decision on witnesses for two weeks  
until the Clinton side presents its case next week and senators 
have a chance to send written questions to the presiding officer, 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Presenting an overview for the prosecution, Rep. James  
Sensenbrenner, R- Wis., argued ``failure to bring President Clinton 
to account ... will cause a cancer to be present in our society for 
generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said in his presentation that Clinton  
designed his actions to protect himself, while ``subordinates and 
friends alike are drawn into this web of deceit. The president is 
insulated. Crimes are committed. Justice is denied. The rule of law 
is suspended. And this president is the beneficiary.''

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Former United States Auto Club president  
Thomas W. Binford, who guided the group during its early years and 
was the Indianapolis 500's chief referee for 22 years, died 
Thursday of a cerebral hemorrhage. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Binford, who was one of the city's leading bankers, served as  
president of the USAC from 1957-1969. He also was chief steward of 
the Indianapolis 500 from 1974-1995. 
</P>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Radio and television actress Betty Lou  
Gerson, who gave a voice to fur-loving villainess Cruella De Vil in 
Disney's animated 1961 feature ``101 Dalmatians,'' died Tuesday 
after suffering a stroke last week. She was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney animator Marc Davis, who designed and drew Cruella De Vil  
in the classic movie, said Ms. Gerson helped define the character. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gerson began her radio career in 1935. She had dramatic  
roles on programs like ``First Nighter,'' ``Grand Hotel'' and ``The 
Lux Radio Theater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was in ``The Twilight Zone,'' ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,''  
``Perry Mason'' and ``The Untouchables'' on television and appeared 
in films such as ``Undercover Girl'' and ``The Fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her distinctive voice earned her the role of narrator in  
Disney's 1950 animated feature ``Cinderella'' and an on-screen 
cameo appearance in ``Mary Poppins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gerson gave up acting until she did voice-over work in  
recent years. She gave voice to a fish diva named Francis in the 
1997 animated feature, ``Cats Don't Dance.''

	CASTRO VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Dr. Gerald Klooster, an Alzheimer's  
victim who became the subject of a custody dispute after his wife 
was accused of trying to arrange for him to commit suicide with Dr. 
Jack Kevorkian's help, died Wednesday of natural causes. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Klooster's son, Dr. Gerald Klooster II, filed for  
custody of his father in Petoskey, Mich. He said his mother, Ruth 
Klooster, was trying to arrange for Kevorkian to help the older 
Klooster commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Klooster acknowledged having talked to Kevorkian by phone  
but denied ever trying to help her husband end his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The family battled for months in court, and judges in Petoskey  
and California reached opposing decisions. A settlement was reached 
under which Klooster was returned to California to live with his 
wife in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, Klooster was found unconscious in his home  
from an overdose of alcohol and barbiturates. His son suggested his 
mother had given Klooster the cocktail. Mrs. Klooster denied that. 
Afterward, a judge ordered that a nurse live with the couple.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Finally Coach of Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The last time Tim Floyd got a new job, a  
helicopter tailed him on his way in from the airport, reporters 
jammed a conference room at the United Center and Chicago Bulls 
chairman Jerry Reinsdorf took time out to stop by. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he got a podium at the Bulls practice facility and a  
dozen reporters. A little less dramatic, but that's what happens 
when everyone knew the job was his six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to getting to the floor and coaching,''  
said Floyd, who finally was named head coach Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the former Iowa State coach also knows he's in for a tough  
start. Michael Jordan retired two days ago and last season's 
championship team is all but dismantled. General manager Jerry 
Krause is trying to work out sign-and-trade deals for Scottie 
Pippen, Dennis Rodman and Luc Longley, sources told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have just four players under contract -- Ron Harper,  
Toni Kukoc, Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- with Harper the only 
starter. That's not even enough to hold a real practice when 
training camp opens next week. 
</P>
<P>
	And if that's not bad enough, the Bulls' first exhibition game  
is against the Indiana Pacers, the same team that took them to 
seven games in the Eastern Conference finals last year and has been 
practicing together all fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a daunting task,'' Floyd admitted. ``I'm  
standing here in front of six trophies, you've got a hall of fame 
coach that you're replacing and the best basketball player in the 
world left your team two days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``So if anybody wants to trade positions, come on,'' he added,  
drawing laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Floyd has a solid record as a college coach, the  
44-year-old has no NBA experience. Still, his appointment hardly 
came as a surprise. He'd been rumored to be Jackson's successor for 
the past two seasons -- long before Jackson got on his 
Harley-Davidson and roared off last June after the Bulls won their 
sixth championship of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was hired in July, but the team gave him the temporary  
title of ``director of basketball operations'' because Jordan swore 
he wouldn't play for anyone but Jackson. Floyd would be the Bulls' 
next coach, Reinsdorf promised at the time, but only if Jackson 
turned the job down again when the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson did say no, but Reinsdorf held off a little longer so he  
could talk to Jordan. Jordan announced his retirement Wednesday, 
clearing the way for Floyd's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's stepping into the fire and he knows it,'' said Steve  
Kerr, one of Chicago's many free agents. ``He's the coach who comes 
in when Michael Jordan leaves. I don't envy him. He's got a tough 
job ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd said he's not worried about being seen as ``the coach who  
ran Michael Jordan out of basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan himself said he didn't have the mental energy needed to  
play, and that even Jackson might not have been able to motivate 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would much preferred having a Michael Jordan on my team as a  
coach,'' Floyd said. ``(But) somebody was going to have to be 
standing here today and moving into this position. I'm glad it's 
me. I'm looking forward to trying to carry on the Bulls' way of 
doing things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's winning championships, regardless of who comes back.  
It might take a while -- Floyd joked that he should ask Krause to 
add another year or two to his five-year contract now that Jordan 
is gone -- but the Bulls aren't giving up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's a patchwork type of situation or whether it's a  
long-term process still remains to be seen,'' he said. ``You just 
hope you can have a little fun along the way with that journey, 
regardless of what it is.''

<HEADLINE> House Prosecutors Want Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors prodded senators at  
President Clinton's impeachment trial on Friday to summon Monica 
Lewinsky and others for testimony and perhaps invite Clinton to 
appear. The White House said Republicans want witnesses only 
because ``they do not have a case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue raised the threat of a partisan clash at the historic  
Senate proceedings. One senior Democrat, Edward M. Kennedy of 
Massachusetts, said ``there may be very well'' a party line vote on 
whether to seek depositions from the key people in the presidential 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of possible witnesses loomed over the second day of  
the day's arguments in the Senate chamber as the House made 
Clinton's credibility a key issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time and again the president says one thing and they say  
something entirely different,'' argued Rep. Bill McCollum, the 
first of several House prosecutors to speak during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Common sense says ``it's the president who is not telling the  
truth,'' he added, and if senators have doubts they should bring 
the witnesses in to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist presided over the  
extraordinary proceedings, his judicial robe symbolizing the 
gravity of the moment. As on the trial's opening day on Thursday, 
all 100 senators sat attentively at their desks as they listened to 
the recitation of evidence in the second presidential impeachment 
trial in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	The first unscripted moment of the trial occurred near the end  
of the day when Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa rose to object 
to the prosecutors' ``continued use of the word 'jurors''' to 
describe senators. The Constitution scrupulously avoids using that 
word, he said, and senators are ``triers'' of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators, who had been sitting silently for hours, seemed  
startled by the objection, and a few reached for their legal pads 
to make notes. Rehnquist, called on to make his first ruling of the 
trial, decided instantly. ``The objection is well taken. The Senate 
is not simply a jury but a court,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, lines of spectators spilled out of  
the Capitol into the plaza outside as hundreds of citizens waited 
for their 15-minute turn in the spectator gallery that rings the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how you think about the issue, you are watching a  
piece of history,'' said Kurt Gahnberg of Seattle, who sat with his 
wife and 12-year-old twin girls. ``It's easy, I think, to get 
overly callous on the whole deal ... if you just follow it at 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is accused of perjury and obstruction of justice for  
attempting to conceal his sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a 
former White House intern. If convicted, he would be removed from 
office, but even some of the Republicans prosecuting the case 
concede it would take a fundamental shift in the political 
environment for a two-thirds majority of the Senate to vote against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, the president was in New York to promote more  
investments by Wall Street in rural and minority areas. Lavished 
with praise at one event, Clinton quipped it was ``the sort of 
thing people say for your funeral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're there yet,'' he added with a laugh.  
</P>
<P>
	At the Capitol, after the day's session ended, White House  
lawyer Gregory Craig fired back at the prosecutors' demand for 
witnesses. He said they wanted to ``expand and extend this 
proceeding for one reason: They do not have a case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters that if any  
witnesses are called, ``this will take an extended time -- 
discovery, motions -- and I think everyone in this country believes 
the time to bring this effort to a close is soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, who helped engineer a bipartisan compromise on trial  
ground rules last week, made his comments to a handful of 
reporters. At the same time, individual Republicans began speaking 
out in favor of calling at least a limited number of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no value in having the president come,'' said Sen.  
Robert Bennett of Utah. However, Bennett said he was ``moving 
toward'' favoring the idea that other witnesses be summoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a moderate, said witnesses  
could be heard ``in an effective way. ... Have them stick just to 
the narrow points. We don't want them wandering all over the place. 
'' 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of 51 votes could determine the issue, meaning that a  
unified GOP caucus -- with 55 members -- could overrule any 
Democratic opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. dismissed the  
suggestion that Clinton would testify even before McCollum made it. 
He told reporters the administration has already said Clinton won't 
come. ``I think it's a non-issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Democratic aides said they believed few, if any, Democratic  
senators would support a request to call witnesses. Republicans, on 
the other hand, generally favor the move. 
</P>
<P>
	That raises the threat of a struggle that senators of both  
parties have tried hard to avoid in an attempt to present a 
dignified face to the public as they struggle with the second 
presidential impeachment trial in history. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecution team divided its three-day opening  
presentation among 13 lawmakers, Republicans all, and it ranged 
from a recitation of the now-familiar facts of the case to 
something akin to a law school seminar. At one point, Rep. Steve 
Chabot of Ohio led the senators through the intricacies of perjury 
law, complete with multiple case citations. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the case that Clinton's actions violated specific federal  
laws, the House prosecutors put at the center of their case two 
women who cast his presidency into crisis. That he had 
``obliterated'' Paula Jones' rights to a fair trial and they 
implored senators to heed the ``very credible'' words of Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an attempt, a bold attempt, one that succeeded in some  
respects, to obstruct the justice sought by a fellow American 
citizen,'' Rep. George Gekas said of Clinton's efforts to hide his 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky from the court in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is heavy. That is soul searching in its quality. That  
goes beyond those who would say: He committed perjury about sex, so 
what?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum went at the issue of witnesses at the beginning of his  
remarks, and returned to it at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton engaged in a ``pattern of obstruction of justice,  
perjury and witness tampering'' designed to impede the proceedings 
in Paula Jones' sexual harassment case, he argued. ``If you believe 
the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, you cannot believe the president 
or accept the arguments of his lawyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators must decide, he argued, and ``if you have any  
significant doubt about Monica Lewinsky's credibility on this 
testimony, you should have us bring her in here and examine her 
face to face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he summed up: ``Time and again, the president says one  
thing and they (Jordan, Mrs. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky and White House 
aides) say something entirely different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they have a doubt about the testimony of key witnesses,  
``then let us bring them before you to testify in person and invite 
the president to come and judge everybody's credibility for 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial proceeded against an almost surreal political  
backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's poll ratings remain unusually high, despite the  
disclosures about his personal life, and next Tuesday, the very day 
his defense team begins its presentation to the trial, has been set 
for his State of the Union address.

<HEADLINE> Purchases of Tobacco To Fall in '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- U.S. cigarette manufacturers plan to  
purchase 291 million pounds of burley tobacco from the 1999 crop, a 
drop of almost 31 percent compared to last year, the federal Farm 
Service Agency announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement is the latest indication that tobacco companies  
anticipate reduced demand for their product in the wake of the $206 
billion tobacco settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated by it,'' said Rod Kuegel, a tobacco farmer and  
president of the Burley Tobacco Farmers Cooperative Association. 
``We didn't expect anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies' declaration of their intended purchase is the  
main component in determining the basic quota for the eight states 
that grow burley tobacco. That number, in turn, determines farmers' 
annual production quotas -- which now look like they will be sharply 
down this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfort, Gov. Paul Patton said he was ``disappointed by the  
purchase intentions announced by the major tobacco companies and 
the implications for our Kentucky farm families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patton said he hoped a round of talks with company  
representatives, scheduled for next Wednesday and Thursday in 
Durham, N.C., would get closer to an agreement ``to fairly and 
adequately compensate growers for any declines they experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the governor said he is pressing the companies to purchase  
tobacco from the reserve pools maintained by the burley tobacco 
cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers had already indicated that they plan to buy 28  
percent less flue-cured tobacco from growers this year, so Friday's 
announced decline in intended burley purchases was not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	The formula for the basic quota includes the expected purchases  
by the U.S. cigarette makers plus the average annual burley tobacco 
export for the previous three years plus the amount of tobacco 
needed to maintain reserve stock levels. The secretary of 
agriculture can then adjust the quota up or down 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year export average for 1996-98 was 185.9 million  
pounds, which would put the 1999 basic quota at 476.9 million 
pounds plus the adjustment for reserves and any adjustment by the 
agriculture secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Service Agency said it would announce the 1999 basic  
quota by Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, manufacturers' intended purchases totaled 421.1  
million pounds. That number was down 11 percent from 1997, when 
intended purchases totaled 473.5 million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette manufacturers must buy at least 90 percent of their  
announced plans or pay a penalty.

<HEADLINE> Many Angolans Face Hunger, Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAXITO, Angola (AP) -- Thousands of people driven from their  
homes by fighting in northern Angola have poured into a makeshift 
camp, placing a huge strain on local resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent arrivals say thousands more are coming behind them as  
fierce fighting continues between the army and UNITA rebels. 
Angola's civil war restarted last month, shattering a U.N.-brokered 
peace accord in this southwest African nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The influx over the last 20 days of more than 5,000 people has  
increased the number of displaced people at the grass-hut camp to 
23,000, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got space to take more, but we hope we don't get many  
more mouths to feed,'' said Isabel Pegado, the top government aid 
official in Caxito, 40 miles north of the capital, Luanda. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Food Program delivers up to 500 tons of food -- mostly  
corn, beans and cooking oil -- each month, but that will have to be 
increased if more people arrive, Pegado said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel Primeiro, 54, said he and his family fled their village  
in Piri forest on Dec. 25 when the rebels attacked just before 
dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just ran. We brought nothing. Nothing except the clothes we  
were sleeping in,'' he said, sitting beneath a dirty tarpaulin with 
his year-old granddaughter Lena. 
</P>
<P>
	Primeiro, his wife, daughter and two grandchildren walked for  
over a week across country to reach the camp, sometimes resting for 
a day to let their bare feet heal. 
</P>
<P>
	A steady stream of women and children make their way in the  
sticky heat to a river about a mile away from the camp and fetch 
water in plastic buckets balanced on their head. A warm breeze 
sweeps across the plain, stirring the dusty soil. 
</P>
<P>
	The men build or repair their huts which are made of branches  
tied together with supple bark and then covered with abundant tall 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Small children, dehydrated and undernourished after their  
cross-country trek, are fed a special diet of milk and vitamins at 
a nutrition center in an abandoned church. 
</P>
<P>
	At the moment, camp official say they are managing to cope with  
the influx. 
</P>
<P>
	Angolan officials have experience in dealing with the plight of  
displaced people. The civil war first began after the country's 
1975 independence from Portugal. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the 
following year, and now a 1994 accord has unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
	The rainy season is due to arrive next month. Officials say the  
rains will crush the grass huts, turn the site to mud, and trigger 
a rise in cholera and acute diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	No one expects the war to have stopped before then.

<HEADLINE> Bill Parcells Vs. Mike Shanahan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The disparities come straight at you like Terrell  
Davis carrying the ball: East vs. West; offense vs. defense; loud 
and intimidating vs. cerebral and relatively unmenacing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Parcells vs. Mike Shanahan.  
</P>
<P>
	OK, so they'll be on the sidelines, not on the field, when the  
New York Jets play the Denver Broncos in Sunday's AFC Championship 
game. But they'll get as much camera time as league MVP Davis and 
the rest of the players at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, Bill and I can't play,'' said Shanahan, who guided  
Denver to its first Super Bowl triumph (after four losses under 
previous regimes) last January. ``Our players play. It's one of 
those games where you are playing for a championship and both teams 
are excited to get out there and show each other what they can 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams can do plenty. They appear to be at their peaks. The  
Jets, for example, have not been nearly this good since midway 
through the 1986 season, and they haven't been a true title 
contender since 1982. These Broncos probably are better than any of 
their previous Super Bowl visitors, even last season's champs. 
</P>
<P>
	And the coaching has so much to do with it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think you always get a little juiced up when you're going  
against a coach who has had a lot of success, and obviously a coach 
who has a couple of Super Bowl rings,'' Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells, who says he barely knows Shanahan, but admires his  
work, sees that work in how the Broncos conduct themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Broncos have won so many games in the last few years, I  
don't think anything that happens on the field is going to damage 
their mentality,'' said Parcells, who with a fourth straight 
victory in a conference championship game -- two came with the 
Giants and one with the Patriots -- would be the first man to coach 
three franchises to the Super Bowl. ``They get behind, they think 
they are going to come back ... I don't think we're speaking about 
fragile mentalities at this time of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Shanahan and Parcells are known for their leadership. Their  
backgrounds, however, are quite dissimilar. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan was a quarterback, Parcells a linebacker. Shanahan grew  
up in the Midwest and learned the pro game in Denver and San 
Francisco. Parcells was born and raised in New Jersey and did his 
apprenticeships on the Atlantic coast. 
</P>
<P>
	While Parcells led the Giants to two Super Bowl crowns in his  
first NFL head coaching stint, Shanahan was 8-12 for the Oakland 
Raiders and was fired four games into 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan is well-versed in all kinds of offensive schemes and  
was the coordinator for the 1994 champion San Francisco 49ers, who 
had one of the most dynamic attacks the league has seen. He has 
mixed elements of the West Coast offense with his own tenets and, 
thanks greatly to such talent as Davis, John Elway, Shannon Sharpe, 
Ed McCaffrey, Rod Smith and a superb offensive line, put together a 
nearly unstoppable offense in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells is a defensive guru, but one who is willing to open  
things up and gamble on offense. Parcells and longtime defensive 
coordinator Bill Belichick probably are the most innovative 
defensive coaches around, and they deploy personnel as well as 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the images, well, Parcells knows how to turn on the  
charm, but you never want to cross him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a coach who wants to make you a better player, and  
wants you to do your best,'' said Pro Bowl receiver Keyshawn 
Johnson. ``He'll keep coming at you to make sure you understand him 
and make sure you're working hard. But that's one of the things 
that makes him a great coach to play for. You know he'll give you 
the best chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan doesn't appear so gruff, but don't be misled. Nobody is  
testing him, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's tough on you,'' Broncos veteran safety Tyrone Braxton  
said of the man some players call ``Little General.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You think of a general who's going to be tough on you, but  
then he loves you as a person and as a player. He loves his 
soldiers, and he's going to nurture them, make sure they're 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like a successful approach.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan on Moss: No Mismatch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Brian Billick, the Minnesota Vikings'  
offensive coordinator, was asked this week what he would do if his 
best cornerback was 5-foot-9 Ray Buchanan and he had to cover 6-5 
Randy Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Billick replied. ``And if I did, I wouldn't  
tell you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan has no such qualms. He's not only happy to be covering  
the offensive rookie of the year, he's looking forward to it when 
his Atlanta Falcons (15-2) face Moss and the Vikings (15-1) Sunday 
with for a trip to the Super Bowl at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	This is how good Moss can be.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Arizona Cardinals covered him with Aeneas  
Williams, one of the best cornerbacks this decade in the NFL. 
Williams gave Moss trouble, and had a touchdown-saving 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Moss finished with four catches for 73 yards and a  
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a Pro Bowler himself, doesn't feel overmatched.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Lord has blessed Randy Moss,'' he said. ``The Lord has  
blessed me, too. He gave me great hands, quick feet, great 
maneuverability, great awareness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True enough.  
</P>
<P>
	And maybe if Moss were the only challenge for the Atlanta  
secondary, it would be fine. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's also Cris Carter, tight end Andrew Glover and maybe  
Jake Reed, although his hamstring problems might not allow him to 
play. If he can't, it'll be second-year man Matthew Hatchette, who 
has played well himself. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are running backs Robert Smith and Leroy Hoard --  
Smith a quick slasher and Hoard a power back. 
</P>
<P>
	That will keep Buchanan from covering Moss full time. In fact,  
the Vikings would like to get Moss against Michael Booker, who is 
6-2 but doesn't have the speed of Buchanan or Moss, who has been 
timed in less than 4.3 seconds for the 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Vikings say they're wary of whomever Atlanta plays.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're good enough so they don't have to try to fool you,''  
coach Dennis Green said. ``They play things pretty straight. They 
feel they can match their man and your man and try to beat you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That might make the matchups up front most important for the  
Atlanta defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota has three Pro Bowlers on its offensive line -- left  
tackle Todd Steussie, left guard Randall McDaniel and center Jeff 
Christy. On the right side, the Vikings have two linemen -- David 
Dixon and Korey Stringer -- whose combined weight is nearly 700 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Against them, the Falcons present a relatively small but very  
quick front. Tackle Travis Hall, at 300 pounds is the heaviest. 
Chuck Smith, the best pass rusher, doesn't weigh more than 260. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's the key, because putting pressure on Randall Cunningham  
is the best way to stop an offense that set an NFL record with 560 
points during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's other defensive weapon is simple -- offense, led by  
Jamal Anderson. He carried the ball an NFL record 410 times this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the real keys to our success is our ability to control  
the ball, whether it be running the football or making some 
conversions on third down, just constantly moving the football,'' 
coach Dan Reeves said. ``We can't be conservative. We've got to go 
after them because it's going to be that type of game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when the Falcons do give up the ball?  
</P>
<P>
	Just leave it to Ray Buchanan.

<HEADLINE> Rapper Involved in Police Shootout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wu Tang Klan rap singer ODB was arrested after a  
shootout with police Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported.  
</P>
<P>
	ODB, whose real name is Russell Jones, was arrested at about  
8:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 29, and another man were driving in a Chevrolet Tahoe  
with either one or both headlights out, said Detective Joseph 
Pentangelo, a police spokesman. A patrol car stopped the truck in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men got out of the truck and began firing an  
undetermined number of shots at police officers, said Pentangelo. 
Police returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was arrested at the scene. The second man, whose name was  
not immediately available, was arrested after a chase, said police. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men were charged with attempted murder of police officers.  
</P>
<P>
	In November, Jones was arrested in California for allegedly  
threatening to kill his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 17, Jones was arrested in West Hollywood for allegedly  
threatening to kill security officers at a blues club. In July, he 
was arrested on a charge that he shoplifted a pair of shoes in 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Jones crashed the stage at the Grammys and hijacked  
a microphone from Shawn Colvin. He apparently was upset his album 
``Wu-Tang Forever'' lost the best rap album Grammy to one by Puff 
Daddy.

	Impeachment Trial Begins 2nd Day  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House's presentation in President  
Clinton's impeachment trial continues today with a summation of 
evidence and arguments that Clinton's conduct violated criminal 
law. Democratic senators said they had heard nothing new from the 
prosecution team, while Republicans praised the presentations. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Not Big News Overseas  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Millions of British newspaper readers could be  
forgiven today if they knew little about the impeachment trial of 
President Clinton since like many newspapers in other parts of the 
world, the big-selling tabloids found other stories more 
interesting for their front pages. The broadsheets, however, 
regarded the possible ouster of the leader of the world's most 
powerful nation as front-page stuff.

<P>
	Clinton Challenges Wall Street  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is challenging Wall Street  
to invest in the underserved markets of America. Highlighting a 
section of his fiscal 2000 budget proposal, Clinton planned today 
to unveil a bundle of tax incentives and loan guarantees designed 
to attract venture capital to distressed areas from the barrios of 
Los Angeles to the hamlets of Appalachia.

	Dow Gains 128; Nasdaq Is Up 45  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just before noon EST, the Dow industrials were  
up 128.22 to 9,249.15. NYSE advancers led decliners 1,834-825. The 
Nasdaq was up 45.09 to 2,321.91. 

</P>
<P>
	Brazilian Currency Falls Sharply  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian currency tumbled  
today after the Central Bank refused to prop up the faltering 
currency in world financial markets. The action heightens the 
financial crisis in Latin America's largest economy and raises 
concerns about economic turmoil spreading throughout the region and 
even threatening the United States. 

</P>
<P>
	Winter Chills Midwest, Northeast  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Snow and freezing rain fell again early today  
across the East, where successive storms have collapsed roofs and 
stranded scores of vehicles on highways. More than 600 flights were 
canceled yesterday at the three major airports serving New York 
City, where up to 3 inches of snow fell into this morning before 
turning to freezing rain. President Clinton's trip to New York was 
delayed until today. 

</P>
<P>
	Palestinians Tout Statehood  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A majority of Palestinians support a unilateral  
declaration of statehood this May, according to a poll published 
today. Yasser Arafat, however, is under growing pressure from the 
United States and Egypt not to go ahead with plans to declare the 
state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on May 4, the deadline set 
for Israel and the Palestinians to have negotiated a permanent 
peace accord. 

</P>
<P>
	Iraqi Minister Derides U.S. Plan  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- An Iraqi Cabinet minister today dismissed a  
U.S. proposal to remove the cap on Iraq's oil exports and demanded 
anew that all U.N. trade sanctions on the country be lifted. Trade 
Minister Medhi Saleh's comments came a day after the United States 
proposed eliminating the limits on Iraqi oil exports under U.N. 
resolutions -- provided all the income be supervised to ensure it is 
spent only for food and other humanitarian goods.

	John Travolta To Sing in New Film  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Travolta will be giving his vocal chords  
a work out when he portrays 1950s crooner Jimmy Roselli in 
``Standing Room Only.'' Roselli, was a contemporary and some say 
equal talent to Frank Sinatra. But in 1970, his career took a hit 
when he was blacklisted by the mob, with which he had an ambivalent 
relationship. It will be Travolta's first singing part since 
``Grease'' in 1978. Filming is to begin March 15.

	Rodrick Rhodes Out Up to 10 Weeks  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Rodrick Rhodes, one of only four signed players  
on the Houston Rockets, will be sidelined for up to 10 weeks after 
tearing a chest muscle while lifting weights. Rhodes, 25, a 
second-year swingman, was undergoing surgery today for the injury, 
described as a torn pectoral tendon. The Rockets head into next 
week, when NBA teams can start signing players for the 
lockout-shortened season, with only three other players under 
contract -- Hakeem Olajuwon, Brent Price and Roy Rogers.

<HEADLINE>  Tyson Feels He Knows About Botha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson knows only two things about Francois  
Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's white, and he can't beat me,'' Tyson said of the opponent  
he will face Saturday night in a 10-round fight in the MGM Grand 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Tyson's first fight since the suspension for biting  
Evander Holyfield's ears on June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was a 6-1 favorite to beat Botha, who won the IBF  
heavyweight title in 1995. But championship recognition was 
withdrawn after he tested positive for a steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to come right after him,'' the 32-year-old Tyson  
said. ``I expect him to go down, be out cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson weighed in Thursday at 223 pounds, the heaviest of his  
career by one pound, but he appeared to be in top physical 
condition. What kind of fighting shape he's in after a layoff of 
about 19 months remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know until a guy is actually fighting,'' said Tommy  
Brooks, Tyson's new trainer. ``From what I've seen in the sparring 
sessions, there is no ring rust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks also thinks Tyson has been able to put the Bite Fight  
behind him and focus on his boxing future. He also said the subject 
of Holyfield has not come up since Brooks began working with Tyson 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's lost confidence in himself,'' Brooks said.  
``He lost confidence in his corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``His trainers weren't telling him anything in the Holyfield  
fights. When you come back to the corner and they're not telling 
you anything, that could put a damper on the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Bright was Tyson's trainer when he lost the WBA heavyweight  
to Holyfield in 11 rounds on Nov. 9, 1996. Richie Giachetti trained 
Tyson for the Holyfield rematch. Tyson weighed 222 pounds for the 
first fight and 218 for the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, a 30-year-old South African who weighed 233 pounds,  
expects Tyson to attack from the opening bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always comes out fast and tries to make it a short night,''  
said Botha, who has fought less than two full rounds in 19 months. 
``I'm making myself ready for an early attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``My strategy is the way Holyfield fought him. You can't run  
away from the guy. (Bruce) Seldon, (Frank) Bruno and others closed 
up, put themselves on the ropes, and Tyson could take his shots. I 
will tie him up when I have to and not stand still in front of 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Botha is a much more credible opponent than Peter  
McNeeley, who didn't last one round in Tyson's first fight after 
his release from prison in 1995, he has not shown himself to be on 
the level of a Holyfield despite his 39-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, who lives in Newport Beach, Calif., won the vacant IBF  
title by outpointing Axel Schulz on Dec. 9, 1995, in Germany, then 
was stripped because of the positive drug test. His loss came when 
he was stopped in the 12th round by Michael Moorer in a bid for the 
IBF title in Las Vegas on Nov. 9, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is not as quick as he was when he was the most feared  
fighter in the world from 1986 to 1990, but he is quicker than 
Botha. The 6-foot-2 Botha has scored 24 knockouts, but he doesn't 
match the punching power of Tyson, who is listed at 5-11 1/2, but 
appears shorter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson (45-3, with 39 knockouts) is getting $10 million for the  
pay-per-view match. Botha's purse is $1.85 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecast will begin at 9 p.m. EST, with the Tyson-Botha  
match to start no later than 11:30 p.m. It will be preceded by a 
12-round lightweight bout between Goyo Vargas of Mexico and Ben 
Tackie of Ghana and an IBF junior lightweight title defense by 
Roberto Garcia of Oxnard, Calif., against John John Molina of 
Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Rams LB Pleads Innocent in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Rams linebacker Leonard Little on  
Friday pleaded innocent to involuntary manslaughter in a fatal 
traffic accident on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	If found guilty, Little could face up to seven years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Little's trial is not expected to be held for at least six  
months, assistant circuit attorney Jeff Hilliard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Little already had been charged in the case before he was  
indicted Dec. 15, but nearly all felonies go through a grand jury 
before trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Gutweiler, 47, of Oakville, died a day after Little's  
sport utility vehicle collided with her car at an intersection 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Little, who was unhurt in the accident, was legally drunk at the  
time of the collision, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutweiler's family also has filed a wrongful death lawsuit  
against Little. The lawsuit seeks unspecified actual and punitive 
damages.

<HEADLINE> Falwell: Antichrist May Be Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- In a speech about the concern people  
have over the new millennium, The Rev. Jerry Falwell said the 
Antichrist is probably alive today and is a male Jew. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell also told about 1,500 people at a conference in  
Kingsport, Tenn., on Thursday that he believes the second coming of 
Christ probably will be within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who will the Antichrist be? I don't know. Nobody else knows,''  
said Falwell, whose Sunday morning services at Thomas Road Baptist 
Church in Lynchburg are carried by television stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is he alive and here today? Probably. Because when he appears  
during the Tribulation period he will be a full-grown counterfeit 
of Christ. Of course he'll be Jewish. Of course he'll pretend to be 
Christ. And if in fact the Lord is coming soon, and he'll be an 
adult at the presentation of himself, he must be alive somewhere 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Bible, the Antichrist will spread universal  
evil before the end of the world but will be conquered at the 
second coming of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell said Friday in Williamsburg that he did not intend for  
his statement to be anti-Jewish. He said he meant only that the 
Antichrist must be Jewish because Jesus Christ was a Jew. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's going to be the counterfeit of Christ, he has to be  
Jewish,'' Falwell said. ``The only thing we know is he must be male 
and Jewish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee in New York  
said the comment surprised him because he knows Falwell is a strong 
supporter of Israel and is not anti-Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is part of what I call millennial madness,'' Rudin said.  
``To single out any one man, and particularly to identify him as 
Jewish, plays into some latent and historical anti-Semitism from 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very, very radioactive material. I think Christian  
leaders have to exercise great care because this can produce 
negative responses among people who are not educated in the New 
Testament,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ice, Rain Glaze the East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Snow and freezing rain put a hard-shell finish on the East on  
Friday, causing deadly highway accidents, backing up airline 
flights and knocking out power to thousands of people. By 
afternoon, rain and melting snow caused a slushy mess for many. 
</P>
<P>
	``Snow, sleet, hail, ice, rain, floods,'' James Ellis of New  
Rochelle, N.Y., said, trying to remember all the weather he had 
seen in 48 hours. ``Slush, frozen slush, snowmelt. Lots of branches 
down. Ice, did I say ice?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The snow that blanketed the Northeast on Thursday was topped by  
freezing rain early Friday, creating a slick coating over much of 
the region during the morning rush hour. As the day wore on and 
temperatures climbed out of the teens, people found themselves 
slogging through slush and high water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aggghhhh,'' screeched Lori Gulliver, 39, as her stepped into a  
puddle of frigid slop while crossing a Boston street on her way to 
work. ``It's a mess!'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight people died Thursday and Friday in traffic  
accidents in West Virginia, Maryland and Massachusetts that were 
blamed on snow and ice. Earlier this month, at least 89 deaths were 
blamed on a major storm that hammered the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice forced the closing of a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 87  
north of Albany, N.Y. Slick roads also caused two pileups on 
interstate ramps near Parsippany, N.J. Numerous fender-benders were 
also reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, commuter trains were delayed and traffic slowed to  
a crawl. Subway travel was hampered in New York, Boston and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weather is for the birds -- ducks,'' said Efrain Burgos, a  
doorman in New York City. ``But if it wouldn't have rained, we'd 
have 2 feet of snow by now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three major airports serving the city canceled many early  
flights and worked to resume normal operation as the temperature 
rose. Boston's airport had to close temporarily to de-ice runways 
after snow changed to freezing rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airlines all woke up with lot of ice on their airplanes,''  
New York Port Authority spokesman Bill Cahill said. ``They spent 
the morning deicing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm glazed trees with ice, breaking off limbs and knocking  
out power from New York to Virginia. About 319,000 customers lost 
power in Maryland and the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 customers lost service in Virginia, and there  
were smaller outages in New Jersey, New York and around 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to get even warmer through the weekend, with  
temperatures headed toward the 50s as far north as Boston on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, National Park Ranger David Wahlgren chopped  
away with a garden spade at patches of ice on the walk outside 
Independence Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even at Yellowstone and Yosemite, where I have worked before,  
you end up shoveling a lot of snow,'' said Wahlgren, a 26-year-old 
Oregon native. ``It's just part of the job.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Sign 3 Pitchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals avoided salary  
arbitration with pitchers Alan Benes and Lance Painter on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Painter, who made $430,000 last season, got $1.8 million,  
two-year contract. He gets $800,000 this year and $900,000 in 2000. 
St. Louis has a $1 million option for 2001 with a $100,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes agreed to a $550,000, one-year contract, matching his 1998  
earnings. He also can earn performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Painter, 31, appeared in 65 games last year, going 4-0 with a  
3.99 ERA and one save. He has an 18-11 career record with a 5.31 
ERA and two saves in 171 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes, who turns 27 next week,missed the entire 1998 season as  
he recovered from right shoulder surgery. He was 9-9 with a 2.89 
ERA in 23 starts for the Cardinals in 1997 and has a 23-21 career 
record with a 4.17 ERA in 60 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Cardinals did file for arbitration Friday: pitchers Ricky  
Bottalico and Darren Oliver, and shortstop Edgar Renteria, obtained 
from the Florida Marlins last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohler, a 30-year-old left-hander, spent the past six season  
with Oakland. He pitched in 57 games for the Athletics last season, 
going 3-3 with a 5.16 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohler, who agreed to a one-year contract, has appeared in 50 or  
more games each of the past seasons. He has a 12-24 career record 
with a 4.74 ERA.
