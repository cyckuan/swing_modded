<HEADLINE> UNITA Forces Chased out of W. Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan government official
revealed here Monday that forces of the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have been chased out of
the western part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and are
now in Uige Province in north Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to Cordeiro Ernesto Sacundomba, governor of Uige
Province, some UNITA militiamen had been evacuated from western
DRC under strong military pressure from DRC government army.
</P>
<P>
They then crossed into Uige through floating bridges they set
up over Ambriz River near Mbanza Congo, capital of Zaire Province.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA forces led by its Chairman Jonas Savimbi was the ally
of the DRC rebels fighting to overthrow President Laurent Kabila's
government. The Angolan government, however, also sent a
7,000-strong troops to support Kabila so as to contain UNITA's
possible attack from the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
The governor expressed worries that with the return of UNITA
forces to the north, the relative tranquility could be once again
broken and the province might become yet another tension area.
</P>
<P>
At present, UNITA forces are mainly concentrated in Huambo and
Bie provinces in central Angola and Malanje Province in the north,
fighting with government army.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the UNITA soldiers have been chased back by
Angolan troops in the DRC, for the government of the vast central
African country does not have strong armed forces.
</P>
<P>
It is indicated that since government army suffered setbacks in
central Angola, it intends to recall its troops in the DRC to the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and the DRC held a
summit here on April 8, and discussed mainly the military
cooperation in the Angolan conflict. Later, Kabila accepted the
ceasefire initiative with the rebels and signed a peace agreement
with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in Surte, Libya.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has pardoned more than 4,000 inmates who were left
with three months to complete their jail terms on the occasion of
the country's Union Day.
</P>
<P>
The presidential clemency, however, will not benefit those who

trafficking, car theft, robbery, sexual harrassment, a statement
released by the Tanzania Information Services said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Others who will not be pardoned include those who had once

"It is the hope of the government that those to benefit from
the pardon would be law-abiding citizens," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to remember the historical event of the union
between Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which formed the United Republic
of Tanzania 35 years ago, President Mkapa inspected Monday a guard

The parade was mounted by the Tanzania People's Defense Forces
(TPDF), which drew applauses and ululations from tens of thousands
of Dar es Salaam residents who thronged to the stadium to
celebrate the event.
</P>
<P>
Among the national leaders who attended the annual event were
Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Ali Juma, the President of Zanzibar,

<HEADLINE> Egypt Never Acts Against Sudan: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Monday underlined that his country maintains special
ties with Sudan, saying that Cairo "never acts against" Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will never act against Sudan," Moussa told reporters,
saying that Egypt is keen on helping solve Sudan's problems in a
positive way and supports its sovereignty, unity and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was responding to Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed
al-Bashir's recent statement on Sudanese-Egyptian relations.
Al-Bashir also called on Egypt to extradite the Sudanese
opposition to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt keeps contacts with Sudan's opposition both in the Muslim
north and the Christian south. It has voiced support for Sudan's
integrity, fearing that a possible partition of the country would
endanger the Nile, its main water source.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that al-Bashir's statements also included
assurances of the importance and the pivotal nature of the special
relations between Egypt and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt welcomes this part of the statements," Moussa said,
expressing hope that the Egyptian-Sudanese relations will develop
in a smooth way.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt works for protecting the territorial integrity of Sudan,
its people and land, as this is the framework of the Egyptian
policy towards Sudan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Egypt and Sudan soured in 1995 after
Cairo accused Khartoum of masterminding an assassination attempt
on President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also blamed Sudan for harboring Islamic militants, who
have been fighting since 1992 against the Egyptian government in
an attempt to install a strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied both charges.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian parliament, the
House of People's Representatives, Monday called on all pertinent
bodies in the country to actively participate in the public
hearing on the draft broadcasting proclamation scheduled for
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Ahmed Hussein, chairman of
media and culture committee of the house, also urged all pertinent
bodies to comment on the draft broadcasting proclamation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Ahmed said various
religious institutions as well as other bodies concerned are
expressing their views on the bill.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian parliament discussed the draft broadcasting
proclamation at its regular session last March and referred it for
further scrutiny to its legal affairs standing committee.
</P>
<P>
The draft proclamation that provides for the systematic
management of broadcasting services in the country will enable the
establishment of private radio and television (TV) stations.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, political parties, religious
organizations and non-Ethiopians would not be licensed to
undertake broadcasting services in the country, Ahmed said, adding
that "license issued for radio and TV stations shall remain in
force for eight and ten years respectively."
</P>
<P>
There is only one TV station in Ethiopia, that is the Ethiopian
TV which is established by the government. There are several
radio stations which have been established by the federal
government and state governments.

<HEADLINE> Africa to Be Fully Integrated into World Economy, U.N.  Africa Chief Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official on African
affairs Monday voiced her confidence that "Africa will become
fully integrated into the world economy."
</P>
<P>
Thelma Awori, assistant administrator of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and director of UNDP's Africa Bureau,
told a luncheon here that "With enhanced trade and investment,
UNDP is confident that Africa will become fully integrated into
the world economy, offering a promise of hope and future to its
youth."
</P>
<P>
"Africa today is united by a shared vision of collective
self-reliance for peace and sustainable development," she said,
"It is also determined to fully integrate itself into the global
village, as a more active partner."
</P>
<P>
"Translating Africa's vision into concrete actions requires
capacity building not only in Africa but of those who are partners
of Africa," she said.
</P>
<P>
"One such capacity is the capacity to rely on the wisdom and
commitment of Africans to regenerate the environment, create
employment, advance the status of women, promote transparent and
accountable governance and in so doing to create wealth, " she
said.
</P>
<P>
"UNDP counts on the private sector as a strategic partner in
supporting Africa in achieving these ends," she said.
</P>
<P>
Awori made the remarks at a luncheon during the five-day
"Attracting Capital to Africa Summit", which began here on
Saturday last week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, UNDP began a workshop on "Financial
Intermediation and Private Sector in Africa" to analyze the
problems of the private sector and suggest approaches to help
Africa deepen its financial mediation and attract foreign direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
UNDP also co-organized the State of Connecticut Africa Business
Conference 1999 with the State Government on April 20-21 as part
of an effort to ensure global competitiveness of African
enterprises and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
"For me, the Connecticut conference and the Houston Summit are
symbols of the new form of cooperation and partnership that we at
UNDP plan to continue to encourage -- a partnership of mutual
respect and mutual benefit," Awori added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley also took the floor at
the luncheon, saying that the U.S. trade with Africa can serve the
interest of the United States.

<HEADLINE> S. African Countries Meet on Malaria Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- With the support of the World
Health Organization (WHO), southern African countries met here
Monday on eliminating malaria.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting will focus on effectively elimination of
malaria in Africa through strategies closer to the African reality
in accordance with the WHO Roll Back Malaria program.
</P>
<P>
The Roll Back Malaria program which was initiated last year is
aimed at both eliminating malaria and supporting the development
of health systems in countries affected by this disease.
</P>
<P>
A WHO report showed that about 1.5 million to 2.7 million
people in the world die of malaria every year, among them at least
one million are children under five years.
</P>
<P>
Those affected by the disease are mainly living in countries
with poor health conditions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa,
which has brought negative impact on the countries' ecomony.
</P>
<P>
A report released at the meeting said malaria is spreading
around the world, particularly to areas which used to be believed
as unaffected by the disease.
</P>
<P>
The meeting calls for long-term plans and measures to contain
and root out the disease.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be closed Thursday, has drawn representatives
from South Africa, Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland,
Zambia, Zimbabwe, Sao Tome &AMP; Principe and Seychelles.

occur after a full discussion between troop-contributing countries
and the Council, the Committee said.
</P>
<P>
In the area of personnel, the Committee stressed the importance
of good selection and preparation of senior military commanders,
police commissioners and key staff personnel prior to deployment.

<HEADLINE> Govt Army Defeats UNITA Attack in C. Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan military source
announced here Monday that the government army is still in control
of Cunhinga in the central province of Bie after defeating the
counter-attack launched Sunday by the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) at the strategic town.
</P>
<P>
According to the source from the Defense Ministry, UNITA forces
had mobilized tanks and cannons during the attack. However, they
suffered " severe casualties" at the resistance of government
army.
</P>
<P>
The army also destroyed five BMP-2 armored personnel vehicles
and obtained a large number of weapons and ammunitions. But the
source did not reveal the loss on the side of government army.
</P>
<P>
Cunhinga was about 30 kilometers from Kuito, capital of Bie.
To prevent the city's airport from being attacked, the government
army recovered the town for the second time on April 11. The
first was in early this year.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, at least 25 people including 10
policemen were killed and wounded many others in an attack on a
train on Sunday near Canjala, some 80 kms from the western port
city of Benguela in western Angola.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA troops were possibly responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The radio said in another report that 11 people had died when a
convoy of lorries was ambushed, also near Benguela.
</P>
<P>
It did not say when the attack occurred and possibly the two
reports were referring to the same incident.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities were searching the area for more bodies and
possible survivors of the attack on the train carrying food
supplies, the second in two weeks, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, 15 people died in the same place when civilian
vehicles were ambushed, it added.
</P>
<P>
Road and rail ambushes have become frequent since fighting
resumed in last December between forces loyal to the government of
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA rebels just before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The civil war has since spread across much of the impoverished
southern African country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Suggests Three-Way Mideast Summit This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Monday
called for a three-day summit meeting with Israeli and Palestinian
leaders within six months after Israel holds election in May to
complete the land-for security deal he helped bring about last
October.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart issued the call for both
sides to work out a framework to revive peace talks running
aground late last year because of Israel's refusal to withdraw
from more part of the West Bank, stipulated by the Wye accord
approved last October by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat under the brokerage of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel and the Palestinians are to reach an agreement, it
is essential that they do their part to create a serious, fair and
credible environment for negotiations," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's call urged Netanyahu and Arafat to adhere to the
commitments they made in the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
These commitments include an Israeli promise to give up more
land on the West Bank and a Palestinian pledge to root out
terrorists in areas already under Arafat control.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has disagreed publicly with Israel,
saying that while the Palestinians had done fairly well, there was
an obligation on Israel to pull back as promised from 13.1 percent
of the West Bank territory, which, however, was completed only by
2 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said several times that if he did not gain statehood
through negotiations, he would declare a state unilaterally after
May 4.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has urged the Palestinian leader not to make any
announcement of creating a Palestinian state before the Israeli
election scheduled on May 17, for fear it would make the present
impasse even worse.

<P>
LAGOS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's rebel leader Foday
Sankoh said Monday in Lome, Togo that the rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) was ready to declare an immediate ceasefire in

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Emir Invites Jordanian King for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah Monday invited Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein to
visit his emirate for the first time since the 1990 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was conveyed to Abdullah by Kuwaiti Minister of
Justice and Islamic Affairs Ahmad Khaled Al-Kulaib, who is in
Amman to discuss bilateral cooperation in legal and judicial
fields.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Jaber invited Abdullah to visit Kuwait as early
as possible and stressed that the best way to consolidate
bilateral ties and to coordinate Arab stands on regional issues
is a ``direct meeting`` between Abdullah and himself.
</P>
<P>
Jaber's invitation to Abdullah is the first of its kind in nine
years since the 1990 Gulf Crisis which was triggered by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait suspended its diplomatic ties with Jordan and expelled
some 200,000 Jordanian workers during the crisis because Amman
was sympathetic with Baghdad after Iraqi troops stormed into the
tiny Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Kuwaiti ties began to thaw since 1995 when Amman
apparently distanced itself from Baghdad and called for political
changes in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
And the two countries normalized ties in March 1999 when
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel-Ilah al-Khatib paid an official
visit to Kuwait and reopened the Jordanian embassy there.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan has been trying to strike a delicate balance
between Iraq and Kuwait because it still relies on Iraq as its
only source for cheap crude oil and oil products.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government claimed on many occasions that it
would maintain friendly ties with all neighbors and would not
improve ties with one country at the expense of another.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A Pretoria High Court Monday
 dismissed applications by two opposition parties to allow voters
who are overseas or outside their voting districts on election day
to register and vote.
</P>
<P>
The court case was filed by the New National Party and the
Federal Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Handing down the ruling, Judge Hekkie Daniels said the
Independent Electoral Commission acted fairly and treated all
South Africans equally by requiring registration of voters to take
place inside the republic.
</P>
<P>
Whether a person is registered or not was a matter entirely
within his or her own volition and no exceptions were made.
</P>
<P>
In its reaction to the court ruling, the New National Party
said it is considering an appeal to the Constitutional Court. The
Federal Alliance, however, has decided to let the matter rest.

<HEADLINE> Repentant Extremists Set Free in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- An unspecified number of detainees,
suspected members of Islamic extremist groups, were set free on
Monday in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry released the detainees after they have
renounced extremism and violence, a security official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants began an insurgency in 1992 in an attempt to
topple Egypt's secular government and install a strict Islamic
rule. About 1,200 people, mostly police and militants, have been
killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Under the emergency law, which took effect in 1981 after the
assassination of President Anwar Sadat, Egyptian police are
empowered to detain those believed to be endangering public
security.
</P>
<P>
The release of the repentant extremists came amid reports of an
alleged deal between the government and the Islamic Group, the
country's largest militant group, in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The security official dismissed the reports as "groundless,"
saying that "legitimacy is unnegotiable. Security agencies are
unwavering in their fighting against terrorism."

<HEADLINE> Africa's HIV/AIDS Rate Highest in World: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Infection rate of HIV/AIDS in
Africa, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, is the highest in the
world, according to a World Bank report.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled World Development Indicators 1999, was
issued by the World Bank Monday and it showed that the rampant
spreading of the pandemic has cut life expectancies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Stiglitz, the bank's senior economist, said in his
keynote speech: "In sub-Saharan Africa ten countries have seen
life expectancies decrease over the past two decades, and in many
of these the rate of HIV/AIDS infection exceeds. In 11 African
countries, HIV infection rates exceed ten percent of the adult
population."
</P>
<P>
A press release from the international financial institution
said adult mortality rates have risen dramatically in some African
countries due to HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The HIV infection rates in the region are among the world's
highest, it added.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, 29 percent of its population aged 15-49 is
infected with the virus, followed by Botswana (25 percent) and
Zambia (19 percent).
</P>
<P>
Africa, which accounts for only ten percent of world's
population, is home to 21 million people suffering from HIV/AIDS,
about 70 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,500 new infections happen in the region each day and 87
percent of the world's children infected with the virus are in
sub-Saharan Africa.

<HEADLINE> Efforts to Improve Human Welfare Stall: WB Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- After generation of declining
poverty, longer lives, and better health for millions of the
world's poorest people, efforts to improve key areas of human
development are in danger of stalling on the threshold of new
Millennium, said a World Bank report issued here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Faltering growth in Asia and Latin America, uncertain prospects
for the transition economies in the former Soviet Union, and the
continuing spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, will make it increasingly
difficult for the international community to achieve a series of
key development goals for the early 21th century, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to World Development Indicators 1999 -- annual World
Bank compilation of significant development facts, figures, and
analysis -- developing countries, excluding the former Soviet
Union, grew at a rate of 5.3 percent from 1991-97, encouraging
expectations that living standards would continue to rise in most
regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the financial crisis, which began in Asia in 1997, has
now tempered those expectations and could reverse the gains of
many people who has previously migrated from poverty to the ranks
of the middle class in the worst-affected crisis countries.
</P>
<P>
In Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union
(FSU), millions of people have seen their living standards
deteriorate sharply during the difficult move towards establishing
modern market economies.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, about 14 million people in the transition economies of
the FSU were living under a poverty line of four dollars a day,
the report said. By the mid-1990's, that number was about 147
million, or about one-person-in-three.
</P>
<P>
In parts of sub-Saharan African, hard-won increases in life
expectancy have been wiped out by HIV/AIDS, and from 1980-1996,
growth in the school-age population has consistently outpaced the
numbers of primary school enrollments. Furthermore, foreign aid
levels are at their lowest levels in almost 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"A year ago we confidently predicted that the international
development goals of halving poverty, cutting infant and child
mortality by two-thirds, and enrolling all children in primary
education could be met," says James, D. Wolfensohn, President of
the World Bank Group. "Now those goals are at risk, and we must
draw on the lessons of recent experience to help us reshape our
strategies for the future."

<HEADLINE> Development Encouraging Despite Difficulties: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Though efforts to improve key
areas of human development are in danger of stalling, there are
still some encouraging news to report, according to a World Bank
report released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
India and China, which together account for 38 percent of the
world's population, have largely avoided the financial crisis that
has shaken their Asian neighbors, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Botswana had the world's fastest growing economy in the period,
1965-97, with 11.4 percent average annual growth, followed by
Oman, 9.7 percent, China, 8.5 percent, Singapore, 8.3 percent, and
South Korea with 8.2 percent annual growth respectively.
</P>
<P>
Girls enrollments have caught up with boys' in most
high-income, Latin American, Caribbean, and Eastern European
countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
World free trade continues to grow despite protectionist
pressures in some countries, and the continuing impact of the
financial crisis in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Latin America, Central Asia, the Middle East and North America
have the best access to personal computers in the developing
world, while Europe and Central Asia lead the way with Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
Low and medium-income countries have seen their tourism
earnings surge more than 500 percent in the period 1980-97, as the
numbers of foreign tourists to their countries has expanded from
67.5 million in 1980 to 2.3 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the problems of the past 18 months, there is still
some good news to report. Over the last 25 years we can see how
living standards have risen dramatically", said Joseph E.
Stiglitz, World Bank Chief Economist and Senior vice President.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1970, food production has outpaced the population growth
of nearly 2 billion; and 70 percent of adults in the developing
world can read today. By bringing together indicators that cover
the full range of development issues, World Development Indicators
provides a yardstick for measuring the results of our efforts in
all regions and challenging us to make good on our goals for the
benefit of all people," Stiglitz said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan's Life Expectancy Lowest in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan enjoy the lowest life
expectancy in East Africa because its relatively low social
indicators over the past three decades, a senor World Bank
official told Xinhua here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Randolph Harris, World Bank's resident representative in
Uganda, said although Uganda's economic growth rate is among the
highest in the world, its social indicators were low in the past.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank report entitled World Development Indicators 1999
launched Monday in Washington D.C., the United States, showed that
average life expectancy for Ugandans is 42 years, much lower than
that for Tanzanians (48) and Kenyans (52).
</P>
<P>
The official attributed this low life expectancy to, among
other things, Uganda's armed conflicts in the 70s and 80s, adding
that wars not only cost young lives but also damaged a lot of
health facilities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986,
Uganda has benefited from relative stable society and sustained
economic growth. However, this cannot push Uganda's average life
expectancy up to the level of Kenya, Harris noted.
</P>
<P>
With surging national economy, social infrastructure has been
improving in recent years. But achievement can be easily wiped
out by rampant spreading of HIV/AIDS and the widening gap between
the rich and poor, he warned.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Remains Problem for Developing Countries: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Poverty remains a serious
problem for the developing countries, a World Bank report released
here Monday said.
</P>
<P>
All developing regions have lost momentum in achieving their
poverty reduction goals, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the period 1990-97, East and South Asia were the only
regions growing fast enough to reduce poverty by half by 2015.
</P>
<P>
Current forecasts for 1998-2001 suggest that only South Asia
and China will grow sufficiently to achieve this goal, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic loss has been for East Asian countries.
Comparing their latest growth forecasts with those from just 12
months ago, the average number of years it will take to reduce
poverty by 10 percent, as required by the international
development goals agreed several years ago, has risen by roughly
two years for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, where income growth has historically been
low, its slowdown in growth will increase the time it takes to
meet its poverty target by as much as 10 years.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- According to World Development
Indicators 1999, the communications and computer revolutions are
greatly expanding the reach of global knowledge, said a World Bank
report released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
They can allow developing countries to leapfrog old
technologies that still hold sway in industrial countries, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of cellular to total mainframe telephone use is much
higher in the Philippines and Sri Lanka than in Belgium or France.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, Finland has the greatest number of cellular phones
per 1,000 people with 417; followed by Norway with 381; Sweden
with 358; Japan with 303; and Israel with 283.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that Sub-Saharan Africa countries such as
Botswana, Djibouti, and Ghana have 100 percent digital telephone
networks, compared with the OECD (Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development) average of less than 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the Internet continues to reach millions of new
subscribers each year in both developed and developing countries,
the report shows that industrial countries, particularly those in
Scandinavia, continue to have the greatest access to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
As with cellular technology, Finland also has the world's
largest number of Internet hosts per 10,000 people with 996;
followed by the United States with 976; Norway with 705; New
Zealand with 468; and Sweden with 430.

<HEADLINE> NATO Official: No Force Used to Halt Oil to Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A top official of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said on Monday that the allied
naval force will not use force when attempting to halt oil
shipment to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters one day after the three-day alliance
summit, German General Klaus Naumann, who commands NATO's Military
Committee said that the oil blockade regime against Yugoslavia
will not "give us the right to force" any ship to abandon its
course.
</P>
<P>
"So we cannot stop a merchant vessel by the use of force," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Naumann said that NATO's Military Committee was likely to
approve an implementation plan in Belgium on Monday or Tuesday for
warships to begin searching vessels headed for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
With an aim to block the oil shipment into Yugoslavia, the
European Union and NATO have approved an oil embargo against the
country.
</P>
<P>
Naumann noted that the United Nations had not approved such an
embargo, and Russia vowed again on Monday that it would continue
oil shipments under contract to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this is going to be addressed on an urgent basis,"
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said at a separate briefing in
Washington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Naumann insisted hat the inspection regime would still have a
dampening effect on imports of foreign oil into Yugoslavia through
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
"And all naval people tell me if you establish something like
this, third nations' ships will get very, very cautious -- they
will think twice whether they will take this route, because no one
likes to be stopped at sea by a warship," the general said.

KAMPALA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 300,000 Ugandans are
dying of AIDS every year, almost a doubling of the figure five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Rubaramira Ruranga, a coordinator of the people living with the
epidemic in Uganda, said on Monday this increase in AIDS deaths to
the fact that many of the early HIV infections have developed into

Although the infection rate has fallen dramatically in urban
areas, that for villages is still unacceptably high with more than
20 percent.

AIDS, or "slim disease", was first noticed in a Ugandan fishing
village on Lake Victoria near the border with Tanzania in 1982.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- "The workshop is held to give
feasibility to more creative thinking on the issue of financial
intermediation in Africa," a senior U.N. official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Thelma Awori, assistant
administrator of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and
director of the agency's Africa Bureau, said that "UNDP needs to
do more to change the image that Americans have of the African
private sector."
</P>
<P>
Awori chaired a workshop, sponsored by UNDP, Monday on
"Financial Intermediation and Private Sector in Africa," part of
22 worships held during the five-day 1999 "Attracting Capital to
Africa Summit," which began here on Saturday last week.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important issue because our private sector is so
young, we need to have access to services outside capital cities,
we need to have structures in place in our countries that will
really improve the efficiency of our banking and financial
management," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the role of UNDP in promoting African development, she said,
"UNDP really facilitates very much developmental work. We have
been playing a major role in trying to get the American private
sector to understand the African private sector a bit more, to be
more comfortable with the African private sector."
</P>
<P>
"What we see is that we need to do more to change the image
that Americans have of the African private sector, and I think we
are making progress," she said, citing Botswana, Namibia, Ghana
and Cote d'Ivoire as "success stories in Africa."
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Americans saw Africa as a continent full of
poverty and conflicts, not aware of the economic progress made by
southern African countries, such as Botswana, Mozimbique and
Namibia, which enjoy political stability, conducive to economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
UNDP convened the workshop, expected to last two days here, to
analyze the problems of the private sector and suggest approaches
to help Africa deepen its financial mediation and attract foreign
direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, UNDP also co-organized the State of Connecticut Africa
Business Conference 1999 with the State Government on April 20-21
as part of an effort to ensure global competitiveness of African
enterprises and entrepreneurs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investments in Africa Generate Higher Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. direct investments in
Sub-Saharan Africa have generated higher returns than in many
other regions, according to U.S. Department of Commerce on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a backgrounder prepared for Attracting Capital to Africa
Summit, now being held here, the Department said U.S. direct
investments in Sub-Saharan Africa generated net income of 1.5
billion U.S. dollars in 1997, the latest year the data are
available.
</P>
<P>
The 22 percent return against book value compares with 11
percent in Europe, 12 percent in Latin America, 13 percent in
Asia-Pacific, 17 percent in the Middle East and 12 percent
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992-96 period, the average annual return of the
U.S. direct investments in Africa was 28.7 percent, more than
2-1/2 times the average return rate of U.S. investments
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
At year-end 1997, the U.S. direct investments position in
Sub-Saharan Africa stood at 7.1 billion dollars, a 58 percent rise
over 1996, led by growing capital outflows from U.S. parent
companies to their affiliates in South Africa and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong growth in the direct investments, Sub-Saharan
Africa accounted for less than 1 percent of the U.S. position
worldwide in 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Nigeria and Angola combined to account for nearly
two-thirds of the U.S. direct investment position in Sub-Saharan
Africa in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position in Nigeria and Angola is heavily concentrated
in the petroleum sector, while in South Africa is largely in
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
U.N. data show that Africa attracted total FDI flows of 19.2
billion dollars in the period 1982-96. The United States was the
third leading supplier of FDI to Africa, providing 16.9 percent of
total flows.
</P>
<P>
Britain led all supplers with 25.9 percent, followed by France,
24.6 percent, Germany, 7.2 percent, Japan, 5.7 percent and the
Netherlands, 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. World Investment Report 1998 said Africa accounts for
only 3 percent of total FDI flows to developing countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Economic Commission
for Africa (ECA) will hold its biennial ministerial meeting on
African economy in Addis Ababa from May 6-8.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a press release on Monday that the
conference, with the theme "the challenges of financing
development in Africa", will be attended by African finance,
economic and planning ministers.
</P>
<P>
It said the conference is being held when African economic and
social development is facing serious challenges in the recent
financial crisis in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The release said the African continent is affected by the
declining development assistance because of budgetary constraints
in donor countries and competing demands for aid from other
regions and heavy external debt service burdens for many countries
in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The conference will promote dialogs between African countries
and their development partners, it said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Profile: Awori Directs UNDP Africa Program Differently (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- "We have to learn to use the
immense capacities in Africa, to recognize what people are doing
and see how best we can support it, rather than coming in with our
own agenda and our own ideas of what people should do," said Ms.
Thelma Awori, assistant administrator of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and director of the U.N. agency's
Africa Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Awori is among participants at the current conference, titled
"Attracting Capital to Africa Summit", which kicked off here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP's Africa Bureau on Monday morning began a workshop on
"Financial Intermediation and Private Sector in Africa" at the
five-day summit to analyze the problems of the private sector and
suggest approaches to help Africa deepen its financial mediation
and attract direct investment.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to use the event to generate new ideas and concrete
proposals on how to make the African private sector the engine of
of economic growth," she said.
</P>
<P>
Broad experience has made Awori a firm believer in popular
participation in the development process. A Ugandan of Liberian
origin and a former university lecturer, she has long been an
activist in the women's movement.
</P>
<P>
Awori was appointed to hold the current post in the U.N. system
in September 1997. Before joining UNDP, she worked extensively in
community mobilization and human resource development.
</P>
<P>
From 1988 to 1992, she was chief of the Africa Section and then
deputy director of the UNDP affiliate, the U.N. Development Fund
for Women (UNIFEM). She then served as U.N. Resident Coordinator
and UNDP Resident Representative in Zimbabwe until 1996 before
returning to New York as deputy director of UNDP's Policy and
Program Support Bureau.
</P>
<P>
With a perspective stretching from community activities to
international policy-making, Awori has done a lot to advance UNDP
efforts to achieve "national execution" of development program.
Facing a worrying decline in development aid, African countries
have to use all available resources in the most effective and
sustainable ways, she said.
</P>
<P>
This means strengthening local ability to coordinate, manage,
monitor and evaluate external aid, and making greater use of local
expertise. Development work, she said, "should go beyond the
donor/ recipient relationship and become a true partnership."
</P>
<P>
With UNDP a major, but far from the only, source of development
finances, Awori sees the need for greater coherence. She expects
the Resident Coordinator system and the U.N. Development Group
proposed in the U.N. Secretary-General's reforms to strengthen
partnerships with other donors and make the broader donor
community "as user-friendly as possible to host governments."

<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- But in many cases, the African
continent afford the "unbearably high moral, economic, social and
political costs" of excluding "a huge segment of our society" from
the development process, she said.
</P>
<P>
Exclusion is the main cause of poverty and conflict throughout
Africa, she said, adding that this makes "inclusion the key
development challenge of our time," she said and dictates an
urgent agenda of human and institutional development.
</P>
<P>
"As I travel across Africa, I see a continent that is proud of
its history, culture, and abundance of natural and human assets,"
she said. "I see a continent that is beginning to look to itself
for answers."
</P>
<P>
In February this year, Awori attended a meeting in Cotonou,
Benin, where 45 UNDP Resident Representatives in African countries
reviewed Africa's development needs for the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
UNDP is one of the most widely implanted development agencies
in Africa. With a network of 45 country offices, UNDP focuses on
critical issues ranging from poverty, gender equality and the
empowerment of women to good governance and private sector
development.
</P>
<P>
Apart from better economic management and good governance in
Africa, Awori also attached importance to the linkages between
other priority areas for UNDP in Africa, such as poverty
eradication and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Awori is chairperson of the African Women in Crisis (AFWIC)
project, launched in 1993 by UNIFEM. The project has helped
refugee and displaced women prepare to return home by providing
reproductive health care, trauma counselling, and training and
development of skills.
</P>
<P>
"The women took over, declaring that they would no longer be
caught in conflict situations as victims," she said. "We had to
organize ourselves to support all these different groups of women
getting involved in conflict resolution, a movement which took off
like wildfire."
</P>
<P>
Awori is married to a Ugandan diplomat and has raised five
children. "Every women I know in Africa balances career
responsibilities with those she has in the family and the
community because of her gender. Like all women, we just have to
do it all."

<HEADLINE> 2 Soldiers Killed in Mine Explosion in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Two soldiers of the Turkish
security forces were killed on Monday after a military vehicle
hit a mine in southeastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the mine was planted by rebels of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party at a road in Nusaybin town
of Mardin province and the mine exploded when the military
vehicle carrying soldiers were passing over.
</P>
<P>
Seven soldiers were also wounded in the mine explosion, said
the agency.
</P>
<P>
It added that the wounded soldiers were rushed to Mardin
State Hospital for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a near 15-year-old war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. The conflicts
have claimed over 37,000 lives since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured by Turkish special
agents in Kenya in mid-February and has been jailed on Imrali
Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa
for trial on charges of treason.

<HEADLINE> Five Zambian Surveyors Detained by DRC Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Five Zambian surveyors have been
picked up and detained by government soldiers of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), Zambia News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The five were picked up by heavily armed DRC soldiers last
Saturday morning from the Zambian side of Kasumbalesa border post
near Chililabombwe in Copperbelt province, north of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Zambians were on routine work following the border line in
the bush when the Congolese pounced and dragged them into their
country, the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The captives are accused of carrying out surveillance
activities for the rebels fighting to topple that country's
government led by President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Of the five, three are surveyors for Konkola division of the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), and the others are
Ndola-based government surveyors.
</P>
<P>
Chililabombwe district senior security and defense officers
spend the whole day trying to seek their release but failed.
</P>
<P>
"We held a lengthy meeting today with Congolese officials to
try and seek the release of the Zambians but efforts bore no
fruition," a senior Zambia soldier said.

<HEADLINE> France Calls on Comoran Island to Accept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- France Monday called on the Comoran
island of Anjouan to accept the framework of a reconciliation
agreement drafted by the parties of the Indian island nation in
Antananarivo, Madagascar, recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antananarivo agreement, Anjouan should abandon
its unilateral declaration of independence made in August 1997,
and all the Comoran parties should create the Union of Comoran
Islands to replace the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros
which groups the islands of Great Comoro, Moheli and Anjouan.
</P>
<P>
The fourth island of the Comoran archipelago, Mayotte, is under
French rule.
</P>
<P>
Although the delegation of Anjouan did not sign the agreement,
it considered many elements within the agreement positive.
</P>
<P>
France, which joined the Antananarivo conference as an
observer, is ready to bring an immediate assistance to the local
population of Comoros with an aid of 20 million francs (3.3
million U.S. dollars), if the agreement is formally adopted by all
the parties, said a spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
``France calls on the Comorans to seize the historic chance of
reconciliation, which will allow the international community to
accompany the development of the Federal Islamic Republic of the
Comoros,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of the
Communist Party of Greece (KKE) Aleka Papariga Monday expressed
her opposition to a new doctrine adopted by NATO on Saturday which
finally breaks original collective defense doctrine and assumes
broader functions to take actions outside alliance territory.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Greece's main opposition New
Democracy (ND) leader Costas Karamanlis on developments in Kosovo,
Papariga said that the new NATO doctrine had to be opposed by all
because it undermined every notion of popular or national
sovereignty, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed that the Greek government should disentangle
itself from the conflict in Yugoslavia, refuse to facilitate NATO
troops and take a neutral stance.
</P>
<P>
If Greece and Italy refused further involvement, it would
constitute a severe rift in NATO, she added.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: U.S.-African Trade Profile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Two-way trade between the United
States and Sub-Saharan Africa declined 12 percent in 1998,
according to U.S. Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume dropped to 19.8 billion U.S. dollars from 22.5
billion dollars in 1997, the Department said in a backgrounder
prepared for the current Attracting Capital to Africa Summit.
</P>
<P>
The April 24-28 Summit is being held here as a high-level forum
for African leaders and the U.S. business community to exchange
views to expand two-way trade and U.S. investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports to the region rose to 6.69 billion dollars last
year from 6.17 billion dollars in 1997 while imports fell to 13.1
billion dollars from 16.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. share of Africa's total import market fell to 6.1
percent in 1997, the latest year for which data are available,
from 7.3 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Yet the U.S. moved up from third place to second among Africa's
industrial country suppliers.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, France topped the list with a market share of 6.5
percent, though declining from 11.1 percent in 1996. Britain
yielded from second place to third with a market share of 5.8
percent from 7.4 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports to Sub-Saharan Africa in 1998 reached their
highest total of 6.69 billion dollars, an increase of 8.4 percent
from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The exports expansion contrasted with declines in U.S.
shipments elsewhere when U.S. worldwide exports fell 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite growth in U.S. exports in 1998, Sub-Saharan Africa
accounted for less than 1 percent of total U.S. exports in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured exports comprised 72 percent. Principal U.S.
exports included aircraft, oil and gas equipment, construction
machinery, wheat, computers, motor vehicles and telecommunications
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Sales of telecommunications equipment grew 38 percent and motor
vehicles sales grew 27 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
U.S. purchases from Sub-Saharan Africa fell 20 percent in 1997
due to sharply lower world prices for crude oil, diamonds and
materials.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil accounted for 7.6 billion dollars, or 58 percent of
U.S. imports from the region.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa shared 20 percent by value of U.S. market
for crude oil, with Nigeria and Angola as major suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imports about as much crude oil from Sub-Saharan
Africa as from the Persian Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Closes Border Post with DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Monday closed its border
with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) at Kasumbalesa near
Chililabombwe in the north of Zambia following the abduction of
five of its citizens last Saturday by DRC government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The border was closed this morning by Zambian officials to
press for the return of the detained Zambians, according to Zambia
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The decision to close the border was reached by district
defense and security chiefs, who were said to be fed up with the
conduct of the Congolese authorities about the continued detention
of the Zambians.
</P>
<P>
A Zambian government team held a series of lengthy talks with
their Congolese counterparts since Saturday to seek the release of
the Zambians but failed.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the border is closed. It was sealed this morning and no
one including vehicles are entering Congo," said Paul Ngoma,
police officer-in- charge in Chililabombwe.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear whether the decision to close the
border had the blessing of the central government of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
A long queue of heavy-duty international trucks carrying goods
to Congo were seen marooned on the Zambian side. A similar
situation obtained on the Congolese side of the border.
</P>
<P>
"Since the Zambians were picked up at Kasumbalesa border post
on the Zambian side, we have held a series of meetings with our
Congolese counterparts on the detainees. Each time we're assured
of their release soon, the Congolese come up with other flimsy
charges just to complicate the issue. We're fed up with this," a
defense officer told the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The five were on duty checking the border line west of
Kasumbalesa barrier when the armed soldiers from the country
pounced on them and dragged them into their side, it reported.
</P>
<P>
The five were accused of making reconnaissance for the rebels
fighting to topple DRC President Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Holds Workshop on Financial Intermediation in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. agency on Monday morning
began a workshop here on "Financial Intermediation and Private
Sector in Africa" to analyze the problems of the private sector
and suggest approaches to help Africa deepen its financial
mediation and attract foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The Africa Bureau of the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) sponsored the workshop on the sidelines of the five-day
"Attracting Capital to Africa Summit," which began here on
Saturday last week.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to use the event to generate new ideas and concrete
proposals on how to make the African private sector the engine of
economic growth," said Thelma Awori, assistant administrator of
UNDP and director of the U.N. agency's Africa Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector has an important role to play in Africa,"
said Awori, who chaired the workshop drawing representatives from
African and European countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to discuss what kind of assistance do we need to
put in place, and what kind o structure do we need to put in
place," she said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, part of 22 workshops held during the summit,
draws representatives from African and European countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, UNDP's chief economist, told
the workshop that Africa today faces challenges of a new global
environment, which include maintaining a competitive economy,
attracting capital and preventing capital flight.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the challenges, it is very important for
African countries to work hard for the determined pursuit of sound
economic policies, regional and sub-regional cooperation,
favorable political atmosphere and increasing domestic savings and
investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Five heads of state, four prime ministers and high-level
representatives of some 30 African countries met with
entrepreneurs and chief executive officials of some of America's
largest corporation here on April 24-28 to discuss the state of
the private sector in Africa and the prospects for its
development.
</P>
<P>
The gathering, the second in the United States since 1997, is
also expected to explore opportunities for two-way trade and
investment between Africa and the United States. The first such
meeting was held in April 1997 in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
UNDP also co-organized the State of Connecticut Africa Business
Conference 1999 with the State Government on April 20-21 as part
of an effort to ensure global competitiveness of African
enterprises and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The current summit follows the heals of the U.S.-Africa
Ministerial Meetings held in Washington last month. The two events
are seen as an integral part of the redefinition of the U.S. ties
with Africa.

ATHENS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Greek equity prices Monday
continued its downtrend with the Athens Stock Exchange's general
index falling 1.83 percent to 3,252. 09 points.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FTSE/ASE 20 index ended 1.82 percent off to
2,033.50.
</P>
<P>
The turnover was 70.6 billion drachmas (about 253 million U.S.

</P>
<P>
Decliners led advancers by 192 to 92 with another 13 issues
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Investment led the market decline with a 4.95 percent, with
banks and leasing losing 2.04 percent and 2.0 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that Monday's fall was more a result of lack of
demand than of heavy selling.
</P>
<P>
The Athens Stock Exchange's general index registered last week
a loss of 6.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deeply concerned with the possibility of a prolonged war in
Kosovo, traders were afraid that the country's equity prices might
continue to fall sharply.

<HEADLINE> German Main Opposition Rejects Kosovo Ground Troop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 26 (Xinhua)--The Christian Democratic Union (CDU),
Germany's main opposition, rejected sending ground combat troops
to Kosovo Monday at the party's congress in Erfurt.
</P>
<P>
A statement approved by the 1,000 delegates said, "the CDU will
not approve any step which could trigger uncontrollable military
developments in the Balkan region."
</P>
<P>
"There must not be any uncontrolled, automatic escalation (in
Kosovo)," CDU chairman and parliamentary fraction chief Wolfgang
Schaeuble said at the congress overshadowed by the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We must not cross the red line, " CDU deputy chairman and
former Defence Minister Volker Rueher told the delegates.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders also called for any deployment of the German
forces under NATO mandate, including humanitarian deployment, to
be passed by German parliament at first.
</P>
<P>
The German government has sent without parliament's approval
some 400 soldiers and 7 helicopters to Albania as pioneers of a
NATO humanitarian troop.
</P>
<P>
Although the CDU backed the cabinet's decision of sending 14
Tornado jet fighters to participate in the NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia, the party executives at the congress demanded
a political solution to the crisis under closer cooperation with
Russia and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The CDU leaders criticized that cabinet heads' harsh words
against Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic were useless and
unconstructive.
</P>
<P>
"It is always dangerous to talk yourself into a rage and make
false comparison," Schaeuble commented.
</P>
<P>
Germany's government leaders, including Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, have compared
Milosevic to the Nazis.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Journalists Condemn NATO Bombing of Serbian TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Society of
Journalists on Monday condemned NATO strikes against the state-
run Yugoslav Radio and Television (RTS) as a serious violation of
press freedom.
</P>
<P>
"No such violent act happened in any conflict area of the
planet so far," and "it was carried out by forces belonging to a
military alliance pretending it represents civilization and
democracy," the society said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The organization expressed sympathy with casualties in the air
raids and urged the International Federation of Journalists, the
United Nations and the Council of Europe to make all possible
efforts to stem such deeds.
</P>
<P>
NATO bombed the RTS building in central Belgrade early last
Friday, causing dozens of injuries and deaths. The killing of
innocent civilians working with the Yugoslav radio-television has
sparked worldwide condemnation.

<P>
BONN April 26 (Xinhua)--U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
Monday said in Germany that he would soon appoint two mediators to
seek a peaceful solution to Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the start of his three-day visit to Germany, Annan
said in Berlin that the mediators would go to work as soon as he
finished the necessary consultations.
</P>
<P>
Annan did not mention whom he would choose for the task. U.N.
staff indicated former Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and
former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt were among the
candidates. Officials said Annan would not appoint mediators that
came from a NATO member country, but prefer one from the west and
another from th former eastern bloc.
</P>
<P>
Annan is unlikely to name the envoys before he arrive in
Moscow, official said. His visit to Russia is scheduled for
Wednesday after meeting with German Chancelor Gerhard Schroeder,
Defence Minister Rudolf Scharping,and Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer.
</P>
<P>
It was the boldest intervention by the United Nations almost
five weeks after the NATO launched air campaigns against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with German President Roman Herzog, Annan said the
U.N. Security Council should play a stronger role to settle the
Kosovo conflict, and the endeavor must include Russia as well. A
peaceful solution to the region should allow the refugees return
their homeland "quickly and safely", Annan said.
</P>
<P>
It will be a victory of the Europe, the United Nations and the
humankind, if the Kosovar citizens are able to live in peace and
freedom with their civil and political rights fully ensured, he
said.

LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler was
banned for six matches and fined 32,000 pounds (51,200 U.S.
dollars) Friday for two misconduct charges in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
A Football Association disciplinary panel ordered a four-match
suspension for Fowler's goal celebrations against Everton last
weekend, when he simulated snorting cocaine.

After converting a penalty, Fowler got down on all fours and,
pinching one nostril, pretended to sniff the white line to the
side of the goal.

Fowler was handed a two-game ban for a separate incident during
a game against Chelsea last month when he made crude sexual
gestures and taunts toward Graeme Le Saux.
</P>
<P>
Le Saux, who reacted to the taunts by elbowing Fowler in the
head, was banned for one match and fined. Zhe bifan 5,000 pounds

<P>
PARIS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Monday called on his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin to exert
more pressure on ``the authorities of Belgrade'' and said that
Russia has a big role to play to solve the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Chirac had a positive and substantial telephone conversation
with Yeltsin on Kosovo after he returned from Washington Monday
morning, said French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
The French president encouraged Russia to continue to work in
favor of a political solution to the conflict, and expressed his
appreciation for the ``sincere efforts'' made by Moscow over the
past one month, she added.
</P>
<P>
``President Chirac also stressed that it is necessary to
increase the pressure on the authorities of Belgrade, which always
rejects the legitimate demands of the international community,''
said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has sent Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and former
Prime Minister Viktor Chernormyrdin to Belgrade in search of a
political solution to the Kosovo conflict, after NATO began its
air campaign one month ago.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees in Turkey Reach Over 11,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of Kosovo refugees in
Turkey has increased to 11,986 since the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Interior Ministry said in a statement Monday that
4,712 refugees have entered Turkey from the Tekirdag-Corlu border
gate and 6,592 from the Edirne-Kapikule border gate while 682
embarked in Turkish northwestern port city of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
At present, 4,451 Kosovo refugees have been sheltered at the
Gaziosmanpasa Refugee Camp in Turkey's northwestern Kirklareli
province.
</P>
<P>
NATO's air strikes against Yugoslav Serb targets began after
the Serb-led government refused to accept a peace agreement to
grant autonomy to the independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians have fled to
neighboring Macedonia and Albania since the air operation, and
still more on the roads.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, with other NATO members, has been asked to take in part
of the refugees before they can return home.

<HEADLINE> UK Minister Says Racist Groups Difficult to Penetrate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
said on Monday the white supremacists blamed for targeting blacks
and Asians recently were hard to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with a different nature from those, and to some
extent they are more difficult to penetrate," Straw told BBC
Radio.
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about very small numbers of people. There has
been some monitoring of some of these groups but, as we know from
Irish terrorism, with the best will in the world -- even if there
is very extensive monitoring -- they still have a capability to
commit outrages."
</P>
<P>
A nail bomb blasted in Brick Lane in east London on Saturday,
injuring six people. A week earlier, another big explosion ripped
south London, injuring nearly 40 people. The neo-Nazi racist group
Combat 18 has claimed responsibility for both incidents.
</P>
<P>
"We have to show absolute determination to celebrate and
strengthen Britain as a multi-racial society," Straw said.
</P>
<P>
British police were liasing with counter-intelligence
authorities abroad. But they played down press speculation that
the attacks might have links to nail bomb attacks in Paris four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Britain's black and anti-racism leaders have called for a ban
on racist groups and a firm government pledge to introduce tougher
race relations law as quickly as possible.

<HEADLINE> Workshops Held to Discuss Attracting Capital to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The "1999 Attracting Capital to
Africa Summit" Monday entered its third day, breaking all
participants into 22 workshops, which are expected to last two
days.
</P>
<P>
The Africa Bureau of the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) Monday began a workshop on financial intermediation and the
private sector in Africa to analyze the problems of the private
sector and suggest approaches to help Africa deepen its financial
mediation and attract foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was chaired by Thelma Awori, assistant administer
of UNDP and director of the U.N. agency's Africa Bureau. "Our aim
is to use the event to generate new ideas and concrete proposals
on how to make the African private sector the engine of economic
growth," she said.
</P>
<P>
Five heads of state, four prime ministers and high-level
representatives of some 30 African countries are present at the
five-day summit. The theme for the 1999 summit is "transforming
natural wealth into human capital," which, observers here said,
speaks to one of the most important challenges facing Africa
today.
</P>
<P>
Top U.S. government officials and senior representatives of the
American enterprises also attended the summit to explore
opportunities for two-way trade and investment between Africa and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Doing business with African countries is in the interest of
the United States," U.S. Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee told
Xinhua. The United States can do a lot of work in helping women's
businesses and medium-sized enterprises in Africa, she said.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 summit follows on the heals of the U.S.-Africa
Ministerial Meetings held in Washington last month, and these
events are seen as an integral part of the redefinition of the
U.S. ties with Africa.

Cross (ICRC) to work in Kosovo, said the ICRC president Cornelio
Sommaruga on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the French television channel France

"I also need the agreement from NATO and the Kosovo Liberation

He said that Red Cross delegates should be able to go around
freely in Kosovo.

"He (Milosevic) mentioned his hope to see the return of
refugees," he said.

Sommaruga also said that the Red Cross is concerned about the
suffering of all the victims in the war.

bridges across the Danube River, which resulted in the lack of
portable water for 90,000 people in Novi Sad north of Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Leading Suspected Militant Starts in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Higher State Security Court
on Monday began trial of a leading suspected Islamic militant.
</P>
<P>
The defendant, identified as Ahmed Abdel Wahab, was arrested
recently, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported. Abdel Wahab
has been sentenced to death in absentia, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
He was charged with taking part in the murder of a police
major-general, a brigadier and a lieutenant colonel in the
governorate of Qena, 450 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
He was also accused of joining a terrorist group, which seeks
to topple the government by force and assassinates officials and
policemen.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants began an insurgency in 1992 in an attempt to
overthrow Egypt's secular government and install a strict Islamic
rule. About 1,200 people, mostly police and militants, have died in
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Egypt usually slaps harsh sentences on suspected militants. In
a major trial in the government's crackdown on Islamic insurgency,
an Egyptian military tribunal sentenced nine militants to death on
April 18 and 11 others received life sentences with hard labor.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's ruling party has secured
its narrow majority in parliament by gaining two seats previously
held by opposition parties, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya African National Union (KANU), which has ruled the
east African country since its independence in 1963, won the two
by-elections in Tigania and Mutomo constituencies in rural eastern
Kenya, although vote- counting was marred by violence in which one
opposition leader was injured.
</P>
<P>
Social Democratic Party leader Charity Kaluki Ngilu suffered
leg, chest and head injuries when a group of young KANU supporters
stoned her car in Mutomo.
</P>
<P>
The results from Saturday's by-elections brought KANU's tally
in the 222- seat parliament to 116 while opposition parties now
command a combined 104 seats. The other two members are the House
Speaker and the country's Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
KANU leaders said the results indicated its continued
popularity despite three years of economic depression.
</P>
<P>
"KANU remains the only party that represents the interest of
all Kenyans and clearly that is why it won," KANU by-elections
organizer Kalonzo Musyoka said. "Opposition parties have not shown
that they can achieve anything for the Kenyan people," he added.
</P>
<P>
But opposition leaders accused local KANU officials of using
money to induce people to vote for the ruling party.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Unilateral Palestinian State, "Unlawful Act" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A unilateral Palestinian
declaration of statehood on May 4, 1999 would not only be "an
unlawful action, but would undermine the framework capable of
changing the situation of the Palestinian people, Israel said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations, Israeli representative to
the United Nations Dore Gold rejected Palestinian arguments that a
transitional period would end on May 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Dore said the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state was
"more than simply an unlawful act" and it would be "a rejection of
the two fundamental principles of the pace process: the need to
accommodate the legitimate rights of both sides and the
recognition that this accommodation can only be achieved through
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"It would thus undermine the only framework that has proved
capable of bringing about genuine changes in the situation of the
Palestinian people -- to the extent that today 97 percent of the
Palestinians of the West Bank and all the Palestinians of the Gaza
Strip live under Palestinian not Israeli rule," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dore said that when the two sides had been unable to reach
agreements by the specified target dates, "the arrangements in
force have continued to apply until the negotiations on the new
arrangements have been concluded.

LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Technology stocks and new
telecommunications links kept European markets higher Monday as
traders kept a wary eye on the G7 meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
London's benchmark FTSE 100 index of leading shares finished 76
points higher, or 1.18 percent, at 6503.6.
</P>
<P>
The session's best level of 6522 was achieved around the same
time GEC offered to buy Fore Systems for 4.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Deals amid banks, drugs and telecoms are leading the market
higher and will continue to do so," said a trader.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax index of leading shares closed up just over
1.5 percent, or 81 points, at 5,269. But airline Lufthansa fell 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
German magazine Der Spiegel reported the airline is losing
around 10 million marks (5.4 million U.S. dollars) daily due to
delays and rescheduling stemming from the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC 40 gained just over half a percent to finish
at 4,284.40 as traders remained cautious amid a dearth of
big-company news.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Urges Church to Help Eradicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has urged churches across the country to support and complement
government's efforts to eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a message read for him at a religious
meeting by the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs
Mayanja Nkangi in eastern Uganda Monday, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that poverty is one of the major challenges
facing the National Resistance Movement administration.
</P>
<P>
The Church and government must be allies in fighting against
poverty, he added, encouraging churches to urge people to distance
themselves from those attempting to fail the program.
</P>
<P>
The Entandikwa Scheme, a revolving fund for the rural poor,
must be supported and implemented with help from all different
groups.
</P>
<P>
With the continuous efforts by the government to eradicate
poverty, the poverty rate has dropped from 56 percent to 46
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, income distribution is worsening and the gap between
the rich and poor has been widening. Women, who constitute
Uganda's 80 percent of work force in rural areas, only control
five percent of the land.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deploys More Forces Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said Monday it
was sending up to 30 more air tanker planes to support the bombing
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Secretary William Cohen is expected to
announce Tuesday the call-up of thousands of U.S. Reserve and
National Guard troops, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The call-up could involve between 20,000 and 33,000 part-time
reserve troops, most of them air crews and support personnel for
the new airplanes, according to U.S. media reports.
</P>
<P>
The new tanker deployment follows an agreement by NATO leaders
at their summit meeting in Washington over the weekend to
intensify bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"All of the leaders left the NATO summit saying they were
determined to intensify the air campaign and this will allow that
to happen," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"These 30 tankers are really a down payment on a much larger
deployment order that will be coming soon. This is in response to
General Clark's request for approximately 300 planes," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
About 100 of the 300 aircraft would be tankers, a major
increase in the 137 U.S. air refueling tankers already committed
to the operation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. General Wesley Clark is NATO's supreme military commander.
The new deployment will bring the number of U.S. warplanes in the
operation to nearly 650.
</P>
<P>
"These tankers will immediately help increase the tempo of air
operations, allow us to keep planes on station for longer periods
of time, and increase the number of hours of the day in which
we're actually flying over or near Yugoslavia and Kosovo," Bacon
said.

OTTAWA -- Canadian scientists have cloned the world's first
triplet goats, each of which was developed from a single adult
cell and they share identical DNA, or genetic makeup, the National
Post newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The triplet kids, known as Danny, Clint, and Arnold, were born
in mid-March at a McGill University campus farm. They share a
black spot in the center of their forehead, all have black feet,
the same erect ears, as well as similar head and body shape. Their
cell structures are identical.
</P>
<P>
The three goats are Canada's first cloned livestock using
nuclear transfer, the same procedure used to produce Dolly the
sheep, the world's first cloned animal that was born in 1997 in
Scotland. (Canada-Clone-Goats)

<HEADLINE> UN Reports Dire Humanitarian Situation in Abkhazia, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Tuesday described the humanitarian situation in
Abkhazia, Georgia as "dire".
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Untied Nations Security Council, Annan
said the failure to reach agreement in January on terms for the
return of refugees and displaced persons to the Gali district and
measures for the economic rehabilitation of Abkhazia, Georgia,
meant that a valuable opportunity was missed to take a major step
forward in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Tensions associated with the upcoming elections in Abkhazia,
Georgia, and economic difficulties, were creating an environment
in which provocations along the lines of separation of forces
might lead to a more general destabilization, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
It was therefore essential that both sides exercise great
restraint in responding to any incidents on the ground, the U.N.
chief said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, two specific actions by the parties
would significantly help improve the situation on the ground: the
full separation of forces from the ceasefire line and the
establishment of a joint investigation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The report detailed the work of the United Nations Observer
Mission in Georgia, which includes monitoring compliance with the
1994 Moscow ceasefire agreement and progress on the ground.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Journalists Condemn NATO Bombing of Yugoslav Media (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Journalists
Association (ACJA) today strongly condemned NATO strikes against
Yugoslav media targets as a serious violation of the freedom of
the press.
</P>
<P>
"China's journalists express their great indignation over
NATO's brutal airstrikes against Yugoslav civil installations and
press organizations," an announcement by the ACJA said here today.
</P>
<P>
The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) also accused
NATO of deliberately attacking media targets, it said.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led NATO bombed Yugoslavia's state-run TV station on April
23 and dozens of press people and citizens were killed or injured.
On April 26, NATO airstrikes destroyed Yugoslavia's ruling-party
headquarters and several TV and radio stations in the same
Belgrade building.
</P>
<P>
"It is the right and responsibility of the Yugoslav press to
report for its nation, and send out a just, united, and peace-
demanding voice," the announcement said, and condemned U.S.-led
NATO for targeting the Yugoslav media and considering them to be
reasonable airstrike objectives.
</P>
<P>
"Is this the so-called `'freedom of the press under a new
concept and new order' NATO has flaunted?" it asked.

<TEXT>
<P>
The so-called freedom of the press claimed by NATO is actually
gangster logic, as a Chinese saying goes: only allowing officials
to light fires, but banning ordinary people from lighting a lamp.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, it seems that only the Western
media are allowed to express its point of view, spreading word of
so-called heinous crimes committed by Yugoslavia, which are
unchecked and meant to instigate a hostile attitude within the
international community against Yugoslavia. At the same time, the
Yugoslav news media are banned from telling the truth, and
exposing lies to the world.
</P>
<P>
Does not NATO call itself a guardian of freedom of the press
and speech? Nowadays, if you are not on accord with NATO's view,
NATO regards you as the brains of military units and destroys your
media organization, your life, and freedom of the press and speech
by missiles, the protest said, noting that this is hegemonism and
power politics imposed upon Yugoslavia by U.S-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that Chinese news media and journalists
firmly support the important speech given by President Jiang Zemin
on Kosovo, and firmly support the solemn stance of the Chinese
government opposing NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We believe NATO'S wanton and indiscriminate bombing cannot
overwhelm the brave Yugoslav people, and that justice is on the
side of the Yugoslav people, and the will of the people is on the
side of the Yugoslav people," the announcement concluded.

<HEADLINE> Institutes Downgrade German Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 27 (Xinhua)--German economy will see a depressed
year 1999 with growth rate lower than expected and the high
jobless rate dropping only slightly, Germany's six leading
economic institutes reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The six institutes are in Berlin, Kiel, Hamburg, Halle, Essen
and Munich.
</P>
<P>
"The cooling of the economy is due largely to foreign economic
factors - the main causes were the crises in Asia, Russia and
Latin America," the institutes said in their spring report.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) growth will be 1.7 per cent
for 1999 and 2.6 per cent in 2000, the institutes said. German GDP
grew by 2.8 per cent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In their autumn report last year, the institutes had predicted
a growth rate of 2.3 per cent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The German government has lowered its GDP expectation even
further. The Finance Ministry predicts 1999 GDP will grow by just
1.5 per cent instead of 2 per cent as earlier projected.
</P>
<P>
Germany's high unemployment rate will fall only moderately in
the coming years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 jobless rate of 11.2 per cent (4.3 million unemployed)
will fall to 10.6 per cent in 1999 and 9.9 per cent in 2000, it
said.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Germany, the jobless rate was 18.5 per cent in 1998
and will fall to 17.9 per cent this year and 16.9 per cent in
2000.
</P>
<P>
The institutes said falling unemployment would not mainly be
due to creation of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment will fall because of the rising number of foreign
guest workers leaving Germany, an aging population, the growing
number of people who put off looking for work to study, more
people retiring before the normal pension age and the creation of
200,000 state-funded jobs for youths.
</P>
<P>
German corporate investment in machinery and equipment is due
to fall in 1999 compared with last year, the report said.
Following a 10 per cent growth rate in 1998, corporate outlays
will grow by 4.5 per cent this year and 4 per cent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
This decline is due to higher wage accords than in previous
years which will average 3 per cent for 1999, while consumer
prices are set to rise by 0.7 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Personal consumption will jump, however, due the rise in gross
wages and tax cuts and other benefits for people with lower
incomes. Real income will grow by 2.5 per cent this year and in
2000 and result in equivalent growth in private consumption.
</P>
<P>
Falling investment in construction will be reversed in the
coming two years, said the report. After last year's 4.3 per cent
decline in the key construction sector, this year's drop will be
just 0.1 per cent, and then will show one per cent growth in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Germany's basic trade balance remains in surplus. Last year
strong exports pushed the German trade surplus up by 13 billion
marks (7.2 billion dollars) to 129 billion marks - the highest
since the 1990 German unification, the report said. Germany's
terms of trade will remain similar for 1999.
</P>
<P>
But a gap in invisible trade pushed the overall German current
accounts balance into deficit of 6 billion marks in 1998, the
institutes said, adding this figure was likely to remain negative
in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Says Liquidity Situation More Relaxed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The liquidity situation in
Thailand was more relaxed during the first quarter of 1999, the
Thai cabinet concluded at a meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a press release from the Government House, the cabinet said
that according to a Bank of Thailand report, the increasing
liquidity has led to declining interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The interbank rate dropped from 2.73 percent in January to 2.25
percent in March while the one-day repurchasing rate has dropped
to 1.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increasing liquidity has reflected the ease of monetary and
financial policy since the second half of 1998, the cabinet said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the financial situation tends to be more stable and
people's confidence has returned, it said.
</P>
<P>
As for the liquidity in the business sector, the cabinet
acknowledged the resolutions of a meeting of the Economic
Ministers' Council on Monday that said during the first two months
of 1999, the private sector had more liquidity compared with the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks, whose liquidity has been boosted by the
private recapitalization and government loan package, have lent
more credit to the business community while the outflow of capital
fund has been slowing down.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of capital fund in the private sector from
January to February was as high as 77.2 billion baht (2.08 billion
U.S. dollars) compared with 24.6 billion baht (66.5 million
dollars) in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet expects that the liquidity in the monetary market
will increase due to some key factors, including a
54.4-billion-baht (1.45 billion dollars) loan from Japan, the
easing of conditions of capital risk ratio for commercial banks
and the continuously increasing current account and trade surplus.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Cisco Systems and the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) on Tuesday announced
that they would join forces in an effort to eradicate extreme
poverty in the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the people in developing countries struggle
for survival on incomes of less than 1 U.S. dollar a day. Their
extreme poverty denies them access to such basic needs as safe
drinking water, adequate food and health care.
</P>
<P>
To support its commitment, Cisco Systems, the worldwide leader
in networking for the internet, has pledged its vast resources to
develop a global website which will serve as a powerful source of
information to mobilize the world's people to action.
</P>
<P>
As part of its commitment to alleviating world poverty, Cisco
Systems is creating a website which will be maintained by UNDP.
The site will be solely dedicated to serve as a clearinghouse for
organizations and individuals who want to get involved in the
effort, and have the infrastructure to support more than one
billion hits on the web.
</P>
<P>
in addition to being stocked with information, live interviews,
links and suggestions on how each and every person can help in the
race against poverty, the website will also provide a conduit for
contributions.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has the power to change the fortunes of
countries,,companies and individuals," said John Chambers,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
"Whether it is managing a micro-loan program to purchase
sewing machines for a women's cooperative in Jordan, or accessing
medical expertise for remote clinics in South East Asia, or
educating people on how they can make a difference, the Internet
can play a key role in eliminating extreme poverty," said John.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty eradication must become a central and guiding
objective of all development efforts. Good health, adequate
nutrition, literacy and employment are not favors or acts of
charity to be bestowed on the poor by enlightened leaders. they
are human rights," said James Gustave Speth, Administrator of
UNDP.

KATHMANDU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Last rites with full state
honors were held here Tuesday for Nepal's veteran Communist leader
and former Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikari who died Monday
morning at the age of 79.
</P>
<P>
The late chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified
Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML) was the second common citizen in Nepal
to receive such full state honors.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, ministers and political
party leaders were among those to pay their last tributes to
Adhikari before his body was cremated.
</P>

A funeral procession through the thoroughfares of Kathmandu was
held before the final rites under the escort of the army.

Adhikari fell ill all of a sudden on April 19 while on an
election campaign in the capital. He was his party's prime
ministerial candidate for the parliamentary elections on May 3 and
May 17. He had remained unconscious until his death.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Groups Protest Defense Guidelines Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Demonstrators from Japanese labor
unions and pro-peace groups gathered outside the Diet (parliament)
building Tuesday to protest against the approved three bills for
the implementation of the updated Japan-U.S. defense cooperation
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after mid-day, about 5,000 people attended an emergency
rally in Tokyo's Hibiya district, called by a national liaison
group.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the All Japan Seamen's Union, who took part
in the rally, demanded that the bills, which will enable Japan's
military to render support for U.S. forces in undefined "areas
surrounding Japan," be revoked.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, holding placards and wearing sashes, then
staged a march to the Diet building.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Takako Doi, leader of the opposition Social
Democratic Party (SDP), and other protesters issued an appeal for
joint action to uphold Japan's Constitution, saying the
Constitution's war-renouncing provisions are threatened by the
bills.
</P>
<P>
Also in front of the Diet building, some 300 protesters
belonging to another civic group opposed to the guidelines started
a sit-in in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The approved bills authorize Japan's military to take various
measures in the event of emergencies near Japan, to revise the
Japan-U.S. Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement and to amend
the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) Law.
</P>
<P>
Japan's civic groups and labor unions intensified their
opposition to the bills over the past several days, holding
rallies outside the Diet building and at other locations, calling
for the abolishment of the bills on the ground that they would
draw Japan into war.

<HEADLINE> Macedonian Economic Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian Economic Minister Zanko
Kado has resigned over the failure of the Western countries to
provide aid to the tiny Balkan nation, whose economy has been
seriously battered by the ongoing Yugoslavia crisis, reports
reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his resignation letter presented Monday to Prime Minister
Lju Bco Georgievski, Kado said he was facing huge difficulties as
the West lacked understanding of the current situation in
Macedonia and failed to give it enough economic aid as promised.
</P>
<P>
Other factors led to Kado's quit included rejections of most of
his proposals by the government and family problems.
</P>
<P>
But the reports did not say whether Georgievski had accepted
Kado's resignation. Georgievski is now in Luxembourg attending
political dialogs between Macedonia and the European Union, the
Council of Europe and the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian economy has plunged into a crisis since NATO
started the ongoing open-ended bombing of neighboring Yugoslavia,
with which Macedonia has vital economic relations. An exodus of
ethnic Albanian refugees to Macedonia from the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo has made the economic situation even worse.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian government announced earlier that the conflict
in Yugoslavia is expected to cost the country about 1.5 billion U.
S. dollars in economic loss.
</P>
<P>
At present, unemployment is surging in the country and the
economic growth is slowing down. The latest economic figures
showed that Macedonia's first quarter industrial production fell
30 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Foreign Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov said the
country was on the brink of a disaster and urged the West to keep
up their promises.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's export value dropped 10
percent in the first quarter of this year, even though its total
foreign trade volume rose by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by Beijing Customs, the city's
total foreign trade volume increased by 20.7 percent in the first
quarter of the year, standing at 1.622 billion U.S. dollars. But
exports declined by 10.4 percent to 547 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuequn, an official with the Beijing Municipal Economic
and Trade Commission, said that both local state-owned and
overseas-funded enterprises witnessed a drop in export value on a
year-on-year basis over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributed Beijing's export decrease to the slow growth
of the world economy and weak market demand.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, devalued currencies have also enhanced the
competitiveness of Southeast Asian states in the world market, and
undermined China's export growth, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
But Zhang is still optimistic that Beijing can achieve its
target of maintaining 2.7 billion dollars in foreign trade this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Beijing Municipal Government has adopted
measures to encourage exports, such as increasing cooperation with
overseas commercial entities and developing E-business.

XINING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police today burned the
skins of 110 Tibetan antelopes as a special action against rampant
poaching activities in the Hoh Xil Nature Reserve on the Tibet-
Qinghai Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Yang Gangqiang, a police officer with the Qinghai provincial

"If the confiscated antelope skins were somehow returned to the
market, that would encourage rather than discourage poachers,"
said Yang.
</P>

The reserve is home to more than 20 rare animal species
including the yak and the Tibetan antelope, and they are all under
state protection.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of April, the police have arrested 17
suspects, and confiscated 11 trucks and jeeps and six guns used

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Why Kunming Is Chosen as Site of Horti-Expo '99 (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The China '99 Kunming
International Horticultural Exposition, the first to be held in a
developing country, is around the corner. It has aroused worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
People may wonder why Kunming, capital of China's remote Yunnan
Province, is chosen as the site of the specialized world
exposition.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 such expositions have been held since the first
one opened in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in 1960. But all of
them, except the one in Osaka, Japan, were held in European and
North American countries.
</P>
<P>
China submitted an application with the Association of
International Producers of Horticulture (AIPH) in 1993 for AIPH
membership and at the same time bid for the international
horticulture exposition in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, AIPH accepted China as a member and the International
Expositions Bureau (IEB) approved China's bid for hosting the
International Horticulture Exposition in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Originally, it was decided to host the exhibition in Beijing.
But later, the central government decided to change the venue to
Kunming after inspecting Yunnan Province and viewing the favorable
natural conditions, abundant biological and tourism resources
there.
</P>
<P>
Officials from IEB and AIPH visited Kunming afterwards and
approved the constitution of the exposition. The proposal was

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Why Kunming Is Chosen as Site of Horti-Expo '99 (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yunnan, which means "land beyond the rosy cloud" in Chinese, is
noted for its multifarious climatic and geographical conditions.
It is known as the "Kingdom of Plants" since it is home to 18,000
species of plants of higher order, or 60 percent of the flora
species in China. They include plants of the frigid zone,
temperate zone, subtropical zone and tropical zone.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the major botanical gene banks in the world, and a
leading province-level flower production base in China with an
annual output of nearly 700 million fresh-cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan also leads the country in terms of the number, type and
coverage of natural reserves. There are now 111 natural reserves
at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is the habitat of the people of 25 minority
nationalities. Their unique histories, cultures and customs and
conventions constitute a grand scroll painting. This, plus the
numerous natural scenes and historical sites, has made Yunnan a
popular tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
The capital Kunming is a scenic city with a wealth of
historical and cultural treasures. It is reputed as a spring city
thanks to its salubrious climatic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The coming horticultural exposition is sited at the Jindian (
Golden Palace) Scenic Area, four kilometers from the city proper.
With a forest cover of 76.7 percent in an area of 218 hectares,
the site is noted for its natural scenes and historical sites.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting the area, officials from the AIPH and IEB
agreed that this is the most ideal site for an international
horticultural exposition so far.

China's stock market is presented with a rare opportunity for
development this year, and this will help solve some deep-rooted
problems in the ailing state economy.

<HEADLINE> HK GCC Chairman Upbeat About HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Peter Sutch, chairman of the
Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (GCC), expressed here
Tuesday his confidence in Hong Kong's future and advised that Hong
Kong should further promote its international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong should keep its property prices and wages at a
competitive level and should do business more effectively and
efficiently in order to compete with its regional competitors,
said Sutch at a press conference before the annual general meeting
of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
Sutch, who is retiring as chairman of the chamber and is
leaving Hong Kong for London, expressed his support for the
government's proposals to reform the civil service of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The government recognizes the importance of an efficient and
cost effective civil service and it is a very important step on
Hong Kong's road to competitiveness, Sutch said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual general meeting of the HK GCC, Sutch
noted that the HK SAR has seen dramatic changes since a third of
century ago with the return of Hong Kong to China being only the
most recent dramatic development.
</P>
<P>
"I regard it as a tremendous privilege to have witnessed this
truly dramatic development," Sutch said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has now established itself as one of the world's
major cities for business, for finance and investment; as a key
entry point for international business to China; and as major
travel, tourism, communications and services hub, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As I now prepare to leave Hong Kong for London, I am confident
that with the continued economic opening of the mainland, the
future of the Hong Kong SAR is bright, despite our problems in the
past two years," Sutch said.
</P>
<P>
The last year was an extremely difficult one for the Hong Kong
economy, as the full impact of the east Asian financial crisis hit
home.
</P>
<P>
But like the rest of the community, the chamber responded
quickly to the downturn by cutting costs, increasing the
efficiency of its operations and improving services to members,
Sutch said.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the immediate future, the bad news is that it is
already that the current year is going to be another difficult one
for the Hong Kong SAR business community, he said.
</P>
<P>
The good news is that it should not be as bad as last year, he
continued.
</P>
<P>
Externally, with one or two exceptions, it is apparent that the
regional situation has stabilized, with most of Hong Kong's
regional markets expecting a resumption of positive growth after a
negative 1998.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, Hong Kong's biggest trading partner, the
inland areas, is looking to further strong growth of some 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, there are some signs of improvement, with the
share market doing well and the residential property market
appearing to have stabilized at lower price levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
Inbound travel and tourism numbers improved in the latter half
of last year and have continued to do so in the opening months of
the current year.
</P>
<P>
"Although I am about to leave Hong Kong, I have every
confidence that this vibrant commercial city will recover in the
near-term future," Sutch said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Constitution Day Marked in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Decorated with pictures and
craft arts supporting Yugoslav's campaign against NATO's bombing,
the embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia held a reception
here today to mark the 7th anniversary of the founding of the
Yugoslav Federal Republic and the formulation of its Constitution.
</P>
<P>
These art works included 2,000 paper cranes made by the
children of Beijing No. 8 Middle School, drawings by Nanjing
University students, and oil paintings depicting scenes in
Yugoslavia after the air strikes by the U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Ambassador Slobodan Unkovic said that this is a
special national day because NATO is still bombing his motherland.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that "we have no choice because we don't have
a second motherland, and we will stick to the end", adding that he
believes Yugoslavia will win the final victory.
</P>
<P>
Unkovic praised China for its support to Yugoslavia on the
Kosovo issue, and said he firmly believes that China will maintain
its just and fair standard in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Yugoslavia has called on NATO to stop the air
strikes and hold political negotiations with the parties concerned,
presided over by the United Nations, and he stressed that "any
agreements reached will only become effective if the Yugoslav
government accepts them."
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, NATO's targets in Yugoslavia,
besides military facilities, have included bridges, hospitals,
factories, and other civilian facilities, and even the Serbian TV
station and a residence of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 days of air strikes have caused economic losses
and many casualties, and have brought about the issue of refugees
and ecological disaster, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador expressed his gratitude to more than 500 guests
from both China and overseas, including over 70 diplomats and 60
ambassadors in Beijing, and he also talked with Wang Yingfan, vice
minister of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Close Down 61 Uneconomic Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Ministry of
Industry and Trade plans to close down 61 loss-making coal mines
this year, by using its own funds and those released by the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the mines, which prove uneconomic given the poor
quality of the extracted coal and the steep cost incurred by an
eventual re-engineering, will be followed by the ecological
reconstruction of the related zones.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government has ruled that the ecological
reconstruction should be included in the Program of the
Restructuring of the Mining Sector, for the implementation of
which a working group of experts has been set up.
</P>
<P>
Financial support will be diverted from the 1999 state budget
to shut down 32 mines, and the World Bank will assist in the
closure of 29 others.
</P>
<P>
From 1997 to 1998, the Romanian government brought 180 mines
and quarries to a halt.
</P>
<P>
So far it has set rules for beginning the closure and
ecological reconstruction for 113 mines, with another 67 mines and
quarries slated for a later time.

<HEADLINE> China Succeeds in Massive Transplantation of Alpine Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese botanists have succeeded
in their massive transplantation of alpine plants at the China '99
Kunming International Horticulture Exposition, which is scheduled
to open on May 1 and last till the end of October.
</P>
<P>
"The survival rate of the alpine plants we have migrated to the
Grand Greenhouse of the Expo site has reached more than 99 percent,
" said Liu Peigui, a botanist from the Kunming Institute of Botany
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Previously there was no record of such massive migration of
alpine plants in the world as it requires strict control of
temperature, humidity, light, ultraviolet ray and alpine wind.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have so far successfully transplanted more than
8,000 alpine plants of more than 400 species to the Alpine Plant
Hall of the Grand Greenhouse, including more than 30 rare species
under the state-class or province-class protection.
</P>
<P>
The massive plant migration project is designed to show the
harmony between man and nature, which is the theme of the
horticultural exposition this year. The other two halls of the
Grand Greenhouse are devoted to tropical plants and flowers.
</P>
<P>
The Alpine Plant Hall is built entirely according to the
ecological environment for alpine plants. It is divided into eight
small areas, which basically represent the typical alpine
vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Home to more than 60 percent of the flora species in China,
Yunnan is known as the kingdom of plants that cover a full
spectrum of climatic zones. Alpine plants mainly grow in
northwestern Yunnan, and more than 5,000 species survive at an
elevation more than 3,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
"The scientists spent more than a year deep in the mountainous
areas in the province seeking plants for migration. Most of the
plants, soil and rocks were moved directly from the high altitude
to Grand Greenhouse so as to satisfy the requirements of alpine
plants," said Sun Weibang, a botanist in charge of the migration
project.
</P>
<P>
The botanists have done away with the normal practice of
building interim greenhouses. Instead, they built "natural low
temperature cultivation rooms", known as "bedding in earth". They
then selected the plants that survived, put them into containers
and moved them to the greenhouse for field planting. The migration
of most species was done during their dormant period, thus
ensuring the success of the massive transplantation.

Two other "dumping sites", Panlongjiang River which made Wang

become clear and the stinking smell has gone.
</P>

"Now things are much better," said Mr. Wang, standing on the
turf where the narrow railway train used to run. "We can go out
for a walk, enjoying fresh air. There are many people doing
exercises down here in the morning and evening."
</P>
<P>
"It is good to build a precinct here," said Wan Xiuying, who
was sitting on a stone bench knitting. In front of her, there is a
footpath, laid with red bricks and dotted with lush green grass.
</P>
<P>
Every afternoon, Wan and her husband would walk for 10 minutes
in the precinct and relax themselves at the place which used to be
called Wujinglu Crossing.
</P>
<P>
Prior to environmental control project, Yang Haiming and his
colleagues visited the Kunming International Horticultural
Exposition gardens, about six kilometers northeast of Kunming City
proper. "It is green everywhere, very beautiful" Yang said. "we
were deeply touched and resolved to turn the garbage dumping site
into an 'oxygen bar'."
</P>
<P>
"I really begrudged to demolish the narrow track,to be frank"
said Yang, who used to be a pathmaster along the narrow track
outside Kunming for 28 years. "But the track is too dirty and too
filthy to be kept. It should have been removed long ago."
</P>
<P>
To remove the narrow railway in the downtown area did not
prevent Yunnan from becoming the only province in China to use
narrow railways. A new China-Vietnam railway was built and cargo
and passenger through transport was opened in 1996 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian, Israeli Officials to Meet Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian and Israeli
officials are due to meet in the coming days to discuss the
planned closure of three offices of the Orient House, a major
center for Palestinian political activity in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel Radio, the meeting was
requested by the top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who was
trying to persuade the Israeli government not to implement the
closure.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani will take part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security cabinet ordered the closure of three offices
of the Palestinian National Authority in the Orient House last
Thursday. And on Monday, Israeli police gave the formal
notification of closure to Faisal Husseini, the top Palestinian
official in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have said the three offices in the Orient
House have worked for the PNA while the peace agreement signed
between Israel and the PNA ban Palestinian activities in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In response, Husseini has said the Orient House does not
represent the PNA, noting that the compound has been working as a
Palestinian center for years.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
was seeking publicity ahead of the May 17 elections by ordering
the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
Husseini also said that he might appeal the closure order to
the Israeli Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and later annexed it. The Palestinians want to establish a
future capital in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace agreements signed by the two sides, the
issue of Jerusalem should be settled in the final status talks.

KUNMING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- For more than a decade, Mr. Wang
Yuxing, 72, had to learned to live with a century-old narrow
railway that had been turned into a virtual dumping site and a
stinking river that used to run across this highland city.
</P>
<P>
"The filthy river and the garbage dump along the narrow railway
made it virtually unbearable to live in the vicinity," Mr. Wang
recalled what he felt only two months ago, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
The railway, linking Kunming, capital city of Yunnan Province,
with Hanoi of Viet Nam, was a narrow railway only one meter wide.
The over 600-kilometer-long railway was built and put into service
by France in 1910. It used to be the only outlet of this once
remote and secluded province.

<P>
The growing city of Kunming gradually besieged the narrow track.
And the rapidly developed transportation, such as air routes,
standard railways and freeways gradually cast the old narrow
railway into the limbo of oblivion.
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, the railway was used to haul coal to the
downtown area once or twice a week only," said Mr. Yang Haiming,
an official with the Kunming Railway Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"When the train passed, the busy traffic near the crossings
would come to a standstill for minutes," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
As time passed, the narrow railway had been left unused,
unattended. People began to dump garbage along the line.
</P>
<P>
"It was simply an eyesore in this spring city," said Mrs. Wan
Xiuying, a 65-year-old retired kindergarten teacher who lives
about 10 minutes walk from the Wujinglu Crossing.
</P>
<P>
But all these have become a memory of the past. The old rail
track was torn away. On the debris appeared a green precinct for
people to do exercises and chatting. All these were done on the
eve of the opening of the '99 International Horticultural
Exposition.

PARIS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- French soccer star David Ginola has
said a "Player of the Year" award from the Professional
Footballers' Association (PFA) in England was a bonus tantamount
to the World Cup for him.
</P>
<P>
"This trophy is my World Cup," the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder
told France's L'Equipe newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ginola, who was not selected for the French team for last
summer's World Cup in his home country, said he had given up hope
to be capped.
</P>
<P>
"I have no more hopes to be capped. Now, I have other aims: to
win trophies with my side, to get ovations when I go out of the
stadium, to mark Tottenham's history", he added.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that missing the chance to lift the World Cup
trophy along with the French squad was a big disappointment.
</P>
<P>
"Having stayed away from this great adventure will be the
biggest disappointment of my career", Ginola said.

<HEADLINE> Wu Yi: Edge Policy Won't Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Wu Yi warned the
U.S. negotiators today that "the edge policy won't work".
</P>
<P>
Wu, the chief negotiator for over ten years on China's entry
into the late General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and now the
World Trade Organization (WTO), urged the U.S. to "treasure" the
concession and promise China has made during the bilateral
negotiations on China's accession to WTO.
</P>
<P>
"Some negotiators are reaching out for a yard after taking in
an inch," she said when meeting with a delegation of the Financial
Women's Association of New York (FWA) here today. "They are
demanding too high conditions that are impractical and
unacceptable for China," she said.
</P>
<P>
"China will definitely not agree with this," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu also stressed that China is willing to cooperate
with the U.S., adding that "China is the largest developing
country while the U.S. is the largest developed. China is a huge
market for the U.S. and both economies are complementary toward
each other."
</P>
<P>
"If the two countries could cooperate smoothly, that will
contribute greatly to the development of world economy," she said.
</P>
<P>
Wu recalled her recent visit along with Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji to the U.S., saying that the U.S. promised to strongly
support China's entry into the WTO by the end of this year, which
was put in a joint statement signed by Premier Zhu and President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Even the U.S. side admitted that China has made incredible
concessions," she said.
</P>
<P>
Wu briefed the delegation led by Lenore C. Albom, vice-
president of the Chase Securities Inc., on the financial reforms
in China, adding that she hopes that more financial enterprises
with good credit and reputation would invest in China.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Ensure Safety of Rebel Negotiators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that it will ensure the safety of peace negotiators of the
National Democratic Front (NDF) to pave the way for the resumption
of formal peace negotiations with NDF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Tuesday afternoon in
the Presidential Palace that a cabinet peace advisory committee he
heads has recommended that provisions of the Joint Agreement on
Safety and Immunity Guarantees earlier forged with NDF be restored
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Philippine President Joseph Estrada has instructed
government peace negotiators led by Ambassador Howard Dee to
immediately resume peace talks with the NDF following the release
by the rebels of its last government hostage, Sgt. Wivino Demol,
this week.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the president also stressed that the peace panel
should follow strict guidelines on the resumption of the talks,
which include those requiring that the negotiations be held within
Philippine territory and concluded by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The executive secretary said the government has already
informed the NDF of these guidelines.
</P>
<P>
He said officials involved in the peace process will submit its
recommendation to the president next week on the request of the
NDF to release political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The original list included 50 names drawn up by the government
and two human rights organizations, Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, indefinitely suspended peace talks with
the NDF, and put off his announcement on the release of these
detainees following the abduction by NDF rebels of military and
police officers in February.
</P>
<P>
These NDF hostages, including a general, a police inspector and
three military officers, have already been released by the rebels,
signaling the resumption of the formal peace talks.

BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
urged Israel to adopt more pragmatic approach to push forward the
Middle East peace process and realize comprehensive and lasting
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
China pays great attention to the peace process, said Li,
chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, during his meeting with visiting Israeli President Ezer
Weizman here today.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese nation and the Jewish nation enjoy a

</P>
<P>
Chinese people cherish friendly feelings to Israeli people, he
said, adding that China has a long history of civilization, and he
only knew the country from the books in the past. Now, he actually

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker on Gold Sales Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar lost
nearly three quarters of a U.S. cent Tuesday, weighed down by
expectations of gold sales by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and a subsequent slump in the price of the precious metal.
</P>
<P>
Angelo Gangemi, foreign exchange manager of Bankers Trust
Australia, said that after losing ground overnight there was very
little interest in the domestic currency during Tuesday's session.
</P>
<P>
"Basically it's just drifting lower," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished in Sydney at 64.65 U.S. cents,
down from Monday's close of 65.38 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
During the day it traded between 64.62 and 64.94 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven nations met in Washington Tuesday and issued
an inconclusive statement on debt relief for developing countries,
saying nothing about the sale of part of the IMF's 103 million
ounces of gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has been considering the sale of some of its gold
reserves since September 1996 and the Monday night speculation
resulted in the price of COMEX gold for current delivery tumbling
3.1 U.S. dollars to close at 280.5 U.S. dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
The level of the Australian dollar is strongly dictated by
movements in the gold price as the precious metal is Australia's
second largest export.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney, the Australian dollar was buying 0.6096
euro from 0.6159 euro Monday and 77.32 Japanese yen from 77.74
yen.

<HEADLINE> China Foresees Severe Floods in Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua)-- The rain belt this year may move
northward as compared with last year, causing big floods in the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Huai River and the middle and
lower reaches of the Yellow River in the June-August period.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Wenzhi, vice-minister of water resources made the remarks
here today citing majority opinions of experts.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China is suffering prolonged and lingering drought
in the northern part, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the La Nina phenomenon is expected to
bring about 27-29 typhoons this year in the Pacific, with seven-
nine landing on China, adding that the typhoons will also swamp
China's northern coastline other than the usual southeastern
coastline.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the Yangtze has enjoyed improvement in its dykes
and levees, basically solving the leakage problem. However, the
Yellow River, whose river bed in the middle and lower section is
higher than the ground, is less well prepared for severe floods.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was speaking at a conference introducing a 14,000-word
book expounding last year's flood situation and a ten-part TV
documentary film of the same topic.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Support China's Forest Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is now discussing
with China's State Administration of Forestry on a new project to
help the country protect its forests.
</P>
<P>
The proposed project, called "the Sustainable Forestry
Development Project", is expected to start next year, said an
official from the World Bank Resident Mission in China at a Sino-
Norwegian forestry seminar held here today.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and others plan to invest some 200 million U.S.
dollars in the project, including the World Bank loans of 150
million U.S. dollars, a Global Environment Facility grant of 30
million U.S. dollars, and another grant of 20 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jin, agriculture specialist with the World Bank, said that
a multi-donor identification mission visited China from March 20
to April 3, and the framework and main components of the project
have been worked out.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully," Liu said, "it will be on board later next year."
She added that the preparatory work for the project began last
November.
</P>
<P>
China launched its Forest Protection Program last year in the
wake of severe floods on the Yangtze and Songhua rivers.
</P>
<P>
With the funds provided, this new project will help improve the
protection and management of forests to enhance the sustainable
management of natural resources and environmental development in
China, develop new forestry resources to address China's
increasing wood deficit, and support economic development of rural
households and state enterprises to redress the social and fiscal
impacts of the logging ban.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the World Bank has financed six forestry projects
in 19 of China's provinces with about 800 million U.S. dollars in
commitments.

<HEADLINE> Preliminary Findings on ROK Plane Crash Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Aviation Administration
of China (CAAC), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
of the U.S, and the Korea Civil Aviation Bureau (KCAB) jointly
issued preliminary findings on the crash of the Korean Airlines
cargo flight 6316 this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The investigation produced no evidence of an explosion before
impact, and no evidence of criminal intent or engine failure.
</P>
<P>
The investigation also indicates that the crew's conversations
with Air Traffic Control (ATC) were routine. The ATC and CVR tape
indicates that all ATC procedures were followed correctly, and
that the flight crew did not request a landing or declare an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
However, the conversations provided by the CVR indicate that
shortly after takeoff the crew experienced a problem in
maneuvering the airplane.
</P>
<P>
But the initial examinations of the crew's comments have not
provided investigators with a sufficient understanding of the
nature of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Radar data indicates that the flight was cleared by ATC
initially to an altitude of 900 meters. The ATC subsequently
cleared the flight to climb to 1,500 meters, and about the time
radio contact was lost, the flight was cleared to climb to 5,700
meters.
</P>
<P>
Korean Air Lines cargo flight 6316 crashed shortly after
takeoff from Shanghai on April 15. The airplane was destroyed and
the two pilots and one flight engineer on board were killed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, five persons on the ground were killed and 37
others injured. Flight 6316 was a regularly scheduled cargo flight
from Shanghai to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is being conducted by the CAAC, the NTSB, and
the KCAB. Technical support is being offered by Boeing, Pratt&AMP;
Whitney, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Korean Air
(KAL).
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the investigation continues under the
supervision of the CAAC with the full support and cooperation of
the NTSB, KCSB, KAL and component manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Former Australian PM Doubts NATO Would Win Ground War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Australian Prime Minister
Malcolm Fraser, who returned from Yugoslavia Tuesday, warned of
disaster for NATO if it launched a ground war against Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
Fraser, who traveled to Belgrade to try to obtain the release
of two Australian aid workers accused of spying for NATO, doubted
NATO's ability to win a ground war, which he said could drag
Russia into the conflict.
</P>
<P>
More diplomatic action should have been taken to resolve the
situation in Kosovo, the CARE Australia aid agency chairman told a
press conference in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"When diplomacy fails and people go to war they really do need
to think through the consequences very, very seriously indeed,"
Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister returned Tuesday morning from
Yugoslavia as Australia's special envoy to Yugoslavia to seek the
release of the Australians detained there.
</P>
<P>
"They (NATO) should have a look at a little history," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hitler had 20 divisions in Yugoslavia. He was able to occupy
the country but he never suppressed the country," Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
He believed the sending in of NATO ground troops would "make
them (the Yugoslav forces) more determined."
</P>
<P>
Fraser said Russia's attitude would be "highly critical" if
ground forces were used by the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
Fraser said his negotiations with Yugoslav officials on the
release of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, the two "aid workers" of
his non-governmental aid agency, were productive, but believed it
was best for him to return to Australia.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls for Regulation of Tobacco Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
on Tuesday called on international food and drug regulators to
bring cigarettes and other tobacco products under the same ambit
of rules that govern the sales and promotion of other nicotine
delivery devices.
</P>
<P>
Gro Harlem Brundtland, director general of WHO, made the remark
at the opening ceremony of the ninth International Conference of
Drug Regulatory Authorities (ICDRA) in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland said, "a cigarette is a euphemism for a cleverly
crafted product that delivers just the right amount of nicotine to
keep its user addicted for life before killing the person."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the world's premier health agency to
urge food and drug regulators to rationalize rules that govern all
forms of nicotine consumption.
</P>
<P>
"The tobacco companies will inevitably tell you they are
selling a simple agricultural product, chopped up tobacco leaves
rolled into a paper tube," said Brundtland, adding, "this is
categorically untrue."
</P>
<P>
Tobacco control experts say it does not stand to reason that
harmful nicotine from cigarettes is available freely while
prescriptions are necessary for therapeutic nicotine sold by
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, in 1890, tobacco was included in the United
States Pharmacopia but, after intense lobbying of Congress by
tobacco manufacturers, it was excluded from the purview of the US
Food and Drug Administration, which has jurisdiction over those
products listed in Pharmacopia.
</P>
<P>
Demanding that the omission to be rectified, Brundtland said
that the organization would soon convene a high-level meeting of
international regulators to assess the extent to which the tobacco
industry had subverted science and used false advertising and
promotional tactics to veil nicotine addiction as an act of free
choice.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco has reportedly killed 4 million people, over 70 percent
of them in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of the next century, tobacco industry
products will kill 10 million people, many of them in the prime of
their lives.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Afforestation Cooperation with Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Both Chinese and Norwegian
officials expressed their hopes at a seminar here today that
cooperation in the field of forestry will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zehui, president of the Chinese Academy of Forestry
Sciences, told the Sino-Norwegian Forestry seminar that Sino-
Norwegian cooperation has great potential in areas such as timber
processing, biodiversity conservation, afforestation, and
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China is a forest-deficient country with a
comparatively harsh environment in many regions, and the Chinese
government has always attached great importance to forestry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the existing planted area in the country
now covers more than 40 million hectares, ranking first in the
world.
</P>
<P>
In the China National Program for Ecological Environment
Improvement worked out at the beginning of this year, there are
plans to cover all the land suitable for afforestation with trees,
raising the forest cover to 26 percent. China's current forest
cover stands at 13.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this, we are willing to work together with
developed countries, including Norway, in addition to relying on
our own efforts," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
She noted that as a country with developed forestry, Norway has
accumulated a wealth of successful experience and advanced
techniques in such areas as forest operations, biodiversity
conservation, and forestry management.
</P>
<P>
Severe Bergh Johansen, Norway's ambassador to China, also said
that the focus of today's seminar on forestry means a new field
for Sino-Norwegian cooperation will be opened. He noted that in
the world's overall environment and biodiversity, China's forests
play a tremendously important role.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have cooperated in more than 80 environment-
related projects over the past 40-plus years.

<HEADLINE> New Technology in Cassava Processing Developed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Stored Products
Research Institute has developed technologies for stemming early
deterioration of cassava tubers, Director of the institute,
Ajibola Daramola, said.
</P>
<P>
This Day newspaper Tuesday quoted Daramola as saying recently
the new technology is capable to extending the shelf-lives of
freshly harvested cassava tubers by three months.
</P>
<P>
He explained that after adopting the technology, the tubers are
 available all year round, especially in the production centers of
the crop in the south and central areas in this west African
country.
</P>
<P>
It would also mean availability of more tubers for processing
into products such as garri (the staple food of the Nigerians),
starch and other industrial derivatives, the director added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, essentially, by the technology, freshly
harvested cassava tubers are stored in trenches and saw-dust.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the leading producer of the crop in the world, which
is an important contributor to national food security and
self-sufficiency for African countries.
</P>
<P>
Cassava production has increased to more than 80 million tons
in the most populous African country from 50 million tons in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Per capita production of the crop in Nigeria was estimated at
about 250 kilograms in the mid-1990s, compared with barely 150
kilograms during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Mopko Bokanga, biochemist and food technologist with the
Ibandan-based International Institute of Tropical Agriculture,
attributed the increase in cassava production mainly to the
development of high-yielding and disease-resistant varieties of
the crop.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia's intelligence
organization Tuesday revealed plans to go after spies and
terrorists through their computers, financial transactions and tax
records.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Richardson, director-general of the Australian Security
Intelligence Organization (ASIO), said his organization is seeking
changes to its powers which gave it a capability to use
technologies of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"Access on occasion to taxation information and to financial
transactions can be critical in ASIO's work, especially in the
area of counterespionage and also in the area of politically
motivated violence or terrorism," Richardson told the Australian
Parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In respect of the latter, there is likely before the end of
the year to be an international convention which will in fact call
for governments to be more aware of the need to access information
relating to financial transaction in the fight against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Richardson was giving evidence before the parliamentary joint
committee on ASIO which is considering amendments to the ASIO Act.
</P>
<P>
Among the proposed changes, ASIO is seeking the power to access
tax and financial records, break into computers and intercept mail
carried by private contractors and to use electronic tracking
devices.
</P>
<P>
ASIO is currently permitted to intercept telecommunications,
use listening devices and open mail.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said ASIO has not yet broken into computers using
existing technology as that is not permitted under the current
legislation.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's re-
exports, domestic exports and imports all registered decreases in
March this year over a year earlier, according to figures released
by the Census and Statistics Department today.
</P>
<P>
The figures show the value of total exports in March was down
10.6 percent to 97.1 billion HK dollars (12.45 billion U.S.
dollars) compared with the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
The value of re-exports and that of domestic exports
respectively amounted to 85.1 billion HK dollars (10.9 billion U.S.
dollars) and 11.9 billion HK dollars (1.52 billion U.S. dollars),
separately 9.5 percent and 17.5 percent lower than that of March
last year.
</P>
<P>
The value of imports fell by 12.4 percent over a year earlier
to 108.3 billion HK dollars (13.88 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1999, the value of total exports
dropped by nine percent while that of imports fell by 13.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman said that export performance
in 1999 continued to be dampened by the slack import demand in
some of the east Asian economies such as Japan and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The on-going structural shift from re-exports to offshore
trading could have reduced merchandise exports further,
particularly those to the Chinese mainland, he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Clone 3 Goats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists have cloned
the world's first triplet goats, each of which was developed from
a single adult cell and they share identical DNA, or genetic
makeup, the National Post newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The triplet kids, known as Danny, Clint, and Arnold, were born
in mid-March at a McGill University campus farm. They share a
black spot in the center of their forehead, all have black feet,
the same erect ears, as well as similar head and body shape. Their
cell structures are identical.
</P>
<P>
The three goats are Canada's first cloned livestock using
nuclear transfer, the same procedure used to produce Dolly the
sheep, the world's first cloned animal that was born in 1997 in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Nexia Biotechnologies Inc. of Montreal, the company that
produced the goats, said the next big scientific step will come
when the company adds special "spider" genes to goat cells from
the triplets to clone more animals, whose milk can then be used
for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
If the upcoming procedure is successful, the company will begin
breeding thousands of goats.

current China visit.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Weizman arrived here on Sunday for a state-visit to China at
the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his stay in Beijing in the past two days,
he held "fascinating" meetings with President Jiang and Premier
Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
"We concentrated on the cooperation between the two countries
and on the peace process in the Middle East," he said.

"I am very glad to say that Israel has a lot of cooperation
with China in economies, hi-tech business and agriculture," he

LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Companies have started pouring
into Nigeria to explore the prospects of buying stakes in the
Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL) and the Mobile
Telecommunications Limited (M-Tel).
</P>
<P>
Lee Barnes, Commercial Counsellor of the U.S. Embassy in
Nigeria, said that a number of American companies had already
visited Nigeria in connection with the proposed privatization of
NITEL and M-Tel, Nigerian Tribune newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement on the U.N. envoy's current visit to the Horn of
Africa, Selome said, "Ethiopia, which has always been willing to
work with third parties attempting to mediate a peaceful
resolution to the conflict, welcomes Sahnoun's current efforts."
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun, who is visiting Eritrea and Ethiopia this week,
arrived in Asmara late Saturday night and is expected to further
come here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
His current visit is expected to push for implementation of the
peace plan put forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have nominally accepted the OAU
proposals, but no cease-fire has been agreed.
</P>
<P>
Selome said in the statement that "Eritrea must withdraw its
troops from all occupied Ethiopian territories, as required by the
OAU framework agreement."
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, the government in Asmara needs to officially
declare that it will withdraw its troops from all Ethiopian land
and agree to set a short time frame in which the withdrawal will
be implemented," the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the Eritrean authorities agree to these requirements
can a cease-fire take place," she said, adding that "if Eritrea
does not agree to both withdraw its troops and to do so within a
set period of time, a cease-fire will not be possible."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia accepted the OAU framework agreement in November last
year while Eritrea accepted it in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The 11-month border conflict escalated into fierce fighting in
June 1998 and in February and March this year.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun's last visit to the Horn of African was made in early
February this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports to Asia Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's exports to the rest of
Asia are recovering following a first ever negative growth last
year, signs at an on-going trade fair show.
</P>
<P>
Business people from Southeast Asia signed import contracts
worth 630 million U.S. dollars between April 15-26 at the 85th
China Export Commodities Fair, which will close at the end of this
month. The value is 66 percent more than the comparable figure for
the previous fair.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the Republic of Korea and Japan jumped 30 percent
and 13 percent, respectively, according to official statistics,
which indicated that exports to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
regions also grew by considerable margins.
</P>
<P>
"These figures show that China's exports to other parts of Asia
are recovering from the effects of the Asian financial crisis," a
trade expert said.
</P>
<P>
That the Asian economy is bottoming out is the major reason
behind the significant growth in Chinese exports to the Asian
market, Gao Mingdou, Secretary of China Council of Machinery and
Electronics Products, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that more than 50,000 business
people from other parts of Asia participated in the trade fair by
Monday, up 16.8 percent over the corresponding number for the
previous fair.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Asian financial crisis, which first broke
out in Thailand in July 1997 and quickly engulfed many other
countries and regions, China last year experienced its first
negative growth in exports to the Asian market in 16 years. Asia
used to be the leading destination of Chinese exports.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China exported 98.3 billion U.S.
dollars worth of goods to the rest of Asia last year, down 9.9
percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
As the financial crisis is widely seen to ease, signs of an
economic recovery in the region have become increasingly apparent
in recent months, allowing Asian business people to be able to
import more Chinese goods.
</P>
<P>
Initial statistics show that turnover at the trade fair totaled
8.89 billion U.S. dollars by Monday, an increase of 12.6 percent
over the comparable figure for the previous fair.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not to Send Peacekeeping Force to E.Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not send a
peacekeeping force to East Timor because the Indonesian Armed
Forces can maintain stability in the troubled territory, U.S.
Ambassador to Indonesia J. Stapleton Roy said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a dialogue with leaders of various groups in Dili, capital
of East Timor, Roy stressed the Indonesian armed forces'
capability to maintain peace and stability in the former
Portuguese colony, Antara news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of sending a peacekeeping force, the U.S. government
will dispatch a special team to observe the direct balloting in
East Timor," he said before leaving Dili for Denpasar, capital of
Bali province.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the U.S.' stance on the peaceful solution to the
East Timor question, Roy said his government will in principle
accept the decision the East Timorese will make through the
U.N.-sponsored direct balloting.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie Tuesday said in Denpasar that
the direct balloting in East Timor will be held on August 8, and
the government has proposed to the U.N. to invite Australia, the
United States, Japan, the Philippines, Germany and Britain to
observe the event.
</P>
<P>
Roy said if in the long run, the people accept the wide-ranging
autonomy proposed by the Indonesian government, the U.S. will give
its full support.
</P>
<P>
"The differences between the different parties are going to
complicate the process of trying to move forward a credible
process to determine the wishes of the East Timorese people," he
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Roy, who arrived in Dili on Sunday, held dialogues with Bishop
Carlos Belo and East Timor Governor Abilio Jose Osorio Soares,
emphasizing to them the importance of avoiding further violence
and keeping the peace process going.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, the Indonesian government announced that it was
ready to release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider
autonomy was refused by the people in the region and the
international community.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Botanists Furious At Plants Stealing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1949, the Chinese government has made great efforts to
protect the country's plant resources through legislation and
intensified customs control, but it has so far failed to
completely wipe out plant theft.
</P>
<P>
"By protecting a species you can protect many kinds of genetic
resources," said Xu Zaifu, another noted botanist in Yunnan. "
Since mankind is still unable to create new genes, the more
existing genes a country preserves, the greater advantage it
enjoys in the global competition in the next century."
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, director of the Xishuangbanna Tropical
Botanical Garden under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, apart from
rare species and ornamental plants, plants with major economic
value or application potential, also need protection.
</P>
<P>
He cited soybean and kiwi fruit as examples. Both plants were
originated in China. But now the largest producers are the United
States and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"Similar things have happened to some medicinal herb native to
China," Xu added.
</P>
<P>
Both Wu and Xu hoped that during the '99 International
Horticultural Exposition scheduled to open in Kunming, capital of
Yunnan, on May 1, botanists from all over the world can discuss
about how to protect more effectively plant resources in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the two scientists also agreed that in the world today,
it is extremely costly and almost impossible for a country to put
all its plant resources under flawless protection.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the rapid development of biological
technologies, plant theft no longer necessarily requires
acquisition of seeds," said Wu. "Sometimes a plant can be cloned
with merely a single piece of its leaves."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the most effective way to protect rare and
valuable plants is to reproduce them by large quantities and to
exploit their economic values fully ahead of others.
</P>
<P>
Xu suggested that the state should increase its financial
support for botanical research so as to enable scientists to find
out the use and application prospects of all known species of
plants in China.
</P>
<P>
"Priority must be given to plants of greatest importance and
highest economic value," said Xu. "Only with a definite objective
in view can we carry out our protection efforts most efficiently."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Botanists Furious At Plants Stealing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite the stunning beauty of
that small pot of apricot-color orchid in front of him, Mr.Wu
Zhengyi felt no heart for joy or appreciation. What is on his face
is only sadness and anger.
</P>
<P>
"A native of Yunnan, this flower at one time could be found
nowhere but in China. But now it is not the Chinese who are
studying it carefully or making a good fortune of it," said Wu, an
academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences who has been
engaged in botanical study for more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
One of the prettiest members of the lady's slipper orchid
family, the Apricotyellow Paphiopedilum, or "Xinghuangdoulan" in
Chinese, sells for several dozen US dollars a pot on the
international flower market.
</P>
<P>
Wu, now 83, still clearly remembered that this orchid was first
found in the 1950s by Chinese botanists in high mountains in the
western part of Yunnan, but he could never figure out when and how
the flower's seeds fell into foreigners' hands.
</P>
<P>
"But I do know that some foreign scholars and business people
often spent big money purchasing the seeds of China's rare or
precious flowers and trees, and then smuggled them out of the
country," said Wu. "Yunnan has suffered the most from such illegal
activities."
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is reputed as China's "kingdom of plants" as more than
18,000 of the country's 30,000-strong species live in this
southwestern plateau province, many of which have never been found
elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, who has taken Yunnan as his research base for
more than half a century, Yunnan's plant resources were once
subject to unbridled plunder by foreigners before the founding of
the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, many precious species of flowers in Yunnan,
especially rhododendra, were taken out of China and transplanted
into foreign gardens. This earned China the name 'mother of all
world gardens'," recalled Wu.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi-Jordanian Oil Pipeline to Start Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The construction of an oil
pipeline between Iraq and Jordan will start soon, an Iraqi weekly
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Economist weekly published on Tuesday quoted an official
source at the Oil Ministry as saying that the ministry and the
Jordanian Energy Ministry are making final preparations for
starting the construction of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Jordan agreed in 1998 to construct an oil pipeline to
export northern Iraq's oil through Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
The source said that this project will be executed in stages,
beginning with the construction of the pipeline from Jordan's
al-Zarkaa refinery to the Jordanian-Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline construction inside Iraq will be started after
the United Nations sanctions on Iraq were lifted, said the source,
adding that after the pipeline inside Jordan is ready, Iraq will
deliver its crude oil to the border by tankers and pump the oil
into the pipeline inside Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the pipeline from Jordan's al-Zarkaa
refinery to the Iraqi-Jordanian border will cost 300 million
U.S. dollars with the transport capacity of 150,000 barrels per
day.

<HEADLINE> African Grey Parrots Face Extinction in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An increased trade in the African
grey parrot has put the endangered birds at the brink of
extinction in Nigeria with the parrots paradise at Okodi Village
in northern Nigeria under severe threat.
</P>
<P>
According to the Environmental Rights Actions (ERA), government
efforts to protect the African grey parrot is being thwarted by a
ring of international poachers, This Day newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
ERA said "some influential Nigerians who are based mainly in
Kano and Port Harcourt sponsor the poachers who are mainly
immigrants from Ghana."
</P>
<P>
The trade in the African grey parrot persists in Nigeria
despite the nation's adoption of the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of fauna and flora to curb the
trade in endangered plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
To enforce the convention, the Nigerian government promulgated
the Endangered Species (control of international trade and
traffic) Decree in 1985.
</P>
<P>
But since then, ERA said, the government had "done little or
nothing to protect any of the endangered animal and plant species
covered by the decree."
</P>
<P>
Although the trade in endangered wildlife is almost as
lucrative as trade in hard drugs, criminals find the former more
attractive because the penalty for poaching endangered animals is
said to be far less than those for drug related offences.
</P>
<P>
The African parrot is a grey-colored bird with a scarlet tail
whose habitat is limited mainly to the swamps and mangroves of the
lowland forest of equatorial African countries like Nigeria,
Ghana, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Fondly called "brain and beauty", the bird is sought all over
the world as pet due to its beauty, intelligence and peculiar
ability to speak and whistle like a human.

PARIS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Western countries now want to maintain military pressure on
Belgrade, where the first sign of crack is appearing in the
coalition in power, while intensifying diplomatic contacts with
Russia. In Belgrade, former opposition leader Vik Draskovic is
taking distance with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
-- Meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, the European foreign
ministers decided to reinforce economic sanctions against Belgrade,
notably by banning the visas of President Slobodan Milosevic, his
family and his ministers. Other measures include extension of
freezing of properties of the Yugoslav state abroad for people
associated with Milosevic or enterprises associated with or acting
for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac has imposed on himself a
moratorium, avoiding any meeting with the political personalities
of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic and its liberal allies
before June 13, the date when the European Parliament elections
are held. The move is aimed at not worsening the quarrels within
the right-wing camp of France.
</P>
<P>
-- The Yugoslav Vice Prime Minister Vik Draskovic has separated
himself from the official policy of the regime by calling on
Milosevic to cooperate with the international community. "We
cannot defeat NATO. We don't have the right to have such ambitions,
" he said.

came from the ballot in the general elections is valid and this
is what the people want.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Independent Deputy Ahmet Ozal, son of the late President
Turgut Ozal, said that the central-right True Path Party (DYP),

</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan's Lower House Passes Guidelines Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives,
or the lower house of the Diet (parliament), Tuesday adopted three
bills to implement the updated Japan-U.S. defense cooperation
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The move came two days before the week-long visit of Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi to the United States, with the support of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), its coalition partner
Liberal Party (LP) and opposition New Komeito.
</P>
<P>
The three bill package authorizes Japan's military to take
various measures in the event of emergencies near Japan, to revise
the Japan-U.S. Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement and to
amend the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) Law.
</P>
<P>
The passage was ensured by a compromise reached Sunday among
the LDP, LP and New Komeito.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, the three parties agreed to delete from
the first bill a clause on inspection of foreign ships by the SDF
during emergencies in areas surrounding Japan. They instead agreed
to enact separate legislation on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The three parties also agreed to add to the definition of
emergencies in areas surrounding Japan, the phrase "such
situations which, if remained unchecked, may bring about direct
armed attack against Japan."
</P>
<P>
The original bill only referred to "situations that would have
an important influence on Japan's peace and security."
</P>
<P>
The amended bill also requires prior Diet approval of the SDF's
rear-area logistic support and search and rescue operations.
However, in the event of high-level emergencies, the government
could seek the approval after it has dispatched troops.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's lower house plenary session, members of the LDP,
LP and New Komeito voted for the amended bill, while members of
the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the Japanese
Communist Party (JCP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) voted
against the bill.
</P>
<P>
The other two bills were approved without amendments, supported
by the LDP, LP, New Komeito and DPJ.
</P>
<P>
The SDP and JCP opposed the bills, saying their provisions
could get Japan embroiled in another war.
</P>
<P>
The bills, which were immediately submitted to the House of
Councilors, are certain to become law as the LDP, LP and New
Komeito together hold a comfortable majority there.
</P>
<P>
Apart from some Japanese opposition parties, ordinary Japanese
also expressed their strong opposition to the bills. For the past
several days, people from Japan's civic groups and labor unions
lodged protests at the Diet, and other locations, calling for
discarding the bills.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Central Bank Wants Statute Amended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda, the country's
central bank, has proposed a list of amendments to the Financial
Institutions Statute 1993 to create uniformity in the banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the amendments is a strong directive to all
commercial banks, local and foreign, to raise their capital base
to two billion shillings (1.4 million U.S. dollars) within the
next eight months, the New Vision paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Walugembe Musoke, the bank's spokesman, was quoted as saying
Monday that the move is to ensure that there is uniformity in the
banking sector and that the commercial banks are backed by a solid
capital base.
</P>
<P>
Under the Financial Institutions Statute 1993, the minimum
capital requirement for local banks is 357,143 dollars while that
for foreign banks is 714,286 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The draft was sent to Finance Minister Gerald Ssendaula, who is
expected to present it for debate in parliament on a date to be
named.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's move was taken after it closed four
commercial banks within seven months for their mismanagement and
huge inside lending.
</P>
<P>
The recent closure of the Greenland Bank Limited sent another
wave of panic among depositors and the demand for dollars has been
rising sharply, making the shilling depreciate every day.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Open up Insurance Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China will further open up its
insurance market to foreign competition, Ma Yongwei, chairman of
the China Insurance Regulation Commission, said here today.
</P>
<P>
China will do so with the gradual improvement in the legal
system and the government's supervision ability concerning the
insurance market, he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while answering reporters' questions at the
1999 Mainland and Hong Kong Insurance Conference, which opened
today and attracted more than 100 insurance regulators, company
officials and scholars from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong as
well as Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, He Jiesheng, managing
director of the Insurance Institute of China, said China would not
only approve more foreign insurance firms to set up business in
the country, but will also allow them to expand their business
scope and set up offices in more Chinese cities beside Shanghai
and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Chinese market to foreign insurers will
bring the country advanced management expertise and know-how,
which will help improve the performance of Chinese insurance
companies, she said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, nine foreign insurance companies from seven
countries have started business operations in China. Another 113
foreign insurance institutions from 17 countries have set up 202
representative offices in the country, while five foreign
companies have been approved to set up solely-funded businesses or
joint ventures in China.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Criminal Court Frees Former Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The criminal court in Kibuye
district, western Rwanda, Monday acquitted a former government
official in a case relating to the 1994 genocide in which he was
allegedly involved.
</P>
<P>
The criminal court ''set free one genocide suspect and also
former sous- prefet (deputy-governor) of Kibuye, (Ignace) Banyaga,
after finding him innocent,'' the Rwanda News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had requested death penalty to the suspect whom
it accused of genocide and crimes against humanity. Banyaga
immediately walked home and joined his family, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in Kibuye said Banyaga served as personal
 secretary to Clement Kayishema, the former governor of Kibuye,
who is now in the United Nations custody in Arusha, Tanzania, for
involvement in the genocide of thousands of Tutsis who had sought
refuge at the local church, soccer stadium, and the Bisesero
hills.
</P>
<P>
His release surprised many genocide survivors who had accused
him of direct participation in the killings which rocked Kibuye
five years ago, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan prisons are crammed with over 124,000 genocide suspects
waiting for trial. Since the beginning of the trials by the
country's criminal courts in December 1996, up to 1,000 cases have
been handled, with around 150 death sentences.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by a local human rights organization
LIPRODHOR, about 2,000 detainees were released since October 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Computer Virus Generates Little Fallout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Only 70 computers had been
hit by the so-called Chernobyl virus Monday, much less than
expected, according to the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Across the world, the Chernobyl virus had affected hundreds of
computers in Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Japan, New Zealand,
Britain, Russia, Malta, Finland and Sweden, CERT said, adding that
the worst damage appeared to be taking place in Singapore, where
at least 150 computers broke down.
</P>
<P>
Among those hit in the United States, 30 to 40 computers used
by Boston College students, said the college spokesman Jack Dunn.
The virus affected only students who did not install antivirus
software distributed by the college last fall.
</P>
<P>
Before Monday, media reports warned that the Chernobyl virus
could wreak havoc around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chernobyl virus is a variation of the CIH virus, first
reported in the middle of last year. The April CIH virus is called
Chernobyl virus because it's timed to go off on the anniversary of
the Soviet nuclear accident, one of technology's worst disasters
occurred 13 year ago.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Favors Declaration of Statehood on May 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yaser Arafat
said here Tuesday that he favored to declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Central Council, Arafat said the outcome and
fate of the Palestinian people's struggle have asked the
Palestinian leadership to declare an independent Palestinian
state in the territories on time.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Arafat briefed the council members about the
current development in the Middle East peace process, the
situation in the region and his discussions about the statehood
issue with leaders of foreign countries he recently visited.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he said, the issue of the statehood declaration should
be decided by the council.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Arafat's address to the meeting, a report on
whether to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 this
year was submitted to the council for consideration, a senior
Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton's letter to Arafat was
also made public to the council, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The PLO Central Council started discussing here Tuesday over
the issue of the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
As invited, a delegation of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) headed by its spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin
attended the meeting as observers. Representatives from other
Palestinian political factions also took part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting's main topic is whether Arafat would
announce the formation of an independent Palestinian state in the
teritories on May 4 this year, when the five-year Palestinian
self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo
Accords.
</P>
<P>
As the meeting is in progress, hundreds of Palestinians
from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are
demonstrating in front of the Office, urging the council and
Arafat not to postpone the declaration on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo
principles, he has the right to declare an independent
Palestinian state on that date. For this purpose, he traveled
recently to many countries in the world to seek their support and
advise over this matter.
</P>
<P>
But Israel opposes this idea, threatening to annex parts of
the West Bank territories now under its control.
</P>
<P>
The United States, seeking to persuade the Palestinians not to
declare a state, urged on Monday again Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) not to take unilateral actions but set
themselves a new target of agreeing on a permanent settlement
within in a year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday officially sent a letter
to Arafat, in which he once again asked Arafat to cancel the
announcement of a state on May 4 and stressed the U.S. would help
move the peace process forward after Israel's May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Backing up Clinton's call, the White House issued a statement
the same day, promising to facilitate that process, to bring
Israeli and Palestinian leaders together within six month after
Israeli elections to review the status of their efforts and to
help reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how long the council meeting would take, but
the whole world, particularly the United States and Israel, are
anxiously to see what decision the council would make on this
statehood issue.

dollars in quantities of 1,000. The Intel 810 chip set will range
in price from 25.5 dollars to 32 dollars, depending on the cache
memory, in quantities of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
"We are deadly serious about this segment (low end PC market),"
said Paul Otellini, Executive vice president and general manager
of Intel's architecture business group, at a press briefing. "We
are very very cognizant that this is where the growth is."
</P>
<P>
Intel estimates the chip set could reduce costs of 810-based
Celeron computers by as much as 20 percent, while 466 MHz Celeron-
based computers is available starting at 999 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
That's enough to enable a whole new market for PCs, said
Otellini.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the combinations of a cheaper and faster Celeron
could hurt Intel's rivals. "It is helping to take the wind out of
the sails of AMD and Cyrix," said Kathleen Maher, analyst with
graphics technology watcher Jon Peddie Associates.

<HEADLINE> Police Investigate Murder of BBC Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- British police on Tuesday started
hunting for a hitman who carried out the murder of BBC television
presenter Jill Dando on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Detective Chief Inspector Hamish Campbell told a news
conference at Scotland Yard in London that Dando died after being
shot once in the side of the head with a 9mm semi-automatic
firearm.
</P>
<P>
He said a man police want to question was seen an hour before
the shooting outside Dando's home at 11.30 am in west London.
</P>
<P>
Detectives are still trying to track down a smartly dressed man
carrying a mobile telephone who was seen walking from the scene.
</P>
<P>
Police issued another call for anyone who may have seen the man
in the area following the murder of Dando, 37, who presented
Crimewatch UK and Holiday.
</P>
<P>
Police were also exploring the possibility that Dando may have
been killed by a stalker. She was stalked by a fanatical fan last
year, prompting her to say in an Internet interview that she was
scared for her personal safety.
</P>
<P>
Nick Ross, who co-presented Crimewatch with Ms Dando, said he
could not believe the murder was linked to her television work.
</P>
<P>
He told BBC Two's Newsnight program: "I don't believe there was
any Crimewatch connection with her killing. God alone knows what
the motive is."
</P>
<P>
Dando's murder prompted tributes from the Queen, who was said
to be "shocked and saddened", and Prime Minister Tony Blair, who
was also "deeply shocked".
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old star had been looking forward to marrying a
London doctor later this year.

<HEADLINE> China Deeply Concerned Over Approval of Military Cooperation Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China is deeply concerned over
the approval of relevant acts of the New Japan-U.S. Defense
Guidelines by the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet,
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said at a regular press
conference today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan's adoption of relevant acts, regardless of
the strong concerns of China and other neighboring nations, is
aimed to strengthen the military cooperation between Japan and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"It runs against the trend of the times, and will bring a new
unstable factor and a negative impact to the security of the
region," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the fact that some U.S. congressmen wrote a
letter to Lee Teng-hui, reaffirming commitment to the Taiwan
Relation Act, the spokesman said that this has gravely violated
the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and wantonly interfered in
China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
China has expressed strong displeasure and firm opposition to
this, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that U.S. congressmen will, proceeding from the
fundamental interests of the people of both China and the United
States, do more things conducive to the further growth of Sino-U.S.
relations, not the other way round," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
On the Sino-Indian border issue, Sun said China hopes that the
Sino-Indian border issue will be properly settled through friendly
negotiations and on the basis of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
He said that the related issue is left over from history, and
that both sides have conducted 11 rounds of negotiations on the
issue.

<HEADLINE> China to Maintain Stable Monetary Policies: Dai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Dai Xianglong, governor of
China's central bank, has reiterated that China will keep stable
monetary policies this year to ensure a sustained growth of the
national economy, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, expected a least
14 percent growth in the broad money (M2) in 1999, Dai was quoted
as saying at a forum Monday.
</P>
<P>
China's money supply has increased steadily in the first
quarter this year with expanding foreign reserves and a stable
exchange rate of RMB yuan, marking a good opening for the
implementation of this year's monetary policies, Dai said in a
speech given at the ongoing '99 China Enterprise Summit.
</P>
<P>
The present active monetary policies have been adopted to
prevent deflation and financial irregularities amidst a sluggish
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, China's retail prices of commodities had
been falling for 18 months in a row.
</P>
<P>
China has already launched a series of monetary policies that
used financial leverages to stimulate domestic demand in the face
of the rough market situation.
</P>
<P>
To effectively implement the policies, China will attach more
importance to fiscal policies, such as issuance of treasury bonds,
and development of a capital market, which may change more
deposits into corporate capital, according to Dai.
</P>
<P>
Dai has also pledged to reduce the non-performing loans of
commercial banks markedly, develop a deposit insurance system for
local small and medium-sized financial institutions, and finish
regulation of non-bank financial institutions such as investment
and trust companies within two years.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Vice President Warns Against New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan has warned the United States against consequences of any
new aggression on Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The vice president warned that Washington would pay high price
if it launched new aggression against Iraq because Iraq was now on
a high degree of vigilance and alert.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said in an interview with Egyptian newspaper Al-Usbu
that he expected new U.S. aggression against Iraq at any moment,
said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four-night of air strikes on Iraq
last December to retaliate what they called Iraq's failure to
fully cooperate with United Nations arms inspectors in charge of
eliminating Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said the U.S. aggression would be existing "as long as
Iraq rejects Washington's resolutions" and called for the lifting
of the U.N. embargo in place since 1990 following Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He denied any form of dialog between Baghdad and Washington,
saying that Iraq has no objection in principle for conducting
serious and constructive dialog on condition that it should be
within the frame of joint interests and non-interference in Iraq's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The vice president further said that whatever flexibility Iraq
would show, what the U.S. was seeking is toppling the national
regime in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He denied reports that Iraq had made good offers to
U.S. companies to work inside Iraq in a bid to press the
U.S. government to change its policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan called on Arab countries to exert pressure on the
U.S. government.

<HEADLINE> GCC Petrochemical Output to Be Raised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf states are expected to
invest substantially in new petrochemical projects, with their
combined production projected to increase from 14 million tons in
1997 to 24 million tons annually over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"An estimated amount of 13 billion U.S. dollars will be
invested" by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states in improving
petrochemical output, Tuesday's Gulf News quoted a senior Dubai
government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
In GCC states, namely Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 75 percent of their
petrochemicals production is exported, as against 25 percent by
other producers, said Sultan bin Sulayem, chairman and managing
director of Dubai's Jebel ali Free Zone and Dubai Ports Authority.
</P>
<P>
"Since our industry is export-oriented, our production is set
to increase manifold over the next few years," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the vast oil and gas reserves of GCC states
are the major strength for their new petrochemical projects.
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia has taken the lead and we will maintain our
market share and match growth in global demand by stepping up
production and setting up new facilities," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Understanding the need for a strong petrochemical industry,
the UAE has announced plans to set up four petrochemical plants at
a total investment of about 2.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
With new projects coming up in the region, demand for shipping
and logistics support services will go up, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Russia Could Be Pulled Into Kosovo Conflict: Former Australian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Australian prime minister
Malcolm Fraser Tuesday warned that Russia could easily be pulled
into the Kosovo conflict, possibly supplying fuel and arms to the
Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
Fraser, who returned to Melbourne earlier Tuesday morning from
a trip to Yugoslavia as Australia's Special Envoy, said if ground
forces were used by the NATO alliance, Russia's attitude would be
"highly critical."
</P>
<P>
At its recent summit marking its 50th birthday anniversary,
NATO authorized an oil blockade against Yugoslavia, and French
President Jacques Chirac has expressed his concern that the
decision may put NATO in direct conflict with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Fraser made the comment at a press conference in Melbourne
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I think that if you really want to analyze the situation, to
look further ahead: if they (the Yugoslav forces) are running
short of fuel, would Russia allow them to run out of fuel?"
</P>
<P>
"If they're running short of ammunition, would Russia allow
them to run out of ammunition? "If they need more or better
ground-to-air missiles, you could so easily get a situation where
Russia is just pulled in even if Russia doesn't even want to be
pulled in," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said even though it was true Russia needed Western economic
support, history showed that issues of nationalism and old
alliances always won out over economic realities.
</P>
<P>
Fraser, who is also chairman of the non-governmental aid group
Care Australia, had been to Russia and Yugoslavia to seek the
release of two Care Australia "aid workers" who have been accused
of spying for NATO after being detained by Yugoslav authorities
late last month.
</P>
<P>
Despite his efforts, including talks with senior Yugoslav
officials, the former prime minister failed to persuade Yugoslavia
to release the two Australian "aid workers."

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Resume Military Drills with Arab States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will resume joint military
exercises with Arab countries which have been suspended since the
1990 Gulf crisis, the Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The drills will be conducted with troops from Egypt, Oman, the
United Arab Emirates and Yemen, the paper quoted Jordanian Field
Marshal Abdul Hafez Mira'I Kaabneh as saying.
</P>
<P>
The date for the joint military exercises has not been fixed,
but the war games will be conducted in Jordan and the territories
of the other involved states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the 1990 Gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, the Jordanian armed forces often carried out joint
military maneuvers, especially with member states of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
However, relations between Jordan and the GCC states, namely
Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain, soured
during the Gulf crisis because Amman was sympathetic with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Despite the political rifts and a halt to the joint military
exercises, senior military officers from the GCC countries
continued to visit Amman for training courses in Jordan`s military
institutions.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah Bin Hussein of Jordan went on full gear to mend
Jordan`s relations with the Gulf states after taking throne on
February 8, following his father King Hussein's death.
</P>
<P>
He normalized relations with Kuwait, which were severed during
the Gulf crisis. Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Ahmed Sabah had invited
Abdullah to visit his emirate.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah will be the first Jordanian ruler to visit Kuwait in
more than nine years after the Gulf crisis.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Promote Farm Produce Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
commercial city of Shanghai will take a series of measures to
enhance its farm produce exports.
</P>
<P>
It will mainly improve the product mix, with emphasis on
increasing production of specialties and environment-friendly food.
</P>
<P>
Advanced quality standards will be introduced from abroad for
agricultural production on the outskirts of the city, so as to
raise the quality of local products up to international levels.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will also encourage the non-public sector to
participate in exporting farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Mayor Feng Guoqin referred to the move as part of the
city's plan to open its agricultural sector in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
The city's annual export of agricultural products is only about
100 million U.S. dollars, accounting for less than 10 percent of
the city's total agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
That is not in proportion to the level of Shanghai's
agricultural development, Feng said.

<HEADLINE> China Concerned over Japan's Approval of Military Cooperation Act (Details Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China is deeply concerned about
the approval of relevant acts of the New Japan-U.S. Defense
Guidelines by the Lower House of the Japanese Diet, Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said at a regular press conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
In disregard of the strong concerns from China and other
surrounding countries, Japan passed relevant acts, which are aimed
to strengthen military cooperation between Japan and the United
States, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
At a time when both the regional and international situations
are moving towards relaxation, such a move goes against the
historical trend, and will have a new unstable and negative impact
on regional security, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Chinese Government has time and
again expounded its position on this issue to the Japanese side
through various channels, and the Japanese side has also in turn
made a series of commitments in this regard.
</P>
<P>
China demands that Japan strictly abide by its commitments by
taking practical actions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Japan will properly handle issues
concerning Taiwan by following the principles set forth in the
China-Japan Joint Declaration and the China-Japan Peace and
Friendship Treaty, and that it will not do anything that will
interfere in China's internal affairs and damage bilateral ties.

high-tech industrial estates.
</P>
<P>
Clark is a former U.S. military base in the Philippines while
Milpitas is one of the satellite cities in Silicon Valley which
hosts Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Sunb Micro Systems and other
computer giants.
</P>
<P>
According to PNA, Colayco cited the mission's importance not
only in the promotion of the Clark Special Economic Zone but also
in bringing to the Philippines opportunities for tech-transfer and
improvement of direct trade relations with Silicon Valley firms.
</P>
<P>
The trade mission from the famous California electronic capital
is the third business delegation brought to the Clark zone by
Mayor Manayan and Silicon Valley Marketing Management (SVMM), an
organization of Filipino-American businessmen based in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The first two trade missions have resulted in the signing of
business ventures for the Clark zone such as the high-end computer
animation and film colorization project by Tri-Advance Systems
from Milpitas and Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
Manayan said they "found Clark (zone) to be very conducive to
high-tech industrial projects."
</P>
<P>
Members of the trade mission said they were looking for a
partner in the Philippines in manufacturing and marketing for the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region catalytic
converters for motor vehicles, a device used in reducing vehicle
emission and increasing fuel efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Century-Old Cactus Survives Transplantation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A cactus that is at least 150
years old has survived a major transplantation more than one year
ago and has recently sent out new sprouts.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for such old tree to survive
transplantation in China, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The cactus, one of the oldest kept by man in China, is 2.1m
tall, 80cm in the widest part and 30cm in diameter in thickness at
the root. It now grows in the Potted Landscape Garden at the venue
of the '99 International Horticultural Exposition in the
northeastern suburbs of Kunming.
</P>
<P>
The first world expo China has ever hosted, the horticultural
exposition is scheduled to start on May 1 this year in Kunming and
last through October.
</P>
<P>
Looking like a grimacing tiger head or a weird palm-leaf fan,
the cactus formerly belonged to Dai Zhijian, a retired worker in
Fengqing County some 600 kilometers away from Kunming.
</P>
<P>
According to Dai, the cactus was discovered and taken home by
his great-grandmother when she was picking tea in the mountains.
It was then only 50cm in height. It has since been under
meticulous care of the family for five generations or for more
than 150 years.
</P>
<P>
"When my family learned that Kunming would host a horticultural
exposition, we decided to donate the old plant to the garden gala,
" Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the "old age" of the plant made the chance of survival
extremely slim. After one year of waiting, some gardeners at the
exposition venue lost patience and declared the plant's death and
planned to remove it from the garden.
</P>
<P>
But, to their great surprise, fresh sprouts started to burst
out several days ago. Botanists say that this indicates the plant
has survived the transplantation and can become robust again soon.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that nearly 400,000 trees and shrubs of some 3,
000 species have to date been transplanted to the horticultural
exposition venue. Many of them are rare or precious species
donated by residents and units across Yunnan.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai To Host Market-Oriented Arts Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is to stage China's
first international art festival to be run on a commercial basis
between November 1 and December 1, which will feature thirty major
performances by both domestic and foreign drama, dance and music
troupes.
</P>
<P>
Co-supported by the Ministry of Culture and Shanghai Municipal
Government, the Shanghai International Art Festival will feature
foreign symphony orchestras, ballet and opera companies, drama and
musicals with a wide range of Chinese artists also taking part.
</P>
<P>
"The arts festival is to be run as a business enterprise and
the Ministry of Culture and Shanghai Municipal Government will not
invest even a cent," said Zhou Muyao, Vice-Mayor of Shanghai, in a
news release today.
</P>
<P>
Invitations to artistic organizations and the box office
management will be controlled by agents and intermediary companies
who will compete to win the business and be responsible for either
profits or losses, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
A three day art exhibition will also be held during the
festival and many cultural agents worldwide will be invited with
the hope of promoting future cultural trade between China and the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Already a number of foreign artistic groups have registered to
attend, including the BBC's Welsh Orchestra and the prestigious
Royal Opera House from the UK along with the French National
Orchestra and the Franz Harary conjuring team from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a one week long African art exhibition will also be
held during the event.
</P>
<P>
As the largest commercial city in China, Shanghai believes it
is mature enough to host a festival on such a scale in terms of
its economic and cultural strength. According to Li Yuanchao,
China's Vice Minister of Culture, Shanghai can hold a one-month
international arts festival annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The fact that some U.S.
congressmen wrote to Lee Teng-hui reaffirming commitment to the
Taiwan Relation Act, has gravely violated the three Sino-U.S.
joint communiques and wantonly interfered in China's internal
affairs, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Sun made the remarks when asked to comment on the matter at a
press conference, saying that China has expressed strong
displeasure and firm opposition.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that U.S. congressmen will, proceeding from the
fundamental interest of the people of both China and the United
States, do things conducive to the further growth of Sino-U.S.
relations, not the other way round," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Taiwan Relation Act, which aims to "
legalize" the U.S. move to interfere in China's internal affairs
by making use of the Taiwan issue, gravely violates the principles
of the Sino-U.S. joint communique on the establishment of
diplomatic relations. The Chinese government and people have
always expressed firm opposition to this.
</P>
<P>
Sun reiterated that the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of
China and no foreign countries are allowed to interfere in it.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Review Telecommunications Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will review
the Communications Act 1998 and make necessary policy changes to
ensure its telecommunications infrastructure sufficient for
future economic growth, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's postal and telecommunications reform program aims at
encouraging private sector investment to facilitate rapid network
expansion, said Stanley Murage, Permanent Secretary of the
Transport and Telecommunications Ministry on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Murage urged the experts at a seminar on telecommunications to
amend or formulate regulations that stimulate competition and
growth of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted Murage as saying that
the government recognizes that an efficient communications
infrastructure is absolutely vital to a growing economy.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications liberalization process of the east
African country was kicked off last week when a regulatory body
was created from the former giant Kenya Postal and
Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) while the rest part of the
KPTC was disintegrated into two independent companies.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has planned to expand the
telecommunication network to 2.7 million lines by the year 2015
at an estimated cost of 323 billion shillings (about five billion
U.S. dollars) in its zeal for industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The east African country has a network of 290,000 telephone
lines for a population of 30 million with one line serving 100
Kenyans.

<HEADLINE> PLO Central Council Begin Discussing Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Central Council started its discussions here
Tuesday on the issue of the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat presided over the meeting,
which was held at the Presidential Office and attended by over 100
council members. The council has 124 members.
</P>
<P>
As invited, a delegation of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) headed by its spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin
attended the meeting as observers. Representatives from other
Palestinian political factions also took part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting's main topic is whether Arafat would
announce the formation of an independent Palestinian state in the
teritories on May 4 this year, when the five-year Palestinian
self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo
Accords.
</P>
<P>
As the meeting is in progress, hundreds of Palestinians from
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are
demonstrating in front of the office, urging the council and
Arafat not to postpone the declaration of statehood on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo
principles, he has the right to declare an independent
Palestinian state on that date. For this purpose, he traveled
recently to many countries to seek their support and advise over
this matter.
</P>
<P>
But Israel opposes this idea, threatening to annex parts of
the West Bank territories now under its control.
</P>
<P>
The United States, seeking to persuade the Palestinians not to
declare a state, urged on Monday again Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) not to take unilateral actions but set
themselves a new target of agreeing on a permanent settlement
within in a year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday officially sent a letter
to Arafat, in which he once again asked Arafat to cancel the
announcement of a state on May 4 and stressed the U.S. would help
move the peace process forward after Israel's May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Backing up Clinton's call, the White House issued a statement
the same day, promising to facilitate that process, to bring
Israeli and Palestinian leaders together within six month after
Israeli elections to review the status of their efforts and to
help reach an agreement.

<HEADLINE> PLO Central Council Begins Discussing Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Central Council started its discussions here
Tuesday on the issue of the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat presided over the meeting,
which was held at the Presidential Office and attended by over 100
council members. The council has 124 members.
</P>
<P>
As invited, a delegation of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) headed by its spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin
attended the meeting as observers. Representatives from other
Palestinian political factions also took part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting's main topic is whether Arafat would
announce the formation of an independent Palestinian state in the
teritories on May 4 this year, when the five-year Palestinian
self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo
Accords.
</P>
<P>
As the meeting is in progress, hundreds of Palestinians from
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are
demonstrating in front of the office, urging the council and
Arafat not to postpone the declaration of statehood on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo
principles, he has the right to declare an independent
Palestinian state on that date. For this purpose, he traveled
recently to many countries to seek their support and advise over
this matter.
</P>
<P>
But Israel opposes this idea, threatening to annex parts of
the West Bank territories now under its control.
</P>
<P>
The United States, seeking to persuade the Palestinians not to
declare a state, urged on Monday again Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) not to take unilateral actions but set
themselves a new target of agreeing on a permanent settlement
within in a year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday officially sent a letter
to Arafat, in which he once again asked Arafat to cancel the
announcement of a state on May 4 and stressed the U.S. would help
move the peace process forward after Israel's May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Backing up Clinton's call, the White House issued a statement
the same day, promising to facilitate that process, to bring
Israeli and Palestinian leaders together within six month after
Israeli elections to review the status of their efforts and to
help reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how long the council meeting would take, but
the whole world, particularly the United States and Israel, are
anxiously to see what decision the council would make on the
statehood issue.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Local Governments to Determine Pay Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
leave it to the local governments to decide whether to grant pay
increases to workers to help them cope with the rising costs of
living, especially after the oil price hike, Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said a nationally mandated uniform wage hike is unlikely
because of the different needs of workers in every region.
</P>
<P>
"We have to find out the situation in the different regions. We
don't want workers in some regions to get higher wages compared to
workers in other areas," Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He said the cost of living, a key factor in determining wage
increases, varies depending on where a worker resides.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said a wage hike
by May 1 is not likely, but added that the government is now
studying non-wage benefits for workers.
</P>
<P>
Zamora reiterated that the national government has to consider
the plight of non-union members and the jobless as well in any
move to adjust wages.
</P>
<P>
He raised concern that a wage hike now may trigger a rise in
the prices of basic commodities, a situation he said would
adversely affect the jobless and negate the positive effect of pay
increases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary Bienvinido Laguesma of the Department of
Labor and Employment said that while labor groups are calling for
another round of wage increases to cope with the recent increase
in oil prices, many businesses are not in a position to grant
this.
</P>
<P>
The minimum wage in Metro Manila is 198 pesos (4.95 U.S.
dollars) a day. Labor groups say the sum is no longer enough to
sustain the daily needs of workers and their families.

<HEADLINE> China, EU Resume Group Talks for Second Day (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua)-- China and the European Union (EU)
resumed group talks on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) for a second day here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The group negotiation in the morning focused on the tariffs on
goods trade, and in the afternoon on service trade, according to a
source at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (
MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks between China and the EU started
here Monday morning, before negotiations between China and the U.S.
on the remaining issues concerning China's accession to the WTO
concluded. The China-EU talks are expected to last for one week.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, Long Yongtu, chief representative of
negotiation of the MOFTEC, and Gerard Depayre, deputy director-
general of Directorate General 1 of EC, held one-hour small group
and closed-door talks. They reached consensus on the procedure and
contents of the current round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Depayre Monday, Long told Xinhua that
China is prepared to make the "utmost efforts" to push forward
negotiations with the EU and will strive to achieve important
progress as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Long said China attaches great importance to its negotiations
with the EU and other members of WTO on China's accession to the
multi-lateral trade body.
</P>
<P>
Long also promised that China will strictly abide by the
fundamental principle of the WTO, namely, the Most Favored Nation
treatment.
</P>
<P>
According to the top Chinese negotiator, the European side has
expressed "firm support" for China's entry into WTO within the
year 1999.

Meanwhile Director-General Renato Ruggiero of WTO said he had
found "encouraging signs" since Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
visited Washington recently and that he believed China could join
the body before November, according to the International Herald
Tribune published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I think that since the visit by China's prime minister there
have been many encouraging signs and I believe we can have China
in the WTO by November, when the WTO begins its next trade round
in agriculture, services and electronic commerce," he told the
newspaper's Monday edition.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Chinese and U.S. negotiators concluded the
latest round of talks on the lingering issues regarding China's
accession to the WTO. "The two sides have made pragmatic and
earnest efforts," according to Long.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States conducted the latest round of talks
last Thursday and Friday, which covered topics of the legal terms
for China's entry into WTO, tariffs on industrial goods and
service sector, including finance, insurance and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said that the last-phase of a negotiation is often
the most difficult, but they have "agreed to continue their
efforts to solve all the remaining issues so as to reach an
agreement at an earlier date," Long said.
</P>
<P>
The time for the next round of negotiations will be discussed
and announced by the two sides later.

WELLINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley Tuesday accepted Murray McCully's resignation from
tourism portfolio.
</P>
<P>
McCully has been criticized these days for his approval of an
unlawful payment of 340,000 NZ dollars (184,000 U.S. dollars) to
former chairman Bryan Mogridge and former deputy chairman Michael
Wall of New Zealand's Tourism Board when they quit the Board last
year after falling out with McCully.

According to a media release from the Prime Minister's Office,
McCully will remain Minister for Sport, Fitness and Leisure and
Minister for Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance.

<P>
Minister for International Trade Lockwood Smith, who is
currently on a tour of the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Turkey and
Saudi Arabia, has been appointed as Minister of Tourism.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Soybean Milk Becomes One of Chinese's Major Healthy Drinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A survey covering 12 major
Chinese cities indicates that 55.3 percent of their residents have
consumed milky drinks in the past one year, 25.5 percent of whom
have had soybean milk.
</P>
<P>
Health experts say that soybean milk has become one of Chinese
people's major healthy drinks, together with fresh milk and yogurt
</P>
<P>
Soybean milk was introduced into China in the early 1980s and
attracted more and more Chinese consumers.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that soybean was accepted so quickly by Chinese
people because of two factors: firstly most Chinese people hadn't
formed a habit of drinking milk and the other is that Chinese
people have a tradition of drinking soybean juice.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's current annual soybean milk
production has reached over 40,000 tons, with the Weiwei Group in
east China's Jiangsu Province, Liyuan Group in east China's
Shandong Province and the Heilongjiang Soybean Food Company as the
top three producers.
</P>
<P>
China's soybean milk producer are also engaged in offering new
products. For example, the Shandong Liyuan Group took the lead in
adding some other nutritional elements, such as fruit and
vegetable juice to their soybean milk.
</P>
<P>
And the group provided new products in 1998 especially for
infants and patients suffering a lack of calcium and affected by
diabetes.

<HEADLINE> WB Urges Manila to Adopt Clear Infrastructure Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has urged the
Philippine government to adopt policy reform measures that would
encourage private sector initiatives in infrastructure
development.
</P>
<P>
The measures, forming part of the Philippine Country Framework
Report of the WB, were discussed recently during a consultation
meeting of the Cabinet-level infrastructure coordination committee
at the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).
</P>
<P>
The WB has recommended the inclusion in the country's Medium
term Development Plan (MTDP) for 1999 to 2004 specific provisions
that would spell out how private firms could go about with their
financial investments in public sector infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Philippine government said the WB wants the
government to lay down specific rules that will govern private
sector participation in infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is part of a multi-sectoral task
force, which is drafting the MTDP for the government.
</P>
<P>
The WB accounts for 2.34 billion U.S. dollars, or 23 percent of
the Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) extended to the country,
which in 1998 amounted to 10.17 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President on Middle-East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
said here today that he is "optimistic" about the future of the
Middle-East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I think we will move forward and finalize (the peace process),
" he said. "Whoever will be elected as the prime minister (in the
upcoming Israeli election), he will have no alternative but to
pursue the peace process."
</P>
<P>
On the current situation in the Middle East, he said: "Let's
underline the good things that have happened in the past 20 years.
"
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the current relations between
Israel and Egypt are "not as good as they should be", but "are
much better than they were in 1976." And in 1977, the Egyptian
President Mohamed Anwar Sadat, who is a "brave man", started the
peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, "We can talk (with Egyptians) on the
telephone, fly to Egypt, cross the Suez Canal and walk on the
streets of Cairo."
</P>
<P>
He cited the situation along the Israel's borders with Jordan
and Egypt as "quiet", and the border with Palestine as "much
quieter" than it was before.
</P>
<P>
He said that the wars and military conflicts between Israeli
and Arab countries not only led to the loss of life on both sides,
but also caused "bad feelings" that can not be eliminated even in
20 years.
</P>
<P>
On the establishment of the Palestine State, he said that he
hoped all problems would be solved when the talks between Israel
and Palestine resumed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China is deeply concerned over
the approval of relevant acts of the New Japan-U.S. Defense
Guidelines by the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet,
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said at a regular press
conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan's adoption of relevant acts, regardless of
the strong concerns of China and other neighboring nations, is
aimed to strengthen the military cooperation between Japan and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"It runs against the trend of the times, and will bring a new
unstable factor and a negative impact to the security of the
region," Sun said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expects International Initiative This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has said he expects to see an initiative on the Cyprus
issue backed by the United Nations, the United States and European
Union (EU) "at the beginning of September at the latest."
</P>
<P>
In a televised press conference Monday night, Clerides
reiterated his readiness to go to the negotiating table without
preconditions, saying the relative U.N. resolutions have laid out
the basis for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the talks will be convened by U.N
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the G8, comprising the U.S.,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash was
setting preconditions by demanding the recognition of his
self-styled regime in the north of the island, the withdrawal of
Cyprus' application for EU accession and confederation as the only
viable solution.
</P>
<P>
He said all preconditions set by Denktash are contrary to
relative U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island, but
the peace talks between the two sides have been stalled since
summer in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Innovative Medicine Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An international conference to
discuss innovative therapies based on the integration of modern
and traditional medicines opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The first World Conference on Innovative Integrated Medicine
provides an opportunity for domestic and overseas experts to
exchange and discuss the latest discoveries, new technology and
new findings of medical research in fields like cardio and
cerebral vascular illnesses, cancer, infectious diseases and
genetic diseases, according to Qian Xinzhong, the conference
chairman.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for China, which has a thousand-year-long
history of using traditional medicines, to hold such an event as
medical treatment is entering a new era with the rapid growth of
life sciences," Qian said at the opening ceremony of the event,
which has been organized by the Chinese Health Care Association on
Aging.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed the importance of geriatric research, saying that
as human life expectancy is being prolonged, any new research
findings to better the health care of older persons should be a
key part of medical innovation.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 Chinese scientists and their counterparts from
the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, India and other
countries will hold seminars on genetic engineering, new therapies,
geriatrics, rehabilitation research, and the modernization of
traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
The three-day event would invite a group of experts to deliver
keynote speeches on topics such as clinical research of diabetes
and the Alzheimer's disease, the treatment of ischemic strokes by
using traditional Chinese medicine, and Internet-based development
of medical science in China.

<HEADLINE> Rare Ancient Tree Species Rescued from Extinction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese horticulturists have
succeeded in multiplying a rare species of tree that dates back to
140 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Now the population of the tree has grown from the original
seven to 140 and three of them have been moved to the Tree
Exhibition Area of the '99 Kunming International Horticulture
Exposition scheduled to open on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Known as living fossil of the Jurassic period, the species is
called manglietiastrum sinicum law, belonging to the Magnolia
family.
</P>
<P>
According to botanists, it is the only species of the only
genus left from the Jurassic period. The Chinese name "Hua Gai"
comes from its massive crown, which resembles the canopy of the
gorgeous carriage of ancient kings or emperors.
</P>
<P>
With straight and smooth trunk and fragrant flowers, the tree
is of high value for studying ancient plants, for use as timber
and for beautifying the environment.
</P>
<P>
The seven trees of the protospecies are scattered among the
evergreen broadleaf forests in western Yunnan, all standing about
40 meters. Local people call it "satin tree" for its fine texture
and the light green color that shines like satin. It is a valuable
material for making high-grade furniture, carvings and other
artistic works.
</P>
<P>
Geological changes and deteriorating forest ecology have
weakened the propagation ability of the species and the hard nut
of the tree has made it difficult for itself to crack and
germinate. It was observed that there is no new natural sampling
of the tree in a decade, according to botanists.

They collected seeds in September and October every year,
treated them to obtain pure seeds and stored them in wet sand,
sowed the seed in February the following year and moved the young
sprouts to containers for artificial cultivation before being
moved to hillsides for wild cultivation. There are now three
migrant cultivation points in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
"We have basically mastered the techniques for artificial
breeding of the species," said Zhang Maoqin, a forestry researcher
in Yunnan who is working at the Expo site. "The survival rate has
reached 85 percent to 90 percent."
</P>
<P>
But the seeds used for artificial breeding can only come from
the protospecies and it is very difficult to collect the seeds
from the 40-meter tall trees. "We have to hire local crack tree-
climbers to collect the seeds for us," Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
The artificial breeding of the species is still in the primary
stage, according to Zhang. There is no record of the growth and
development of the species under the natural conditions. It is
already 12 years since artificial breeding began, yet none has
been found flowering or bearing fruit. The flowering age of the
tree remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
Now, Chinese botanists are experimenting with cutting
propagation. Results show that the samplings are strong, but the
survival rate is low. "It is a good beginning," Zhang said. "It
has laid a sound foundation for further exploration."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loans Aid North China Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The economy of North China's
Shanxi province has benefited from a total amount of nearly 800
million U.S. dollars in loans from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The 18 projects carried out with World Bank loans have involved
many sectors including highway construction, water diversion works,
environmental protection, and educational and medical development
in mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The largest loan worth 400 million U.S. dollars in the Yellow
River diversion project will alleviate the province's low level
economic development due to the lack of water resources.
</P>
<P>
And a project involving water and soil conservancy on the Loess
Highlands with loans of 40 million U.S. dollars from the World
Bank which began in 1994 had by the end of 1998 helped cultivate
71,355 hectares of farmland, or 74.1 percent of the planned total,
yielding both economic and ecological returns.
</P>
<P>
The project has so far increased the per capita grain yield
from 374 to 548 kilograms, and the per capita income of rural
residents from 300 to 600 yuan while also boosting the forest
coverage rate in the area from 19 to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The second stage of the project, headed by the Ministry of
Water Resources, is now under way. The ministry is to help assist
northwest China's Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, and north China's
Shanxi province, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in
dealing with water and soil erosion and land cultivation, which
will benefit 603,000 rural people.
</P>
<P>
Official with the ministry noted that the large project
includes farmland development, vegetation and fruit cultivation,
and small sized water conservancy construction, 12 projects, and
related support services.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's Shanxi anti-poverty project has been ongoing
since August 1995 and has received over 34 million U.S. dollars
from the Bank, helping to provide drinking water for 280,000 rural
people in 330 villages.

<HEADLINE> Marbury's 20 Assists Sunday Tops in NBA This Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- New Jersey's Stephon Marbury
had a game to remember Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
He scored 26 points and recorded an NBA season-high 20 assists

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, nustralian Leaders Discuss E. Timor Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
and Australian Prime Minister John Howard discussed the East Timor
issue in Nusa Dua, Bali, on Tuesday, Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 90-minutes tete-a-tete talk was followed by a meeting
between the Indonesian head of state and his ministers, and a
meeting between the Australian leader and his ministers, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Habibie was accompanied by Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas, Minister for Defense and Security/Armed Forces
Commander Gen. Wiranto, State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung.
Howard was accompanied by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and
Defense Minister John Moore.
</P>
<P>
The parallel meetings were not scheduled before.
</P>
<P>
Howard arrived in the Bali's tourist resort on Monday evening
while Habibie's party arrived after the Australian entourage.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the summit signaled not only Australia's
increasing concern about the situation in East Timor, but also
domestic and international pressures for Canberra to help share
the burden amid signs of a possible breakthrough that would
finally settle the East Timor problem.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975
and became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the United Nations
never recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government announced in January this year that
it is ready to release East Timor if the alternative to provide
wider autonomy is refused by the people in the region and the
international community. A U.N.-supervised vote on the East Timor
future was also decided to be held in July this year.
</P>
<P>
However, violence between pro-integration groups and
anti-integration groups in the territory escalated since the
announcement of the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the warring factions signed an agreement to end
hostilities and increased tension in the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
Howard said Monday Australia would be pushing for a peaceful
end to the violence rocking East Timor when it goes into talks
with the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
Antara said the two leaders are scheduled to hold a joint press
conference after the parallel meetings.

<HEADLINE> Africa's HIV/AIDS Rate Highest in World: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Infection rate of HIV/AIDS in
Africa, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, is the highest in the
world, according to a World Bank report.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled World Development Indicators 1999, was
issued by the World Bank Monday and it showed that the rampant
spreading of the pandemic has cut life expectancies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Stiglitz, the bank's senior economist, said in his
keynote speech: "In sub-Saharan Africa ten countries have seen
life expectancies decrease over the past two decades, and in many
of these the rate of HIV/AIDS infection exceeds. In 11 African
countries, HIV infection rates exceed ten percent of the adult
population."
</P>
<P>
A press release from the international financial institution
said adult mortality rates have risen dramatically in some African
countries due to HIV/AIDS.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson will not make up
his mind to go on his boxing until after his release from a
Maryland jail, his manager said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no definitive timetable for Mike to be back in the
ring anytime soon," manager Shelley Finkel said. "Our immediate
concerns are for him to be back with his family where he belongs."
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old former heavyweight champion is serving a one-
year sentence after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor assault
charges in connection with a minor traffic accident last August.
</P>
<P>
He must still serve 60 days for violating probation for a 1992
rape conviction in Indiana and the earliest he can get out is in
June.
</P>
<P>
"After Mike's release we will sit down and discuss his boxing
future," Finkel said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's last fight was on January 16, when he knocked out
Francois Botha in the fifth round in Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> Intel Chief Foresees Leadership Role for HK IT Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- President of Intel Corporation
Craig Barrett said here Tuesday that Hong Kong has opportunities
to make itself a Asia Pacific Internet hub, thus playing a
leadership role in information technology.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an engineering faculty of the Hong Kong University,
Barrett said Hong Kong can build itself into an Asia Pacific
Internet traffic hub, an Internet content hub and an online
financial services hub.
</P>
<P>
These opportunities of Hong Kong come from the city's advantage
in telecommunications infrastructures, bilingual portal access,
productive movie industry and regional financial center status, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, Hong Kong faces challenges that include
insufficient bandwidth, economic slowdown and piracy.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Hong Kong re-invent its Internet content with
digital technology and bring in innovation in electronic commerce
solutions.
</P>
<P>
Intel, which plans to produce chips running at giga hertz level
by the end of next year, now alone occupies 256-mega hertz
bandwidth while Hong Kong has a total of 243 mega hertz, ranking
third in Asia next to the Republic of Korea and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Barrett also predicted that the volume of Internet economy will
be booming in the next few years and reach 1 trillion U.S. dollars
by the year 2002. He added that the Asia Pacific region will play
an aggressive role in this development.
</P>
<P>
Barrett is now on a five-day tour that will also take him to
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan.

<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 7,600 computers were
damaged by the destructive CIH virus in China yesterday, causing
huge economic losses yet to be determined.

Although many computer users have already had anti-CIH software,
they failed to initiate it, while many others were simply not

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Nuclear Power Plant Receives ISO "Greencard" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Guangdong Nuclear Power
Joint Operations Co. Ltd. was granted yesterday an ISO14001
authenticated card, to make itself the first nuclear power company
in China to pass the ISO's certification, which is an
international environmental approval body.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of four billion US dollars, the Sino-
French joint venture operates two one million-kilowatt nuclear
generating units in Daya Bay Nuke in Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province, which is China's first nuclear power plant
using overseas funds for construction.
</P>
<P>
It has taken two years for the plant to meet all the
environmental requirements of the International Standard
Organization (ISO).
</P>
<P>
The ISO report shows that during the five years of operation,
the nuclear plant has used advanced treatment techniques to
control waste discharges. The environment near the plant has
remained as intact as before the operation started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Daya Bay plant had generated 59.8 billion kwh of
electricity for the power grid of Guangdong and Hong Kong by last
October earning 3.35 billion U.S. dollars and has paid back 51
percent of its loans.

<HEADLINE> No Plan to Hike Prices: Philippine Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government assured
the public Tuesday that it has no plans to increase the prices of
rice sold by the National Food Authority (NFA) despite the recent
oil price increase.
</P>
<P>
A ranking official from the NFA said in a radio program that it
had no plan to increase the price of the staple sold in NFA
outlets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary Jose Pardo of the Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) said initial results of surveys made by DTI price
monitoring teams showed that prices of basic commodities remain
stable.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said retailers appear to have recognized that they have
to be responsible and maintain good relations with consumers.
</P>
<P>
Pardo also said the government will soon auction to private
traders the right to import sugar to augment the 70,000 metric
tons it now has in stock.
</P>
<P>
"We are making sure that there will be no sharp increases in
sugar prices like what happened last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pardo reiterated that the DTI is still keeping tabs on the
prices of basic commodities to ensure that traders do not exploit
the recent oil price increase made by big oil firms.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' three biggest oil companies increased their
oil prices by 43 centavos (1.075 U.S. cents) to 50 centavos (1.25
U.S. cents) last week.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (55) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 55 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Can the MSAR continue to participate in any relevant
international organizations and international meetings?
</P>
<P>
Macao is already a member of a number of international
organizations such as the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International
Labor Organization and the International Red Cross, etc.
</P>
<P>
It has frequently participated in international meetings
concerning economic and cultural matters.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 137 of the Basic Law, the MSAR may continue its
membership in the appropriate international organizations and
participate in international meetings.
</P>
<P>
However, its membership and participation shall be conditional
on non-sovereign status. For example, it can not join any
political and military international organizations composed of
sovereign states or participate in any such international meetings
attended by sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
To be specific, the following rules must be observed:
</P>
<P>
The Government of the MSAR may dispatch representatives to
participate, as members of delegations of the People's Republic of
China, in international organizations or conferences in the fields
affecting the Region, organizations or conferences whose
participation is limited to states. Or its representatives may
attend in such other capacity as may be permitted by the Central
People's Government and the international organizations or
conferences concerned. They may express their views, using the
name of Macao, China
</P>
<P>
The appropriate fields here refer to economic, trade, banking,
shipping, communications, tourism cultural, scientific and
technological, sports and a number of others. As for the capacity
as may be permitted by the Central People's Government and the
international organizations or conferences concerned, they will be
decided in the light of the specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the International Maritime Organization is an
inter-governmental organization. According to the Constitution of
the organization, it has members and associate members. Any
territory under the jurisdiction of a sovereign state may become
an associate member of the organization provided that the
sovereign state concerned gives its consent to it and that the
territory concerned completes the necessary procedures for
obtaining this status.
</P>
<P>
Macao has now become a separate associate member of the
International Maritime Organization in the name of Macao, with the
consent of both the governments of China and Portugal. The MSAR
may, after its return to China, continue to be an associate member
of that organization in the name of "Macao, China", a capacity
that both the Government of the People's Republic of China and the
International Maritime Organization permit.
</P>
<P>
The MSAR may participate, in the name of "Macao, China", in all
those international organizations and conferences which do not
require statehood for participation.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Macao's membership in those international
organizations which both China and Macao have joined, the Central
People's Government will work out a way to enable the MSAR to
remain in them in an appropriate form in the light of the actual
conditions and needs of the latter.
</P>
<P>
As for Macao's membership in those international organizations
which China has not yet participated in while Macao has already
joined, the Central People's Government will work out a way to
enable the MSAR to remain in them in an appropriate form in the
light of the actual conditions and needs.

<P>
YINCHUAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- With the help of the air force
of Guangzhou Military Area Command of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region successfully
launched a massive artificial rainfall program in the arid
southern part of the region recently.
</P>
<P>
After a plane sprayed silver iodide acetone on thick cloud
layers, rain fell in Xihaigu around the Liupan Mountain. Yinchuan,
the regional capital which had received no rain for more than 150
days, also had a heavy shower.
</P>
<P>
A meteorologist estimated that 10,000 sq. km of area in Ningxia
had received an average precipitation of 10 mm. of rainfall. It
will benefit the growth of maize, oil-bearing crops and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
Some 1 million Muslims live in the southern part of Ningxia. An
unusually long dry spell, which lasted for three seasons since
last September, withered up winter wheat on large tracts of land
and created a shortage of drinking water for both local residents
and livestock.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States Monday urged Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to set themselves a new target of
agreeing on a permanent settlement within a year. In response,
Israeli officials stressed that the U.S. pronouncements are
"noting new," while a statement from the Palestinian leadership
said PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat found the U.S. stand "positive."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Three activists of Islamic militant group Hamas who
reportedly were involved in the 1996 suicide bombings in Israel,
causing the deaths of 58 people, were released from a Gaza prison
last week on the orders of PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat. The
three were arrested by the PNA in April 1996 and had been
detained since then without trial.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Central Council of the Palestine Liberation Organization
will meet in Gaza on Tuesday to discuss when the Palestinians
should declare statehood. Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin announced on Monday that he will attend the meeting with a
Hamas delegation, acting as "observers."

<HEADLINE> China's Color TV Price War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Two major Chinese color TV
producers have been forced to cut their retail price to compete
with a price reduction made by China's best selling brand of
Changhong.
</P>
<P>
The Changhong Group triggered the price war earlier this month
by chopping 10 percent of its retail price, which means 50 yuan to
800 yuan per unit price reduction on a wide range of TV models.
</P>
<P>
This led to Konka and Skyworth's even sharper adjustment of the
market price. Konka has responded by slashing prices between 100
yuan to 1,500 yuan, while the price of Skyworth TVs was cut by 18
percent. Another large color TV producer TCL is planning a similar
move.
</P>
<P>
This is Changhong's second price cut. The first in 1996 was
made to ensure its safe lead and also kick start the first price
war in the domestic color TV market. At that time, Changhong was
congratulated because it helped expand the market share of
domestic producers by a large margin, compared with a sharp dive
of the sale volumes of imported brands.
</P>
<P>
The second discount strategy has not yet brought any comment
from government officials, but it has been thought to be related
with its expanding inventory.
</P>
<P>
China's color TV manufacturers are turning out more color TV
sets than can be sold right now. Last year, some 32 million color
TV sets were produced.
</P>
<P>
However, there are currently 200 million people in China's
remote areas who do not watch TV, and only 30 percent of the rural
population who have color TV sets. The price cut is good tidings
for many of those who thought they could not afford one.
</P>
<P>
But, for many small-sized color TV producers, the price war
could be another blow like that of 1996 when many were squeezed
out of the market.
</P>
<P>
It has also vexed the national revenue. Last year, the state
coffers recorded a loss of 5 billion yuan in tax revenue, because
of the price cutting competition among domestic color TV producers.
The State Development Planning Commission is now drawing up a new
regulation to focus on discount criteria for the color TV market.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Gv't Approves Draft Privatization Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
approved a draft privatization policy designed to facilitate the
hand-over of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The draft policy, endorsed by the weekly cabinet meeting on
Monday, also created scope for punishing those violating terms of
agreements after taking over the SOEs, The Daily Star newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If someone fails to fulfill conditions, the government would
take back the enterprise concerned," Commerce and Industries
Minister Tofail Ahmed was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The government would very soon enact laws in line with the
policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Board, set up in 1993 to privatize the
loss-making SOEs, drafted the law and submitted it to the
government last year seeking a well-defined and more powerful
authority to quickly do away with the SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft policy, a 15-member commission would be set up
to replace the existing board, which would comprise six members of
parliament, five ex-officio members, two full-time members, one
chairman and a representative from a professional group to be
nominated by the government. The ex-officio members included the
industries secretary, the commerce secretary and the finance
secretary.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which "will have rule-making power and the
authority to decide independently," would estimate the assets and
liabilities of the SOEs to be privatized, scrutinize tenders and
take necessary measures to hand-over the industrial unites.
</P>
<P>
The proposed commission would have the authority to directly
sell out an enterprise worth up to 250 million taka (5.2 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
At present, the Privatization Board cannot of its own sell or
off-load shares of any enterprise of whatever price without
permission from the prime minister whose office oversees the
board.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the government planned to privatize 51 of
SOEs this year.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300 SOEs in the country, with a total value of
output accounting for about 6 percent of the gross domestic
product and incurring a loss of about 568 million U.S. dollars
every year.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Board has handed over a total of 17 SOEs to
private entrepreneurs since 1993, with 12 of them up to 1996 and
five in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang Modernizes State Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province will upgrade 80 percent of its outmoded tractors and
harvesters as well as a great number of auxiliary farm machines in
state farms and land reclamation zones over the next five or six
years.
</P>
<P>
This will cost about 600 million U.S. dollars, said Zhang
Xiangyuan, a senior official of the Heilongjiang Provincial
Administration of State Farms and Land Reclamation.
</P>
<P>
And the upgrading program was kicked off with the recent
arrival in Dalian, a port city of northeast China's Liaoning
Province, of a number of tractors imported from the Fiat-
Newholland company, which have a value of two billion Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The delivery is just part of the administration's massive
international purchasing policy which will partly be covered by
Japanese Government loans to China worth 17 billion Japanese yen,
said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a large amount of agricultural
equipment will be bought to modernize two of the administration's
large state farms.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang Provincial Administration of State Farms and Land
Reclamation administers 103 farms, the largest number in the
country, which incorporate two million hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
And 85 percent of the work is done by machines and 80 percent
of the grain they produce sold on the open market. Last year, the
administration harvested 17 million tons of grain.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Italy Warns of Ecological Disaster After NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace Italy said Monday that
NATO's bombings on Yugoslavia would inflict serious and long-term
pollution on the biosphere in the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
The group said at a meeting here that a great deal of harmful
gases were emitted to the air after Yugoslavia's chemical plants
and oil refineries were hit by NATO bombs, with initial influence
only on surrounding districts, which, however, would contaminate a
considerably large area including the Adriatic Sea in the long run.
</P>
<P>
The all-pervasive gases could lead to disastrous results, even
at very small amounts, and would be quick to spread.
</P>
<P>
The group said that harmful substances, released to the air
after the bombings of the chemical plants and oil refineries,
would go into rains, rivers and sea, polluting drinking water and
sea food, which would lead to an increase of diseases including
cancer.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the escalation of the war in Yugoslavia would
cause many weapon wrecks to fall into the Adriatic Sea, posing a
great danger to navigation in a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
In case of bombings on Yugoslavia's power plants, the
catastrophe would not be restricted to the Adriatic region alone,
but would have a long-term impact on entire Europe, the group
warned.

<HEADLINE> Namibian President Says Africa Is Land of Promise, Opportunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The world today is increasingly
seeing Africa as "a continent of promise and opportunity" despite
a general sense of pessimism in the United States, visiting
Namibian President Sam Nujoma said here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to 750 representatives from businesses and governments
of both Africa and the United States, Nujoma said, "
Notwithstanding the general sense of Afro-pessimism in this
country and other developed countries, Africa is increasingly
being recognized as a continent of great promise and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"Our continent and the Southern African region, in particular,
are being described as the next frontier of rapid economic growth,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian president made the statement at the five-day "
Attracting Capital to Africa Summit," which was launched on
Saturday last week.
</P>
<P>
"Individually and collectively, most of the nations on the
continent have laid the groundwork for increased investment and
sustained economic growth," he said. "In most countries, a
peaceful and stable socio-political atmosphere prevails.
</P>
<P>
"We have generous incentives for investors," he said "we are
consistently innovating to enhance our competitiveness in
attracting foreign direct investment."
</P>
<P>
Namibia is among a dozen of the African countries, those in the
Southern African region in particular, which have made great
headway in promoting economic growth and social progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Namibia is a country endowed with considerable natural
resources, business potential and a stable socio-political climate,
" he said, appealing for more foreign investment in his country.
</P>
<P>
"By asking you to invest in Namibia, we seek to achieve an
accelerated growth of our economy," he said. "You will be placed
within easy reach of a market of approximately 200 million
consumers."
</P>
<P>
Nujoma gave assurances that his country "is working hard to
position itself as a truly strategic gateway into and from the
Southern African market".
</P>
<P>
The biannual conference is a follow-up to the Africa-U.S.
Ministerial Meeting held in Washington last month. Both
gatherings are seen here as an integral part of the efforts by the
U.S. Government to redefine its relationship with Africa.
</P>
<P>
The first such summit was convened in April 1997 in Virginia in
a move by the United States to better its relations with African
countries after a period of negligence since the end of the Cold
War.

DHAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will receive 138.60
million U.S. dollars from the International Development Agency
(IDA), the concessional lending arm of the World Bank (WB), for a
municipal service project at a rate of 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
A development credit agreement in this regard was signed
between the Bangladeshi government and the World Bank here on
Monday, the Independent daily newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first involvement of the WB in the municipal
project outside Dhaka and Chittagong, according to WB's country
director Frederick T. Temple, who said that this would provide way
to channel fund to small municipalities for their development.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the project, which is to be implemented
during the 1999-2004 period, are to strengthen the institutional
capacity of selected municipalities in city corporations and
improve resource allocation and fiscal discipline, and to
establish a municipal development fund and a municipal support
unit with the Local Government Engineering Department.
</P>
<P>
If implemented, the project will also support government
efforts to reduce urban poverty and improve the environment
condition of urban communities and improve infrastructure, service
delivery system of three towns of Chittagong Hill Tracts and
support post-flood rehabilitation needs of the affected
municipalities.

The new bonds, he said, could attract investors exiting from
bonds of low liquidity issued by the 90 companies for documents of

The operation began on Monday and will last 20 working days so
that the investors have time to study the new bonds.

Since 1986, visiting delegations from the Japan-China Society
have been planting trees annually around the memorial hall to
demonstrate their penitence for the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Japanese visitors also have erected eight monuments in the
memorial hall to urge young generations not to make the same
historical mistakes and to call for friendship between the two
countries and their peoples for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 Japanese students visit the memorial hall every year
to learn about the appalling event.

<P>
All visitors without exception are shocked at the ferocity of
the Japanese invaders and are indignant at those on Japan's
political right wing who deny the incident took place.
</P>
<P>
Japanese soldiers killed as many as 300,000 unarmed Chinese
soldiers and civilians during the massacre.

<HEADLINE> Science Sharpens Competitive Edge in Petrochemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Science and technology has given
China's petrochemical industry a boost, with some 60 percent of 3,
000 scientific research findings being adopted throughout the
industry over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Jiaren, vice-president of the China National
Petrochemical Corp. (Sinopec), through vigorous development in the
1980s and 1990s, China has set up a comprehensive petrochemical
processing system and established a group of backbone enterprises,
with annual refining capacity hitting 150 million tons, making it
third in oil refining capacity in the world.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China can now produce 80 percent of the
six types of catalysts which are vital to petrochemical production,
allowing it to save 200 million US dollars annually and cut
production costs by one billion yuan a year, said the official.
And 80 percent of the scientific findings on refining have been
put into use.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, great breakthroughs have also been
made in scientific and technological cooperation with overseas
petrochemical companies. Projects on three large-scale joint
ventures co-funded with Switzerland, Germany and Hong Kong are
proceeding well to produce polypropylene and polystyrene products.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a large group of important scientific research
joint ventures are under negotiation with overseas petrochemical
companies, he added.

<HEADLINE> Scientists to Focus on Light Energy for Boosting Crop Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have started a
major research program to help better utilize light energy in
raising crop yields, in an effort to meet the food needs of the
country's vast population 30 years from now.
</P>
<P>
This major state sponsored research program, costing a total
of 50 million yuan (6 million U.S. dollars ), ranks first among 14
other major national basic research programs announced recently by
the Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to carry out the basic research programs
over the next five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
Kuang Tingyun, one of the leading scientists involved in the
light energy utilization program and an academic of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS), said more than 100 scientists from CAS
Institute of Botany and others of China's first-rate research
institutions and universities are focusing on a major breakthrough
in the ways in which crops absorb light energy thus increasing the
yield.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Li Liangbi, director of the Institute of Botany's
photosynthetic activity research center, said they plan to seek
ways to raise the light energy utilization rate of rice, wheat and
other major crops from the present 1.5 percent to over 20 percent
in the coming five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that China has put so much investment in
photosynthetic activity research, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that the effective utilization of light
energy is of vital importance for raising the per hectare crop
yield and it is believed to be one of the key contents for the
second "green revolution."
</P>
<P>
China's first group of 15 major basic research programs which
involve considerable state funds mainly cover agriculture, energy,
information, resources and environment, population and health as
well as new materials fields, said an official with the Ministry
of Science and Technology.

<P>
The Posts and Telecommunications Department will study and work
out measures later this year on how to deal with the stamps that
were issued before 1999, but were left unsold.
</P>
<P>
For fear that the stamps issued before 1999 will not be
available on market, many buyers waited in long queue in recent
days for these stamps.

<HEADLINE> G-24 Urges Developed Countries to Open Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 24 developing
countries Monday urged the developed countries to resist
protectionist pressures and further open up their markets.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers expressed concern about the pressure in some
industrialized countries for resorting to protectionism through
various devices," the G-24 said in a communique issued here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers of the G-24 held a one-day meeting on the
sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF)
spring meetings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"They underscore the necessity of resisting such tendencies and
emphasize the advantage of a further opening up of markets for the
exports of developing countries," said the G-24.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 consists of 24 developing countries, eight each from
Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The G-24, warning that the world economy remained fragile, said
it was worried about trade protectionism arising out of crisis
that weakened world demand for goods and dealt a blow to
confidence in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
They criticized the high interest rates and tight fiscal
policies in early policy prescriptions from the IMF as it sought
to ease the financial crisis in Asia and beyond.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers noted that some of the prescriptions adopted for
managing the crisis of recent years may have contributed to
adverse affects through unduly restrictive fiscal measures and
high interest rates which have discouraged investment and retarded
the process of recovery," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 also appealed to the IMF to ensure equal access to
developing countries to a new credit line to protect countries
from financial problems in neighboring states.

<HEADLINE> Italian Vice Minister Arrested on Graft Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian police Monday arrested
Treasury Vice Minister Stefano Cusumano on charges of corruption
and Mafia association in connection with the construction of a
hospital in Catania, the second largest city in Sicilia.
</P>
<P>
Cusumano, the first official at the ministerial level arrested
in office in the Italian history, was hospitalized with an attack
of hyper-tension after the arrest. He did not have immunity
because he was not a member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Sicilian regional councilor for industry, Giuseppe Castiglione,
and eight others were also taken into custody with Cusumano,
accused of tampering with the bidding procedure for the contracts,
corruption and complicity in Mafia association, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
Cusumano and Castiglione, leading figures in Sicilian politics,
are charged with "illegally favoring" the awarding of contracts to
companies linked with the Sicilian Mafia gang of Cosa Nostra.
</P>
<P>
They were suspected of obtaining kickbacks of 120 billion lire
(about 67 million U.S. dollars) from contracts to build the new
hospital in Catania.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to completely get rid of corruption in the
construction area, the Italian National Anti-Mafia Commission
called for the creation of a national task force, made up of
magistrates and law enforcement agents, to closely watch the
awarding of major public contracts.
</P>
<P>
Since Italy launched the anti-craft campaign called "Clean
Hands" in 1992, a number of high-ranking officials were forced to
resign for alleged embezzlement.

<HEADLINE> Feature: China's Private Firms Eyeing International Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A brand new Chinese bicycle is
winning fans all over the world and after a joyful round of
cycling inside a crowded exhibition, Garber Gakobsson, a Swiss
businessman, held his thumb up and told the manufacturer that he
would place an order for one million US dollars worth.
</P>
<P>
The new multi-functional bicycle, with the pleasant name of "Sun
Bird", is produced by the Jinguang Group, a private enterprise in
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
"This new bicycle, I bet, will sell like hot cakes and I will
import more every year," said Gakobsson, who came here to
participate in the 85th China Export Commodities Fair, the most
important foreign trade event which is held twice a year in
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I have attended the Guangzhou fair and
we have signed orders valued at more than 5.6 million US dollars
in less than one week," General Manger Xiao Shuyun told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
It is, in fact, the first time that private Chinese firms have
been able to participate in foreign trade fairs in their own name
and on such a large scale.
</P>
<P>
"With the right to direct foreign trade, we have a much bigger
potential market and greater maneuvering room," Xiao said, adding
his company has developed an environment-friendly model targeted
at overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
China's numerous private enterprises were not permitted to deal
in foreign trade directly until two groups of 61 firms were
granted the right to engage in imports and exports earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
"By allowing private firms to take part in foreign trade on
their own, China has increased its economic and trade contact with
the world," according to Li Jian, an associate research fellow of
the China International Trade and Economic Cooperation Institute.
</P>
<P>
The private sector has grown by leaps and bounds since China
launched its market economy reforms in the late 1970s. Official
statistics show that China had more than 1.2 million private
businesses by the end of last year, with employees hitting 15
million and a combined output value of 355.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the rising role of the private sector and to
respond to a changing environment, in March China amended its
constitution to boost the private sector's role from that of "
complementary" to being an "important component" of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The participation in direct foreign trade of private firms,
which are generally more market-oriented and efficient than state-
owned enterprises, is expected to boost China's exports, which
have been significantly affected by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
After years of two digit growth, China's export growth slowed
to 0.5 percent last year, in sharp contrast to 20.9 percent in
1997. In the first quarter of this year, exports declined 7.9
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials have warned repeatedly that China is facing a
"very tough year for exports".
</P>
<P>
Economists have noted that plunging exports may drag down
economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Premier Zhu Rongji has called for "all possible
means" to increase exports to help stimulate economic growth.
China has set this year's economic growth rate at around seven
percent, down from an actual rate of 7.8 percent last year.

MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- NATO's decision of a sea blockade
of oil shipment to Yugoslavia has no force for Russia, Rusvbsian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to impose any sanctions or embargoes on other

On Yugoslavia's possible entry into the Russia-Belarus Union,
Ivanov said it would take time to consider all related legal,
economic and other issues.
</P>
<P>
He called for an early end to "the risky military actions in
the Balkans," saying that NATO must stop its military strikes
against Yugoslavia and seek political ways out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
NATO announced an oil embargo on Yugoslavia last Friday and is
now considering sea blockade against the country to check arms
supply.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Citizens to Be Allowed to Appeal against Government Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese citizens are likely to be
entitled to appeal against government infringement of their
interests and also against "illegal" government documents,
according to a draft law tabled with the top legislature yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The draft law additionally states that citizens, companies and
other organizations may appeal against government documents if
they are considered to have caused an infringement of their
legitimate rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Li Boyong, vice-chairman of the Law Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), reported the revisions to the ongoing
session of the NPC Standing Committee beginning here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
All government documents can be appealed against except those
signed by the premier, ministers and provincial governors, which,
according to law, are subject to examination by national or local
legislatures, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that this will further open up the government's
activities for public supervision and scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Government documents, usually with red headers, were considered
as laws when there was not an actual legal system in China. And
even today, they remain powerful, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Legislators said in a previous session that the most common
complaints of the public, such as the essentially illegal
collections of exorbitant fees by local governments, directly
derive from "illegal" and unreasonable government orders and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes these law-breaking activities of certain government
employees are following written government orders, they said.
</P>
<P>
The latest draft law also provided that if the complainants are
not satisfied with the results of appeals, they can choose to go
to the court or appeal to higher level of the government, under
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
And the ruling made by the State Council shall be final, the
draft states.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts in Beijing pointed out that such a judicial
review and involvement of the highest level of government shall
help to wipe out the negative influence of departmentalism and
local interests, and serve to safeguard justice.
</P>
<P>
According to an agenda adopted by the Standing Committee here
yesterday, the draft law, which allows greater convenience for the
complainants and heightened efficiency in handling the
administrative appeals, will be voted on at the end of the four
day session.

<HEADLINE> Italian AIDS Vaccine Effective on Monkeys, Researchers Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian researchers announced Monday
that they have further confirmation that the Italian AIDS vaccine
is effective on monkeys.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Ensoli, a researcher at the virology laboratory of the
Italian Health Institute for Higher Studies, reported that the
results of the latest test showed five vaccinated monkeys were not
infected by the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory has developed a therapy aimed at immunizing
against the Tat protein which paralyzes cells that normally hinder
the spread of the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
An experiment was carried out on 10 Macaque monkeys, seven of
which were given the vaccine for 50 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Then all 10 were inoculated with a virus called "Shiv," a
mixture of the HIV virus that attacks humans and the SIV virus
that attacks monkeys.
</P>
<P>
After 10 months, the three monkeys which were not vaccinated
all got seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven vaccinated monkeys, five showed no sign of the
illness and appeared to have been completely protected, while two
became infected but to a much lesser degree than the three
unvaccinated animals.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine caused no side effects and all seven of the
vaccinated monkeys were said to be in good health.
</P>
<P>
The next step is to carry out the necessary procedures so that
researchers can proceed with testing on humans.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that within one year, such tests can get
underway in Italy and Uganda, the African nation hardest hit by
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Research on animals will continue to fine-tune the methodology
and obtain further information for clinical experimentation.
</P>
<P>
At present, the vaccine has a success rate of 70 percent, but
the researchers want to involve a larger number of animals and are
working for a 100 percent success rate.
</P>
<P>
They also want to try different ways of administering the
vaccine and to target not just the Tat protein, but the gene that
causes its manufacture in the body.

Felipe Lampreia and his Argentine counterpart, Guido di Tella,
discussed here Monday trade problems between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They are trying to estimate the impact of the devaluation of
Brazil's currency, the real, on bilateral trade and seeking
measures to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government complained that the Brazilian
government did not take measures against the "dumping" of certain
products entering Argentina.
</P>
<P>
It said because of the devaluation and a possible agreement
between Brazil and the Andean Pact, Argentina will cut down
exports by some two billion U.S. dollars in the 1999-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Brazil argued that Argentina is placing trade barriers to sugar
and rolling steel imports from Brazil, saying it is imposing a
surcharge of 23 percent for sugar and a minimum price of 410
dollars per ton for rolling steel.
</P>
<P>
Argentina is Brazil's second largest trade partner after the
United States. Brazil's imports from Argentina were 8.03 billion
dollars and exports to the country stood at 6.74 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Version of Japanese Veteran's Diary Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese version of the
wartime diary by Shiro Azuma, one of the Japanese intruding
soldiers who massacred 300,000 unarmed Chinese soldiers and
civilians in Nanjing in 1937, has been released in east China's
Zhejiang province, where the author surrendered as an invader in
1945.
</P>
<P>
Shiro Azuma was recruited into the Japanese army and sent to
China in 1937. He was engaged in aggressive battles to occupy
major Chinese cities like Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou and
Wuhan, and recorded all this in his diary.
</P>
<P>
He published part of the diary in Japan in 1987, but was later
sued by a former soldier who was described in the diary as a war
criminal.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Higher Court ruled in this man's favor and instructed
that his name should not be made known or any action taken against
him.
</P>
<P>
An appeal by Shiro Azuma, who feels justice should be done, to
a higher court was rejected.
</P>
<P>
However, Shiro Azuma, regardless of being 87 years old in age,
made a special trip here recently to attend the launch of the
Chinese version of his diary.
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm guilty," the man said. "I'll let more and more
people know the real facts of the war, and that's my way to offer
my apology to the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of local residents and students in Hangzhou, in
support of Shiro Azuma, participated in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"I respect the old man for his courage in admitting the crime
he committed against the Chinese people," said Ding Zijun, a
student at the Hangzhou Institute of Commerce. "Facts are facts."
</P>
<P>
One of Ding's grandfather's brothers was among the victims of
the Nanjing Massacre, Ding said, and that has remained a permanent
hurt for his family.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Larry Miller may be a
successful owner, but he's not much of a trash-talker.
</P>
<P>
The head man of the Utah Jazz was fined $10,000 by the NBA
today for inappropriate comments to Portland Trail Blazers guard
Greg Anthony in a heated 96-85 victory Friday.
</P>
<P>
The game, which was a battle for the best record in the league,
featured a shoving match between Portland's Walt Williams and Jazz
reserve Adam Keefe.
</P>
<P>
But Miller stole the spotlight late in the fourth quarter,
exchanging some harsh words with the emotional guard. Seconds
after the brief argument, Anthony threw up an air bull on a 3-
point attempt.
</P>
<P>
Utah leads the league at 34-10 and the Western Conference by 1
1/2 games over Portland.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Send 448 Athletes for SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) said 448 of the 549 athletes being groomed for the
20th Southeast Asia (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam would
participate in the Games in August, The Jakarta Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moch. Hindarto, KONI's official in charge of athlete
development, said the athletes would be selected through field and
laboratory tests designed to determine if they could maintain
their peak form during the biennial Games.
</P>
<P>
He said the tests, which began on Tuesday, would be for
athletes who had yet to reach the competition phase of their
training. Based on KONI's estimation, national athletes must reach
the competition phase in May.
</P>
<P>
"The field tests start tomorrow (Tuesday) and will last to May
2, and the lab tests will be conducted from late April to late May.
Sports organizations can conduct their own tests, such as cycling.
That would be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
"We want to list athletes (for the Games) who can reach our
minimal standards and their peak performances in July. If they
fail, they should step out of the squad voluntarily," he said
after a meeting with KONI chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar on
preparations for SEA Games training on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto quoted Wismoyo as saying that all sports organization
officials must assure their athletes are more disciplined in
following training programs in the last three months before the
Games.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Adheres to Growth Strategy of Domestic Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven
industrialized countries (G-7) remain committed to a growth
strategy based on strengthening domestic demand and will continue
to support the recovery of emerging market economies, a G-7
statement said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued after a meeting of the G-7 finance
ministers and central bank governors, said the favorable outlook
remains for continuous price stability in the seven countries.
</P>
<P>
"The most important contribution that we can make to improving
the overall global outlook will be to promote sustainable domestic
growth in our own countries, bearing in mind the favorable outlook
for price stability in our countries," said U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert E. Rubin after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the U.S. is concerned, prospects are favorable for
another year of strong economic activity," he said. "But it is
very important that Europe and Japan also get on track for solid
and balanced growth."
</P>
<P>
The G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors discussed
the outlook for growth in their countries as well as in the world
economy, global financial systems, and the current situation in
Kosovo and its ramifications for neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the challenges facing each of our economies, we
pledge ourselves to continued efforts to work cooperatively to
strengthen conditions for financial stability and to improve the
economic outlook," said the G-7 statement.
</P>
<P>
Open and competitive international trade markets continued to
be an important underpinning for world growth, prosperity and
stability, the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 countries remained committed to achieving further trade
liberalization and market transparency through the launch of a new
round of multilateral trade negotiations in November.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the meeting reaffirmed that they would
maintain strong cooperation to promote stability of the
international monetary system and exchange rates among major
currencies that were in line with fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirmed our view on the importance of pursuing policies
to promote sound economic fundamentals and more balanced growth
among key economies and thereby help avoid excess volatility and
significant misalignments of exchange rates of major economies,"
Rubin said. "We will continue to monitor developments in exchange
markets and cooperate as appropriate."
</P>
<P>
On the debts of poor countries, Rubin said the G-7 reiterated
the importance of strengthening the initiative of the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and reviewed the proposals made by
a number of G-7 countries with a view to reaching consensus by the
Cologne summit in June.

<HEADLINE> Helicopter Maintenance Soldier Commended by PLA (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Li Hongtao, a soldier turned
helicopter maintenance expert has been honored by the Headquarters
of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for his
outstanding achievements in military training.
</P>
<P>
He was cited as a modal soldier in the new era for learning and
mastering science and technology in a bid to guide his daily work.
Other PLA soldiers are asked to learn from him.
</P>
<P>
The young soldier of an airman regiment, who is a high school
graduate with only five years military service, has become the
first soldier to win the honorary title in the application of
science and technology in military training since the founding of
new China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Having undertaken 18 specialized courses in higher-education in
such topics as the construction of helicopters, mechanical drawing
and the dynamics of flying, all self-taught, Li, who has been a
member of the army aviation squad in charge of helicopter
maintenance since December, 1994, has participated in more than 20
major helicopter related innovation projects.
</P>
<P>
Applying his self taught knowledge he has been involved in
tackling a series of problems such as increasing speed with which
large weapons can be moved from one place and preventing the tail
propeller from colliding with the ground.
</P>
<P>
Li is the first soldier to have a special paper published in
the state-level "Aviation Maintenance" magazine and the first
invited to an annual meeting of Chinese leading helicopter experts
in 1996 to present and read his paper "Proposals for Prevention of
Tail Propellers From Colliding With the Ground."

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The New Jersey Nets lost their
star forward Keith Van Horn who broke his left thumb and will have
to miss the final six games of the season.
</P>
<P>
The Nets earned a resounding 120-98 victory over Eastern
Conference power Indiana on Sunday, but the win cost them too much.
</P>
<P>
Van Horn left with 1:32 to go in the third quarter after
suffering a displaced fracture of the thumb. He was examined today
by a doctor and will undergo surgery at a later date.
</P>
<P>
The second-year forward is sixth in the league in scoring with
a team-high 21.8 points per game. He also chipped in 8.5 rebounds
per contest and is 11th in the NBA in free-throw shooting at 86
percent.
</P>
<P>
Van Horn, an All-Rookie selection last season out of Utah,
recorded 12 double-doubles this year and scored at least 30 points
three times.
</P>
<P>
The Nets already have lost All-Star center Jayson Williams to a
season-ending broken leg in late January. Their tumultuous season
also included the acquisition of guard Stephon Marbury in a multi-
player, three-team deal and firing of coach John Calipari.
</P>

They have the second-worst record in the Eastern Conference at
14-30.

<P>
Even foreign helicopter experts came all the way to China to
discuss these tail propeller issues with Li after reading his
paper.
</P>
<P>
He also found out on several occasions the cause of such
accidents as engine failure in large scale military training
operations that had not been discovered by technicians with formal
higher education.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, his 16 papers on helicopter maintenance
and character improvement were published in state-level magazines
or collected by high level symposiums on helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Invited as a member of the experts group in his unit, the
soldier was also invited to give a lecture in Beijing University
of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the country's top university in
the field last month.
</P>
<P>
Familiar with more than 2,000 parameters of 14 major systems
and diagrams of 75 sub-systems of a helicopter, Li answered all
the helicopter related questions raised by students and professors
at the university during the lecture.
</P>
<P>
The young soldier won admiration from the students as they say
they learned a lot which they could not get from the textbooks.
</P>
<P>
As he solved quite a number of technical problems neglected by
experts and scholars, he became the first soldier to teach
maintenance theory and practice for those fresh out of the army
aviation squad.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Jichang, a captain, said "I feel very safe flying a
helicopter with maintenance provided by Li, as he could solve any
knotty problems after just having a look, hearing sound of the
engines and touching the equipment."
</P>
<P>
Li believed that the captain's words are the best appraisal of
his work.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports Negative Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's largest city of Shanghai
has registered a population decline for seven consecutive years,
with a 1998 drop of 1.8 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show an annual birth rate of 5.3 per
thousand and a death rate of 7.1 per thousand for last year. That
means a natural decrease of 23,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute the downward trend to a successful
family planning policy that has brought the birth rate down by
nearly 3 per thousand over the past decade. About 95 percent of
married couples in the city have chosen to have only one child
each.
</P>
<P>
Experts also point to an upward death rate trend due to an
aging population. Some 20 percent of the local residents are now
above the age 60.
</P>
<P>
The decline in population has had its impact shown in many
sectors of the city, resulting in a shortage of old folks' homes,
and a surplus of kindergartens and primary schools.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the local population will keep on dropping
in the years to come.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of Home
Affairs Syarwan Hamid has confirmed the impossibility of dividing
Irian Jaya and Maluku into several provincial administrations
before the June 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
"The expansion program will be based on laws which have yet to
be made... it is impossible to carry (the division) out before the
elections, because the House of Representatives, which is in
recess until June 11, will not be able to process them. The House
cannot deliberate the draft if we submit it now," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks after meeting with governors,
regents and mayors across the country here on Monday, according to
The Jakarta Post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Syarwan's statement modified an announcement by Coordinating
Minister for Political and Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung on the
government plan to split the two regions into additional
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with his ministers last Thursday, Feisal
said the plan would be carried out before the elections. Irian
Jaya was to be divided into three provinces and Maluku into two.

<P>
YANGON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Two United Nations agencies
provided a total of 26.9 million U.S. dollars of aid to Myanmar
for its border areas development during the past ten years,
according to a latest official report on the development.
</P>
<P>
Of the aid, 11.9 million dollars were extended by the U.N.
Development Program for the implementation of human development
initiative project between 1994 and 1997 which covered health,
education, water availability, environmental cleanliness and
increase of income of the inhabitants in some areas of Rakhine,
Chin and Kachin states.
</P>
<P>
Other aid of 15 million dollars were provided by the U.N. Drug
Control Program (UNDCP) for the country's five-year drug
elimination project being implemented in Shan state's southern Wa
region from 1998 to 2003.
</P>
<P>
Towards the trust fund set up by the UNDCP, the United States
contributed 5.7 million dollars and Japan 1.04 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the Myanmar government itself invested a
total of 48.84 million dollars for building bridges and roads and
development of agriculture, energy, construction, education,
health and communications in the regions.
</P>
<P>
The country laid down an 11-year master plan for the
development of its border areas beginning in 1993, including the
first short-term three-year plan (1993-94 to 1995-96), the first
medium-term four-year plan (1996-97 to 1999-2000) and the second

<HEADLINE> Measures Called for Protection of Pine Trees in Mt. Huangshan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the Chinese Research
Institute of Forestry and the State Forestry Administration have
called for measures to combat nematodiasis, a plant disease
endangering pines in the Huangshan Mountain in east China's Anhui
Province.
</P>
<P>
Huangshan, a scenic spot and tourism destination, is well-known
for its pine trees, grotesque stones, hot springs, and unusual
clouds.
</P>
<P>
Pine trees near and around the scenic spot and the 176,000 ha
of forestry in Huangshan City are being threatened by the disease
which was first carried into China by long-horned beetle in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 67,000 ha of pine forestry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang,
Guangdong, Anhui and Shandong provinces have been damaged by the
disease.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Anhui provincial forestry
department, the province will implement a protection project
starting this year and use satellite remote-control techniques to
monitor the disease.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is sponsored by the State and the provincial
government, will cost 59.99 million yuan and be completed within
five years.
</P>
<P>
A 100 kilometer long and four kilometer wide control zone will
be established around the Huangshan Mountain in a bid to prevent
the spread of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Roof of World Used to be Damp Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found a
range of fossils during a comprehensive scientific survey on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the "Roof of the World", according
to a book published here recently.
</P>
<P>
"The fossils are leaves of a broadleaf tree from a subtropical
zone," said Wu Yuhu, an associate research fellow, in a book
entitled "On-the-spot Report of Scientific Exploration at Kunlun
Mountains."
</P>
<P>
"This shows that Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was 1,000 or 2,000
meters above sea level at that time. And its climate is similar to
that of Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province," Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the scientists have discovered a karst cave, which
has stalactites and stalagmites which are common in subtropical
areas in south China.
</P>
<P>
The discovery shows that the arid and frigid Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau was a damp subtropical area. It is identical with local
folklore that tells how the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau used to be a
vast sea.
</P>
<P>
Two other researcher who took part in the exploration said
these fossils are vital to the study of the age and geographical
changes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the Mt.
Diwalwal landslide of southern Philippines rose to 16 as rescuers
dug up two more bodies over the weekend, the Manila Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, more than one hundred families have
fled the gold-rush site of Mt. Diwalwal in Compostela Valley for
fear of more landslides.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources of the Civil Defense Office as saying
that two more bodies were recovered in sitio Balite, one of the
four villages hit by landslides last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the landslides had killed 14 people and
injured another 11.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Defense Office also said another landslide occurred
in a village in Mawab town, Compostela Valley, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Authorities had attributed the landslides to the deadly
combination of soil erosion and the heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's environment officials said they had
warned the residents of the area as early as September last year
about possible landslides due to heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Despite the warning, the residents, mostly small-scale miners
trying their luck in the famous gold-rush mountain, opted to stay,
thus exposing themselves to danger.
</P>
<P>
The national weather bureau had reported on Friday that the
rains in Compostela Valley would continue until mid-1999.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Agrees to Merger of German, Italian Telecom Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian government has initially
agreed to Telecom Italia's (TI) plan to merge with German Telecom
"Deutsche Telekom (DT)", announced Minister of Communications
Salvatore Cardinale on Monday, calling the consolidation "a great
opportunity" for the development of the Italian telecommunication
industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a telecommunication
conference, Cardinale said that "the merger plan represents a
great opportunity which we can't afford to miss, and it would lead
to our company becoming, along with DT, the second largest in the
world telecommunication sector" after Japan's NTT.
</P>
<P>
Last week in London, DT and TI unveiled their plan for a merger
which would primarily create a 170-billion-U.S.-dollar behemoth
with more than 90 million customers worldwide and 23 million
mobile phone subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Both TI chief Franco Bernabe and DT head Ron Sommer stressed
that it would be a "merger of equals," with both having an equal
say in the running of the proposed company, and Bernabe pledged
that the Italian government would be convinced by the business
plan.
</P>
<P>
However, the Italian government expressed serious doubts,
centering on the proposal that DT hold a 56-percent stocks in the
new company, while the German government still holds a 72-percent
stake in DT and has been unwilling to set out a clear time-table
for the completion of the national telegraphic industry's
privatization process.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's conference Cardinale stressed that "there must be
management equality between DT and TI, and we must make sure that
the Germans are not at the helm."
</P>
<P>
He said that "it seems that these problems have been resolved,
because there is a five-year equal partnership proviso."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the "gradual privatization" of DT was
acceptable if it is carried out in a clear and transparent way.
</P>
<P>
A group of DT representatives arrived in Rome today to begin
the work on hammering out better details of the merger with their
TI counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide PC Sales Grow in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Strong consumer demand and
rebounding Asian-Pacific markets resulted in a 19 percent growth
of worldwide PC sales in the first quarter this year, according to
a report released Monday by U.S. market research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Worldwide sales rose to 24.5 million units, the IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another U.S. market research firm, Dataquest,
estimated the global PC sales growth in the first quarter at 17.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The IDC and Dataquest pegged U.S. computer sales growth at 21
and 24 percent, respectively. Much of the growth was driven by
strong consumer desktop demand across not just the low-cost
segment but the full range of price points, the IDC said.
</P>
<P>
In Western Europe, where the United Kingdom, France and Germany
experienced strong consumer demand, there was a continued surge in
PC sales. Markets in Asia-Pacific also continued to reverse the
negative growth pattern that marked much of 1998. Elsewhere, the
IDC said, economic woes in Russia were offset by strong demand in
the Middle East and Canadian markets.
</P>
<P>
Vendor performance worldwide continued to be healthy even in a
time of fierce price wars and limited revenue growth, the IDC said.
</P>
<P>
The fight for market share remained very intense among the top
five U.S. PC vendors -- Compaq, Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard and
IBM. Despite lackluster financial performance, Compaq, with
worldwide shipments totaling 3.53 million units, retained its top
position in unit sales in the first quarter, although its growth
was much lower than the first quarter last year. According to
Dataquest, Compaq's PC sales in the United States only grew 6.9
percent, leading to a drop in its market share to 15.7 percent
from 17.8 percent in 1998.

exposure to ultraviolet sun rays.
</P>
<P>
At present, annual domestic demand for R134a has reached 2,000
tons and the figure is expected to climb to 5,000 tons by the end
of the century.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have banned the use of freon as it is suspected
of playing a role in the destruction of the atmosphere's ozone
layer.
</P>
<P>
China will totally phase out the use of freon by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Prevention On Curriculum at Shanghai's Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- AIDS prevention has become a
required course at 15 colleges and universities in China's largest
city of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
This is a positive response to college students' lack of
knowledge about the fatal disease, according to an official with
the Shanghai Municipal Educational Commission.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the commission and the Shanghai Medical
University found that most college students in the city do not
have adequate basic knowledge about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The commission has therefore issued a regulation, Basic
Requirements for Education on Prevention of AIDS and Other
Venereal Diseases, requiring all Shanghai-based universities and
colleges to add the prevention of sexually orientated diseases
such as venereal diseases and especially AIDS to their curricula.
</P>
<P>
Students will be encouraged to read books, attend lectures and
seminars, and watch videos about the diseases.
</P>
<P>
Young people are especially vulnerable to venereal diseases,
the official said, so great efforts must be made to enhance health
education among them.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts have warned that Shanghai could be on the verge
of a rapid growth of HIV/AIDS cases if public awareness of
preventative measures is not given priority.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last November, the city, which has some 13
million residents, had 183 people registered as infected by HIV,
or the AIDS virus, according to an earlier report. But experts
estimated that the actual figure might be higher and will possibly
reach 16,000 next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Aviation Authority Orders More Inspections on Boeing 737 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) Monday ordered the country's airlines --
already subject to fuel, wiring and hydraulic inspections of their
Boeing 737s -- to inspect for and correct possible fatigue cracks
in the aft pressure bulkhead, located near the tail.
</P>
<P>
The barrier, like one in the cockpit, allows the planes to
pressurize to a safe breathing atmosphere. Left untended, cracks
could widen and trigger rapid depressurization of a plane.
</P>
<P>
The order stems from reports of fatigue cracks on the aft
pressure bulkhead of some Boeing 737-200 models, older planes with
cigar-shaped engines under the wings. Newer models have oval or
round engine pods.
</P>
<P>
The airworthiness directive requires operators of the Boeing
737-100 through -500 series aircraft to conduct either electronic
or visual inspections, and to repair any cracks found.
</P>
<P>
The directive is an interim action pending identification of a
final action, which could require further FAA rulemaking.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine 737 is the world's most commonly used passenger
aircraft. The proposed rule affects 1,020 planes worldwide, 500 of
which are registered in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the new inspections is 480 U.S. dollars per
aircraft for each electronic inspection, and 120 U.S. dollars per
aircraft for each detailed visual inspection.

White House spokesman Joe Lockhart issued the call for both
sides to work out a framework to revive peace talks running

and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat under the brokerage of
President Clinton. (Clinton-Israel-Palestinians)

<HEADLINE> China Urges Increase of Resources Flow to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China on Monday urged the
international community, particularly the developed countries, to
spare no efforts in reversing the downward trend of resources flow
to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Such efforts will bring benefits not only to developing
countries, but also to developed countries themselves," said Jin
Liqun, China's vice finance minister, at the 61st Ministerial
Meeting of G-24 here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the global economic trend from a broader perspective,
it was obvious that the gap between the developing countries and
developed countries has been widening rather than narrowing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Promoting financial resources transfer to developing countries
would exert a profound overall impact on eliminating the adverse
effect of the financial crisis, narrowing the gap between the
North and South, stimulating global market demand and promoting
world economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
China supported the enhanced efforts on the initiative of
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries where debt reduction would be more
closely linked to poverty alleviation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In order for debt reduction to be effective, the critical
issue is to provide additional financial resources for development
assistance," he said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investments on Indonesia's Agribusiness Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Although the total foreign direct
investments (PMA) in Indonesia last year dropped by 70 percent, in
fact the value of PMA in agribusiness doubled to 998.5 million
U.S. dollars last year from 465.3 million U.S. dollars a year
before.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Investment Hamzah Haz, who is also chairman
of the National Coordinating Board of Investment, said the figures
were an indication that the agricultural sector could lead to
recovery from the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"When the other sectors experienced contraction up to 15.4
percent last year, agriculture grew by 0.3 percent," he was quoted
by The Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of agribusiness projects also sharply
increased from only 14 to 134 projects.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the mistake made by Indonesia "is not
paying much attention to developing agriculture which most of the
population depend on. If we could boost the growth of the sector
by nurturing the 39 million small- and medium-scale enterprises
intensively, our budget surplus will really come from trade not
from capital inflow anymore."
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis has brought a new blessing for the sector
to become the pillar to get out of the crisis, he added.

HANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The offshore island city of
Zhoushan in east China's Zhejiang Province is preparing to build a
total of six sea-crossing bridges, in a bid to build a peninsula
by linking several local islands with the mainland.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gov't Vows to Promote New Ties With Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government Monday said
that it is determined to promote "a new relationship with Africa."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to some 750 representatives from the business and
political realms in both Africa and the United States, William
Daley, U.S. secretary of commerce, said, "President (Bill) Clinton
has asked all of us in his administration to make an all-out
commitment to promote a new relationship with Africa."
</P>
<P>
Daley has been to Africa five times in his two years as
secretary of commerce, including accompanying President Clinton on
his visit to Africa in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"What I have seen through all this is the positive impact that
market-based reforms have for the African economies. I have seen
the challenges governments face when they seek to open up to the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have also seen that there are tremendous opportunities for
American businesses," he said. "Last year, U.S. exports to Africa
grew a very good 8 percent. This is in sharp contrast to our
overall trade picture with the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
"But what concerns me is that in the last decade, two-way trade
between America and Africa has lagged considerably behind trade
with other regions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our export assistance centers here at home also are focusing
more on Africa," he said, citing a move to hold "a virtual trade
mission to Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
"What we are increasing is video conferencing capabilities," he
said. "So smaller companies can go into our offices in America,
and make links to the world without expensive travel."
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to reduce the number of costly, time-consuming
trips a U.S. executive must take before a deal can be signed," he
said. "Additionally, we are continuing our efforts to bring
American companies to Africa."
</P>
<P>
But "African leaders need to know you are interested in their
growth as well as your own corporate expansion," he said. "They
seek partners -- partners for the long haul -- partners who can
help integrate Africa more fully into the world economy."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of commerce made the remarks at the five-day
"Attracting Capital to Africa Summit," which began here last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 22 workshops were held Monday to explore
opportunities for the two-way trade and investment between Africa
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The current gathering follows on the heels of the U.S.-Africa
Ministerial Meetings held in Washington last month. Both events
are seen as an integral part of the redefinition of the U.S.
relationship with Africa.
</P>
<P>
Many people credit the United States' re-awakening to Africa
with President Clinton's announcement of his Partnership with
Africa in 1997, followed by his historic visit to Africa in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, African countries have long been haunted by unfair
trade terms, heavy debt burdens and poor living standard of
African people. The U.S. government needs to work hard to rid
Africa of AIDS disease, better the investment environment and
fully integrate into the world economy, rather than promoting its
value systems into the continent, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary of Commerce on Attracting Capital to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. government official
Monday said that private companies in the United States "look for
two main things" to make final decision on where to invest and
where not to.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to some 750 representatives from both the political
and business world of Africa and the United States, U.S. Secretary
of Commerce William Daley said, "First, they want to know if a
country has its economic house in order."
</P>
<P>
"Companies look at the fundamentals of fiscal policies. They
look for progress in privatizing and cutting trade barriers. They
look at infrastructure -- at roads, phone service and reliable
power," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is another sensitive issue -- intellectual property," he
said. "When companies like Pfizer spend half a billion dollars to
develop a drug, they want to know their intellectual property will
be protected."
</P>
<P>
The second thing businesses look at is the political situation.
Even if all the economics are favorable, it will take political
stability also," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The increased fighting in so many countries -- the waste of
such great human and resource potential -- sends the picture to
the world of the old Africa, not the new Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Business people don't want to buy into the old Africa. This
negative news is a turn off. We see stories about fighting and
discord, and enthusiasm for Africa lessens, to be frank with you,"
he said. "These are, of course, real issues that must be
addressed."
</P>
<P>
Daley made the remarks at the five-day Attracting Capital to
Africa Summit, which began here last Saturday, drawing African
leaders and American firms into discussion on how to improve trade
and investment between Africa and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Thelma Awori, assistant administrator of the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and director of the
UNDP's Africa Bureau, told Xinhua that the U.N. agency "needs to
change the image that Americans have of Africa."
</P>
<P>
Apart from reported conflicts and poverty on the continent,
Africa also has a lot of success stories, such as Botswana, Ghana,
Mauritius and Namibia, which all enjoy political stability and
economic progress.
</P>
<P>
The summit was held as an integral part of the efforts by the
U.S. government to redefine its relationship with Africa, which is
rich in natural and human resources.

<HEADLINE> Africa Faces Opportunities for Economic Growth: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- African countries, after colonial
rule, conflicts and civil strife, are facing enormous
opportunities for economic growth and social progress, Prime
Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam of Mauritius said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The African countries are free from colonial rule and facing
full opportunities" for economic development and social progress,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks at the five-day Attracting
Capital to Africa Summit, which began here last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Conflicts and civil strife are gaving way to economic
cooperation," he said. "Africa is opening its doors (to the
outside world) because Africa cannot go alone."
</P>
<P>
In introducing Ramgoolam, Thelma Awori, assistant administrator
of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and director of
the UNDP's Africa Bureau, said that the prime minister "is the
precursor of a development philosophy currently known as `economic
diplomacy.'"
</P>
<P>
"Under his leadership, Mauritius has been at the forefront of
promoting African economic cooperation and integration," she said.
"The success story that is Mauritius is now almost legendary in
Africa and serves to encourage those who continue to struggle for
the acceleration of economic development in the rest of the
continent," she said.
</P>
<P>
Without gold and diamond, Mauritius began its economic debut on
the basis of developing the sugar industry. Nowadays, the country,
with a population of some 1 million, has helped Madagascar create
45,000 jobs in two years in the textile industry and is now
supporting Mozambique to develop export processing zones.
</P>
<P>
"The bold efforts of Prime Minister Ramgoolam have been
instrumental in delivering these achievements and in creating an
economy that is now one of the strongest in Africa," she said,
citing such measures as visionary leadership, strong and
constructive partnership between government, the private sector
and trade unions, and strategic investment in human capital.

World number three O'Sullivan beat English compatriot Joe Perry

<HEADLINE> Van Hooijdonk Still for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Nottingham Forest football club
player Pierre Van Hooijdonk has been on the transfer list since
last August, when he effectively went on strike, but up to now
nobody wants to buy him.
</P>
<P>
The recalcitrant Dutch forward has now outlasted two Forest
managers and seen the club return to the premier league and get
relegated since he went on the transfer list.
</P>
<P>
Yet he seems no nearer to leaving himself.
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, there's been very little interest in him" said a
spokesman for Forest, who are bottom of the premier league and
were relegated at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"(Manager) Ron Atkinson had no offers during his time and there
were not very many during Dave Bassett's."
</P>
<P>
Van Hooijdonk, who joined Forest in 1997 and has three years
left to run on his contract, was transfer-listed by former manager
Bassett before the start of the season with a price tag of 8.0
million pounds (12.92 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the situation remained "pretty much as we
were. He's still on the transfer list."
</P>
<P>
He went on strike after the 1998 World Cup in protest because
he said, rightly as it turned out, that promoted Forest had failed
to buy enough quality players to survive in the top flight.
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman, accompanied by security guards, returned to
Forest in October to an uneasy reception.
</P>
<P>
"I would have left him to rot in Holland," Bassett was quoted
as saying in one newspaper. "He's really coming back to be sold
because, as far as I am concerned, he has no long-term future here.
"
</P>
<P>
Bassett was fired in January, Atkinson, his replacement,
announced on Saturday that he was quitting at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
Van Hooijdonk remains up for sale.

<HEADLINE> Newcastle United to Sign Kiev Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Newcastle United are poised to sign Dynamo Kiev defender Oleg
Luzhny for two million pounds.
</P>
<P>
But the Magpies' late move for the 30-year-old Ukraine captain
will leave Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, who thought he had
a deal all tied up, fuming.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd and chief executive Freddie
Fletcher broke off from attending Monday's annual meeting of the
Premiership to talk to Luzhny and his representatives.
</P>
<P>
Luzhny has been an important member of the Kiev side which
reached the semi-final of the Champions' League before going out
to Bayern Munich in Germany on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Robson was in Munich on Wednesday and returned to Teesside
thinking he had tied up the deal only to be told that Newcastle
had moved into the driving seat.
</P>
<P>
A Newcastle insider said: "While the deal is not yet done we
are feeling confident as Luzhny has traveled across from Kiev for
talks with us.
</P>
<P>
"If we can get him it will end a two-year chase because that's
how long we have been interested in him."
</P>
<P>
Luzhny played in both the Champions' League games against
Newcastle last season. Meanwhile, Newcastle have denied reports
that they have made a six million pounds bid for Real Mallorca
striker Dani.

<HEADLINE> Man United Duo Withdraw from Ireland Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Manchester United duo Roy Keane and Denis Irwin have pulled
out of the Republic of Ireland team to play Sweden on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both players sustained injuries in United's 1-1 draw at Leeds
on Sunday and it means Irish manager Mick McCarthy has now lost
four players from his original selection for the Dublin friendly
against England's main rivals in the Euro 2000 qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough's new signing Keith O'Neill was withdrawn earlier
this week and yesterday Leeds United's Ian Harte was also pulled
out
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said: "It's a blow to lose four players like that but
in a friendly international you always expect a few players to be
missing, especially when their clubs are involved in vital league
matches at this time of the season.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly I would like to take on Sweden's strongest team with
our strongest side but often it's not realistic to suppose that
will happen."
</P>
<P>
Sweden were arriving in Dublin on Monday but without Arsenal's
midfielder Fredrik Ljungberg who has a groin injury and has only
made sporadic appearances for the Gunners since hitting the goal
against Poland last month which put his country into command of
England's qualifying group.

<HEADLINE> BAR Calls Salo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The British American Racing team
have confirmed that Mika Salo will take the place of the injured
Ricardo Zonta at the San Marino Grand Prix next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The veteran Finnish driver, 32, who has previously driven for
Lotus, Tyrrell and Arrows, will stand in for the Brazilian who
suffered a cut tendon in his left foot during a crash at his home
Grand Prix two weeks ago, according to local reports on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zonta is recovering well but medical advisors have advised
against putting any undue strain on his foot for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
BAR felt the demanding Imola circuit could aggravate Zonta's
injury. The team's managing director Craig Pollock said: "It is a
great shame that Ricardo will not be able to drive for us at Imola,
and obviously a big disappointment for him personally.
</P>
<P>
"He agrees though that the quickest way back into the cockpit
is to allow his foot adequate time to heal fully and not rush his
return. In that respect he will be guided by the advice of his
doctors.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, we're pleased to have secured the services of
Mika Salo for Imola. He's a great driver and has current Formula
One experience."
</P>
<P>
Salo is looking forward to the chance to get behind the wheel
in Formula One for the first time in 1999 after being replaced at
Arrows.
</P>
<P>
He drove for BAR in testing at Jerez last week and said: "I'm
sorry that Ricardo won't be able to drive at Imola, but speaking
personally, I am very pleased to be able to step in to what I am
sure is a competitive car."

<HEADLINE>   Richards Named as Premiership Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Sheffield Wednesday football club
chairman Dave Richards has been appointed as the new chairman of
the FA Premier League.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Hillsborough club has held the role in an
acting capacity since Sir John Quinton quit the post last month.
</P>
<P>
Sir John and Premier League chief executive Peter Leaver both
resigned in a row over lucrative contracts which were awarded to
two former BSkyB executives without the prior knowledge of the
chairmen of the 20 top-flight clubs.
</P>
<P>
Richards' appointment was confirmed following an unanimous vote
at a meeting of the Premier League clubs' chairmen in London on
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sir John Quinton and Leaver believed they had the authority to
offer the deals signed by Sam Chisholm and David Chance but the
Premier club chairmen refused to back them.
</P>
<P>
The controversy began last November when Chisholm and Chance
were signed up to help the Premier League renegotiate their next
TV rights deal, which is up for grabs from 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Premier League are still attempting to renegotiate the
contracts with the two men, while lawyers are investigating
whether they were legally binding as costly legal action could
ensue if they were unlawfully terminated.
</P>
<P>
The controversy led to Richards' initial interim appointment,
with the rules of association changed to allow an active club
chairman to also take over as Premier League chairman.
</P>
<P>
Sir John was not connected with any club and following the
permanent move, it is likely a review will be held in 12 months'
time as it is believed the League have not totally ruled out the
possibility of appointing another independent in the future.
</P>
<P>
Mike Foster retains his position as acting chief executive,
with the process of appointing somebody permanent having been
initiated at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a Premier League statement, spokesman Mike Lee said: "Dave
Richards has agreed to serve as chairman for a further period to
provide stability and experience whilst a new chief executive is
appointed."

<HEADLINE> Romania Reports 178 Refugees From Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania has granted so far the
status of refugees to 178 ethnic Serbians and Albanians coming in
from neighboring Yugoslavia, the national Rompres news agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were boarded in the western counties of Arad,
Mehedinti and Timis, as well as in the central counties of Sibiu
and Brasov and in the capital city of Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The number of people arriving from Yugoslavia is in excess of
178, as many prefer to stay with their relatives or friends and
apply for the refugee status from western states.
</P>
<P>
According to Head of the Local Public Administration Department
Vlad Rosca, board and meal conditions for the refugees are "very
good." However, he complained that the allocated funds are
insufficient, and hoped more money will be diverted for this
purpose soon.
</P>
<P>
When the refugees began to get in across the Yugoslav border,
Romania showed itself willing to accommodate up to 6,000 people,
with financial support from international institutions. The money
required for the daily upkeep of one refugee ranges between 10 and
15 U.S. dollars daily, according to Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu.
