<HEADLINE> AL Awaits U.S., British Stance on Lockerbie Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) is awaiting
official stances of the U.S. and Britain on ways of resolving the
long-running Lockerbie issue, a press statement issued by the
Cairo-based organization said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid, who started a visit to
Libya on Sunday, is known to have explored responses of Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi to a possible detailed plan for trying two
Libyans suspected of involvement in the 1988 aerial attack.
</P>
<P>
Meguid has said Tripoli held on to its position to settle the
issue in accordance with a proposal put forward by the AL, the
Organization of African Unity, the Organization of the Islamic
Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement. The proposal asked for a
trial of the Libyan suspects in a third and neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The AL statement said Meguid, who is to leave Libya later
Thursday, has met with Gaddafi and other leading Libyan officials.
</P>
<P>
"His visit is designed to express Arab solidarity with Libya in
its conflict with the West and to affirm the need to lift
sanctions imposed on the country," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The visit is also to stress that the continued embargo on
Libya will push Arab nations to look into possible alternatives to
stave off more damage to the Libyan people," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations slapped Libya with air, military and
diplomatic embargo in 1992 for its refusal to extradite its two
nations suspected of blowing up a Pan-Am airliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in 1988. A total of 270 persons were killed in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been resisting the pressure to hand over the suspects
to U.S. or British courts, saying this will compromise their
chances for a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London last month agreed to allow them to stand
trial in the Netherlands before Scottish judges.
</P>
<P>
A key stumbling block now lies in the Anglo-American insistence
that all the judges must be Scots, while the defense counsel wants
a multi-national bench.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli is seeking AL support for lifting the U.N. embargo
immediately upon endorsing the trial procedures. London and
Washington stand firm against negotiating on the demand.
</P>
<P>
The AL has supported Libya's stance. In a recent meeting in
Cairo, the AL Council said Libya is entitled to claiming damages
caused by the unfair sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Meguid held talks earlier this year in London with British
Foreign Minister Robin Cook on the Lockerbie row, and has
conferred in Cairo with a delegation of the relatives of the
bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
The Anglo-American turnabout is seen as having been prodded by
the increasing international support for the Libyan position.
</P>
<P>
During a summit in Burkina Faso in June, African leaders
threatened to bust the embargo by September 1 should Washington
and London fail to agree on a compromise. And some heads of state
recently flew into Libya in defiance of the air embargo.

MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Armenian Prosecutor General Genrik
Khachatryan was shot and killed in his office Thursday, the

transport prosecutor, Tass said in a dispatch from Yerevan, the
Armenian capital.
</P>
<P>
Karapetyan committed suicide after killing the 59-year-old
prosecutor general. His motive has yet to be established.

<HEADLINE> Bonn: U.S. Criticism on German Bosnian Refugee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- German Interior Minister Manfred
Kanther Thursday said United States accusations were absurd that
Germany was forcing back Bosnian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Kanther said Bonn was not trying to forcibly speed up the
repatriation of Bosnian refugees, noting that the government based
the repatriation policy on voluntary return.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Ministry spokesman Detlef Dauke as saying the
accusations from Washington as "absurd".
</P>
<P>
Germany received some 350,000 Bosnian war refugees in all and
still has 140,000 of them. In the first seven months of this year,
it repatriated some 75,000 refugees. German officials said of them
only 1,200 were forcibly expelled and many of these people had
been convicted criminals.
</P>
<P>
The officials conceded, however, that some refugees from the
Serb-controlled Republika Srpska were returning to other areas of
Bosnia as the first step to going home.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials described Germany's repatriation of Bosnian
refugees as refugee "dumping", which they said ran against the
agreed policy of sending refugees back to their former homes.
</P>
<P>
They voiced concern over Germany's practice, saying it
threatened the hard-won Bosnian peace process.

<HEADLINE> Triple Olympic Gold Medallist Smith Banned for Four Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Irish swimmer Michelle Smith,

winner of three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, was

banned from competition for four years on Thursday after being

found guilty of tampering with a drug test, the sport's world

governing body FINA said in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Smith, now called Michelle De Bruin, was banned by FINA after a

hearing last month had initially failed to reach a decision on her

future. The suspension will come into immediate effect, FINA said.
</P>
<P>
Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, said he would not comment on the

ruling until a news conference in Dublin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The case against Smith, alleged that she used alcohol, a

masking agent, to tamper with a urine specimen she gave on January

10 at Kilkenny County, Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
A potentially-lethal dose of whiskey found in a first urine

specimen was also detected in the back-up sample.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old had denied tampering with her test and said any

manipulation must have taken place without her knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The urine specimen was divided into A and B samples and sealed

in separate containers after it was given.
</P>
<P>
De Bruin won gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics in the 400m

freestyle, and 200 and 400m individual medley.
</P>
<P>
FINA ruled that all competition results in the six months

before a positive test must be annulled.
</P>
<P>
This means that Smith is likely to be stripped of the two gold

and two silver medals that she won at the European championships

in Seville, Spain, last summer.

<HEADLINE> Organized Crime Nets $1.5 Trillion A Year: S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Organized crime yielded an
annual global illicit profit of an estimated 9.3 trillion Rand
(1.5 trillion U.S. Dollars), South African Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This represented four percent of the world's economy, South
African Press Association quoted Mufamadi as saying at a media
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Profits of drugs alone were larger than the gross domestic
product of the whole of Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of democracy in South Africa four years
ago, the country has become an easy target of crime syndicates as
increased cross-border trade and transport provided better cover,
Mufamadi said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's relative industrial advancement, communications
networks and financial institutions meant abundant opportunities
for criminals to do money laundering and to steal goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
Up to mid-June this year, 22 foreign citizens had been
arrested in South Africa for drug trafficking, while 110 South
Africans were in jail in countries in Latin America, Asia and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
To fight organized crime syndicates, South Africa had to
upgrade the skills of police through training to close the
"sophistication gap" between criminals and police, Mufamadi said.
</P>
<P>
The detective academy opened in Pretoria last year had already
provided advanced training, with the assistance of the United
States' FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation), to 509 local and
50 Southern African Development Community (SADC) detectives.
</P>
<P>
A regional body for joint crime fighting, the Southern African
Regional Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization, was also set up
and a number of joint operations had been carried out, the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Protection for Ethnic Chinese Women in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China's leading women's
organization today called on the Indonesian government to adopt
effective measures to protect the legal rights of the ethnic
Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the All-China Women's Federation
(ACWF) criticized criminal acts committed against ethnic Chinese
women during the recent riots in Indonesia. The organization
voiced the strong indignation of women throughout China.
</P>
<P>
Social turmoil in Jakarta during May resulted in the
destruction of thousands of Chinese businesses, and the even more
horrifying is savage rape of ethnic Chinese women, according to
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement stresses that the atrocities were grave
violations of the legal rights of women, and notes that the ACWF
and Chinese women as a whole are deeply concerned and sympathize
with the victims.
</P>
<P>
The federation called on the Indonesian government to deal
promptly with the facts and introduce immediate measures to
uphold justice for victims by conducting a thorough investigation,
severely punishing perpetrators and preventing the recurrence of
similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has clearly stated its stance and
demanded that Indonesia protect the personel safety, legal rights
and interests of ethnic Chinese. Chinese societies and
organizations throughout the world have also expressed their
indignation over the atrocities.

<HEADLINE> Improvements in Cargo Services at HK New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals
Ltd. (HACTL), the operator of SuperTerminal 1 at Hong Kong's
one-month-old new international airport, Thursday announced
improvements in its provision of outbound cargo handling services.
</P>
<P>
The improvements will lead up to the handling of all export
cargo from August 16, an official of the HACTL said.
</P>
<P>
With effect from 23:59 on August 9, HACTL will handle on all
outbound passenger flights, two pallets, plus 500 kilograms of
loose cargo.
</P>
<P>
This cargo can be delivered by shippers and agents into the
SuperTerminal 1 facility with effect from 23:59 on August 8.
</P>
<P>
By 23:59 on August 15, all restrictions on export handling at
SuperTerminal 1 will be lifted and at this time HACTL will be able
to process all its customers' requirements at either SuperTerminal
1 or Terminal 2 at Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
HACTL also announced that, as of 23:59 on August 11, cargo on
all Cathay Pacific inbound flights, both passenger and freighter,
will be handled at SuperTerminal 1. This will greatly facilitate
the handling of transshipment cargo.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Charter, managing director of HACTL, said the recovery
plan of the SuperTerminal 1 is going according to schedule, with
the aim being to handle all outbound and inbound cargo through
SuperTerminal 1 by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the overall progress to date in the recovery
plan, Charter said that since the recovery plan was implemented at
23:59 on July 18, tonnage handled has been steadily increasing.
"Last week for example, the tonnage handled by HACTL was at 80
percent of normal levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
Operation of the SuperTerminal 1 broke down after the new
airport at Chek Lap Kok went into commercial service on July 6 due
to computer problems.

<HEADLINE> UK Warns Iraq over Arms Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook Thursday warned Iraq over suspending cooperation with U.N.
weapon inspectors, saying it would only prolong economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's statement threatening to end cooperation is "a
transparent attempt to raise the stakes before Richard Butler
reports to the United Nations." Robin Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued hours before Richard Butler, chief of
the U.N. Special Commission for disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM), is
to brief U.N. members later Thursday on the current situation in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Robin Cook said that Baghdad promised U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan in February that Iraq would cooperate fully and
unconditionally with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the only way that Iraq can secure the
lifting of sanctions is to honor that undertaking rather than
seeking to impose new conditions.
</P>
<P>
"This latest move will only delay the moment when the Security
Council can consider the removal of sanctions." Cook said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Contacts Continue: Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- One day after the killing of
two Jewish settlers in the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said contacts with the Palestinians on the
redeployment issue are continuing.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told reporters in his office Thursday that he thought
an agreement could be reached with the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) over the second redeployment of Israeli troops in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the killing of Jewish settlers underscored
the need to make sure the Palestinians fulfilled their commitment
to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also disclosed that he had a phone conversation with
PNA President Yasser Arafat two days before.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he urged Arafat to act on the issue of
Palestinian commitment, especially security commitment, in order
to complete the current negotiations on the second
redeployment. No more detail is available.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian negotiators resumed direct talks last month
in a bid to unblock the peace process, which has been stalled for
months over the scope of the long-overdue redeployment. But no
progress has been made in Israel's acceptance of a U.S. initiative
for a 13.1 percent more withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Since two Jewish settlers were killed early Wednesday near the
West Bank city of Nablus, some right-wing members in the Israeli
government have called to halt talks with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Urges Strong Response From Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations would have to respond in a very strong and
unmistakable way amid Iraq's announcement that it had decided to
froze the cooperation with U.N. Weapons inspectors, U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before the Security Council is to be
briefed by Richard Butler, Executive Chairman of the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), on his recent visit to Iraq,
Bill Richardson said Iraq had violated U.N. resolutions and the
Memorandum of Understanding reached between the country and the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Last February.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said Iraq would have to reverse itself on its
decision to refuse further cooperation with UNSCOM in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on Wednesday that it was suspending cooperation
with UNSCOM led by Butler until it was restructured.
</P>
<P>
Butler visited Iraq on Monday. The first two rounds of
disarmament talks between Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz
and the chief inspector broke down due to sharp differences.
Butler cut short his visit and returned to the headquarters of the
United Nations in New York on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Sartaj to Be Appointed Pakistan's New FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz Thursday confirmed the press reports that he is being
appointed foreign minister in place of Gohar Ayub Khan who has
tendered his resignation in April.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has formally asked me to look
after the Foreign Ministry. Now I am waiting for the official
notification," Sartaj told the private News Network International
(NNI) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the notification might be issued anytime Thursday or
Friday but dispelled the impression given by the press that he was
being removed from the finance minister due to his failure to
manage the country's financial matters.
</P>
<P>
Sartaj said the prime minister took the decision in April this
year when Gohar decided to relinquish his charge as the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Gohar, who has requested the prime minister to change his
present post, also confirmed that he will not perform duties as
foreign minister Friday, the NNI said.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister has asked me to take any ministry of my
choice," Gohar was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gohar had made the request as according to him the Foreign
Ministry keeps him away from his electorates.
</P>
<P>
Sartaj, 69, had served as finance minister from August 1990 to
July 19193 during the first government led by Prime Minister
Sharif and was given the same portfolio in Sharif's new cabinet,
which was sworn in in February 1997.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Iraqi Action not in Conformity with MOU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Thursday that Iraq's decision to suspend U.N. arms
inspection is not in conformity with U.N. resolutions and his
agreement reached with Iraq in February.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a brief question and answer session when
he arrived at the U.N. Headquarters here this morning.
</P>
<P>
To the question whether he saw Iraq's action violating the
February 23 memorandum of understanding which defused the crisis
in the arms inspection, Annan said:"We have been seeking full
compliance with all Security Council resolutions including the
MOU, and what has happened is not in conformity with that."
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General came here to hear a Security Council
briefing by Richard Butler, Executive Chairman of UNSCOM, or the
U.N. Special Commission for disarmament in Iraq, on his trip to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Butler came back to New York on Wednesday from Baghdad after
his talks with the Iraqi Government on the next disarmament steps
collapsed early this week.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced Wednesday to suspend cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors until conditions it sets are met.
</P>
<P>
It demands equal representation of the member states of the
Security Council on the Special Commission, and a relocation of
UNSCOM headquarters to Geneva from New York to keep the Commission
away from direct U.S. influence.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also demands a rotation of UNSCOM chairmanship among the
five permanent members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's move was seen to be motivated by its aim to early lift
eight-year U.N. sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed in 1990 since the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, which triggered the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that
Baghdad has destroyed all banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it has complied with the relevant U.N. resolutions,
but Butler's commission said it has not.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM to Meet Sudan's Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa will meet Sudan's rebel leader John Garang here next week
to discuss the ongoing efforts to end Sudan's 15-year-old civil
war, the Middle East News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Garang, who commands the Sudanese Peoples'
Liberation Army (SPLA), will discuss the outcome of the peace
negotiations in May between Sudan's government and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
During the talks in Kenya, the two sides agreed to an
internationally supervised vote on self-determination for the
south, where the SPLA and government troops have been fighting for
control.
</P>
<P>
The predominantly Christian and animist south has been battling
for autonomy since 1983. Fightings, drought and famine have
conspired to claim more than 1.5 million lives.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the two sides declared a ceasefire to expedite
delivery of relief supplies to the famine-stricken Bahr al-Ghazal
province. The government has announced to expand ceasefire areas,
a decision welcomed by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry in a statement voiced hope that
such a move would herald good intentions to bring together all the
Sudanese to establish an overall peace and maintain the country's
integrity, sovereignty, stability and the welfare of its people.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will never stop doing its best in order to reach these
objectives," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, all the objective proved hard to come by. The peace
talks between Sudan's government and rebels started two days ago
under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority for
Development in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa reportedly ended
Thursday without progress.
</P>
<P>
The two sides failed to reach agreement on any of the topics.
Differences on self-determination in southern Sudan and border
demarcation there are still hindering the talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also argue over the relationship between religion
and the state. The southerners advocate a secular state while the
government says the overwhelming majority of the Sudanese people
want to apply the Islamic Sharia (law) in all Sudan except the
largely Christian south.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt are at odds over a border area and have traded
accusations of harboring each other's militants and oppositions,
but there are signs of a tentative thaw in relations in recent
months.

years, late Thursday evening, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gohar was given the portfolio of minister of Water
and Power, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sartaj told the private News Network International
(NNI) that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had formally asked him to
look after the Foreign Ministry and he was waiting for the
official notification.
</P>
<P>
He dispelled the impression given by the press that he was
being removed from the finance minister due to his failure to
manage the country's financial matters.
</P>
<P>
Sartaj said the prime minister took the decision in April this
year when Gohar decided to relinquish his charge as the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Gohar, who requested the prime minister to change his present
post, said the Foreign Ministry keeps him away from his
electorates.
</P>
<P>
Sartaj, had served as finance minister from August 1990 to July
1993 during the first government led by Prime Minister Sharif and
was given the same portfolio in Sharif's new cabinet, which was
sworn in in February 1997.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Hold Anti-nuclear Demonstration in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Even as Indian and Pakistani
troops exchange fire in Kashmir, thousands of Indians including
workers, intellectuals, retired military personnel, journalists,
students and scientists staged an anti-nuclear demonstration here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said almost simultaneously thousands of
Indians shouted anti-nuclear slogans in Mumbai, Calcutta,
Bangalore, Trivandrum and other cities.
</P>
<P>
In the old city of Delhi, the demonstrators held placards and
shouted slogans as "(we) want bread, no bomb" and "(we) want jobs,
no nuclear weapons".
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was organized by the Citizen Against Nuclear
Weapons, a civilian organization in India, which said it provided
the function for citizens to voice their anger and opposition
against the recent nuclear tests both in India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three top former Pakistani and Indian military
officers urged the leaders of the two neighbors Wednesday to
eliminate nuclear weapons from their arsenal and resolve their
disputes through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Former Indian Naval Chief Admiral L. Ramdas (retired), former
Vice-Chief of the Pakistan Air Force Air Marshal Zafar A.
Choudhury and former Indian Army Lieutenant General Gurbir
Mansingh said in New Delhi that recent development in the field of
nuclear weapons and the means of their delivery are a serious
threat to the well-being of South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement signed by the three officers, they urged
governments of the two countries to confine nuclear research and
development strictly to peaceful and beneficent spheres.

<HEADLINE> Vucic: Yugoslavia Favors Diplomatic Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Yugoslav Press Minister
Alexander Vucic Thursday stressed here that Belgrade supported a
diplomatic solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Vucic said that his country was
making every possible effort towards a peaceful solution to Kosovo
where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of its nearly 2 million
population and have been demanding independence. Any other way for
a solution but the political one would be foolish, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated that Yugoslavia opposed intervention in
Kosovo by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) because it
would violate international rules and constitute intervention in
the domestic affairs of a country.
</P>
<P>
Vucic also denied a press report of a mass grave containing 567
bodies near the Kosovo town of Orahovac, saying that German
reporter Erik Ratfelder had not even visited the area in question.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yugoslavia respected the rights of ethnic
minorities and no one could accuse the country of human rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
The press reports of an Orahovac massacre triggered immediate
reaction from European countries. Austria, which holds the current
EU presidency, asked the EU observer mission in Kosovo to verify
the reports urgently.

Bellamy said some 70,000 people had fled their homes as
villages had been looted and burned. It was estimated that the
total number of displaced persons is now 200,000. Great numbers
of people were struggling to survive in the woods without
benefit of medical or other professional assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Director said given the increasingly
unrestrained burning and looting, many of the local population
had been made homeless. In addition, frequent reports of mass
graves only add to the general terror of the situation.

She urgently appealed to the international diplomatic

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Ambassador in Athens
Valentina Matvienko Thursday said that her country would guarantee
the safe transportation of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to the
divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Matvienko said this during her meeting with Greek Deputy
Foreign Minister Yannos Kranidiotis shortly before the latter's
departure for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that as an independent and sovereign state, Cyprus
had "inalienable right" to make decisions concerning its defense
programs.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its defense capacity, Cyprus has decided to
purchase the Russian-made S-300 missiles, which will be deployed
later this year. but Turkey has threatened to use force to stop
Nicosia's installation of the missiles.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Ally in South Lebanon Concerned About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 6 (Xinhua) -- You may leave South Lebanon, but
what about us ? -- Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA)
Thursday posed the question to Israel which is seeking a
withdrawal agreement with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Orient radio quoted the SLA commander Antoine Lahd as
saying that the arrangement for south Lebanon, including the
residents and SLA members, should be a part of any agreement or
deal which would be reached between Beirut government and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a ceremony at Arslan in the Israeli
occupied zone to mark the end of a camp organized by Israeli
authority for Lebanese children living in the south.
</P>
<P>
He said the common interest for Israelis and Lebanese in south
Lebanon is the security and the peace.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Lebanon and Israel reach an
agreement concerning the Israeli pullout from the south.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip
in south Lebanon and called it "security zone" in 1985 to protect
its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 SLA militiamen are helping Israeli occupying forces
patrol the enclave and controlling Lebanon's Christian-dominated
town of Jezzine which faces the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli and SLA troops have met a tough resistance from
guerrillas. The heavy losses the Israeli forces suffered in south
Lebanon have forced the Jewish state into offering a withdrawal
proposal on the condition of the Beirut government security
guarantee for its northern borders.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer made in April and asked Israel to
unconditionally leave the occupied land.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal provoked the fear of SLA militiamen for their
uncertain future and some of them even have publicly applied for
Israeli visa.
</P>
<P>
SLA is considered by the Lebanese government as the nation's
traitor and its leader Lahd has been sentenced to death in
absentia by the Lebanese military court.

SINGAPORE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Chinese Chamber of
Commerce (SCCC) issued a statement Friday calling on the
Indonesian government to punish anti-Chinese attackers and take
concrete measures to guarantee the life, safety and dignity of the
ethnic-Chinese in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed welcome to a reported affirmation
by an Indonesian presidential envoy that his government has been
working on legislation to ensure the equal civil rights for
ethnic-Chinese and has set up a joint fact-finding committee to
investigate incidents including cases of molesting and raping
ethnic-Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Thursday's reports from a Malaysian newspaper, the
statement said Indonesian presidential envoy Iman Taufik, while
speaking at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur, conceded that the
ethnic Chinese were suffering from injustice in his country in the
past 30 years and he affirmed that his government has drafted a
law bill to stipulate the human rights and responsibilities of the
citizens including the ethnic-Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The statement said SCCC welcomes the legislative move taken by
the Indonesian government and the formation of the fact-finding
committee to investigate the crimes committed against ethnic
Chinese, particularly the atrocities against ethnic-Chinese women
during the riot in May.
</P>
<P>
"We are very much concerned about the current plight of the
ethnic-Chinese in Indonesia and hope the Indonesian authority to
complete investigations as soon as possible, publish the results
to the international community and severely punish those
committing monstrous and unforgivable crimes against
ethnic-Chinese Indonesians," the SCCC statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the Indonesian government to do more to
guarantee the life, safety and dignity of the ethnic Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Refugees Appeal for UN Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Some Bhutanese refugees here
Friday appealed to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) to help resolve their problem.
</P>
<P>
As initiated by the Appeal Movement Coordination Council, an
organization of Bhutanese refugees based in Nepal, 6,000
applications from 6,000 families were presented Friday to the
UNHCR office in Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The refugees said in the applications that "we're genuine
Bhutanese refugees, so UNHCR should verify us. We should not be
stateless, so save us from being without any state."
</P>
<P>
Ratan Gajamer, secretary-general of the Appeal Movement
Coordination Council, said that more refugee families living in
various camps in eastern Nepal are also sending in their
applications.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eight U.N.-run
camps in eastern Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Bhutan have held seven rounds of ministerial talks on
the issue but without any result. Bhutan said that it would take
back only those genuine Bhutanese refugees.
</P>
<P>
India, which handles Bhutan's foreign and defense affairs, has
refused to get involved in the matter, saying it is a bilateral
issue.
</P>
<P>
But Nepali Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said that the
attitudes of Bhutan and India were positive when he held talks
with leaders of the two countries about the issue on the sidelines
of the 10th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation held in late July.
</P>
<P>
He said that ministerial talks between Nepal and Bhutan would
resume soon on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Dam Tested by Biggest Flood This Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Three Gorges Dam, currently
under construction in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River,
has withstood the heaviest flooding this season, with this early
evening water flow rates reaching as high 58,000 cu.m. per second.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the dam and other facilities involved in
China's largest-ever water conservancy project has continued
unimpeded, and travelers stranded upstream from the dam site since
traffic was forced to be closed Tuesday have been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam has been under the constant threat of
heavy flooding since the beginning of July, with three flood
crests reaching maximum flow rates of 57,700 cu.m. per second
passing through the section by July 25.
</P>
<P>
The fourth flood crest formed on August 2, and torrential rains
have created surging discharges from the section.
</P>
<P>
According to hydrological data stored at Yichang Hydrological
Station, the dam site has not met a discharge of 72,300 cubic
meters per second over the past 110 years, whose chance of
occurrence is once every two decades.
</P>
<P>
Flood control facilities at the Three Gorges Project have been
constructed in line with standards for withstanding 20-year
floods, while the second stage cofferdam is built to withstand
100-year floods with discharge rates of 83,700 cu.m. per second.
</P>
<P>
Some 230,000 stranded travelers had been evacuated from areas
upstream from the dam by 06:00 this evening.

<HEADLINE> France Fears Destabilization of Great Lakes Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- France has expressed its fear that
the continued fighting between government forces and rebels in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R. Congo) will further destabilize
the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
D.R. Congo President Laurent-Desire Kabila said on Thursday
that he would send the war back to where it came from, accusing
Rwanda of being the origin of the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
"The risks of destabilization of the region are troubling,"
said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
Fighting continues in several parts of the D.R. Congo. The
Banyamulenge rebels control a key triangle area in the southwest
not far from Kinshasa, the French Foreign Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that the fighting in the Kivu region of
eastern Congo and other places "goes against what is wished".
</P>
<P>
She also called for respect of the territorial integrity of
D.R.Congo by all its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal for, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations
did, respect of territorial integrity of D.R.Congo and respect of
civilians, in the hope that this crisis can be resolved by an end
of hostilities," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said France would watch closely the summit on Saturday in
Zimbabwe by the heads of state of seven nations in the region,
including President Kabila and his Rwandan counterpart, Pasterur
Bizimungu, which aimed to seek a way out of the crisis.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton,
awakened at 5:30 a.m. with the news of the bomb blasts near the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, is watching developments
closely, a State Department official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"He was watching it very closely," the official said. "We're
just trying to get more information. Right now information about
the two bombings is very sketchy."
</P>
<P>
Clinton was informed of the attacks by National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
The bombs went exploded at or near the embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania between 10:40 and 10:45 a.m. local time on Friday, and
caused massive damage, with deaths and injuries in both blasts,
State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said.
</P>
<P>
"There are numerous people dead," he said. "The rear of the
embassy in Nairobi (the capital of Kenya) is reported to have
collapsed."
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassies around the world had been put on heightened
security alert, McClenny said.
</P>
<P>
"There was no warning and there has been no claim of
responsibility," he said. "They were terrorist attacks."
</P>
<P>
The State Department has set up a task force on the bombings
and the U.S. government is sending personnel and equipment to the
sites.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who has been notified
the bombings, is returning to Washington from a private visit to
Italy, where she was scheduled to attend the weekend wedding of
her spokesman James Rubin.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) here Friday
called on Hong Kong residents to donate to the victims of the
serious flood along the Yangtze River in China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a media session Friday afternoon, Tung said that
this year's flood in the mainland is the most serious one in the
past 50 years, with 28 provinces and cities and 240 million people
along the Yangtze River being affected by the flood.
</P>
<P>
Tung expressed his admiration for the millions of soldiers and
civilians along the Yangtze River who are fighting against the
flood.
</P>
<P>
"At this difficult moment, the people in the flooding areas
badly need our support," Tung said. People in the SAR and the
mainland are all Chinese people and should care about each other
and help each other at the difficult moment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that many voluntary bodies in Hong Kong have started
their donation activities and he called on Hong Kong residents to
support these activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SAR government has allocated nine million HK
dollars (1.15 million U.S. dollars) as relief fund to help the
people in the flooding areas.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that he understood Hong Kong residents' difficulties
at present due to the bad economic situation. "How much money you
donate is not important," Tung said. "What is important is to show
your love," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Most major retailers of the United
States posted strong sales in July, beating many estimates and showing
that the consumer still provides a strong underpinning to the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Results were strong accross nearly all retail categories, ranging
from discounters and department stores to specialty apparel and
electronics stores, according to statistics published by the Wall
Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
Sales at stores open at least one year rose 5.7 percent in July, up
from 5.5 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Many retailers said that their results were above expectations, and
that despite July traditionally being a clearance month, they sold
more goods at full price.
</P>
<P>
The good performance was helped in part by solid sales in May and
June, which helped clear out inventories, leaving retailers more room
to bring in new seasonal and back-to school merchandise, which sold at
regular price.
</P>
<P>
All of this is a good sign for retail earnings for the fiscal
second quarter which for most retailers ended in July.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter also saw positive earnings for many U.S.
retailers.

BANGKOK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai baht depreciated
significantly Friday to 41.87/41.97 against the greenback as a
result of the recent speculative attack on the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
Friday, the baht was once traded at 42.20 against the U.S.
dollar before gaining some ground to close at 41.87/41.97.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, the baht passed the 41 psychological level
for the first time in the recent month.

Analysts said that the devaluation of the baht in the past two
days was triggered by the speculative attack on the Hong Kong
dollar which began on Wednesday.

Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi said Friday that the speculative attack on the Hong
Kong dollar was a problem of the whole region, which will have
adverse effect on Thailand's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The weak Japanese yen also added to pressure on the Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index recorded
falls in all five trading days through this week. The SET index
lost 19.18 points or 7 percent from 266.72 points last Friday to

<HEADLINE> 7  IBM Ending Olympic Deal in Cost Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- International Business Machines
Corp. is pulling out as a world-wide sponsor of the Olympic Games,
abruptly severing a 38-year marketing relationship with an
about-face that underscores the high cost of linking corporate
marketing to sports, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The pulling came after several months of futile negotiations, IBM
said. The company is choosing to walk away rather than lock up an
eight-year deal with the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
One apparent sticking point is IBM wanted local organizing
committees to start bearing some of the technology costs, the paper
said. The world computer giant spent more than 100 million U.S.
dollars to sponsor the 1998 Winter Games and provided much of the
technology behind it free of charge.
</P>
<P>
IBM said that the two sides could not agree on how much money the
local Olympic organizers should pay IBM and how much IBM should have
to give away in exchange for marketing rights to the Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
The bailout by IBM means that its sponsorship of the next
Olympics, the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, may be the
company's last. IBM said that it is "fully committed to making the
millennium games an outstanding event" and "will market it heavily."

Court and procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate
were elected by the National People's Congress, China's top
legislature, during its annual session in March this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
president of the main Cambodian opposition party Funcinpec, and
Hun Sen, leader of the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP), met
on Friday for the first time since the prince's return from
self-imposed exile earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Also invited to the dinner meeting hosted by UN special
representative in Cambodia, Lakhan Mehrotra, was Sam Rainsy,
president of the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), the third largest party
in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed the meeting at the state Chamcar mon Palace,
southern Phnom Penh, would help to break the deadlock which
appeared after the Funcinpec and the SRP rejected the election
outcome as "undemocratic, unfair and unjust".
</P>
<P>
However, both Funcinpec and the CPP insisted that they were
simply attending a dinner at Mehrotra's invitation. Neither had
the intention of talking about a coalition or a role for the
prince in the next government.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and the SRP insisted that they would not enter into
any negotiations or discussions about a possible coalition until
all vote recounts were completed, fraud related to the elections
was resolved, and final official results were made available.
</P>
<P>
But a report said Ranariddh would demand the post of National
Assembly Chairman which is now held by Hun Sen.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- About 400 forest fires raging in
British Columbia, west of Canada, have killed one person and left
hundreds of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
More than 170 new fires have broken out in the past week,
driving hundreds of people from their homes and putting another
1,000 on alert.

<P>
More than 100 soldiers from the Canadian Armed Forces joined

<P>
The most seriously threatened community was Salmon Arm, 80
kilometers east of Kamloops in south-central British Columbia,
where a small fire tripled in size to 500 hectares in less than 24
hours due to winds up to 70 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Winds continued to push the blaze toward Salmon Arm, which has
a population of 15,600.
</P>
<P>
The dry weather the province has endured for at least 21 days
and high temperatures exceeding 30 degrees centigrade are also

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Army Chief Denies Coup Attempt Speculations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Army Chief-of-Staff
Gen. Subagyo Friday denied speculations that three senior officers
were being questioned by the Officers' Honorary Council (DKP) in
connection with an alleged coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
"I have never heard of plans or information about a coup
attempt. Let us straighten this out. There is not the slightest
tendency of the investigation going in that direction," he told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The DKP, set up on August 3, had so far interrogated Maj. Gen.
Muchdi and Col. Chairawan and was planning to question Lt. Gen.
Prabowo, former president Soeharto's son-in-law, next Monday,
Subagyo said.
</P>
<P>
The three senior officers were being investigated by the DKP in
connection with the abductions of student activists, Subagyo who
chairs the DKP said.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo and Muchdi were former chiefs of the Army's Special
Troops (Kopassus) and Chairawan was chief of the unit's Group IV
which specializes in intelligence operations.
</P>
<P>
"The council is working maximally and objectively so that it
can make the most appropriate recommendations to the Indonesian
Armed Forces commander who will make the final dispositions on
their cases," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three could be brought to a military tribunal if the DKP
had found them guilty of criminal acts, he added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Devaluates Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam on Friday effectively
devalued its currency, the dong, by about seven percent, bowing to
pressure resulting from the financial crisis that has ravaged
Southeast Asia since July last year.
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, the State Bank of Vietnam lowered the
official rate of the dong to the dollar by 10 percent from 11,816
on Thursday to 12,998, while simultaneously narrowing the trading
band on either side of this rate from 10 to seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Because the dong traded at the ceiling of this trading band
before and after the devaluation, the effective devaluation
equalled seven percent.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, the bank described the
devaluation as a necessary move aimed at forming a rational
exchange rate between the dong and the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The state bank's macro-control over the exchange rate would
encourage exports, limit imports and contribute to the increase of
the country's foreign exchange reserves, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The state bank has demanded all financial organizations
engaging foreign exchanges to set their rates in accordance with
the official one.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here
today that the Ministry of Education is formulating a plan for
improving education for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The action plan is part of efforts to implement the country's
policy of "modernizing the nation through the development of
science, technology and education", according Education
Vice-Minister Wei Yu.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that major tasks for the education sector will include
promoting compulsory education, eradicating illiteracy and
developing education in poverty-stricken and minority areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 97 percent school-age children were enrolled in
primary schools during 1997, with a noticeable closure in the
disparity education opportunities for male and female children,
according to Wei.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of 1997, nine-year compulsory education had been
introduced to areas with 65 percent of the nation's population,
whereas six-year elementary compulsory education had been
available in areas with 90 percent of the total population," said
Wei.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to universalize the compulsory education program have
entered a critical period, said Wei during a meeting with
officials of the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) and
various Chinese ministries and organizations.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the meeting, sponsored by Unicef, was to review the
cooperative program between Unicef and departments of the Chinese
government, including the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Wei pointed to difficulties in the education sector in
poverty-stricken and minority areas and noted that the country is
challenged by new educational problems, including programs
involving children of the floating population and laid-off
workers, as well as environmental education and anti-drug
education.

BEIRUT, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's internet market is
growing rapidly, with the number of users jumping from 5,000 in
1996 jumping to 40,000 this year, a senior ministry official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Minaim Yousuf, general-director of the Investment Department
of the Posts and Telecommunication Ministry, said in a radio

</P>
<P>
The revenues from the internet service have reached 1 million
U.S. dollars each month, the official added.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rapid growth of the internet service to the
ministry's effective policy to fully open the market to the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are a total of five commercial companies in
Lebanon providing internet service.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the ministry has hammered out a huge
project to promote this modern technology across the country.

<P>
The state-run Lebanese University has hooked up to the internet
and other governmental institutions and departments are moving in

<HEADLINE> Media Partners Distances Itself from Berlusconi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Sports marketing group Media
Partners confirmed on Friday that it was looking at plans for
European club soccer competitions and sought to distance itself
from Italian businessman Silvio Berlusconi.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that a proposed European Super League was
instigated by Media Partners and its president Rodolfo Hecht did
have some links to the former Italian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"Media Partners is constantly seeking ways of developing
various sports for the good of sporting clubs, players, supporters
and TV viewers. The company is currently examining proposals for
European club football competitions," it said in a statement
issued in London.
</P>
<P>
"These plans are still being developed and for this reason it
would be inappropriate to comment in any detail at this stage," it
added.
</P>
<P>
"However, we do wish to emphasis that contrary to press
speculation, Media Partners has no links with the media empire
controlled by Silvio Berlusconi."
</P>
<P>
However, two of the four-strong Media Partners management team
named in the statement have worked for Berlusconi's Fininvest
[FIN.CN] media and retail empire. Berlusconi has extensive TV
interests and is also the owner of former European champions AC
Milan.
</P>
<P>
Hecht was previously in charge of Fininvest's strategic
management of sports events while director Andrea Locatelli is a
former AC Milan player who worked in sports event production and
marketing at Fininvest.
</P>
<P>
Media Partners describes itself as an independent
company, wholly owned by its partners. It said it was not
affiliated to any sports federation or media group and had offices
in Milan, London and New York.
</P>
<P>
A number of leading European clubs including England's
Manchester United, Arsenal, Spain's Real Madrid and Dutch team
Ajax Amsterdam have admitted this week that they had been involved
in the talks of a breakaway competition.

high-tech development zones here today that the Ministry will
discuss policies that allow high-tech ventures to be listed on the
stock exchange as early as possible.
</P>

<P>
PYONGYANG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Friday praised Bangladesh for refusing
to sign a "status of forces agreement" with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh government's recent rejection of the U.S.
demand that the two countries sign the agreement would defend the
dignity and sovereignty of Bangladesh and was in its best
interests, a spokesman for the DPRK foreign ministry told the
state news agency KCNA.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral demand of the United States showed that it still
maintained its outdated policy of trying to deploy troops and
establishing military bases in other countries and regions, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "status of forces agreement" includes visa-free
entry of U.S. soldiers into Bangladesh, guarantee for unrestricted
activities of the U.S. forces and introduction into the country of
the equipment and supplies for the U.S. forces without customs
procedures.

<HEADLINE> South African Tobacco Laws to Be Flexible: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's new tobacco
laws will be applied in a flexible rather than a selective
manner, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, Health Minister Nkosazana
Zuma said the new laws did not mean the immediate cessation of
existing contracts between sporting bodies and tobacco companies,
local daily Sowetan reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We will be flexible with each case, but we would like
sporting organizations, particularly soccer, to start looking for
new sponsorship in view of the fact that it plans to host the
2006 World Cup," she said.
</P>
<P>
The rules of the world soccer control body, the Federation of
International Football Associations, did not allow tobacco
advertizing, she said.
</P>
<P>
Zuma's remarks were in reply to a question as to whether or
not her proposed new tobacco laws would not negatively impact on
South Africa's chances of hosting the Formula One Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
According to Sport Minister Steve Tshwete, President Nelson
Mandela would meet Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone on August
19 to discuss plans for a South African Grand Prix in the light
of the government's proposed crackdown on tobacco sponsorship.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Issues Orders to Revitalize Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada Friday
issued a series of orders geared to revitalize Mindanao's economy
by modernizing agriculture and reverse the ongoing food crisis in
the south.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Davao City in Mindanao, Estrada said that
agricultural modernization is one of his administration's highest
priorities to boost its centerpiece agenda of food security.
</P>
<P>
"Here in Mindanao, in my view, lies the future of our program
on food security, self-sufficiency and self-reliance. We should
develop and strengthen Mindanao because it will bring food to the
table of every Filipino," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada disclosed that in the first half this year, the effects
of El Nino forced the country's agricultural production to drop by
as much as 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We must address and correct this anomaly with a deep sense of
urgency and concern," he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to some resolutions presented by the Mindanao
Business Council, Estrada assured that Mindanao will occupy "top
priority in the agriculture and fisheries development program" of
his government.
</P>
<P>
Estrada ordered the Department of Agriculture and other
concerned departments to immediately start identifying strategic
agriculture and fisheries development zones and model farms in
Mindanao, speed up the construction and rehabilitation of rural
infrastructure and establish a research and development fund in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao's economy plunged to a standstill due to a 24-year war
between government troops and the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
Although the MNLF signed a final peace pact with the government
in 1996, several other rebel groups are still operating in the
region.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Vows to Meet Deficit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel vowed Thursday to meet government's
budgeted deficit target of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) despite the recent economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Merrill Lynch's investor seminar in Johannesburg
Thursday, Manuel said: "The current (economic) difficulties will
make some of our targets more elusive. But one target that will
not be elusive is the deficit target," Business Day paper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
There have been doubts that the government would be able to
meet its deficit target as the country's financial markets have
been in turmoil in recent months due to speculative attacks on
the South African currency.
</P>
<P>
The Rand has shed more than a quarter its value against the
U.S. Dollar since the beginning of 1998. The subsequent sharp
rises in interest rates, in a bid to protect the Rand, prompted
predictions that the country's economic growth this year would be
as low as one percent.
</P>
<P>
The government budget for the 98/99 fiscal year projected a
GDP growth of three percent, which was based on the assumption
that banks would allow their historically high interest rates to
drop this year.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said Thursday that despite the changed economic
circumstances, a 3.5 percent deficit remained "entirely
achievable".
</P>
<P>
Low economic growth usually hits government's revenue from
income tax and value added tax, and some economists have
predicted a shortfall of up to two billion Rand (323 million
Dollars) in revenue.
</P>
<P>
But Manuel was optimistic that revenue would hold up. "After
the first few months of the fiscal year, the indications are
positive... The South African revenue service may over-perform
once again."
</P>
<P>
He echoed Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals' optimism about
the current account deficit, predicting it would be below 1.5
percent of GDP this year. At the beginning of the year,
economists predicted two percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the currency crisis, Manuel said the weak Rand
would enhance the country's competitiveness and "the worst of the
shocks" in terms of bad news from South Africa were over.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- China will reach child
development goals by 2000 as scheduled in cooperation with the
United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef), according to Chinese and
Unicef officials.
</P>
<P>
Cooperative programs are being carried out "successfully and
smoothly" in wide-ranging fields, including immunization programs
for children, poverty eradication, lowering mortality rates for
pregnant women and infants, spreading compulsory education and
providing assistance to poverty-stricken children, according to
Vice Minister Sun Zhenyu, from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Unicef's Beijing office and a dozen of
Chinese government departments met here today to review the
partially completed 1996-2000 Program.
</P>
<P>
The program allows the Chinese government to use 145 million US
dollars in Unicef funds to develop health, education and water
supply facilities, as well as to promote social development in
poverty-stricken areas and assist handicapped children.
</P>
<P>
The ministries of health, education, water resources and civil
affairs, and organizations for both women and the handicapped have
joined the program.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation has produced "successful and efficient practices"
related to expanding immunization programs, preventing iodine
deficiency diseases and various other programs, according to
Keshab Mathema, the Unicef representative to China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Unicef officials agree that successful cooperation
will help China achieve goals outlined in the National Action
Program for Child Development in China which is scheduled to end
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the program is to dramatically reduce the mortality
rate for pregnant women, infants and children under the age of
five, as well as to improve quality of drinking water, promote
compulsory education, eradicate illiteracy, and support programs
in minority, border and poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Unicef has provided about 300 million US dollars to help
develop China's women's and children's programs since the two
sides restored relations in 1979.

HONG KONG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks shed 917.79
points, or 11.6 percent, to close the week's trading just above
the 7,000-point mark under the pressure of rising interbank

Monday the market tumbled 383.43 points, or 4.83 percent, to

Trading was jittery before the interim results from banking group
HSBC and revised first-quarter GDP growth figures, both of which
came right after the market closed.

Short-covering brought the index modestly higher Tuesday when

Kong stock prices to a six-week low of 7,466.43, with a dip of

Thursday rising local interbank rates over fears of a new round

TOKYO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi

"At the moment, I am not planning to visit the shrine," Obuchi

<HEADLINE> 40 People Killed in Nairobi Bomb Blast: Red Cross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Forty people were killed in the
huge bomb blast which destroyed a building next to the U.S.
Embassy in the commercial area of Nairobi Friday morning, the
International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) estimated here.
</P>
<P>
Nina Galbe, the ICRC information officer, said about 400
people were injured and the casualty figures were expected to
rise.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rescue workers were still looking for victims
under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
At least two big buses full of passengers were seriously
damaged as they passed the building when the bomb blew up, the
Kenya Television Network (KTN) reported, adding that most of the
passengers were feared dead.
</P>
<P>
The explosion was suspected to be caused by a car bomb outside
the 26-story Cooperative House on the right of the U.S. embassy.
The building's top three stories had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell was seen to be taken out
into an ambulance vehicle, blood in the face.
</P>
<P>
People were seen hurt and burned and running away in panic
following the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Cooperative House hosts Kenya's Trade Ministry offices
where it is reported that a meeting between Trade Minister Joseph
Kamotho and Bushnell was held Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kenya Television Network (KTN) said at its 1:00
p.m. news broadcasting that the trade minister was not hurt and
has returned to his house safely.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Police spokesman William Changole asked people to
withdraw from the downtown area so as to give space for the
rescue work.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what is behind the explosion in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Police, ambulances and fire trucks were seen rushing to the
scene and severe traffic jam was formed in downtown and nearby
suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Crews Constantly Monitor North Flood Gate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Yu Liangjun has spent the day
constantly checking equipment at the North Flood Gate on the banks
of the Yangtze River to ensure its soundness if the call comes for
the diversion of flood waters.
</P>
<P>
The gate is one of major flood diversion facilities along the
Yangtze in central Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The gate was built in 1952 and was used for flood water
discharges on three occasions in 1954 when a deadly deluge
devastated central China and killed over 33,000 people.
</P>
<P>
A memorial plaque on the gate commemorates anti-flood efforts
in 1954 in the following inscription penned by Mao Zedong: "Trying
to complete the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project to protect the
interests of the people."
</P>
<P>
"We will respond to any diversion order by dynamiting the
cofferdams to release flood water," according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
"We conducted a simulation exercise in 1996," said Yu, adding
that routine maintenance has since been carried out to ensure the
normal operation of all equipment. He pointed out that some 80-odd
people work at the gate.
</P>
<P>
Taipingkou Village, home to nearly 3,000 villagers, sits in
close proximity to the gate. Most villagers had been evacuated
since 18:00 on Thursday, with only a skeleton crew remaining to
protect the property of local residents.
</P>
<P>
Livestock has also been moved to higher ground, while small
animals such as ducks and geese have been left to fend for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no reports about criminal activities,"
according to a local member of the public security bureau. He
said, "people are abandoning their belongings and moving to safe
areas,"
</P>
<P>
Chinese reporters, the majority of whom work in the Hubei news
media, have flocked to the scene.
</P>
<P>
Hydrometric Patrol Boat No.207 was the only vessel operating
this afternoon in the Yangtze River section near the gate in
Gong'an County, central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Local hydrometric teams continue to constantly measure water
levels to provide updated reports to flood control departments
which are considering the possibility of dynamiting levees to
divert flood water and protect major.
</P>
<P>
"This section of the channel has doubled the normal width of
1,500 meters," according to one worker.
</P>
<P>
The new flood crest, the fourth of the year, has raised water
levels well beyond the danger level, with water rising 44.81
meters by 19:00 on Friday. Rising water levels have been
accompanied by a flow rate of 47,500 cu.m./second.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary plans for the diversion to be carried out when
water level reaches 45 meters, according to a local official in
charge of flood control.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Pledges Utmost Efforts to Revive Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi pledged Friday to take "decisive, swift" steps to
revitalize the ailing economy and resolve the bad-loan problems of
Japanese banks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to do my best at the risk of the cabinet to
put the Japanese economy back on a recovery track in a year or
two," Obuchi, who became prime minister on July 30, said in his
first policy speech at an extraordinary Diet (parliament) session.
</P>
<P>
The best way for Japan to contribute to the rest of Asia and the
world was to put its own financial system in order and revive the
economy, Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
His government would seek cooperation for the early passage of
bills to stabilize the financial system, including a bridge bank
plan to solve the bad-loan mess of Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to jump-start the economy, Obuchi said the government
would work out a second supplementary budget worth more than 10
trillion yen (about 69.2 billion dollars) for fiscal 1998, which
started April 1.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to implement "permanent" individual and
corporate tax cuts worth more than six trillion yen (about 41.5
billion dollars) next year.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to lower the highest rate of the
combined national and local individual income taxes to 50 percent
next January from the current 65 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also said the government would reduce the effective rate
of corporate taxes next April to 40 percent from 46.36 percent in
a bid to enable Japanese companies to compete on an equal footing
with companies in countries with a lower rate.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said he would freeze the Fiscal Structural Reform Law
"for some time" to stimulate the economy and would seek Diet
approval for the move during its next regular session.
</P>
<P>
The November 1997 law calls for restraints on government
spending to restructure the nation's finances burdened with huge
deficits. It was revised in late May to cope with the economic
setback.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also expressed his resolve to carry out administrative
reform aimed at reorganizing Japan's existing 22 government
ministries and agencies to 13 by January 2001.
</P>
<P>
Through the reform, deregulation and decentralization, Obuchi
pledged to make "efforts to realize a 20 percent cut in the
regular number of public servants and a 30 percent cut in costs".
</P>
<P>
Turning to foreign policy, Obuchi promised that Japan would
offer "as much assistance as possible" as part of the leadership
role it plans to take in helping Asia countries recover from their
monetary and financial crises.
</P>
<P>
"Japan and China, both bearing responsibilities for the
stability and prosperity of the whole Asia-Pacific region, should
extend their relationship to further develop dialogue and exchange
beyond merely bilateral ties, but with an eye to the international
community," Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also reconfirmed that Tokyo-Washington ties constitute
the center of Japan's diplomacy and said, "It is of importance to
establish even better and stronger bilateral relations in a wide
variety of fields including security and economy."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Japan's relations with Russia, Obuchi said he
would strive to conclude a peace treaty by the year 2000 by
resolving disputes over four Russian-held islands off Japan's
northernmost main island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
Repeating Tokyo's position that nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan in May cannot be tolerated, Obuchi said Japan "will take
the initiative in maintaining and strengthening the nuclear
nonproliferation regime, promoting nuclear disarmament and
(taking) realistic approaches toward a world free of nuclear
weapons."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces Framework for Corporate Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim Friday announced the
approach and framework of the Corporate Debt Restructuring
Committee formed to ensure that viable businesses continue to
receive financing for their operations.
</P>
<P>
The measures to be taken by the committee would generate
economic activities and help Malaysia's economic recovery in the
process, Anwar told a press conference here Friday, at which also
present were Anwar's two deputies Affifuddin Omar and Wong See
Wah, Bank Negara (state bank) Deputy Governor Fong Weng Phak and
Securities Commission Chairman Mohd Munir Abdul Majid.
</P>
<P>
The salient features of the committee's approach does not have
any legal status, Anwar said, adding that debt workout will be on
a voluntary basis involving debtors as well as domestic and
foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
He said the five-member committee will be chaired by the deputy
governor of Bank Negara, with the other members comprising one
representative from the Treasury and three from the private sector
with experience in the legal, accounting and banking fields.
</P>
<P>
The committee will commence operation on August 17 and continue
to operate until the end of 1999 or earlier, which will be decided
by the members themselves.
</P>
<P>
A full-time secretariat will be set up at Bank Negara to assist
the committee, according to Anwar.
</P>
<P>
The approach does not lay down "rules" but general principles
governing how creditors and debtors could conduct themselves in
that workout.
</P>
<P>
Among the principles of debt restructuring is that debt workout
is on a voluntary basis and could be initiated by either the
debtor or creditor and any debt restructuring should be for viable
businesses and decisions should be made based on complete and
accurate information which has been independently verified by an
appointed consultant, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said creditors should agree on a standstill period of 60
days (extendible on special circumstances) so that informed and
orderly decisions could be made.
</P>
<P>
Another rule is that each of the private restructuring process
must be completed expeditiously and within the specified time
frame, he added.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said on the operational side of the committee, there
would be a briefing to the chief executives of banking
institutions especially on the details of the debt restructuring
framework.
</P>
<P>
Corporations may seek the assistance of the committee to
approach the creditors for possible debt restructuring, he said,
adding "Banking institutions may on their own identify
corporations for possible debt workout."
</P>
<P>
In all cases, the corporations which were identified must
fulfill four criteria, which include viable businesses, having
outstanding debt of 50 million ringgit (11.99 million U.S.
dollars) or more, borrowings from more than three creditors, and
not placed under receivership or liquidation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said banking institutions should continue with their own
efforts in debt workouts for their customers which fall outside
this approach and that small borrowers could channel their
requests for assistance to the loan monitoring unit (LMU) at Bank
Negara.
</P>
<P>
The role of LMU includes continuing to assist borrowers who
face difficulties in securing loans from banks and to facilitate
banks to continue to provide financial support to viable
businesses in accordance with the objectives of corporate debt
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said all existing guidelines and rules
including those on the classification of non-performing loans
would continue to be applicable to loans under consideration for
debt restructuring.

From July 27 to August 3, four scientists at the Institute of
Electronics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences used airborne
radar to monitor and record the microwave image data of 50,000
square kilometers in central China's Hunan Province and east
China's Jiangxi Province, said Shao Yiming, who headed the group.
</P>
<P>
Shao said it is the first time for the L-Band Synthetic
Aperture Radar (L-SAR), which was developed last year as the first
of its kind in China, to be used for a major state task.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, researchers at both the Institute of Electronics and
the Institute of Remote Sensing Application were working
round-the-clock in Beijing to process and analyze the data sent
back from the two provinces, and report the disaster situation to
the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"The image data obtained by the experts at the Institute of
Electronics through radar is a precious reference for both the
appraisal of the current flooding situation and the construction
of anti-flood facilities to combat such big flooding, which only
comes once every 100 years," said Huang Maoheng, vice-governor of
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the technique of microwave imaging is
superior to optical and infra-red imaging because it can function
day and night and will not be affected by weather. It also can be
used for harvest predictions, pollution monitoring, resource
survey and ocean studies.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Electronics began research and development on
microwave imaging radar in 1976. The L-SAR was developed in June
of 1997 by the institute's Engineering Center of Microwave Imaging
Radar System. The radar discovered a part of the ancient Great
Wall underneath sand in northwest China in a flight last year.
</P>
<P>
Since heavy rain began in north China, areas around the Yellow
River and the Haihe River may also be threatened by
flooding. Scientists at the institute are waiting for further
notice from the central government to decide if they should use
radar monitoring in north China's flood areas.

<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Wealth
anticipates that Yemen will start exporting natural gas by the
year 2003, a delay of two years from the originally schedule, the
Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report of the ministry as saying that the
marketing of natural gas is the most important aspect for the
implementation and success of the project during the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The report said the first phase of the project which covers the
feasibility studies, designs and surveys has been completed early
this year, and that the execution stage will begin as soon as
contracts of natural gas sales are signed later in the year.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The total volume of the vocational training market in
Saudi Arabia is estimated at 9 billion Saudi rials (240 million
U.S. dollars), Al Hayat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Deputy General Manager of Saudi Arabia's Al
Charq Plastics factory Sobhi Hashem as saying that the Saudi
vocational training market is the biggest in the Gulf region. It
is expanding by 4 to 6 percent annually in line with the expansion
of the private sector and the high growth of approximately 4
percent in the population of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- The volume of remittances of Tunisian expatriates
during the past 10 years amounted to some 5 billion dollars
and, statistics published Friday by local daily Al Sabah showed.
</P>
<P>
The amount of such remittances in last year stood at 760
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, about 7 percent of the Tunisian people
live abroad, particularly in western European countries, including
57 percent in France alone. The remittances have contributed to
offset the deficit in Tunisia's balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The governor of the Egyptian port city of Port Said
Mustafa Sadeq has disclosed that three new investment projects
will be implemented in the Port Said free zone with joint
Egyptian-Chinese capital of 5 million dollars, the Egyptian daily
Al Ahram reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The projects include a factory for producing radio cassettes,
another for measurement sets, and the third for plastic products.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- An agreement has been signed between Egypt and Eritrea
for the establishment of a permanent exhibition of Egyptian
products in the Eritrean capital city of Asmara, Al Ahram reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to make use of Eritrean ports and the
new navigation line that passes by Eritrea in transporting
Egyptian products and commodities en route to African states.

<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan jewellers are
flocking into Tanzania which has abundant mineral resources, to
make profit out of gems business.
</P>
<P>
A Sri Lankan company SM Gems, for example, plans to invest
some 200,000 U.S. Dollars every month in buying Tanzanite, a
semi-precious stone unique to Tanzania, Business Times reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
SM Gems president Sony Punjabi, during a recent visit to
Tanzania, told the paper that his company will also tap the
potential of other gems.
</P>
<P>
Punjabi said that his company, based in Hong Kong, is seeking
permission from the Tanzanian Ministry of Energy and Minerals to
do business straight with local miners and dealers.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to set up a small lepidary center in the
northern town of Arusha, as well as to help local miners to grasp
the technology of cutting and polishing stones in a bid to
increase their values.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan businessmen used to purchase Tanzanian gems either
through Germany, Hong Kong, Thailand or through individual
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Tanzanian Ministry of Energy
and Minerals#,the east African country currently exports gems
worth 15 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, through cutting and polishing the gems at home and
marketing the export value may climb up to 45 million US Dollars
annually, the source added.

<HEADLINE> Estrada to Work for Release of 22 Kidnapped Filipinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Friday that his administration will cooperate with
the Malaysian government for the release of 22 Filipinos kidnapped
by sea pirates.
</P>
<P>
The Filipinos, crew and passengers of a ship which was missing
four months ago, are reportedly still alive and in the custody of
the kidnappers in a small town bordering Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The pirates are allegedly demanding 22 million pesos (523,810
U.S. dollars) as ransom for their release.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada ruled out the payment of ransom to the kidnappers
as he stressed the government's policy of not giving money to
kidnapping gangs in a press conference held in Davao city, the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"The government does not negotiate, neither does it raise
ransom money," Defense Secretary Oriando Mercado said on the same
occasion.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government said it is ready to cooperate with the
Philippine government in the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were earlier presumed to have died when their
vessel disappeared on April 4 in the Philippine waters.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the chief mate and engineer were recovered by
fishermen a few weeks after the ship sank. Their bodies bore mark
of torture.

<HEADLINE> Rural Children's Health Needs Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Neonatal tetanus, iodine
deficiency and malnutrition are still a threaten to children's
health in rural China, an official with the Ministry of Health
said today.
</P>
<P>
"Disease prevention and treatment remains an arduous task in
rural areas, especially poor areas," Wang Longde, vice-minister of
health, told a conference of the United Nations Children's Fund in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the most serious diseases of children in those areas
are neonatal tetanus and iodine deficiency, while the incidence of
growth retardation among children under 5 years old has been
lingering above 30 percent in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the hygiene problem with water supply and latrines
and the environmental problems as well as the spreading of
Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) and AIDS are challenging the
health of rural children.
</P>
<P>
"This poses a potential risk which could affect the quality of
the future labor force, and in turn hinder the country's economic
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, rural residents often suffer from delayed
care-seeking, which is caused by the underdeveloped economy and
health care, and inadequate knowledge of first aid and basic
health care.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Health Ministry is working on a plan to improve
medical service in rural areas, which includes promoting a basic
medi-care system for farmers, providing basic services to women
and children, and improving medical services in poor areas and in
the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that China is going to hold a national conference on
environmental sanitation, which aims at improving hygiene in rural
areas. The Health Ministry also plans to launch health education
activities in rural areas, with the help of the All-China Women's
Federation and the Ministry of Education.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Development Fund Urged in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A high-powered committee has
proposed the setting up of an industrial development fund with a
view to expediting Bangladesh's industrial sector, a major English
daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, headed by Lutfor Rahman Sarkar, governor of
Bangladesh Bank, the central bank of the country, submitted to the
government the proposal last week for approval, The Financial
Express quoted an official source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was under active consideration of the government
because of the dearth of funds in the banks for long and
medium-term financing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the specialized financing institutions for industrial
financing were facing serious fund crisis because of huge default
loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are two specialized financing institutions for industrial
financing, but long and medium-term financing "is almost closed"
in these two banks, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The nationalized commercial banks "are also showing less
interest" in long and medium-term financing because of shortage of
funds resulted from the huge amount of default loans.
</P>
<P>
In its recommendations, the committee said creation of the fund
was necessary for speedy industrial development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Before setting up a permanent structure, the fund could
primarily be regulated by an independent "Industrial Development
Fund Board of Directors" under the Bangladesh Bank, the committee
stated, adding that the fund should be finally be run by a
non-bank investment company, which "will be a government-private
joint venture".
</P>
<P>
The company would finance in both local and foreign currency,
but it would preferably provide and realize loan in foreign
currency to avoid any possible loss by "investment risk".
</P>
<P>
The fund would be created from three sources -- sale proceeds
of foreign currency bonds, fund from the International Finance
Corporation and special funding by the government, the committee
said.
</P>
<P>
The committee also proposed introducing 5, 7 and 10-year term
foreign currency bonds immediately to start collecting resources
for the fund.

NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Ten people died in the huge bomb
blast Friday morning which destroyed a tall building in downtown
Nairobi next to the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
At least two big buses full of passengers were seriously

<HEADLINE> Suspects Involved In Taiwanese Woman's Death Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Four men suspected of being
involved in the death of Lin Ti-chuan, a Taiwanese woman who was
killed during a recent business trip to the mainland, have been
arrested, China's Public Security Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
One of the four, Huang Shidong, was apprehended in Mulan County
in northernmost Heilongjiang Province at 3 p.m. on Tuesday. A
second, Zhang Shifeng, was apprehended at about 11 a.m. yesterday
morning on a train going from Yantai in east China's Shandong
Province to Shanghai. Yang Rongxi, the third, was caught at about
4 p.m. yesterday in the port city of Dalian in northeastern
Liaoning Province. The fourth, Zhao Chuang turned himself in to
the public security department in the city of Haicheng in Liaoning
at about 5 p.m. yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary investigation and interrogation,
Lin's kidnapping was plotted by Li Guangzhi, a businessman from
Dalian, who was attempting to force his Taiwanese business partner
Wei Tien-kang to pay some money Wei owed him. Li invited both Wei
and Lin, who was accompanying Wei, to Dalian and, upon their
arrival on the evening of July 27 they were abducted by the four
men and taken to an empty room in the Haicheng Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
Yang Rongxi gave Wei and Lin several injections to knock them
out, but Lin began to suffer respiratory difficulties and turned
pale around 11 a.m. on July 29. Huang then sent her to the
Haicheng Central Hospital. When he discovered that Lin had died,
he fled. His accomplices also fled.
</P>
<P>
At present, the police have started a dragnet to find Li
Guangzhi and are continuing their thorough investigation.

<HEADLINE> Evacuation Underway For Possible Diversion of Yangtze Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Cattle, bearing marks by their
owners, furniture, electric home appliances, and other belongings
of local residents are being moved away at a local ferry in
Gong'an County, in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of residential houses have become vacant with their
doors widely open as local residents were being evacuated to safe
places for a possible diversion of the rampant flood waters.
</P>
<P>
Many villagers are seen walking solemnly along the roads,
mostly carrying luggages on their back or leading a cattle.
</P>
<P>
Although the flood-control authorities, headed by Vice-Premier
Wen Jiabao, are still pondering on whether to break parts of the
Yangtze dykes for diversion, the evacuation to make way for
possible diversion already started 18:00 pm on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 200,000 locals have been relocated by local
government in an organized way. And 130,000 more people are
expected to be resettled in safe places including shelters, safety
platforms and dykes.
</P>
<P>
The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Zone, built in 1952, which is
located in Gong'an County, is designed to divert flood waters to
protect major cities downstream.
</P>
<P>
Local villagers feel quite nervous about the evacuation and the
possible diversion that would flood their dear home.
</P>
<P>
"We did not expect this," a local farmer said, adding that
"because the diversion zone has been used since 1954. But it is
worthwhile doing if needed for saving large cities like Wuhan."
</P>
<P>
The government would compensate for those who sacrifice their
home for the diversion, a local official told Xinhua.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister and
Chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) Gen. Wiranto Friday
said the ABRI is concerned about human rights.
</P>
<P>
The ABRI does not keep its eyes off human rights violations in
the country, Wiranto said during a meeting with ulemas and social
figures in Lhokseumawa in the Special Territory of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
He said that human rights are inherent to each human being and
are endowed by God, and the abuse of power to oppress other
people's rights is a tyrannical act which God condemns.
</P>
<P>
"If there are still erring soldiers who have evaded (the law),
we all believe that sooner or later they will get punishment from
God," he was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"As ABRI chief, I sincerely hope for assistance from ulemas and
social figures to help build up the character of soldiers, who are
part of the Aceh community," Wiranto added.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, between 1989 when the
country's westernmost special territory was declared a military
operation zone and 1992, about 2,000 people were killed in
military operations. About a thousand more civilians were detained
on suspicion of supporting the Free Aceh Movement.
</P>
<P>
"ABRI must stop treating dissenting civilians like enemies in a
war. And it must do so without delay, or not only will ABRI lose
all credibility, the country and the nation will be placed in
danger of disintegration," warned the Jakarta Post.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Sets Up "Millennium Bug" Buster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has set
up a "millennium bug" buster and ordered all government agencies
to avail of its services to avert a potentially disastrous crash
in their computer systems by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said in a news release
Friday that he also directed the Technology and Livelihood
Research Center to formulate and provide cost-effective solution
package to the problem especially for government offices.
</P>
<P>
Estrada required all availing government offices to allocate
funds from their existing resources and savings for their
respective solution package in order to render their
computer-based systems millennium compliant by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said prior to the establishment of the buster, no specific
plan has been developed, much less implemented, to tackle the
problem pestering computer systems worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Computerized government agencies had been ordered to formulate
year 2000 conversion plans by institutions like the Central Bank,
Securities and Exchange Commission and National Computer Center,
but no definite corrective actions had been undertaken.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug problem traced its roots four decades ago
when computer technologies established the data in both computer
software and diskettes as a two digit number, such as 98, to save
storage space.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, with the use of two digits, the year 2000
will be stored as "00", which for humans will mean that year, but
computers could read it differently, like 1900, 1800 or even 1700.

<HEADLINE> 19 Congolese Ex-Refugees Flee Back to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 7 (Xinhua)--Nineteen former Congolese
refugees have returned to their previous sanctuary in western
Tanzania in a bid to escape from the fighting between the army
rebels and the forces loyal to President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Local media reported Friday that the ex-refugees, leaving
Uvira in the eastern part of DRC, arrived in Kigoma in western
Tanzania on Wednesday morning aboard a Tanzanian registered boat,
Mv Let Them Say.
</P>
<P>
The Kigoma Regional Police Commander, Placid Chaka, was quoted
as saying that they have been sheltered at the Kibirizi refugee
holding centre on the shores of Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
"They are all safe," he said. "The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Ministry of Home
Affairs (of Tanzania) are screening them to find out whether they
deserve to be accorded the refugee status."
</P>
<P>
Chaka said that the 19 former refugees had been sheltered in
Kigoma before they were voluntarily repatriated this year to the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
Earliy this week, the UNHCR has suspended the repatriation of
Congolese refugees from western Tanzania to the DRC following an
army rebellion in the east part of DRC.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the UNHCR Branch Office in Dar es Salaam said
Wednesday that they are closely monitoring the situation in that
area and have made appropriate preparations for possible new
arrivals of the Congolese refugees.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53,971 Congolese refugees have been voluntarily
repatriated from the UNHCR camps in western Tanzania since the
operation began last September till the end of July.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said, some 48,000 Congolese refugees
still remain in Tanzania, waiting for repatriation to their home
country.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese refugees have crossed the border to the western
border areas of Tanzania since late 1996, fleeing a civil war
between soldiers led by Laurent Kabila, the current DRC
president, and the Zairean army of former president Mobutu
Sese-seko who died later in exile in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
A UNHCR report says that as of June 30 this year, Tanzania
accommodates a total of 331,538 refugees from neighbouring DRC,
Burundi, Rwanda and Somali.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Central Bank Changes Inflation Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) has revised
its projected target for the reduction of inflation from nine percent
as announced in the 1998 budget to 15 percent by the end of this year
and the GDP to four percent from 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This has been necessitated by a number of dynamic issues in
the Zambian economy and some regulations that will need to be put
in place, said Flix Kani, director of the Economics Department at
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Some of the major causes to the failure to achieve the desired
targets include the decline of the country's agricultural output
due to the EL Nino phenomenon, a report of Zambia Daily Mail said
Friday,
</P>
<P>
The delayed privatization of the remaining mines of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) and the withholding of the
balance of payment support by donors are also attributed to the
failure.
</P>
<P>
Zambia spent 40 million U.S. Dollars to import food last year.
And this year more food will be imported to ease the country's
food shortage.
</P>
<P>
Government officials disclosed that the Zambian government
tried every means to lobby worldwide for the sale of its Nkana
and Nchanga mines, which represent 65 percent of the country's
copper output, but no potential buyers have showed serious
interest in buying them till now.
</P>
<P>
However, the completion of privatizing all the ZCCM mines is a
precondition set at a consultative meeting between the Zambian
government and its western donors in Paris last May to release a
pledged aid of 530 million U.S. Dollars to Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S.-Philippine War Games Arouse Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- American and Philippine warships
and aircraft staged live-fire war games in the South China Sea
earlier this week, and this has aroused fierce debates in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to a Philippine navy spokesman, the 18-hour military
exercises were held "outside the Philippine territorial waters"
Wednesday because of the absence of a bilateral agreement
governing such maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
However, the exercises have aroused intense debates in the
country, especially in the Senate, which is under pressure for the
ratification of the controversial Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).
</P>
<P>
The VFA, which was signed by Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon and U.S. Ambassador Thomas Hubbard in February,
allows the resumption of military exercises between the two
countries and opens the Philippines' 22 ports to the U.S.
military.
</P>
<P>
Washington halted all joint exercises in the Philippines and
visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996 when Manila ended a
legal loophole that had shielded U.S. military personnel from
prosecution by the Philippines for crimes committed in the island
country.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the accord limited the Philippine government's
right to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes, as it
gives the U.S. jurisdiction over soldiers who commit crimes while
on duty, and the Philippine jurisdiction over crimes committed
while off-duty.
</P>
<P>
Because of the controversies, the Philippine Senate has not yet
begun deliberations on the VFA.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that by conducting such war games,
Washington and Manila are trying to push the Senate for an early
ratification of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
But some senators questioned the legality of the war games
since the exercises were staged without the VFA, while some
activists described the war games as part of the U.S. government's
program to "hard-sell" the VFA by creating an atmosphere of
discord with the Philippines' neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Senator Raul Roco said that the Philippine Constitution
stipulates that after the expiration of the Philippine-U.S.
Military Base Agreement in the early 1990s, foreign military
troops will not be allowed in the country except under a treaty
concurred in by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Senator Rodolfo Biazon questioned the motive
behind the war games as the exercise was held when Washington is
seeking the early approval of the VFA.
</P>
<P>
"Are these part of the friendly persuasion efforts of the VFA?"
he asked.
</P>
<P>
Military ties with the United States have remained a sensitive
issue in the Philippines since the Philippine Senate forced the
closure of the last U.S. base in the country in 1992, ending
nearly a century of U.S. military presence in its former colony.
</P>
<P>
Senator Aquilino Pimentel said that the VFA provision on
criminal jurisdiction was an attempt by the Americans to foist an
"anachronistic" rule of 1950s vintage.
</P>
<P>
Other senators accused President Joseph Estrada of lobbying for
the Senate's ratification of the agreement by approving the war
games.
</P>
<P>
However, President Estrada said Thursday that he and Defense
Secretary Orlando Mercado were not informed ahead of the war
games.
</P>
<P>
He said that navy and air force officials will be asked to
explain why they did not inform the country's top officials of the
military exercises.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exercises were scheduled during the
administration of his predecessor, Fidel Ramos, who stepped down
on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, one of the 12 senators who had voted in 1991 against
the continued stay of U.S. military base in the country, said that
he is not stampeding the senators into approving the VFA, and will
respect the Senate's decision.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he reiterated his defense of the VFA and his
support for the ratification, saying it could enhance the
country's security.
</P>
<P>
Although both the government and the military denied the
linkage between the VFA and the war games, observers said the
exercises were part of their efforts to push for the early
ratification of the VFA.
</P>
<P>
The World News newspaper said in a commentary Friday that
Washington is so anxious for the ratification of the VFA that it
conducted such war games to promote the approval of the agreement
by the Philippine Senate.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Seeks Closer Ties in Caribbean, Latin America (1) by Xinhua Writer Liu Yunfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- While enhancing relations with
other countries, China has intensified its diplomatic efforts to
strengthen links with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Ties between China and that region were cemented by a visit of
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen to five Caribbean nations late
last month: Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba and
Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
Qian described the trip as "being positive and achieving
anticipated objectives."
</P>
<P>
An unofficial Chinese delegation has also been visiting the
Caribbean where non-governmental celebrities from both sides
discussed how to foster Sino-Caribbean friendship for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean island nations belong to many Latin American
associations and are often politically linked with South America.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion early this month at a seminar in
Kingston, Jamaica, the first in nearly 50 years, participants from
17 countries expressed a willingness to facilitate friendship and
cooperation between China and the Latin American-Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite rarely seen in China's diplomatic work in recent
years that official action, together with unofficial exchanges,
have been put in motion almost simultaneously," a local observer
said.
</P>
<P>
He called it a "clear exhibition" of the interest and desire of
both sides to expand their ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian said during his visit that China is willing to bring a
stable Sino-Caribbean relationship into the 21st century based on
equality, mutual support and expanding cooperation.
</P>
<P>
There have been frequent high-level exchange of visits between
leaders of China and the region since the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have become acquainted with many Latin American
leaders from north to south in the region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has engaged in several dialogues with the
Rio Group, the largest organization for political coordination in
Latin America which includes Caribbean nations in an observer
status.

<TEXT>
<P>
"These fully show the shared interests of the two sides," said
Xu Shicheng, a professor at the Institute of Latin American
Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no impending issue between China and
Latin America, thus laying a sound foundation for the growth of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"There are many kinds of rich natural resources in Latin
America like oil and iron ore, and Chinese investment is welcome
to Latin America to be involved in natural resource exploitation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Moneta, permanent secretary of the Latin American
Economic System, said there is great potential for economic and
trade cooperation between Latin America and China.
</P>
<P>
He added that better understanding of each other will enable
both sides to achieve a "breakthrough" in this area.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume with Latin America in the first five
months reached nearly 3 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 12.4
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
China has so far launched more than 200 solely invested
enterprises or joint ventures in Latin America. It also became an
official member of the Caribbean Development Bank in January of
1998.
</P>
<P>
Although Sino-Latin American relations have been developing
well, analysts said, some barriers in bilateral relationships need
to be removed.
</P>
<P>
They said the main problem in bilateral relationships is that a
small number of countries in the region have no diplomatic
relations with China because of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Qian clearly stated in his Caribbean tour that the Chinese
government is prepared to set up and develop normal state-to-state
relations with those countries.
</P>
<P>
The Bahamas and St. Lucia, both in the Caribbean, established
diplomatic relations with China last year.
</P>
<P>
"St. Lucia has proceeded in a direction which the majority of
the states of the world have already trod by establishing
diplomatic links with the People's Republic of China," said
St. Lucia's Prime Minister Kenny Anthony.
</P>
<P>
A new relationship featuring mutual trust politically, more
economic cooperation and mutual support in the international arena
appear to be the common objectives of the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Pak National Assembly Condemns Indian Firing on LoC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's National Assembly
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Friday condemned the
unprovoked Indian shelling on civilians from across the Line of
Control (LoC) in disputed Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
The committee urged the international community to take note of
India's aggressive designs.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the committee Abdul Waheed told a press conference
that the committee has adopted a resolution strongly condemning
the unprovoked Indian aggression as well as New Delhi's reign of
suppression in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"We have urged the international community to take note of
Indian brutal aggression against innocent civilians and stop its
reign of repression against Kashmiri men and commissions of
offense against women in the occupied Kashmir," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged the United Nations, Asia Watch and other
international bodies to stop New Delhi from carrying out its
brutalities and atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Waheed said that the heavy Indian firing on civilians in
Pakistan-held Kashmir this week also aims at pressurizing
Pakistan, the Kashmiris and Muslims living in India.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the recent unprovoked firing has proved that
Kashmir is a live dispute and needs international mediation for
peace and security in the region.

<HEADLINE> Large Gas Field Found in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 7 (Xinhua)-- A large natural gas field,
estimated to have gas reserves of more than 100 billion cubic
meters, has been discovered in the Junggar Basin of northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Tests have shown that the field has a 59-meter oil layer,
covering an area of more than 1,000 square kilometres, according
to a recent survey by the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration.
</P>
<P>
Located in the hinterlands of the Kurbantongut Desert, 150
kilometres from Karamay where the country's fourth largest oil
field is located, this gas field had shown signs of gas reserves
before, but bad weather in the desert stopped further exploration.
</P>
<P>
On August 3, one of the four wildcat wells began to gush oil
after it had been drilled to a depth of 4,438 meters, and its
daily output has reached more than 70,000 cubic meters and 46 tons
of light oil.

<HEADLINE> Shandong's Trade with Republic of Korea Rebounds in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Trade between east China's Shandong
Province and the Republic of Korea (ROK) rebounded in June, with
both exports and imports hitting this year's highs, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's trade with ROK reached 390 million U.S. dollars in
June, a surge of 39 percent over May. Imports in June rocketed
47.6 percent to 270 million U.S. dollars, while exports jumped
22.3 percent to 120 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Surging crude oil and coal exports and rising imports by
overseas-funded enterprises were the major driving forces behind
the rebound of trade between Shandong and ROK, according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
After the introduction of new preferential tax policies at the
beginning of this year, ROK invested 130 million U.S. dollars in
equipment and materials in Shandong in the first half of this
year, a jump of 82.5 percent from the corresponding period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's imports from ROK include rubber, corn, pulp,
plastics, electronics, automatic digital processing equipment,
steel and refined oil, while exports include crude oil, cement,
raw materials, textiles and garments.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Dollar Appears to Be Stabilizing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The troubled Zimbabwe Dollar
appears to be stabilizing after a heavy bashing against other
currencies early this week, the daily Herald newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Banks Thursday were buying U.S. Dollars at an average rate of
20 Zimbabwean Dollars and selling them for 22.5 Zimbabwe
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers interviewed Thursday said that more exporters were
off-loading their foreign receipts, bringing the much-needed
liquidity to the market while only importers with payment
commitments were demanding foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Dollar came under heavy import pressure early
this week as panic-gripped importers rushed to buy foreign
currency, creating a shortage on the market.
</P>
<P>
At one stage, 28 Zimbabwean Dollars were tading one U.S.
Dollar before the country's central bank, Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe, the central bank, took a corrective measure by raising
the rediscount rate -- the rate at which banks borrow -- from
31.5 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the Zimbabwe Dollar is stabilizing with
suggestions that it was overvalued and the market is
correcting the anomaly.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States has offered
advanced anti-terrorist training for Sri Lankan police to face the
growing challenges in operations against Tamil rebels, according
to the Island newspaper here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The training is organized through the Anti-Terrorist Assistant
Program (ATAP) of the State Department, an authoritative
spokesperson for the U.S. Information Service told the Island
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen officers and men have come to Sri Lanka. They have been
selected to train in the art of defusing different types of
explosive devices, the spokesperson was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The six-week-long course will help Sri Lankan police improve
its capabilities, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four other officers and men have commenced a 3-week
course aimed at enhancing police capability to protect vital
installations.
</P>
<P>
The course has also been aimed at improving and expanding
ongoing police operations against the Tamil rebels' attempts to
target vital installations in Colombo and provincial towns, the
reports added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. increased ties with Sri Lankan military in 1995. Since
then Sri Lankan government forces have been given advanced
training conducted through the U.S. Pacific Command.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- University students who have
difficulty continuing their education in central China's Henan
Province will receive a monthly subsidy from the provincial
government for the coming semester.
</P>
<P>
The project, guided by the provincial Education Bureau, will
provide 120 yuan (around 15 U.S. dollars) to each poor student
every month.
</P>
<P>
Henan, which has the largest population in China, has more than
50 universities of 130,000 students. About 80 percent of the
students come from relatively impoverished rural areas. Some of
them can hardly subsist, which affects their schooling and health.
</P>
<P>
The bottom-line subsidies will be allocated to 5,000 poor
students. In addition, related students will also receive
scholarships, loans and other kinds of financial aid.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Mayor Kidnapped by Kurdish Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish mayor, along with
three other people, has been kidnapped by a group of Kurdish
militants in southeastern Turkey, the Daily News newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The car of Naci Orhan, mayor of Bahcesaray city in the
province of Van, was stopped by rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) on a road outside Bahcesaray Wednesday
night. Orhan and three others were abducted by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale operation has been launched by the security
forces to find the kidnapped official in the nearby areas. Two
PKK militants were killed in an exchange of fire with the
troops.
</P>
<P>
The incident came shortly after the Emergency Rule Region
Office issued a statement saying that 165 PKK rebels had been
killed over the past week.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that a group of PKK militants attacked a
military post in southeastern Turkey early this week, killing 15
Turkish soldiers and kidnapping 10 others. But this was not
confirmed by officials.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a guerilla war since 1984 to
establish an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, in
which over 35,000 people have been killed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Heart Failure Death Rate Down Between 1988-1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A study released Thursday
said that the death rate due to heart failure among U.S. adults
has been declining since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The study by the Federal Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDCP) said that the heart failure death rate has
fallen roughly one percent per year between 1988 and 1995, with
the largest average annual decline in black men (3 percent),
followed by black women (2.2 percent), white men (1.7 percent) and
white women (0.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
Other figures in the study showed that in 1988 heart failure
killed 117 per 100,000 people aged 65 or above. In 1995, the last
year for which statistics were available, heart failure killed 108
per 100,000 people over the age of 65, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Experts credited drugs introduced in the late 1980s, called
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in part for the
decline of death rate between 1988 and 1995. They also credited
improved tracking by doctors of high-risk individuals and early
intervention after heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
The study particularly pointed out that the sharper decline of
death rate among blacks seen in the 1995 figures may be because of
better access to medical care and improved control of high blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Reducing fat and salt intake, maintaining a proper weight,
quitting smoking and exercising can help prevent both hypertension
and heart attack, thus reducing the risk of heart failure, the
CDCP study recommanded.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Central Bank Slashes Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Central Bank has
decided to slash its key lending rates by 1.5 percentage, local
daily The Jerusalem Post reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said following the change, which will take effect
on Sunday, the key lending rates will be 9.5 percent, the lowest
level since November 1993.
</P>
<P>
The move was part of a package deal worked out by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman and
Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The other elements of the deal, which was aimed at spurring
the economic growth, included setting next year's inflation
target at 4 percent and a technical change to the exchange rate
mechanism of foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
And before Frenkel formally announced the cut of the interest
rates on Thursday, the Finance Ministry also presented its 1999
budget to the cabinet the same day.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicted that this year's economic growth will be
1.5 percent, its lowest this decade, but it could rebounce to 2.5
percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> American Insurance Firm Aims High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The American International
Assurance Co. Ltd. has vowed to be one of the most welcome
insurance firms in this economic and financial center of China.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to do better, to be one of the best insurance
companies in Shanghai," said Nysco Shu, general manager of the
American insurer, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
American International, which was present in Shanghai as early
as 1931, became the first licensed overseas insurance company in
this metropolis in 1992. In May of this year, American
International moved into the building that housed it decades ago.
</P>
<P>
American International's insurance business has been growing
steadily in Shanghai, with premiums in the first half of this year
up 30 percent from the comparable period of last year, according
to Shu.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his hope that more overseas insurance companies would
be allowed to do business in Shanghai and they should compete with
each other in insurance products and services.
</P>
<P>
"Our operation in Shanghai has enabled us to see the huge
potential of the Chinese insurance market and I personally hope
that the Chinese authorities will consider opening more cities to
overseas insurance companies," Shu said.
</P>
<P>
China currently allows a limited number of overseas insurance
companies to sell policies only in Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
American International now has nearly 400 employees and more
than 3,000 sales agents in Shanghai. Its customers exceeds
500,000.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Plunge to Four-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices plunged
to a four-year low this week amid confusion over the future of the
country's massive 1.1 million bale (80.57 million kg) wool
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) said Friday its eastern
market indicator fell 44 Australian cents to 549 Australian cents
(329 U.S. cents) per kg clean when sales resumed in Sydney,
Melbourne and Fremantle after a three-week break.
</P>
<P>
A total of 103,086 bales were offered, with 28.4 percent passed
in.
</P>
<P>
"The industry debate of recent weeks over stockpile disposal
arrangements added an additional negative factor into what was
always going to be a difficult market environment this week," AWEX
said.
</P>
<P>
"Continuing subdued market consumer demand, the traditional
European holiday period, and an extremely large offering of
growers' wool by today's standards provided the basic
ingredients," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government Tuesday announced a freeze on all
sales from the nation's 1.1 million bale wool stockpile for 12
months in a bid to spur on low prices.
</P>
<P>
AWEX said buyers reported little new business in the market.
</P>
<P>
Sales will continue next week in three Australian cities:
Sydney, Adelaide and Fremantle, with 81,000 bales rostered for
sale.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia is reinforcing its troops
on its border with Latvia as Latvia unilaterally defined the border
line in July, said Russia's Federal Border Service director
Nikolai Bordyuzha on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Latvia's move will not affect Russia's territory and security,
Bordyuzha said, adding Russian frontier troops will protect the border
and never have it changed.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two nations got seriously strained twice
this year, first by clashes between Russian-speaking Latvians and
local police in Rica on March 3 and, then by Russia-exerted
economic pressure on Latvia in April because of an explosion near
the Russian embassy in Latvia.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Farmers Register Trademark for Jindun Watermelons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 7 (Xinhua)-- This summer watermelons with a
special trademark "Jindun" sell very well on the market in the
East China region in spite of the price decline caused by a bumper
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Jindun watermelons, grown in Jindun Town of Dafeng City in East
China's Jiangsu Province, sell for 0.5-to-1 yuan per kilogram,
much higher than the average price of 0.3-to-0.4 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Hefei, a farmer of Rennan Village of Jindun Town, said: "I
have planted watermelons for years, but never have had such a good
sale. One watermelon can earn twice as much as before, because we
have registered a trademark for our melons."
</P>
<P>
Jindun Town is noted for its watermelons in the East China
region which includes Shanghai, Nanjing and Suzhou. But in recent
years some watermelons from other parts of the country, falsely
labeled as Jindun melons, were sold on the market.
</P>
<P>
In March of this year, the melon growers of Jindun Town set up
a watermelon association under the local government. They applied
for the "Jindun" trademark to the administration in charge of
trademarks in the country and printed 100,000 trademarks to stick
on their melons.
</P>
<P>
The watermelons with trademarks caught the consumers' attention
soon after their appearance on the market.
</P>
<P>
Many people turned to Jindun melons and, in Shanghai and
Nanjing, the supply has fallen short of demand.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Hefei has printed many namecards which have his name and
address as well as the advertisement on his melons. While selling
the watermelons, he presents the namecards to customers to add to
the popularity of the trademark.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of industry and commerce in Jiangsu
Province said: "It is a good thing that the farmers registered a
trademark for watermelons. It shows that Chinese farmers have
begun to use the economic laws and regulations to protect their
interests."
</P>
<P>
He added that it was only in recent years that Chinese farmers
began to register trademarks for their products such as grain,
fruits, vegetables and aquatic products.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Breed Sheep With 20-Year-Old Semen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have recently
bred 33 sheep by using 20-year-old frozen semen in northwest
China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Xinjiang Academy of Animal Husbandry
Sciences began the experiment in 1995, using semen collected from
two Australian sheep in 1975.
</P>
<P>
After thawing the semen, scientists used an endoscope to infuse
the semen into the wombs of 69 sheep. Of these, 28 became pregnant
and eventually gave birth to 33 lambs.
</P>
<P>
The artificially bred sheep, now living on a farm in Urumqi,
capital of Xinjiang, are three years old and look exactly like
their Australian fathers of 20 years ago, said scientists.
</P>
<P>
Each of the sheep weighs more than 100 kg and produces 6.85
kg of wool a year.
</P>
<P>
Although the 20-year-old frozen semen had lost much of its
vitality, the utilization of the endoscope method increased the
conception rate, according to Shi Meiying, a researcher at the
academy.
</P>
<P>
Frozen semen has been used to preserve endangered animals,
however the problem of maintaining the frozen semen's vitality has
yet to be solved.
</P>
<P>
The experiment by the Xinjiang scientists has contributed
greatly to this field of research, according to experts.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Increasing Investment in Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province will
spend 72 billion yuan on highway construction during the next five
years, Vice Governor Han Yuqun announced here recently.
</P>
<P>
Most of this money will go to 34 key projects, and upon their
completion in 2002 the total highway mileage in Shandong will
reach 75,000 kilometers, 26,000 of which will be expressways.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 19 new or ongoing projects will cost an
estimated 9.6 billion yuan this year, 60 percent more than
originally planned, Han said.
</P>
<P>
These projects will provide new jobs for 190,000 people and add
3.9 billion yuan to gross domestic product. As a major economic
powerhouse in east China, Shandong is striving to achieve a GDP
growth rate of nine percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Fueled by the heavy demand for investment, the GDP of this
coastal province grew by 10.3 percent in the first half this year
compared with a year ago. The provincial government plans to raise
investments to 221 billion yuan this year, 23 percent more than
last year.
</P>
<P>
Shandong has been one of the five fastest-growing provinces in
China since the 1980s, and its GDP reached 665 billion yuan last
year, ranking third in the country.

<HEADLINE> 2,400 Tangshan Paraplegics Survive 22 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 2,400 paraplegic people
in Tangshan City in north China's Hebei Province have been
surviving for the 22 years since a major earthquake struck the
city and claimed more than 240,000 lives in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas medical authorities believed that these victims
could be expected to survive for only 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The 1976 Tangshan quake also injured 420,000 people while
leaving 3,810 paraplegics.
</P>
<P>
To arrange for the rehabilitation of the paraplegic, the city
established 18 rehabilitation centers, and some enterprises also
opened facilities for paraplegic workers.
</P>
<P>
After completing their special training, nearly all of the
paraplegic people are now able to either partially or
completely take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan also built a wheelchair-accessible rehabilitation
village, where more than 40 paraplegic couples have settled.
</P>
<P>
The annual death rate among those left paraplegic by the
earthquake has stood at only 1.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city also opened several factories and shops where the
handicapped and paraplegic people have been employed.
</P>
<P>
They engage in occupations such as electrical applicance
maintenance, keymaking, photography, and artistic creation.

ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Clouds of war are blotting out
on the Line of Control (LoC) as the rival armies of Pakistan and
India are engaged in their worst kind of cross-border artillery
duel in the disputed Kashmir region.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the prime ministers of Pakistan and India came out
of their meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka, at the end of last month

the armies of the two South Asian nations traded heavy fire along
LoC which, Pakistan blamed, has been triggered by "unprovoked
shelling" by the Indian army.

According to a spokesman from Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, more

in Pakistan-held Kashmir area during the last week as a result of
"India's unprovoked and indiscriminate firing across LoC which
separates the disputed region.
</P>
<P>
The armies of the two rival neighbors, positioned eye ball to

heavy and light machine guns in the clashes which, according to
estimates by the media, have displaced about 20,000 people from
the bordering villages on the Pakistani side.

<P>
The Pakistani government has apprised the United Nations and
the international community of the danger the Indian belligerency
poses to the overall peace and security of the region. It has also

which neither country can afford, especially after the induction

<P>
 new delhi, aug 7 (pti) the export incentive package
unveiled by indian government is insufficient and will provide
only a marginal impetus for exports growth, director general
national council for economic research (ncaer) rakesh mohan
has said.
</P>
<P>
 the incentive package will no doubt improve the
competitiveness of exports by way of reducing the financing
costs and releasing funds blocked in duty drawback within a
time frame. but this alone is not sufficient, he told pti in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
 mohan said more efforts have to be undertaken by the
exporting community through better internal management of
resources and quality control.
</P>
<P>
 +while the package does come as a relief, any turnaround
in exports performance at this juncture would not be enough to
achieve the targetted 20 per cent growth for 1998-99,+ he
added.
</P>
<P>
 exports dipped by 7.9 per cent in the first quarter of
1998-99 and the trade deficit widened to 2.4 billion dollars
reflecting a slide in the fortunes of exporters.
</P>
<P>
 heeding to the complaints of exporters that high cost of
finance was the biggest factor for slow down in exports,
government reduced the interest rates on pre and post-shipment
credits from 11 per cent to 9 per cent as part of its package

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on Chinese Ambassador's Refusal to Attend U.S. Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang issued a statement today on Li Zhaoxing's refusal to
appear at a U.S. congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chinaese ambassador to the United States, refused to attend
a hearing organized by the International Operations and Human
Rights Subcommittee of the International Relations Committee of
the U.S. House of Representatives on the human rights situation in
China.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the Chinese side is willing to have a dialogue on
human rights on the basis of equality and mutual respect. "China,
however, always opposes any attempt to interfere in its internal
affairs under the pretext of human rights," he said, adding that
such a stance is "clear and consistent."
</P>
<P>
China's embassy in the United States has already issued a
statement on the matter, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Li accepted the invitation for a meeting on human rights with
members of the subcommittee "in the spirit of openness and
promoting mutual understanding," the statement said. However, Li
had never agreed to serve as a witness before the subcommittee and
"it is not appropriate for the ambassador to appear as a witness
before the congressional subcommittee" in keeping with general
diplomatic practice, it stated.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the statement indicated that Li always welcomes an
opportunity for a genuine and candid dialogue on human rights
issues with members of the U.S. Congress "on an equal footing and
in a manner acceptable to all."

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Clouds of war are blotting out
on the Line of Control (LoC) as the rival armies of Pakistan and
India are engaged in their worst kind of cross-border artillery
duel in the disputed Kashmir region.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the prime ministers of Pakistan and India came out
of their meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka, at the end of last month
without breaking a deadlock in the much-awaited official talks,
the armies of the two South Asian nations traded heavy fire along
LoC which, Pakistan blamed, has been triggered by "unprovoked
shelling" by the Indian army.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman from Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, more
than 50 civilians have been killed and hundreds of others injured
in Pakistan-held Kashmir area during the last week as a result of
"India's unprovoked and indiscriminate firing across LoC which
separates the disputed region.
</P>
<P>
The armies of the two rival neighbors, positioned eye ball to
eye ball, are reported to be using weapons ranging from mortars to
heavy and light machine guns in the clashes which, according to
estimates by the media, have displaced about 20,000 people from
the bordering villages on the Pakistani side.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has apprised the United Nations and
the international community of the danger the Indian belligerency
poses to the overall peace and security of the region. It has also
warned that the conflict could escalate into a full-fledged war
which neither country can afford, especially after the induction
of the nuclear factor.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India, which conducted a series of tit-for-tat
nuclear tests in May, have fought three wars mainly over Kashmir
since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Situation on Line of Control Takes  Alarming, Worrisome Turn  by Xu Yuenai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Clouds of war are blotting out
on the Line of Control (LoC) as the rival armies of Pakistan and
India are engaged in their worst kind of cross-border artillery
duel in the disputed Kashmir region.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the prime ministers of Pakistan and India came out
of their meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka, at the end of last month
without breaking a deadlock in the much-awaited official talks,
the armies of the two South Asian nations traded heavy fire along
LoC which, Pakistan blamed, has been triggered by "unprovoked
shelling" by the Indian army.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman from Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, more
than 50 civilians have been killed and hundreds of others injured
in Pakistan-held Kashmir area during the last week as a result of
"India's unprovoked and indiscriminate firing across LoC which
separates the disputed region.
</P>
<P>
The armies of the two rival neighbors, positioned eye ball to
eye ball, are reported to be using weapons ranging from mortars to
heavy and light machine guns in the clashes which, according to
estimates by the media, have displaced about 20,000 people from
the bordering villages on the Pakistani side.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has apprised the United Nations and
the international community of the danger the Indian belligerency
poses to the overall peace and security of the region. It has also
warned that the conflict could escalate into a full-fledged war
which neither country can afford, especially after the induction
of the nuclear factor.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India, which conducted a series of tit-for-tat
nuclear tests in May, have fought three wars mainly over Kashmir
since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has always called for a U.N.-sponsored plebiscite to
decide the fate of the Muslim-dominated region. However, India
claims Kashmir as its integral part.
</P>
<P>
India blames Pakistan for abetting about 10-year-old insurgency
in its part of kashmir, which Pakistan firmly denies. Islamabad
says it only extends political, moral and diplomatic support to
the "Kashmir freedom struggle."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that skirmishes between the rival armies
at LoC take place quite often in the disputed region. But tension
mounted between the two estranged neighbors following their
nuclear tests at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, while describing
the situation as "precarious" along the LoC, said that "there is
a limit" to its (Pakistan's) patience.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in a
recent address at the Parliament vowed a firm response to Pakistan
in case of attack on India.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to keeping our borders secure. We will deal
with a firm hand any attack by Pakistan," local newspapers quoted
Vajpayee as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India have had several rounds of talks at various
levels in the past. However, sharp differences over the Kashmir
dispute always led to breakdown.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretaries of the two countries held three rounds of
talks since the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif took
power in February 1997.  The top diplomats of the countries
reached an agreement in Islamabad in June last year charting up an
eight-point priority agenda with peace and security, and Kashmir
topping the list.
</P>
<P>
Differences cropped over the mechanism as to how to deal with
the Kashmir issue. While Islamabad insists that the Kashmir
dispute stands out in the bilateral talks, New Delhi wants the
discussion over the dispute to be part of a "composite process,"
covering all outstanding issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Kashmir issue still stands as the main
obstacle for Pakistan and India to normalize their strained
relations. And the warmongering on LoC is, by any means, not
has said.
</P>
<P>
 the incentive package will no doubt improve the
competitiveness of exports by way of reducing the financing
costs and releasing funds blocked in duty drawback within a
time frame. but this alone is not sufficient, he told pti in

exporting community through better internal management of

in exports performance at this juncture would not be enough to
achieve the targetted 20 per cent growth for 1998-99,+ he
added.

 exports dipped by 7.9 per cent in the first quarter of
1998-99 and the trade deficit widened to 2.4 billion dollars
reflecting a slide in the fortunes of exporters.

As a Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman said the recent
situation arising out of unprecedented confrontation along the LoC
called for serious dialogue at the political level to reduce
tensions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that there is an urgent need for Pakistan
exporting community through better internal management of
resources and quality control.
</P>
<P>
 +while the package does come as a relief, any turnaround
in exports performance at this juncture would not be enough to
achieve the targetted 20 per cent growth for 1998-99,+ he
added.
</P>
<P>
 exports dipped by 7.9 per cent in the first quarter of
1998-99 and the trade deficit widened to 2.4 billion dollars
reflecting a slide in the fortunes of exporters.
</P>
<P>
 heeding to the complaints of exporters that high cost of
finance was the biggest factor for slow down in exports,
government reduced the interest rates on pre and post-shipment
credits from 11 per cent to 9 per cent as part of its package
for exporters on wednesday. pti aml aa pti

<HEADLINE> Nature Reserve Becomes Home to White Storks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 white storks have
become the "pride and symbol" of the Honghe Marshland Nature
Reserve in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, a technician
of the nature reserve said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu Baoguang, the technician with the reserve,
these nearly one-meter-tall birds live in the reserve 300
kilometers east of Jiamusi, a medium-sized less polluted city in
the province, from April through October every year to propagate
baby storks, and then leave the region to spend the winter in
southern China.
</P>
<P>
There are now some 1,000 white storks in the country, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1984, the Honghe Marshland Nature Reserve with a range
of 20,000 hectares is a national nature reserve and home to more
than 190 species of animals and nearly 1,000 kinds of plants,
according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
What has attracted such a big number of white storks is the
region's large area of marshland and great variety of fish,
necessary living conditions and food for waterfowl, birds
specialists say.
</P>
<P>
Manmade nests are another factor attracting white storks, Zhu
added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu explained that between 1984 and 1992, fewer than six white
storks lived in the reserve, and the number of storks has been on
the rise since 1993 when Zhu and his colleagues started building
nests.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Extract DNA From Ancient Rice Seed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Scholars at China Agricultural
University have successfully extracted DNA from 5,500-year-old
single-grain carbonized rice seeds.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the first time for scientists in the world
to extract DNA from ancient plants aging more than 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Xiangkun, Associate Professor Sun Chuanqing, and
Li Chen, a postgraduate student at the university, went on to
conduct the external expansion of the DNA (to increase the amount
of related DNA parts), and hybridized them with the genome DNA of
"Yuefu," a kind of modern japonica rice.
</P>
<P>
The outcome made it clear that the expanded parts are of the
DNA of the ancient rice.
</P>
<P>
The ancient single-grain carbonized rice was unearthed from the
relic site of Longqiu Village of Gaoyou City in East China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The extraction and expansion of its DNA provided a new way for
the research of the origin and evolution of Asian cultivated rice,
the scholars said. It is also important for the differentiation
from the ancient cultivated rice to wild rice, the ancient indice
rice to japonica rice and for the foundation of the molecular
archeology.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, scientists in the world have never before
extracted DNA from plants more than 3,200 years old.
</P>
<P>
The scholars at the university are comparing the DNA molecules
of the modern rice with ancient rice in different periods of time
to further understand the variation of the DNA molecules of the
cultivated rice in the process of evolution.

<HEADLINE> ADF Rebels Kill 33 in Western Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of Uganda's Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) killed at least 33 people including
government soldiers in the western district of Kasese, Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
This surprise attack came about hours before Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni's visit to the district, the New Vision paper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the Press Secretary to the President, Hope Kivengere, told
Xinhua in a telephone interview Friday morning that this did not
prevent the president from going there and the president spent
the whole day in the west Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Jonathan Tigali, a Kyarumba sub-county chief
as saying that the ADF rebels attacked a government army unit at
about 3:00 p.m.(local time ).
</P>
<P>
James Kazini, the Acting Army Chief of Staff, said the rebels
launched two separate raids on Kyarumba and Ihandiro
sub-countyies.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that some soldiers and a family of six were
killed but was non-committal about the number of rmldiers killed.
</P>
<P>
The strike by the rebels followed another invasion on Kasese
twon last Friday at which 16 people were killed, 26 vehicles and
hotel rooms burnt and other property destroyed.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the local council in Kasese Thursday,
Museveni promised to use big guns against the increasingly
rampant rebel activities in the area.
</P>
<P>
"There will be adequate capacity to fight the ADF rebels
during the night and day," the president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president reassured the foreign and local investors in the
area that the safety of their lives and property will be
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors in Kasese and expatriates in the
construction companies for the Kasese Cobalt Processing Project
and Hima Cement Factory had threatened to leave the area for fear
of rebel attacks.

ANKARA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aksam (Evening)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel Thursday approved the
decisions on the retirement and promotion of senior military
officers made at the Supreme Military Council meeting. The
decisions are to take effect on August 30.
</P>
<P>
The Commander of the Land Forces Huseyin Kivrikoglu will
succeed Ismail Hakki Karadayi as new Chief of General Staff to
lead the Turkish Armed Forces in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey has launched diplomatic efforts at the U.S. State
Department and the Capital Hill in a bid to block the
proposed sale of the Stinger missiles to Greece, a major rival
of Turkey, saying these missiles might be transfered to Kurdish
rebels fighting for independence from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon approved early this week the sale of 1,322
short-range Stinger missiles, 188 launchers and support equipment
to Greece which are worth an estimated 150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National)

has said during a visit to Washington that he will make efforts to
normalize the German-Turkish ties and help open the door of the
European Union to Turkey if his party comes to power in fall.
</P>
<P>
The latest opinion polls have indicated that Schroder's party
is most likely to win the September 27 general elections after
staying in opposition for 16 years.

<HEADLINE> Floods Challenging China's Anti-Poverty Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Continuing floods along the
Yangtze River will make China's goal of helping 10 million people
out of poverty this year more difficult to reach, a government
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that by August 3, a total of 240 million
people in 28 provinces across the country have been affected by
the floods which began in June.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Office of the Leading Group of Poverty
Alleviation and Development under the State Council has pointed
out that most of the flood-stricken areas are state-designated
poverty counties.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangxi Province, for example, the Yangtze
floods have hit all the 18 state-designated poverty counties. The
local government has predicted that the floods will bring more
than one million people in the province down below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
The flooding has also slowed or ended many of the
aid-the-poor projects.
</P>
<P>
Families with per capita incomes of less than 300 yuan by 1990
standards are considered poor in China. By the end of 1997, the
country had had 50 million such poor people.
</P>
<P>
Along with the floods, the anti-poverty campaign also faces
other obstacles such as declining prices for farm produce, which
greatly affects the effort to increase farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
The slowing growth rate of township enterprises and the
increasing number of layoffs in urban areas are also decreasing
job opportunities for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first half of this year the per
capita income of farmers remained at the 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffling of governmental departments also delayed the
payment of poverty-relief funds, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To solve these problems, the government plans to adopt measures
ensuring the timely payment of these funds, and the central
government will invest 18 billion yuan this year in this
effort.

SHANGHAI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A group of experts has begun a
feasibility study of the planned railway line linking the Tibet
Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province in southwest China, the
Shanghai Wen Hui Daily reported recently.
</P>
<P>
With approval from the Ministry of Railways, the group will
conduct field surveys over the 1,654-kilometer railway, which

kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The line will begin at Dali, a popular tourist city in Yunnan
Province, and terminate in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous

</P>
<P>
The construction of the railway will cost an estimated
63.6 billion yuan (about 7.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As the shortest line from Tibet to coastal ports, the railway
will also be able to link-up with trains from China to Thailand and

<HEADLINE> China Works to Help the Deaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical experts are
working hard to return the deaf to the world of sound, according
to the Sixth Asia-Pacific Congress on Deafness that closed on
Thursday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 medical scientists, rehabilitation specialists
and special educators from 12 countries, including the United
States, Great Britain, Japan and Australia, exchanged views on the
treatment of deafness during the four-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
As a chronic condition afflicting the mankind for ages, hearing
impediments are one of the five major disabling conditions in
China, with approximately 24 million sufferers.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Han Demin, chairman of the congress's organizing
committee, said China's ability to prevent and treat deafness has
greatly improved in recent years, and that several ear-operation
techniques currently in use have reached or exceeded the
international standards.
</P>
<P>
In order to help improve the education of hearing-loss
sufferers in China, the Ministry of Health and Australia signed a
memorandum in 1993 calling for the two countries to jointly train
personnel engaged in educating the deaf. Training for the first
group of these specialists has now been completed.

JERUSALEM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's central bank, Bank of Israel, announced Thursday
an unexpected 1.5 percent cut of the interest rate, taking it
down to 9.5 percent, its lowest level since November 1993. Bank
Governor Jacob Frenkel made the decision after Finance Minister
Yaacov Neeman informed both him and Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that the 1999 inflation target will be 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel has promised the United States to form a final
position by next week on a United Nations resolution calling for
a halt to the production of the fissionable material used to make
unclear bombs. Israel is the only member of the 61-member United
Nations Conference on Disarmament to oppose the so-called
"cut-off" treaty on production of plutonium and highly-enriched
uranium.

<HEADLINE> Stern Labels NBA Union Talks Disappointing, Insulting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The first serious collective
bargaining session since the NBA locked out players over a month
ago began smoothly today, but later dissolved into an unproductive
meeting with owners and executives walking out on the Players
Association.
</P>
<P>
After a morning session at a New York law office, the union
returned with a counterproposal and what NBA boss described as
a"lecture" from Players Association attorney Jeffrey Kessler.
</P>
<P>
"The words they were using were insulting, patronizing," NBA
commissioner David Stern said. "We thought it was the better part
of valor to end the discussion."
</P>
<P>
NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said:"The players were not
really interested in doing any serious bargaining at this time."
</P>
<P>
Utah Jazz superstar Karl Malone called the exit by Stern,
Granik and a handful of owners "unbelievable. It was like a
4-year-old taking his toys away from the other kids and going
home."
</P>
<P>
No further talks were scheduled, and with the union threatening
legal action, the chance of 1998-99 season starting on time
appears further reduced.
</P>
<P>
The four-year proposal from owners included a guaranteed jump
of at least 50 million U.S. dollars per year in total player
salaries,which last season was just under 1 billion dollars. But
it also included the phasing out over a period of two to three
years of the Larry Bird Exception, which would change the system
from a soft cap to a hard cap.
</P>
<P>
The counterporposal from the union included the Larry Bird
Exception a handful of new salary exceptions.
</P>
<P>
Owners and players signed a six-year agreement in 1996 calling
for the percentage of basketball-related income devoted to
salaries to be 48 percent, with owners given the option to re-open
the agreement if the number climbed above 51.8 percent in the
1997-98 season, salaries totaled 995 million or 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
Claiming up to 15 teams lost money during the season, owners
voted 27-2 in March to re-open the agreement and locked out
players on July 1st. The union says just four teams operated in
the red.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was attended by 14 players and six owners. Both
sides entered somewhat entrenched position, but there was positive
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-99 season is the first under the new four-year, 2.64
billion U.S. dollars TV deal that guarantees each owner 23 million
in revenue whether or not games are played.
</P>
<P>
There was a lockout prior to the 1995-96 season that postponed
summer leagues and delayed free-agent signings, but no games were
missed. There was another lockout lasting just minutes in the
summer of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Water-Borne Diseases Spread in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Water-borne diseases such as
diarrhea and dysentery have spread in an epidemic form in
Bangladesh's flood-hit areas, already claiming more than 30 lives
and attacking 59,080 people, press reports said Friday quoting
health officials.
</P>
<P>
The government departments concerned have already sent about
4,000 medical teams with more than 2,000 doctors to the affected
areas to contain the situation. At the same time about 100
temporary medical centers have also opened across the flood-hit
districts to provide treatment to the victims.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society has already issued an
international appeal for 1.7 million U.S. dollars in aid for the
flood victims. It also requested the World Health Organization
(WHO) to send about 5 million water-purifying tablets to ensure
pure drinking water for the marooned people and keep them safe
from the diseases in the aftermath of the flood.
</P>
<P>
Since early the July-October monsoon season, this South Asian
country has been seriously hit by flood, which has already
affected 37 of its 64 districts, with more than 17.4 million
people becoming flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The death toll caused by flood has exceeded 270, officials of
the Ministry of Disaster management and Relief said.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, the flood has also washed away and damaged 420,000
hectares of cropland, 5,100 kilometers of roads and about 2,400
kilometers of embankment with more than 2,200 bridges and
culverts, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief and other
government departments concerned have already distributed over
13.2 million taka (about 280,850 dollars), about 30,000 tons of
foodstuff and large quantities of other relief materials among the
flood-affected people.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the overall flood situation in the country was
improving further as water in the major rivers had started
receding, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the monsoon remained fairly active over the country
and 10 rivers of Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna basins were still
flowing above danger marks at 13 places, the FFWC warned.

<P>
SOFIA, August 6 (Xinhua)-- The Bulgarian government announced
its first currency value reform in decades Thursday in a bid to
stablize the economy in order to facilitate ease of payments.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria will change its currency's face value by slashing
three digits beginning on July 1, 1999, officials said. A new
Bulgarian lev will be equal to 1,000 old ones, or one Deutsche
Mark.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian National Bank President Svetoslav Gavriski said
the transformation is a technical procedure and would not cause
losses to anyone, reported the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency (BTA).
</P>
<P>
BTA said, the old lev and the new one will be in use
simultaneously till December 31,1999. After that the old lev will
be withdrawn from circulation. But the old lev holders still can
exchange them for the new lev for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
The currency re-valuation is the first since 1962. It is not
yet sure how many kinds of notes the new currency will have. The
old lev has several face values ranging from 100,000 lev to 100
lev.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, post-crisis Bulgaria established a currency
control board, according to deals with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF). The currency control board fixed the exchange rate of
the lev at 1,000 to one Deutsche Mark.

<HEADLINE> Majority of Bulgarians Have Pleasant Memories of Zhivkov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- More than half of all Bulgarians
have favorable memories of Todor Zhivkov, their former head of
state, according to an opinion poll conducted by the Fact Agency
Thursday, one day after his death.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 88 percent of the 398 respondents interviewed in Sofia
and six other cities thought the name of Zhivkov would have a
memorable place in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of the people thought that Zhivkov had done
many good things for Bulgaria, compared with one-third who alleged
that he had abused his power for his own benefit.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent described his term in office as successful
while 39 percent of the people held the opposite view.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven percent saw him as their "savior" and 16 percent
believed the situation would have been the same if Zhivkov had
remained in power. About 38 percent thought it would be worse.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent of those interviewed believed their
expectations of a better life were unobtainable after Zhivkov lost
power, while only eight percent found their dreams fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov was in power for 35 years from 1954 until 1989 when he
lost power and was expelled from the Bulgarian Communist Party. He
died Wednesday in a Sofia hospital at the age of 86.

<HEADLINE> Hungary to Provide Free Milk to School Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hungary has found a solution to
its surplus dairy products: free milk for school children
throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
The country has a high milk output and dairy farmers always
find it difficult to market their milk, while many children and
their families cannot afford to buy it.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the Hungarian Agriculture and Rural
Development Ministry recently decided to offer a certain amount of
milk free to children around the nation.
</P>
<P>
Szabolcsszatmar State, which produces a large quantity of milk,
will be the first to introduce the new program. Each of the
85,000 children in all the state's nurseries, kindergartens and
elementary schools will receive 0.25 liters of milk everyday.
</P>
<P>
Children over the rest of the country will begin to receive the
milk beginning January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry and the national
dairy association will share the expense.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Tourists to Vietnam Down By 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Only 800,000 foreign tourists
visited Vietnam in the first half of 1998, a drop of 10 percent
from the same period last year, the Vietnam News Agency said
Thursday.

Vietnam attracted about 1.7 million foreign tourists, while 8.5
million local people traveled throughout the country last year,
spending nearly 7,000 billion dong (or 590 million U.S. dollars),
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Tourism Administration is preparing a publicity
campaign called "2000 - the year of Vietnamese tourism" to attract
more tourists in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
It is also calling for coordination with related authorities to
simplify visa issuing procedures and guarantee security for
foreign tourist groups.

WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

to pressure Yugoslavia to stop its offensive against ethnic
Albanian separatists in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that the conversation

"They agreed that a negotiated solution was preferable at this
point but acknowledged that NATO has intensified its planning" for
possible military action, Lockhart said.

<P>
They also discussed Iraq. "Clinton told Blair that President
Saddam Hussein's refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspections is unacceptable and that Iraq's failure to comply

<HEADLINE> Shell Thailand Plans to Shed 150 Local Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The oil-marketing arm of Royal
Dutch/Shell in Thailand will take an unprecedented decision to
shed 150 of its 1,012 jobs to seek a leaner corporate structure,
it was learned here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The company confirmed a newspaper report that it will downsize
its stuff in Thailand by 15 percent as part of its worldwide
business reorganization.
</P>
<P>
Shell Co. of Thailand is the first major foreign oil firm to
embark on large-scale redundancies following major rationalization
within the local oil marketing industry.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Friday quoted John Withrington, chairman of
the Shell companies in Thailand, as saying the layoffs were not
part of a cost-cutting exercise.
</P>
<P>
He described them as a reorganization to improve the company's
efficiency to deal with the new environment characterized by
fierce competition, tight market margins, high operating costs and
slumping demand.
</P>
<P>
Withrington said the decision to shed staff had nothing to do
with the forthcoming new labor law which will force employers to
pay more in severance benefits to laid-off employees.
</P>
<P>
The company said it will help those taking part in an early
retirement scheme and senior employees of advanced age to manage
their finances.
</P>
<P>
Those made redundant will be given life insurance and health
insurance for a period of five years in addition to compensation
higher than the legal requirement while financial advisory
services will be provided on how to start up a business.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Tunisia Sign Repatriation Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Tunisia signed an
agreement here on Thursday on the repatriation of illegal
immigrants, teh ANSA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stressed that joint efforts to control illegal
immigration should contribute to "respect for human rights," which
underpin Italian commitments to help development in Tunisia's most
depressed zones.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Tunisia will gradually strengthen its
coastal controls to prevent the departure of illegal immigrants.
Other measures include provisions for identifying the illegals,
necessary before repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement applies to all illegal immigrants intercepted
after departure from Tunisian territory, excepting nationals of
some other North African Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Italian foreign ministry officials said they value this clause
because it would further discourage immigrant traffickers who sail
nationals of some African countries as well as Asians to Italy
from Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said the agreement is
"particularly satisfying and of great political significance." In
bringing a systematic approach for the two countries, it placed
their relationship in this field on "new and constructive
foundations."
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Tunisia is one among a series of
repatriation agreements that Italy has signed with countries from
which most of the illegal immigrants come. A similar agreement
was signed with Morocco on July 28.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Gold Market Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Official statistics indicate
that gold sales in this economic and financial center of China
recovered in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's gold sales totaled 3.4 tons in the first three
months of the year, up three percent from the same period last
year, and 17 percent from the last quarter of 1997, according to
figures released by the World Gold Association.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, a total of 52.3 tons of gold was sold in the
Chinese mainland between January and March this year, with a total
value of 6.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say they are optimistic about gold sales this
year. Tang Qing, general manager of a gold shop in Suzhou, which
neighbors Shanghai, said that people often turn to gold products
in times of economic recessions.
</P>
<P>
Li Yanming, manager of the China section of the World Gold
Association, said that the Chinese mainland has a huge market
potential for gold sales.
</P>
<P>
Though the varieties of ornaments keep increasing, gold jewelry
accounted for over 80 percent of all jewelry sales in Chinese
mainland market last year, and will likely continue to do so this
year, Li said.

BANGKOK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Lower House Thursday
passed a bill to protect local industry from the dumping of
foreign products, the newspaper The Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, proposed by Supachai Panitchpakdi, deputy prime
minister and commerce minister, was passed with all-party support.
</P>
<P>
Pressure for anti-dumping control built up after Thailand
signed a World Trade Organization agreement to combat
protectionism to protect the country from unfair trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The bill provides for heavy import duties on foreign products
deemed to be on the local market at a lower cost than in the
countries of origin.
</P>
<P>
It also includes a clause to enable trading partners to appeal
if they can prove the products in question are not dumped to
damage local industry or monopolize the market.

<P>
YANGON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will participate in the
Economic Ministers' Meeting of a new regional grouping, the
BIMST-EC (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and
Thailand-Economic Cooperation), due to begin in Bangkok, Thailand,
later Friday.
</P>
<P>
The BIMST-EC is a sub-regional economic grouping originally
formed in June 1997 with four countries bordering the Bay of
Bengal and its membership was extended to Myanmar in August the
same year.
</P>
<P>
Minister at the Office of the Chairman of the State Peace and
Development Council Brigadier-General Abel will head the
delegation representing Myanmar for the meeting, the official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second time for Myanmar to attend the BIMST-EC
ministerial meeting since the country joined the grouping.
</P>
<P>
A special ministerial meeting of the grouping, held in Bangkok
in December 1997, agreed to strengthen cooperation in the fields
of trade, investment, transport and communications, energy,
tourism and fishery among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, together with Thailand, is a member of both the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the BIMST-EC, thus
becoming a gateway for the two groupings to link South and
Southeast Asia.

</P>

One third of the deposits is in the state-owned Banco de la

The Central Bank said that the increase in foreign currency
deposits is because people feel keeping money in banks is much
safer than investing in the uncertain stock markets after the

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Whether it's staying at the Holiday
Inn, finding a well-trained guide, or getting on a bus to Mount
Qomolangma (Mt. Everest), tourists are now finding travel in the
Tibet Autonomous Region much more convenient.
</P>
<P>
As many as 42 travel agencies, including 21 international ones,
now have state approval in Tibet, the mysterious and attracting
land in southwest China, which now has 14 star hotels and more
than 50 tourism hotels. In the first half of this year, about 380
guides and attendants received training to work in the service
industry in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
On routes extending in all directions, several kinds of state
tourist transportation along much-improved roads are available
every day.
</P>
<P>
Regarding tourism as one of its five pillar industries, the
government of the Tibet Autonomous Regional has invested heavily in
building its tourism infrastructural facilities.
</P>
<P>
Besides completing the construction of the Lhasa International
Airport, the government has rebuilt the roads from Lhasa to many
scenic spots, and maintains such popular destinations as the
Potala Palace and Mount Qomolangma, the highest summit on earth.
</P>
<P>
The government has also developed five tourist centers with a
variety of unique vivid features, including Lhasa for the Tibetan
culture, Mount Qomolangma for mountain-climbing, the Yarlung
Zangbo River Gorge for ecological scientific investigations and
the Yalong River Valley, the birthplace of Tibetan ethnic group,
for its distinctive characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Welcomes Outcome of Cambodian Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam said Thursday that it
welcomes and respects the outcome of Cambodia's July 26 election
announced by the Cambodian National Election Committee on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh said Vietnam
welcomes and fully respects the choice of the Cambodian people.
She said the election was held in a free, stable and fair
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said Vietnam hoped for an early establishment
of the new Cambodian government. This, she said, was the basis for
an independent, peaceful, prosperous, neutral and nonaligned
Cambodia, which would keep good relations with all other countries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam hoped the traditional good neighborly relations between
the two countries could be consolidated and further developed, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Initial results of the July 26 election, verified by the
Cambodian National Election Committee, showed Second Premier Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPC) came first, winning 41.4
percent of the votes. Hun Sen is thus expected to lead a coalition
government in early October.

<HEADLINE> China Works to Help the Deaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical experts are
working hard to return the deaf to the world of sound, according
to the Sixth Asia-Pacific Congress on Deafness that closed on
Thursday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 medical scientists, rehabilitation specialists
and special educators from 12 countries, including the United
States, Great Britain, Japan and Australia, exchanged views on the
treatment of deafness during the four-day meeting that ended on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As a chronic condition afflicting the mankind for ages, hearing
impediments are one of the five major disabling conditions in
China, with approximately 24 million sufferers.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Han Demin, chairman of the congress's organizing
committee, said China's ability to prevent and treat deafness has
greatly improved in recent years, and that several ear-operation
techniques currently in use have reached or exceeded the
international standards.
</P>
<P>
In order to help improve the education of hearing-loss
sufferers in China, the Ministry of Health and Australia signed a
memorandum in 1993 calling for the two countries to jointly train
personnel engaged in educating the deaf. Training for the first
group of these specialists has now been completed.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Philippine Stocks Dive to 5-Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stocks dived to a
new five-year low Thursday after Wednesday's reprieve, reflecting
wide-spread pessimism about the direction of the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The main stock index tumbled 43.86 points, or 2.88 percent to
1,480.89 at the close on Thursday, the lowest since April 2, 1993,
when the index reached 1,475.97.
</P>
<P>
Share prices are now back to the 1993 level, erasing all gains
squirreled in half a decade.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's technical bounce was short-lived, with investors
taking it as an opportunity to flee as the market appeared headed
toward 1,400 points, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The market blood-bath, with prices of some issues below book
value, was caused by further deterioration in investor confidence
in the Philippine economy, they noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our market is in a lot of pain... The biggest factor is the
loss of confidence, the utter disgust for what is happening," said
Ramon Garcia, president of Diversified Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
The market is worried that the economic growth in the first
half of the year may turn out weaker than expected, as did
corporate results. It was reported that the earnings of Ayala
Corp., the country's major corporation, were almost flat in the
first six months of the year, while those of another big company,
ALI, slumped 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Philippine Socio-Economic Planning Secretary
Felipe Medalla said the second-quarter economic growth is "not
going to be better than the first quarter. I'll be surprised if
the economy in the second quarter performed better than the
first."
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, the second quarter will be the worst (period for
the economy), then (we expect) some recovery after that," Medalla
said.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, gross national product (GNP)
of the Philippines grew by 2.5 percent and its gross domestic
product (GDP) 1.7 percent, the slowest in several years.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth may gradually pick up in the next two
quarters as interest rates and inflation ease and measures are
carried out to bridge the budget deficit, allowing the government
to achieve its target of 2-3 percent growth for GNP and 1.5-2.5
percent for GDP this year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Government data released Wednesday show inflation in July
softening to 10.6 percent on the year from 10.7 percent in June
due to the stabilization of food prices.
</P>
<P>
Despite the release of the July inflation rate, the poor
economic performance in the first half of the year will push
investors to continuously sell Philippine shares, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a weak Japanese yen, fragile U.S. stocks and a sharp
dive on Hong Kong's share market also affect the mood in the
Philippine stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese currency fell to nearly 145 yen to the U.S. dollar
in late Tokyo trade from around 144 yen Thursday, putting
pressures on an economic recovery in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine shares were also hurt by worries that U.S.
stocks could be in for another sharp fall, despite a mild recovery
overnight. The Dow plunged more than 3 percent Tuesday, sending
tremors through world markets.
</P>
<P>
As part of a regional phenomenon, the Philippine currency, the
peso, sagged to 42.7 against the greenback Thursday, the lowest in
four months. The peso's downturn also had a negative impact on the
stock market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the Philippine stock market may further
go down to test the year's intra-day low of 1,450, but they see
bargain-hunters waiting in the sidelines.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM to Bid for WTO Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister
and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi has confirmed that he
would run as a candidate for the position of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) chief, the newspaper The Nation reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said Thursday that he would formally request Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai to nominate him for the position.
</P>
<P>
If his request is approved by Chuan, the Thai Foreign Ministry
would be responsible for submitting his name to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, Chuan said he was reluctant to let go of his
deputy as he felt Supachai could contribute to the country's
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that if Supachai were to leave, it would adversely
affect the ruling Democrat Party and the government as his
economic expertise would be difficult to replace.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister also said the decision was Supachai's
and he would not veto his bid to become head of the world trade
body.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said he would retire from politics if he was elected
to the WTO job.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that he made the decision on personal aspirations
and was not trying to escape from rumored conflicts with Finance
Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda.
</P>
<P>
He also said his decision was moderately risky as the
application does not ensure that he will get the job.
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the position must be nominated by their
governments before September 30. The term of the current WTO
director-general, Renato Ruggiero of Italy, expires next April 30.

<HEADLINE> Computer Accessories Imports Up Notablely in Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's imports of computer
parts and accessories have risen more than a quarter in the first
half year over last year, feeding the capital's increasingly
hungry information technology industry, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Customs said that 38.24 million U.S. dollars of spare
parts and accessories were imported in the first half of this year,
representing a year-to-year increase of 27.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imports via bonded warehouseds, which allow importers to
temporarily store goods in China without paying import tariffs,
have risen in recent years because of their low risk and high
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that imports via bonded warehouses were 54
percent of the total spare parts imported in the first half of the
year, up from 38.1 percent in 1996 and 25.2 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Imports from the U.S. amounted to 20.35 million U.S. dollars,
more than half the total. Other major sellers include Malaysia,
Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the robust rise of imports partly results
from lower prices because of Asian financial turmoil and
widespread currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
But, there is also a growing appetite for computers. Demand
grows here at a rate triple the world average.
</P>
<P>
Some key computer components, such as microprocessing chips,
central processing units and hard disks, depend largely on
imports, though China's computer industry is growing quickly.
</P>
<P>
Also, some large Chinese home appliance giants, such as
Changhong, Haier and Hisense, are marching to break into the
information industry. They may have money and resources for China
to vitalize the industry by producing more China-made computer
parts, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Around 10 million computers will be sold in Beijing by the year
2000, making itself one of the three largest computer markets in
the world.

<HEADLINE> Structural Readjustment In Northeast China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a leading
heavy industrial center in northeast China, is using structural
readjustment to offset the effects of the Asian financial crisis
and to meet its economic goal this year.
</P>
<P>
Investment from Asian countries this year is down 32.6 percent,
with Japan's the biggest drop, at 54.9 percent. Over half the
overseas investment in this province in the past few years has
come from Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and Tailand.
</P>
<P>
Exports to ROK were also down 31 percent, and those to
Southeast Asia, by 38 percent. Under these circumstance, the
province has turned its emphasis of developing other areas.
</P>
<P>
As a result, exports to the United States increased 22 percent
and to European countries, 52 percent, according to Wen Shizhen,
secretary of the provincial Communist Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wen says the province will continue to readjust its economic
structure and export product mix and develop hi-tech products in
the latter half of the year.
</P>
<P>
It will also encourage companies with better performance to
build plants in Africa and the Middle East, to increase their
market share abroad, and to form joint ventures with foreign
companies.

<HEADLINE> China Exports Fuel Injectors to France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The First group of 10,000 EV6
fuel injectors produced by the Shanghai United Automobile
Electronics Co. Ltd. has recently been exported to France.
</P>
<P>
The company said the injectors will be used in manufacturing
Citroen and Peugeot automobiles. This deal has put an end to
China's previous zero-level in exporting high-tech automobile
electronical products such as fuel injector systems.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai United Automobile Electronics Co. Ltd. is a joint
venture started by ten Chinese companies and a German company with
an investment of 2.668 billion yuan. The company mainly produces
advanced gasoline-flow engine control systems for automobiles, and
has an annual production capacity of 500,000 units.
</P>
<P>
These fuel injectors are used in manufacturing the China-made
Santana, Jetta, and Citroen-Fukang cars, and are also used by
Toyota Automobile Engines Co. Ltd. of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The use of these advanced systems can reduce harmful automobile
exhaust by 50 percent, lower fuel consumption and improve overall
performance. Auto gas exhaust may be reduced by as high as 95
percent if catalytic technology is also applied, said one of the
joint venture's engineers.
</P>
<P>
This joint venture, which now has many orders from a number of
overseas companies, will export 370,000 fuel injectors this year,
and 700,000 in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two candidates, both of whom were nominated by more than
10 villagers, began to make their speeches.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yuguo, holding a stick in his right hand and an umbrella in
the other, pushed his way through the crowd to the rostrum. During
his speech he asked the other candidate to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Liu, 39, is a village doctor with a high school education. His
speech was a hit, winning applause from the audience five times.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged applause broke out at the end of his speech when Liu
said firmly: "Democracy must be practiced widely in the daily work
of the village committee. The financial report shall be open to
the public. A villagers advisory council will be set up..." Many
people waved their umbrellas in the rain to show their support.
</P>
<P>
Li Xuewen, the other candidate, also received some clapping
when he addressed the crowd.
</P>
<P>
After their speeches, the two men answered questions from the
villagers.
</P>
<P>
All the voters were divided into five groups. One by one, they
picked up the ballots by showing their voter-registration cards
and filled them out at the designated desk. Scrutinized by two
polling observers, the completed ballots were then put into the
boxes.
</P>
<P>
A mobile ballot box was used to get the ballots from door to
door for old and disabled villagers.
</P>
<P>
Observers and vote-counters were chosen by the public after the
voting. With 1,121 valid ballots tallied, Liu Yuguo beat his
opponent by the overwhelming majority of 809 votes.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 8 (Xinhua)-- Early one recent morning in the
summer breeze, the villagers of Hadahso in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region woke with excitement to go out, not to
work in the fields, but to vote for a new village committee.
</P>
<P>
The central voting area was in a square in front of the
committee office building, which had been carefully decorated with
a banner reading: "Third Village Committee Election".
</P>
<P>
There were five red ballot boxes and desks with wooden
partitions. A 10-meter by 2-meter area around each box was marked
by rope. On the sides of the square there were two blackboards for
election results.
</P>
<P>
At about 5 o'clock, more than 700 villagers had gathered and
were chatting cheerfully, but then it began to drizzle. Some women
with children ran into the building. One villager named Liu Huan
hurried into the third election section and took off his shirt to
shelter the ballot box. Soon, umbrellas were opened above the five
boxes.
</P>
<P>
As it continued to rain quietly, people were talking heatedly
under the umbrellas: "Is Liu Yuguo, who is lame, competent to be
head of the village committee? " to which someone else replied,
"But he's educated, upright, and not corrupt."
</P>
<P>
Another person chimed in; "That's right. I'll vote for him, as
long as we can become rich under his leadership."
</P>
<P>
The election started at 6 o'clock and it began to rain more
heavily, making a drumming noise on the umbrellas.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Still Roaring Around Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires fanned by strong winds
blazed away in Italy today as thick smoke blanketed major roads
and caused at least one serious accident.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern region of Liguria was effectively cut in half
by a blaze on the coastal riviera near Genoa. Black smoke
billowed onto the A-12 motorway and forced its closure to traffic
for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of tourists were evacuated as a blaze swept through a
campsite at Deiva Marina, burning tents, campers and holiday
bungalows.
</P>
<P>
At Eboli near Salerno, 11 people were hurt as smoke caused a
pile-up on a state highway. The most serious injury was to a
9-year-old child who is reported to be in a coma.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters said the situation was also "critical" in
Calabria, Tuscany and other parts of Campania, the region around
Naples.
</P>
<P>
But fire-fighters managed to put out a blaze at Maratea, in the
Basilicata region, just before it reached a hotel and a group of
houses on the outskirts of the coastal town.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the fire emergency, Interior Minister Giorgio
Napolitano today signed a decree earmarking 20 billion lire (11
million dollars) for the regions of Calabria, Sicily and Sardinia.
</P>
<P>
Outside Italy, flames continued to claim victims today as a man
was burned to death on a Greek mountain as he tried to save his
house, while two others died on a Croatian island.

<HEADLINE> Monica Lewinsky Testifies before Grand Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky Thursday testified before a grand jury in a
courtroom here about her relationship with U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Her spokeswoman said she testified "truthfully, completely and
honestly."
</P>
<P>
"Monica and her family are relieved that this ordeal finally
appears to be coming to an end," family spokeswoman Judy Smith
said at a news conference shortly after Lewinsky ended a long day
of testimony.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to answer questions before the same grand
jury on August 17.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky was to testify she had a sexual relationship with the
president and discussed ways of concealing it but was never
instructed to lie under oath, news reports quoted legal sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The account would reverse her own sworn affidavit, directly
conflict with the president's sworn testimony in January that he
did not engage in sexual activity with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"She answered each question truthfully, completely and honestly
that was posed to her by the Office of Independent Counsel and
also questions that were posed to her by members of the grand
jury," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Smith declined to say whether Lewinsky would have to return to
the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's appearance completed a deal struck last week that
removed her and her parents from any legal jeopardy with a grant
of immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Clinton went about his business at the White House,
hosting an anti-crime event in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
"His mood is great," White House deputy press secretary Barry
Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful that this means a four-year investigation that
has cost upward of 40 million dollar is finally coming to a
conclusion," Toiv said, referring to Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's investigation that started with the Whitewater land deal
in Arkansas and expanded to questions of obstruction of justice
inside the White House.
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt,
referring to the Lewinsky investigation at a news conference,
said, "I'm sick of hearing about it."
</P>
<P>
He said it would be a "grave mistake" for Starr to send a
report to Congress on the investigation in the weeks leading up to
the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
"That would be very partisan, very unfair and demeaning to the
process that I think all of us believe is important to this
country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Demands Yugoslav Ethnic Hungarians off Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, August 6 (Xinhua)-- Hungary urged Yugoslavia on
Thursday to immediately stop sending Yugoslav ethnic Hungarian
soldiers and policemen to Kosovo, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Foreign Ministry's Political State Secretary
Nemet Zsolt made the appeal to the Yugoslav ambassador in
Budapest, the Hungarian Telegraph Agency (HTA) reported.
</P>
<P>
HTA said, Zsolt told the ambassador that Hungary was deeply
concerned about the escalation of the Kosovo crisis and
Yugoslavia's practice of sending ethnic Hungarians to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Since early August, Yugoslavia has been recruiting ethnic
Hungarian volunteers and reserves in Vojvodina and sending ethnic
Hungarian police officers to Kosovo, a Yugoslav province where
ethnic Albanians are seeking independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Zsolt said the situation has forced Hungary to reiterate its
stance and demand that authorities in Belgrade stop such actions
at once.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Zsolt said Hungary is willing to continue
developing bilateral relations with Yugoslavia and a halt to
sending ethnic Hungarians to Kosovo would be conducive to the
development of the relations.

<HEADLINE> China's Anhui Province Reports Good Early Rice Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has reaped
a good early rice harvest despite severe flooding, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Anhui's output of early rice totaled 1.95 billion kilos this
year, which translates to 5,037.5 kilos per hectare, slightly
higher than the per-unit yield last year.
</P>
<P>
The provincial agricultural department said that Anhui's
acreage of early rice this year was 387,000 hectares, about 13,000
less than last year.
</P>
<P>
In late June, when early rice entered a critical growth period,
Anhui was hit by a spell of torrential rains, causing great damage
to agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> Cotton Prices Rise in U.S. Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Cotton futures prices were
rising in the past two days on both the New York Cotton Exchange
and the Chicago Board of Trade, said reports reaching here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cotton for December delivery Thursday rose 1.7 cents to 72.88
cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, December cotton rose 1.01 cents to 71.18 cents a
pound on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
Market participants pointed out two major factors behind the
increase of cotton futures prices.
</P>
<P>
One is the lower production estimates in the United
States. Sparks Co. of Memphis predicted a cotton crop of 14.196
million bales in the United States after drought wiped out parts
of the crop in Texas and other southern states. The new estimates
are well below the prediction of 15 million bales by the
U.S. Agricultural Department earlier.
</P>
<P>
The other is the worst flood China is suffering in more than 40
years. Market sources say the flooding has wiped out some crops in
Chinese cotton-growing regions, which could cause China to reduce
exports and possibly import more cotton later this year.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States are the world's two biggest
cotton-growing countries. Market analysts believe that both
countries contend yearly for the title of the world's largest
producer.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Gives Less Fertilizers to Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar distributed less chemical
fertilizers to its farmers in the 1997-98 fiscal year which ended
in March despite the fact that it procured a large amount of them
locally and from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Of the 394,000 tons of fertilizers obtained by the state-run
Myanmar Agriculture Services (MAS) and other organizations,
289,000 tons were distributed, a decrease of 35,000 tons over the
previous year, according to the latest official report on
agriculture in the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the decrease to the inability of farmers
to operate on small holding because of rising prices.
</P>
<P>
The MAS distributed 117,000 tons of fertilizers, 63.9 percent
of the total amount sold to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also being made for systematic utilization of
natural fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is reportedly introducing effective
micro-organism fertilizers for boosting the yield of crops and
improved quality without affecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
Paddy, beans and pulses, cotton and sugarcane are designated as
major crops of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar imported 59.5 million
U.S. dollars worth of fertilizers in the 1997-98 fiscal year, 47.5
million dollars more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that Myanmar's agriculture, the
mainstay of its economy traditionally accounting for 35 to 40
percent of the gross domestic product and 35 percent of the
export, grew by 2.9 percent in its output value in the fiscal
year.

<HEADLINE> Flood Watcher Working Long Hours on Dongting Lake Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Lin Hongwu has been working long
hours for more than a week at the Qilishan Hydrologic Station of
Chenglingji, the confluence of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake.
</P>
<P>
Because of persistent rainfall along the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River, the water level of the lake has lingered at about
35 meters, surpassing the warning level for almost a month.
</P>
<P>
Every day Lin works for 12 hours, checking the water level
every 30 minutes, much more frequently than the normal four times
a day.
</P>
<P>
Although an automatic meter is used to record the rise and fall
of water, Lin never gives up checking the records at the water's
edge.
</P>
<P>
"We must guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of the flood
report," he said. "Every time the water level climbs to a new high
point, I am feeling quite heavy at heart for the floods are
threatening people."
</P>
<P>
Lin's father used to be a hydrologist working at Qilishan
Station. Both Lin and his elder brother followed in their father's
footsteps. Lin, 29, has already been working at the station for 12
years.
</P>
<P>
His brother is working at Anxiang Hydrologic Station 100 km
away, an area inundated by floods several days ago. They moved
water surveying meters to a boat and continued to work.
</P>
<P>
Since the British set up the first customs water gauge at
Chenglingji in 1904, the hydrologic station here has recorded the
rise and fall of the water at Dongting Lake.
</P>
<P>
Affected by serious soil erosion on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River, the water surface area is decreasing but floods
occur almost every year.
</P>
<P>
At noon on last Sunday, Lin's father made phoned to ask him to
come home for lunch. The offer was rejected by Lin, who said that
he was only able to leave the station for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that my father can understand; it was he who
introduced me and my brother to the hydrologic station," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Commission to Solve Border Row with Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua will set up a
commission to resolve the dispute over the San Juan River between
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique
Nicolas Bolanos said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bolanos said the commission will draft regulations for
navigation on the San Juan border river.
</P>
<P>
He said the draft regulations will be discussed by the
authorities of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, with the aim of ending
the dispute over rights of navigation on the San Juan river
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under conditions included in the regulations, Costa Rica must
request permission from Nicaragua when it needs to navigate on the
San Juan River with weapons, Bolanos said.
</P>
<P>
All officers who travel on the river must have passports,
declare the amount of weapons they are carrying, the time they
will enter or leave the river and the route.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua will demand payment from Costa Rica when Nicaraguan
escorts accompany Costa Rican officers navigating on the river
with arms.
</P>
<P>
Under relevant treaties, the 300-kilometer section of the river
separating Costa Rica from Nicaragua is under Nicaragua's
sovereignty. Costa Rica has the right of free navigation through
this waterway.
</P>
<P>
However, the treaties have not specified whether the navigation
right covers armed Costa Rican officers patroling the river.
</P>
<P>
The latest dispute between the two nations flared up almost a
month ago when Nicaraguan authorities prohibited members of the
Costa Rica forces moving on the river with weapons.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Nicaragua suspended free navigation following a
heavy deployment of military personnel by Costa Rica.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Says Goodbye To Endemic, Infectious Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region has brought endemic and infectious diseases
under control thanks to efforts made since the region was
established four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The region has said goodbye to four major endemic diseases,
namely the plague, iodine deficiency, fluorine poisoning and
brucellosis, and to 17 types of infectious diseases such as
measles, dysentery, diphtheria and epidemic encephalitis, all of
which had threatened local people for years.
</P>
<P>
Iodine deficiency, the number one endemic disease in the
region, is now under control in 77 townships in its 17 counties
and cities.
</P>
<P>
A total of 480,000 out of the 640,000 people threatened by
fluorine poisoning now use low-fluorine water for drinking and
cooking.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of concerned departments in the region,
the plague, which used to occur every five years, disappeared 33
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has also speeded up the implementation of planned
immunization, and over 90 percent of its townships have now
adopted the immunization system.
</P>
<P>
The great efforts made to control endemic and infectious
diseases have helped reduce the incidence of acute infectious
diseases to a current rate of 323 per 100,000 people, down from
the 1958 ratio of 2,162 per 100,000 people, and the death rate
attributed to infectious diseases has dropped to 25 per 10 million
from 6,055 per 10 million.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Weather Changes in Past Two Decades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- People who still remember
better summers or harder winters in New Zealand should not imagine
things like that, because there has been a big shift in New
Zealand climate during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest study of climate records and weather
features in New Zealand and the South Pacific by New Zealand
National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research, a lot of
changes in New Zealand weather have taken place since 1977.
</P>
<P>
These changes include:
</P>
<P>
1. The north and east of New Zealand's North Island have become
 10 percent drier and 5 percent sunnier, with more droughts;
</P>
<P>
2. The west and south of New Zealand's South Island have become
10 percent wetter and 5 percent cloudier, with more damaging
floods;
</P>
<P>
3. There are fewer frosts nationally;
</P>
<P>
4. The retreat of the west coast glaciers has stopped, but
eastern glaciers continue to shrink; and
</P>
<P>
5. Night temperatures in New Zealand continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion, a local newspaper, Friday quoted Paul Hargreaves,
chief executive of the institute, as saying the changes were
linked to larger-scale climate changes in the South Pacific and to
other worldwide variations.
</P>
<P>
Since 1977, he said, there has been more than 150 kilometers'
movement east of a vast belt of storms and winds in the South
Pacific convergence zone. El Nino events have become more
frequent, but they could not yet be linked with global warming.
</P>
<P>
Among impacts of the changes outlined by a number of
institutes, are poorer summer and autumn pasture growth in drier
areas, increased damage to soil in wetter areas, as well as
increasing fungal diseases, heat-induced Toxins, pests and
disease.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Exports to Asia Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Chilean exports to Asia reduced
by 30.3 percent to 2.16 billion U.S. dollars in the first six
mouths of this year, compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Chile's Central Bank statistics show that although Japan
remained the top destination for Chilean products in the region,
Chilean exports there dropped by 22.6 percent to 1.09 billion
dollars, while its sales to South Korea amounted to 219 million
dollars, down 60.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Chilean imports from Asia during the period rose by 23
percent. Japan, the biggest trade partner, exported 557 million
dollars worth of products to Chile, a 28.3 percent increase over
the same period of 1997, followed by South Korea with an 18
percent export growth, to 302 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chinese exports to Chile show the biggest increase of 53
percent, to a total of 371 million dollars.

<P>
CANBERRA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard's gamble that he can convince
battlers to support a new tax is based on a crucial calculation
that he can hold the total increase in food prices to below 5
percent -- despite the imposition of a 10-percent Goods and
Services Tax.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Safe water, the big lie. Sydney Water Services did no
testing for two parasites -- one of them potentially deadly -- in
the major supply route blamed for the contamination crisis until
the bugs actually showed up in tap water, an investigation found.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's most experienced prime ministerial and VIP
security and intelligence officer has warned that the coming
federal election could be the most dangerous in the nation's
history. He said he was concerned about the potential for violence
particularly from rural Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Asian economic crisis has stalled plans for fast-track
development of one of Australia's biggest resource projects, the 8
billion Australian dollar (4.8 billion U.S. dollars) Gorgon
liquefied natural gas development on the Northwest Shelf.

<HEADLINE> Oil Workers To Go on Strike in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- About 80,000 Venezuelan oil
workers will go on a 12-hour warning strike on August 10 to
protest at the mass dismissal of employees in the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Oil Workers Federation President Carlos Ortega met Wednesday
with Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) management without reaching
any agreement to avoid the strike, reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PDVSA refused to reconsider the dismissals even if it
committed itself in May to guarantee labor stability.
</P>
<P>
An indefinite general strike is not ruled out, said Ortega.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 6,000 workers have been dismissed so far
in the oil industry and that the figure could rise to 20,000 in
December.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Doubtful About Military Action in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Military action will never
solve the conflict in Kosovo and it is not possible to repeat the
type of intervention that was taken against the Serbs in Bosnia,
Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister is highly skeptical to the military intervention
plans currently discussed within the EU and NATO.
</P>
<P>
"Military action could create a new situation which would
result in negotiations, but the conflict must be solved by
negotiations," Hjelm-Wallen said.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to find a well balanced military intervention
which can lead to negotiations," she said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to NATO's planning of a military action which could
be launched within a week to 10 days, the Swedish Minister said
that "this option must exist but should be used for political
purposes and it is highly important to have an international U.N.
mandate."

<HEADLINE> Doctors: Tour de France Drug Should not Be Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) - Dutch doctors said on Friday that a
drug that taken by some riders during the Tour de France cycling
race should be excluded from the banned substances list.
</P>
<P>
Epoetin, the synthetic form of a natural substance called erythr
opoietin, controls the production of red blood cells in the body
that carry oxygen to tissues. It is banned by the International
Olympic Committee and the Union Cycliste Internationale.
</P>
<P>
Athletes'muscles need a lot of oxygen to perform well.Injecting
epoetin is one way of increasing performance,particularly in an
endurance competition.
</P>
<P>
France's 21-day cycling race was dubbed the "Tour de Farce"(The
Joke Tour) when six cycling teams quit the competition after
French police conducted a series of raids in search of banned
substances, including epoetin. Doctors, team officials and
cyclists are awaiting further questioning in connection with the
raids.
</P>
<P>
Professor Joammes Marx and Peter Vergouwen, of University
Hospital in Utrecht, argue that epoetin should not be considered a
doping drug.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very good and safe medicine, but now the point
is:should it be used by athletes?" local reports quoted Marx as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Athletes, in principle, should not use drugs but this one,I
think, should be discussed by the International Olympic Committee
again. I'm not sure it should be a forbidden drug."
</P>
<P>
In a study published in The Lancet medicine journal, the
doctors showed that competitors who take the drug cannot be
reliably detected and that some athletes who have never used the
drug have packed-cell volume of 0.5, the limit of normality.
</P>
<P>
The drug cannot be detected in the body. In general,doctors
measure packed-cell volume, a measure of red-blood-cell
concentrations. The Union Cycliste Internationale set a cut-off of
0.5. Above that level epoetin is assumed to be used and the
cyclist is banned.
</P>
<P>
Marx and Vergouwen analysed blood samples of 18 men and 28
women athletes and 134 men and 144 women in a control group over
16 months. Four men athletes and four controls exceeded the limit.
</P>
<P>
"All six would have been excluded from competition according to
Union Cycliste Internationale rules despite their packed-cell
volumes being part of normally distributed values," Marx said in
the study.
</P>
<P>
As further proof he cited an Australian study of top cyclists
who were monitored over 10 years. Nearly three percent had
packed-cell volumes higher than 0.5.
</P>
<P>
Marx said athletes use iron, vitamins and food supplements to
enhance performance. He said some might be tempted to correct a
lower packed-cell volume by using a non-detectable substance such
as epoetin, as long as the value remains below 0.5.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that everything possible should be done to
protect athletes against doping but added: "In the case of epo
etin, the International Olympic Commitee and Union Cycliste
Internationale might consider whether taking a non-detectable
substance that is able to correct a physiological inequality among
competitors should be considered doping."
</P>
<P>
Marx said epoetin, which is available through prescription,is
one of the best drugs ever developed. He said it has changed the
lives of patients on kidney dialysis and has improved the health
of anaemia patients.

<HEADLINE>   IAAF Withhold Two Athletes' Prize Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- World athletics governing body the
IAAF has decided to withhold the prize money for Kenyan
steeplechaser Paul Kosgei and an unnamed Romanian woman athlete
from two world championship events.
</P>
<P>
Since athletics went professional in 1985, it is the first time
the IAAF imposed financial sanctions, rather than suspensions,in
such a case.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at an International Amateur Athletic
Federation (IAAF) meeting in Seville, Spain, last June. Details
were given in a statement last weekend but the IAAF refused to
identify the athletes.
</P>
<P>
However, Kosgei's new manager, Italian agent Gianni DeMadonna,
confirmed on Thursday that the Kenyan had been sanctioned,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Kosgei was bronze medallist in the 4-km world cross country
race at Marrakech last March.
</P>
<P>
IAAF secretary Istvan Gyulai said in a statement: "The prize
money of two athletes, due to them after the world cross country
championships in Marrakech and the world road relay championship
in Manaus, Brazil, will not be paid.
</P>
<P>
"The two athletes had undergone only one out-of-competition
test instead of the two required during the 12 months prior to the
competitions, a condition to be eligible to win competition
awards."
</P>
<P>
The total amount of cash withheld amounted to more than 40,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF stressed the punishment was not because of any
suggestion of a failed drug test or any refusal to test.
</P>
<P>
Gyulai added: "The two athletes could not be tested because the
IAAF did not know where they were."

<HEADLINE> War Factions in Afghanistan Urged to Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations Thursday called on all war factions in
Afghanistan to stop all actions leading to the escalation of the
military confrontation and reach a cease-fire through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the Security Council expressed its
grave concern over the new sharp escalation of the military
confrontation by saying it is a growing threat to regional and
international peace and security, and demanded an urgent and
unconditional cease-fire leading to a final end to the
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated that the Afghan crisis can be settled
only by peaceful means, through direct negotiations between the
Afghan factions under United Nations auspices, aimed at achieving
mutually acceptable solutions accommodating the rights and
interests of all ethnic, religious and political groups of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon all Afghan parties to return to the
negotiating table without delay and preconditions and to cooperate
with the aim of creating a broad-based and fully representative
government, which would protect the rights of all Afghans and
observe the international obligations of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The council called on all states neighboring Afghanistan and
other states with influence in Afghanistan to intensify their
efforts under the aegis of the United Nations to bring the parties
to a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council urged all sates to refrain from any
outside interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan,
including the involvement of foreign military personnel.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that any such interference from abroad should
cease immediately and called on all states to end the supply of
arms and ammunition to all parties to the conflict and to take
resolute measures to prohibit their military personnel from
planning and participating in combat operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The council once again called on all Afghan factions to
cooperate fully with the United Nations Special Mission to
Afghanistan and international humanitarian organizations and urged
them, in particular the Taliban, to take necessary steps to assure
the safety and freedom of movement of such personnel.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed its deep concern over the continuing
discrimination against girls and women and other violations of
human rights as well as violations of international humanitarian
law in the country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. to Keep Sanctions against Iraq in Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said on
Thursday that Iraq's refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors was "unacceptable" and that it would strengthen U.S.
resolve to keep sanctions in place.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's latest refusal to cooperate with the international
weapons inspectors is unacceptable," Clinton said in a statement
issued by the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Unless Iraq reverses course and cooperates fully with
international weapons inspectors, the United States will stop any
and all efforts to alter the sanctions regime," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
"Far from hastening the day the international community lifts
sanctions against Iraq, as Iraq intends, its failure to live up to
its obligations will perpetuate those sanctions and keep the Iraqi
economy under tight international control," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's statement came following a meeting of the U.N.
Security Council in New York, which also declared iraq's freeze of
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors "totally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S. State Department said Washington would oppose
any easing of sanctions against Iraq until Baghdad complies with
U.N. resolutions on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"We will oppose any change in the sanctions regime until Iraq
complies," spokesman James Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Foley said the United States did not consider the latest
dispute to be a crisis.
</P>
<P>
The latest dispute came as talks between chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz broke down earlier this week becauser of Butlter's refusal to
declare that all Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had been
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the White House said Iraq's decision to freeze
weapons inspections was unacceptable and vowed to keep pressure on
Iraq unless it complies with the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
"This noncompliance is completely unacceptable," White House
spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow Iraq access to the resources necessary to
restart their weapons of mass destruction program," he said. "We
will keep the pressure on until Iraq complies fully" with the
U.N.-mandated inspections program.
</P>
<P>
Crowley also said Iraq failed to provide required escorts on
Thursday to a U.N. inspections team seeking to leave its compound
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the failure to provide the escorts was an indication
that Iraq's threats of noncompliance were being carried out
although there had been no inspection scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"We have evidence on the ground that Iraq is beginning to
follow through on its threats," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
He said Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, had broken off a vacation to attend a U.N. Security
Council briefing by chief weapons inspector Richard Butler on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Finances Urban Property Rights Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Thursday
approved a 38 million U.S. dollar loan to implement a program that
aims to assure formal and sustainable rights to real property in
poor settlements in Peru's urban areas.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in these areas, 70 percent of all urban
properties are not formally inscribed in the registry, denying the
owners of these properties -- poorer urban dwellers -- the social
and economic benefits of ownership.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to finance the majority of the
registration of 960,000 properties, of which 800,000 will be
individually titled. The formalization process will cover an
estimated 4 million people, about one-quarter of the total
population, who live near the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The project will also improve the existing process of
collecting and analyzing legal and special ownership information
to support the scaling up of the formalization process.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House of Representatives Passes Campaign Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Thursday voted to ban large, unregulated
contributions to political parties that caused problems during the
1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which passed 252-179 and could deny the parties a
multimillion-dollar source of campaign cash, faces long odds in
the Senate, where the campaign finance overhaul is opposed by
Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Senate abandoned changing the campaign finance laws this
year after supporters couldn't break a Republican-led filibuster
and force a vote on a similar bill. Majority Leader Trent Lott has
no desire to resurrect the matter in the Senate's closing days of
the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
Backers of the measure, co-sponsored by Representatives
Christopher Shays, a Republican, and Marty Meehan, a Democrat,
hoped the strong House showing would spur the Senate. Sixty-one
Republicans, 190 Democrats and an independent voted for the bill,
while 164 Republicans and 15 Democrats were against it.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who favors the bill, called the vote a
"heartening sign for the health of our democracy" and urged the
Senate also to pass it.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the Shays bill would ban use by national or
state parties of "soft money," unlimited and unregulated donations
from corporations, labor unions and individuals. It also would
regulate issue advertising, which purports to educate voters but
increasingly is used to influence elections. It also would expand
disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
Between January 1997 and June 1998, the two major parties
raised 115.8 million dollars in soft-money donations, according to
a study of campaign donations by Common Cause, an advocacy group
that supports changing the system of funding political campaigns.
The figure was more than double the 50 million dollars collected
in the corresponding period of the 1994 election cycle, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, a Republican, said the bill
would damage the process.
</P>
<P>
"The effect of all this federal regulation is to chill free
speech and political participation," said DeLay, who led
Republican opposition to the reform effort.
</P>
<P>
The Shays-Meehan bill advanced to a final vote after surviving
an unusual procedure crafted by House Republican leaders that
stretched debate over many weeks and required votes on 11
different bills and dozens of amendments. The bill with the most
support advanced to final passage.
</P>
<P>
An alternative, known as the "freshman bill" and offered by a
bipartisan group of first-termers, represented the strongest
challenge to Shays. But the House rejected it Thursday by a
221-147 vote, with 61 members taking a neutral position by voting
"present."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the House voted 237-186 in favor of Shays-Meehan.
</P>
<P>
Republicans generally raise and spend more money than Democrats

alleged fund-raising improprieties by Democrats during the 1996
election, they said it also made little sense to pass new campaign
finance laws when existing ones were being broken.

<HEADLINE> Russia Concerned about Iraq's New Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia is seriously concerned
about the new deterioration of relations between Iraq and the
Special Commission in charge of Iraq's disarmament, the Interfax
news agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry said that Baghdad must comply with
U.N. Security Council resolutions and continue constructive
cooperation with U.N. Special Commission in charge of Iraq's
disarmament, and not make ultimatums.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership Wednesday decided to suspend cooperation
with the commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), accusing the commission of delaying intentionally the
implementation of its mandate on Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Iraq criticized the U.N. Security Council for it
cannot properly assess Iraq's progress in complying with its
resolutions, notably in the nuclear field.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry called on all sides "to show restraint
and avoid steps which could lead to further deterioration of the
situation."
</P>
<P>
The ministry believed that the Special Commission "would
facilitate the closure of Iraq's disarmament files and the
introduction of a monitoring regime," and the Security Council
could pass a resolution on lifting the oil embargo against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians were
wounded in south Lebanon Thursday during an Israeli artillery
bombardment, the state-run National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops pounded the village of Kfar Tibnet on the
edge of the Israeli occupied south Lebanon, leading to the injury
of the two civilians, said the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The shelling also damaged several villagers' houses and set
surrounding crop fields and farms on fire.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack came as a retaliation for the previous
offensives launched by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a Hezbollah guerrilla was killed and another
wounded by an Israeli shell.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday morning, Hezbollah launched retaliation
attacks on a number of Israeli posts in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas
have been going on since Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer
self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its
north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Heavy losses the Israeli forces suffered have raised question
in Israel about the wisdom of maintaining troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Israel offered to withdraw its troops from
the region on the condition of Beirut's security guarantee for its
northern borders.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer and asked Israel to leave the
country unconditionally.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Army to Launch Anti-Rebel Surveillance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni
Thursday said the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) will
launch a full-time surveillance and combat operation against
rebels active in the western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
He revealed the plan when addressing Kasese district local
council, but did not give more details of the plan, Radio Uganda
reported Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the operation is to trace the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) rebels in the war affected areas of Kasese, Kabarole
and Bundibugyo, all of which are frequently haunted by the ADF
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Following the June 8 massacre in which more than 80 students
were burnt to death and over 100 others abducted, the ADF rebels
attacked Kasese town on August 1, killing at least 16 people
including two UPDF soldiers and two police constables.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said the operation will also include modern night
vision military equipment, and aircraft which can sight the enemy
at night.
</P>
<P>
ADF rebels have been waging war against the government from
western Uganda since 1996. But on several occasions they have
infiltrated the capital, hurled grenades at unsuspecting sites,
claiming lives and sending people into panic.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Says NATO to Hold Exercises Near Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will hold exercises in Albania beginning next
week and in Macedonia next month to warn against Yugoslavia on the
conflict in Kosovo, the Pentagon said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, Defense Department spokesman
Ken Bacon told reporters that NATO plans for possible military
intervention in the Kosovo situation could be completed by the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said the military exercises, to be held August 17-22 in
Albania and September 10-18 in Macedonia -- would involve forces
from a large number of NATO countries and eastern bloc nations
under the alliance's Partnership for Peace (PFP) program.
</P>
<P>
The Albania exercise was planned following NATO ministerial
meetings early this Summer while the Macedonia peacekeeping
exercise had been tentatively planned for some time, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
NATO'S patience was wearing thin over the continuing violence
in Kosovo, he stressed, referring to the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"NATO will have to decide what triggers its intervention," he
said. "I think that every day the violence continues, it brings
the NATO community closer to consensus on this."
</P>
<P>
Bacon declined to give details of the plans, but said the
packages covered "a wide range of military options."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies have blamed Yugoslavia for the crisis
in Kosovo, claiming that Belgrade should take all the major
responsibilities for it.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Reiterates Non-Interference in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Thursday reiterated its
stance of good-neighborlihood with and non-interference in Congo
(K), where military conflicts have reportedly been going on for
days.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast by Radio Uganda Thursday evening, the
government said it wishes to reiterate its policy of good
neighborliness with all her neighbors and non-interference in the
internal affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Ugandan government has publicly
aired its attitude toward the recent fightings against the L.
Kabila administration in the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda appreciates all efforts aimed at finding a peaceful
settlement to the internal conflict in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC). It supports the initiative of the Organization of
African Union to hold a regional summit in Harare on August 7 in
order to find a lasting settlement to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Ugandan government is doing everything
possible to ensure the safety of its nationals living in DRC and
will continue to monitor the situation there.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said the recent rebellion in Africa's third
largest country was against President Laurent Kabila, accusing
him of nepotism and failing to run the country properly.
</P>
<P>
His Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha is reported to have
defected and rebels have allegedly seized the eastern town of
Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
Government officials of DRC acknowledged that Bukavu had
fallen to a Tutsi-led dissident faction of the new Congolese army
after two days of heavy fighting but accused troops from
estranged ally Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated army of taking part.
</P>
<P>
The sudden change of situation in this central African country
has immediately attracted the attention of its close neighbors as
well as many other countries around the world.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposes Easing of Sanction on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said on Thursday that Washington would oppose any easing of
sanctions against Iraq until Baghdad complies with U.N.
resolutions on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"We will oppose any change in the sanctions regime until Iraq
complies," spokesman James Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Foley said the United States did not consider the latest
dispute to be a crisis.
</P>
<P>
The latest dispute came as talks between chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz broke down earlier this week becauser of Butlter's refusal
to declare that all Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had been
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday the White House said Iraq's decision to
freeze weapons inspections was unacceptable and vowed to keep
pressure on Iraq unless it complies with the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
"This noncompliance is completely unacceptable," White House
spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow Iraq access to the resources necessary to
restart their weapons of mass destruction program," he said. "We
will keep the pressure on until Iraq complies fully" with the
U.N.-mandated inspections program.
</P>
<P>
Crowley also said Iraq failed to provide required escorts on
Thursday to a U.N. inspections team seeking to leave its
compound in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the failure to provide the escorts was an indication
that Iraq's threats of noncompliance were being carried out
although there had been no inspection scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"We have evidence on the ground that Iraq is beginning to
follow through on its threats," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
He said Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, had broken off a vacation to attend a U.N. Security
Council briefing by chief weapons inspector Richard Butler on
Thursday.

UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's announcement to
freeze the cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission

here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Council was briefed by Richard Butler,

Authorities of Iraq in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council noted that the announcement was made
after a period of improved cooperation and some tangible

</P>
<P>
The Security Council reiterated its endorsement in the
resolution 1154 of 1998 and the Memorandum of Understanding and
reaffirms its support for UNSCOM and IAEA in the implementation
of their mandate and calls for an early resumption of
dialogue between Iraq and UNSCOM and IAEA.
</P>

 The Security Council intended to respond favorably to the
future progress made in the disarmament process and affirmed its
commitment to comprehensive implementation of its resolutions in
particular resolution 687 of 1991.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Foreign Minister Gasana
Anastase Thursday denied his country's involvement in the
on-going conflicts between soldiers of rebel Banyamulenge and the
government in Congo (Kinshasa).
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's foreign policy now stresses on good neighborlihood,
said Anastase in Mazabuka, 100 kilometers south of Lusaka,
according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "Rwanda has no connection to the on-going
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The policy of our
government is good relations with other countries, especially our
neighbors."
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan foreign minister, who arrived in Zambia Wednesday
accompanying President Posteur Bizimingu for a three-day visit,
said his government has a great challenge to reconstruct the
country and has no time for involvement in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda does not want to be disturbed to derail its mission of
rebuilding the country, he stressed, adding that Rwanda did help
Congo (K)'s President Laurent Kabila topple its predecessor
Mobutu Sese Seko in May last year.
</P>
<P>
When asked to explain as to whether the Banyamulenge in
eastern Congo are actually his country's nationals, Anastase said
Rwanda has no citizens in its western neighbor.
</P>
<P>
"We have no Rwandans living in eastern Congo. That is why we
decided to withdraw our forces which helped President Kabila
remove dictator Mobutu," said Anastase.
</P>
<P>
On future relations with the Congolese government, the foreign
minister said relations will remain good so long as rwanda is not
disturbed in its efforts to reconstruct the country ravaged by
years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, visiting Rwandan President Bizimingu also
denied his country's involvement in Congo's conflicts, saying
Rwanda has no reason to get involved in the conflict which
followed the repatriation of Rwandan soldiers last week.
</P>
<P>
However, the Congolese government Monday accused Rwanda, its
former ally, of invading the country and called on the U.N.
Security Council to order an immediate retreat of the troops that
invaded its territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force has
suspended training missions for its B-2 stealth bombers after
problems with the aircraft's crew ejection system were found.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was called as "a potential problem associated
with initiators which operate the air crew ejection system" had
been discovered during routine acceptance testing, the Air Force
said in statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The B-2 stealth bomber was designed in the 1970s and 1980s to
be able to dodge Soviet radar in a potential conflict. The first
B-2 entered service in December 1993 and there are eight such
planes in the Air Force and all are based with the 509th Bomb Wing
at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, small holes were discovered on one of the
wings of one of the bombers.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the suspension was temporary and
precautionary. It would not interfere with the aircraft's ability
to be deployed in combat.
</P>
<P>
"Each aircraft has eight initiators and all will be replaced as
a safety precaution. Each aircraft will resume peacetime training
as soon as replacement parts are installed and inspections are
complete," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 2-billion-dollar warplane can drop either nuclear or
conventional bombs.

BAGHDAD -- Iraq denied Thursday that it had banned a U.N. arms
inspection team from entering a weapons site here, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
An official source at the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate
was quoted as saying there was no question of Iraq's banning
U.N. inspection teams from carrying out their duties because
"there is no arms inspection team in Iraq right now."
</P>
<P>
"All the U.N. arms inspectors here belong to long-term
monitoring teams," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that according to Wednesday's decision made by the
Iraqi government, activities of the long-term monitoring teams are
allowed to continue, and in fact all monitoring activities are
going on smoothly on Thursday. (Iraq-UN-Denial)

JERUSALEM -- Hanan Ashrawi, the newly-appointed Minister of
Tourism and Archaeology in the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA), resigned on Thursday to protest the lack of reform in the
cabinet reshuffle made by PNA President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in the West Bank city Ramallah,
Ashrawi said she would continue to stay in the Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC), and would contribute her knowledge and
wisdom to it as an elected member.
</P>
<P>
Her move was apparently in protest against the failure by
Arafat to tackle the widely reported corruption within the
cabinet, which was the main reason behind the latest cabinet
shakeup. (Palestine-Ashrawi-Resignation 2nd lead writethru)

CAIRO -- The Arab League (AL) is awaiting official stances of
the U.S. and Britain on ways of resolving the long-running
Lockerbie issue, a press statement issued by the Cairo-based
organization said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid, who started a visit to
Libya on Sunday, is known to have explored responses of Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi to a possible detailed plan for trying two
Libyans suspected of involvement in the 1988 aerial attack.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London last month agreed to allow them to stand
trial in the Netherlands before Scottish judges.
</P>
<P>
A key stumbling block now lies in the Anglo-American insistence
that all the judges must be Scots, while the defense counsel wants
a multi-national bench. (AL-Libya-Lockerbie)

<HEADLINE> Ugandan FM Ends Visit to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan First Deputy Premier and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya has concluded his
four-day official visit to Israel with both sides agreeing to
strengthen economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Kategaya briefed him on the improving economic situation in
Uganda and the Great Lakes Region which is offering great
investment opportunities, Radio Uganda reported Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
They discussed matters of bilateral interest in areas of
cooperation such as investment promotion and agro-industry.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to analyze priority areas for cooperation
followed by signing and implementation of the agreements.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in the Middle East and the situation in the
Great Lakes Region were also high on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya said on the basis of forming a regional economic
integration body, the idea of forming a political federation,
proposed recently by President Yoweri Museveni, is being
considered by the three east African countries as well as Rwanda,
Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a large trade delegation, the Ugandan foreign
minister aimed to promote Uganda's economic ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel used to be deeply involved in Uganda's economic life in
the 1960s. It built roads and extensive agricultural projects in
northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
But with the coming into power of Idi Amin in 1971, their
bilateral ties began to show signs of deterioration after Israel
refused to give Amin the fund he needed badly to revitalize the
shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya's visit is seen as a clear signal that a new active
phase of contacts between the two former friends is at hand.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Israel, Palestinians to Move on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan here
Thursday urged the Palestinians and Israel to enter into final
status talks, saying that the time is ripe.
</P>
<P>
He made the call after meeting separately with Palestinian
chief negotiator Saeb Erekat and Israeli Minister of Internal
Security Avigdor Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said that it is time to close the chapter of second
Israeli troops redeployment in the West Bank, and move on to the
third redeployment and start the final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The regent said that his judgment is based on the belief that
the current Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have almost reached
the threshold of achievements.
</P>
<P>
He said that the efforts exerted by the Palestinians in these
negotiations are very "effective."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hassan said that the United States, as a full
partner of the peace process, should consolidate the achievements
of the two parties, especially at this crucial moment.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who arrived in Amman early Thursday to deliver a
message to Hassan from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, played a
different tune. He told reporters that Israel has so far failed to
comply with the signed peace agreements and rejects a U.S. peace
proposal.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. to publicize the details of its proposal
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani arrived here later on a one-day trip. He held three
hours of talks with Hassan and delivered a letter from Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani said a solution to the deadlock of the peace process
is imminent.
</P>
<P>
Direct Palestinian-Israeli talks were resumed last month but
the two sides are still apart on the U.S. initiative calling for a
13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. idea, but Israel still
resisted it, citing security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Israel suggested that it hands over 10 percent and limits
Palestinian rule over the other 3 percent which will be designed
as a "nature reserve."
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been sharply criticized Israel for its hardline
policies and kept a close eye on the developments of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It maintains regular contacts with Israeli government, its
opposition parties, the Palestinians as well as Egypt in order to
play a role in the process.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Bankers Urged to End Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan business circles
Thursday called for a quick end to the nationwide bank strike
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit are exporters, manufacturers, the tourism sector
and the foreign currency market, economic analysts said.
</P>
<P>
However, some 12,000 striking bank workers raised the stakes
Thursday, demanding the removal of Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae as part of a deal to end the crisis caused by the
introduction of the new tax of their low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
"The tax must be scrapped completely. The tax must go and then
Simeon Nyachae must follow," All Banks Shop Stewards leader Jacob
Opiyo told some 5,000 bank workers in downtown Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
During the day, the Nairobi Stock Exchange recorded a 91
percent drop in turnover since Monday, as manufacturers warned
the Treasury would lose out on duties and VAT payable on the
imported goods if the strike continues.
</P>
<P>
Chris Kirubi, the chairman of the Kenya Association of
Manufacturers (KAM), Thursday described the strike as "a disaster
for the economy."
</P>
<P>
He called for a quick end to the crisis, saying: "if we go on
like this for another two to three weeks, many industries will
grind to a halt."
</P>
<P>
He said KAM members had recorded a 30 percent reduction in
manufacturing and incurred costs at Kenya's Indian Ocean port of
Mombasa, and at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi,
as they could not pay for the release of their imports.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers were also suffering from a shortage of
operational cash as most of their money is tied in the banks,
while foreign remittances are also inaccessible as importers
cannot open letters of credit for imports or exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke out as the bank employers announced they were
recruiting new staff to replace those they sacked Wednesday for
going on strike.
</P>
<P>
But the sacked 12,000 workers were free to apply for their own
jobs, the bank employers said.
</P>
<P>
A strike over the same issue paralyzed banking services
earlier this year but was called off when the government
suspended implementation of the tax.
</P>
<P>
The tax was re-imposed in June and a tax on other fringe
benefits was also introduced with the government citing the
current economic difficulties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Increases Pressure on Belgrade in Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has told Yugoslav leaders to halt military
offensive in Kosovo, which she said increased the threat of a
military intervention.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said Thursday that in
the message to Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, Albright
expressed the strong view that "the ongoing Serb offensive and the
unacceptable actions" only increase the chances of there being
military action on the part of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a separate briefing, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon
said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will hold
exercises in Albania beginning next week and in Macedonia next
month.
</P>
<P>
Bacon also told reporters that NATO plans for possible military
intervention in the Kosovo situation could be completed by the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Analysts fear that the increasing pressure from the U.S. will
again encourage the Kosovar ethnic Albanian extremists to launch
new offensives for independence, which is opposed by the
international community including the United States.
</P>
<P>
Albright's message was conveyed to Milosevic Wednesday by
Ambassador Chris Hill, the U.S. envoy to Macedonia who has been
spearheading U.S. attempts to halt the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Albright expressed "her shock and dismay over the effects of
the Serb military offensive in Kosovo," said Foley.
</P>
<P>
NATO has drawn up contingency plans for possible military
action in and around the Yugoslav province. The alliance had held
exercises in June in Albania and Macedonia as a threat to the Serb
forces.
</P>
<P>
However, it said later that it is far from making a decision on
military intervention when the separatist rebels defeated the Serb
forces on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's regular briefing, Bacon said NATO's patience
is wearing thin over the continuing violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"NATO will have to decide what triggers its intervention," he
said. "I think that every day the violence continues, it brings
the NATO community closer to consensus on this."
</P>
<P>
Bacon declined to give details of the plans, but said the
packages cover "a wide range of military options."
</P>
<P>
The military exercises, to be held on August 17-22 in Albania
and on September 10-18 in Macedonia, will serve as a new warning
to Belgrade against its offensive in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The exercises involve forces from a large number of NATO
countries and Eastern bloc nations under the alliance's
Partnership for Peace program, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
The Albania exercise was planned following NATO ministerial
meetings early this summer while the Macedonia peacekeeping
exercise had been tentatively planned for some time.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies have blamed Yugoslavia for the crisis
in Kosovo, saying that Belgrade should take all the major
responsibilities for it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Approves Opening up Nazi Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress approved a
legislation on Thursday to unseal thousands of classified U.S.
files on Nazi war crimes and criminals.
</P>
<P>
The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, which passed the Senate in
June, was approved in the House on Thursday by unanimous voice
vote and will be sent to President Bill Clinton for signature.
Clinton has indicated his support.
</P>
<P>
The act would make it much easier for historians, researchers
and the public to view the documents dating to the Cold War years
that followed World War II.
</P>
<P>
Several federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA), the State Department and the Department of Defense,
previously refused to declassify the documents, citing national
security.
</P>
<P>
The bill would create a new multi-agency group to administer,
inventory and release documents.
</P>
<P>
It also would require the government to disclose now-secret
information about individuals who participated in Nazi war crimes,
what their relationship was to U.S. intelligence agencies and what
they received in return.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Praised for Surrendering Rwandan Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 6 (Xinhua) - The Registrar of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) Thursday
appreciated the decision by a United States court to surrender a
Rwandan genocide suspect to the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
In a statement reaching here, Agwu Ukiwe Okali said the
Tribunal welcomed the decision by Judge John Rainey of the U.S.
District Court in Laredo, Texas on ordering the surrender of ICTR
indictee Elizaphan Ntakirutimana to the Tribunal based in Arusha,
northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The Tribunal hopes that this decision will accelerate the
process of bringing Mr. Ntakirutimana, accused of genocide and
crimes against humanity, to face trial before the Tribunal," the
Registrar said.
</P>
<P>
Okali also expressed thanks to the U.S. government for its
efforts to cooperate with and render judicial assistance to the
Rwanda Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Okali said that the Tribunal's first judgement was
expected this month in the case of Jean-Paul Akayesu, the former
burgomaster of Taba Commune in Gitarama Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal also expected to deliver its sentence on Jean
Kambanda, former Prime Minister of Rwanda at the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda is the first Rwandan suspect who had pleaded guilty
to genocide and crimes against humanity before the Tribunal on
May 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 suspects have been indicted so far by the ICTR,
founded by the United Nations following the Rwanda massacre in
April 1994 soon after President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, died
when his plane was shot down over capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
More than half a million people, mostly Tutsis and moderate
Hutus, were reportedly killed in the three-month slaughter.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls on Congress to Extend Brady Law on Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday urged Congress to extend the Brady law on gun control in
an effort to keep weapons out of the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
The president issued the appeal in the White House Rose Garden
alongside police officers and Jim Brady, the former presidential
spokesman for whom the law is named. He was shot and wounded
during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
Under the Brady law, which took effect in 1984, a five-day
waiting period is required for handgun purchases. The ban expires
on November 30.
</P>
<P>
"Too many crimes are committed within hours of a handgun
purchase," Clinton said. "The waiting period gives tempers time to
cool. It gives potential criminals the time to consider the
consequences."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that years of experience now show that this law
works and "we have to make it more effective, not less effective."
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the Brady law has blocked handgun purchases by more
than 240,000 people with criminal records or a history of mental
instability. Last year, it stopped 69,000 gun purchases.
</P>
<P>
"How many people are alive today because of that law? We will
never know," Clinton said. "But no one doubts the number is very
large indeed."
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked Congress not to water down the law with
amendments that he says would thwart the FBI's ability to perform
the instant background checks and maintain important records.
</P>
<P>
The issue was raised weeks after the shootings occurred inside
the Capitol, in which two Capitol police officers were killed and
a tourist was injured.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Uganda Sign Accord on Cargo Storage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Uganda Thursday signed
an agreement in which Kenya pledges to provide sufficient space
Uganda's goods.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed that as from September this year, the Kenya
Port Authority (KPA) will open a special window at the port for
processing Uganda transit cargo documents in order to expedite
documentation flow.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Kenyan Minister for East African and
Regional Cooperation Nicholas Biwott and Brig Moses Ali, Uganda's
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism, Trade and
Industry, according to media reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, KPA and Kenya Revenue Authority will work out
modalities for starting operations at western Kenya's Eldoret
Inland Container depot to speed up the handling of Ugandan goods.
</P>
<P>
The move was said to be a follow-up to the state visit by
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to Uganda in May.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also discussed issues on the tea bonding
requirement for Uganda tea exported through Kenya, which has now
been waived.
</P>
<P>
Although Kenya remains among the main exporters to Uganda, the
value of Kenyan imports to Uganda dropped by 43 million U.S.
Dollars last year due to Uganda's industrialization and the
availability of South African products.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Kenya fell from 280 million Dollars in 1995 to
200 million Dollars in 1996 and 157 million Dollars in 1997,
according to the official data.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Concerned About Congo (K) Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has said the situation in Congo (K) is causing great
anxiety and sadness on the African continent, Zambia News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner hosted for the visiting Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimingu here Wednesday night, Chiluba also said it is
regrettable that the new government of Congo (K) cannot be given
a chance to rebuild the country because of the conflict between
the government and rebel Banyamulenge soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to a quick resolution to the on-going
conflict to enable that country to resume its economic and
political reconstruction program," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that the resurgence of armed conflicts in
Africa are a threat to the tremendous gains made in the region's
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
It was saddening that Africa has continued to spend its scare
resources on resolving conflicts instead of national building,
Chiluba noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, Rwandan president Bizimingu
stressed that African leaders must work to ensure that conflicts
are resolved if the continent has to develop.
</P>
<P>
He added that Africa must not allow influence from outside to
cause strife and divisions and that the continent could only be
developed by the Africans themselves.
</P>
<P>
During an official talks with Chiluba earlier Wednesday,
Bizimingu denied his country's involvement in the conflicts in
its western neighbor, saying that for the time being there is "no
particular reason" for Rwanda to get involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, Bizimingu, who arrived in Zambia Wednesday morning
for a three-day state visit, indicated that Rwanda may get
involved if necessary, saying: "if there are serious reasons to
be involved, maybe we will be."
</P>
<P>
The Congolese government Tuesday accused Rwanda of invading
its territory and called on the U.N. Security Council to order an
immediated retreat of the Rwandan troops. Meanwhile, it warned
all its neighbor against getting involved in its internal
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts Happened Sunday evening after Rwandan soldiers,
who helped President Laurent Kabila of Congo (Kinshasa) seize
power last year were ordered to return to their homeland.

<HEADLINE> Comoran Officials Slap Secessionists for Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Two senior officials of the
Comoros Thursday criticized secessionists in the country for
resisting peace efforts by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) and other international organizations to restore peace.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued at the OAU headquarters here, the
country's foreign and justice ministers said failure on the part
of the secessionists to accept the peace efforts has created
social and economic crisis in the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said the OAU could not be successful in its
efforts to regain national unity in the Comoros as the
secessionists fail to make clear-cut demands.
</P>
<P>
They said OAU has carried on with its efforts to attain a
peaceful settlement to the crisis in the country despite the
difficult situation there.
</P>
<P>
It was recalled that on August 3, last year, secessionists
from one of four islands of the federal Comoros, the Anjouan
Island, announced their independence.
</P>
<P>
They set up so-called "the state of Anjouan" and announced to
join France, the former colonial ruler of the islands. The
separative activity was immediately opposed by the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The Comoran crisis remains unsolved after the secessionists
refuse to accept OAU peace efforts.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Names New State Administrators, Electoral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian leader General Abdulsalam
Abubakar Thursday announced the appointment of new military
administrators for the country's 36 states, the state television
stations, TV NTA said.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was announced after a joint meeting of the
ruling Provisional Ruling Council and the National Council of
State in Abuja, the federal capital.
</P>
<P>
The National State Council, comprising all military
administrators, was dissolved before the new appointment.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting also approved a new independent electoral
body, the National Electoral Commission (NECON), which was sacked
by Abubakar on July 20.
</P>
<P>
The new electoral body which has 14 members, was chaired by
Justice Ife Omokusi Okwata.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, however, failed to produce a new cabinet, as it
has been widely expected.
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar took the power on June 9 after the sudden
death of late military leader General Sani Abacha. He sacked the
cabinet of Abacha on July 8.
</P>
<P>
On July 20, Abubakar announced a new transition program by
which he promised to hand over to an elected civilian government
on May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar sacked all the political parties as well as the
electoral body, saying that the transition program under Abacha
has lost its credibility due to massive rigging.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant Colonel, A.U. Obi (Abia State), Lieutenant Colonel,
P.E. Obi (Bayelsa State), Colonel D.O. Oneya (Benue State), Wing
Commander, L.N. Haruna (Borno State), are on the list of the new
administrators.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Barclays Bank Pretax Profit Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Barclays Bank of Kenya, a
leading bank in this east African country, announced Thursday a
14 percent increase of its pre-tax profits in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Pre-tax profits for the six month to June 30 were posted at
2.118 billion Shillings (some 36 million Dollars), compared to
1.866 billion Shillings (some 32 million Dollars) for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Managing Director Gareth George, when expressing
satisfaction with the half-year's performance, noted that lending
growth had still been constrained by high interest rates and the
poor state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for the full year looked promising but would be
influenced by the general performance of the country's economy,
George told media Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bank also announced a one point reduction in its base
lending rate to 24 percent, effective from September 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
George expressed optimism that the downward trend in statutory
cash ratio and Treasury Bill rates would facilitate further
reductions in commercial bank lending rates.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on benchmark 90 day Treasury bills are
currently around 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
George called for a quick resolution to the some 12,000 Kenyan
bank workers' strike launched Monday, saying the protest strike
against a new tax on bank staff loans is having a detrimental
effect on customer service.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Consumer Price Inflation Down to 5.1 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece's consumer price inflation
in July dropped from 5.2 percent in June to 5.1 percent, according
to figures released by the Greek National Statistics Service (NSS)
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NSS attributed the drop in July inflation to a decrease in
the prices of foodstuffs and of goods in the summer sales as well
as increases in electricity rates and fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
The NSS also estimated that inflation was expected to fall
below 5 percent in August this year.

<HEADLINE> UK Supports U.N. Statement on Iraqi Arms Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Thursday Britain backed the U.N. Security Council's
statement that Iraq's suspension of cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors was "totally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council made the above announcement after the
talks between U.N. chief arms inspector Richard Butler and the
Iraqi leadership collapsed early this week and Iraq pledged to
halt all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for
Disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Cook said in a statement issued Thursday, "The U.N. Security
Council's message to Iraq is swift and clear: the international
community is united in rejecting Iraq's demand for a rewriting of
the rules under which UNSCOM operates."
</P>
<P>
"If (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein is genuine in wanting
sanctions lifted, he cannot continue to defy the will of the
international community," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook stressed that Iraq should "take heed" of the U.N.'s demand
that Iraq resume full and unconditional cooperation with the
UNSCOM and allow it full access to carry out its inspections.
</P>
<P>
"Only when UNSCOM has completed its work, can the U.N. Security
Council take action on sanctions," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Needs to Be Engaged More Closely: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Thursday that the United Nations needs to engage
Iraq much more closely in resolving the question of arms
inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who phoned Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
Thursday morning, told the Security Council that he made it clear
to Aziz that Iraq's demands on the restructuring of U.N. Special
Commission for disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM, "are unacceptable
to the Security Council and the United Nations as a whole."
</P>
<P>
The council held informal consultations on Thursday to hear
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler's briefing on the breakdown of his
talks with the Iraqi authorities this week, which was followed by
a decision by Iraq to suspend cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors unless conditions it sets are met.
</P>
<P>
It demands equal representation of the member states of the
Security Council on UNSCOM, a relocation of UNSCOM headquarters to
Geneva from New York and a rotation of UNSCOM chairmanship among
the five permanent members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"In any case it is not for a single member state to dictate the
organization how it should structure its activities," Annan said,
adding that the Iraqi position is clearly in violation of the
resolutions of the council and the accord he reached with Iraq in
February to defuse an inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "having studied the Iraqi declarations
carefully and spoken to Mr. Aziz, it is my judgement that the
Iraqi Government's position on this matter is not a closed one."
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the Government of Iraq has developed the view
that its record of compliance is not satisfactorily recognized by
UNSCOM or by the Security Council," he said, continuing:
</P>
<P>
"It is my view that rather than allowing this situation to
deteriorate into a crisis, the Security Council should seek to
engage with the Iraqi authorities in order to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
"I would propose that the Security Council give some thought to
the larger questions involved in this matter by undertaking a
comprehensive review of the entire issue.
</P>
<P>
"This would include taking stock of Iraqi compliance with
relevant Security Council resolutions, the recognition of progress
made in a number of areas, and examining ways forward, bearing in
mind the ultimate objective of the exercise which is to ensure
that Iraq is effectively disarmed and that the Iraqi people are
enabled to take their place among the community of nations, free
of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The comprehensive review should involve a more direct dialogue
than has occurred hitherto between the the Government of Iraq and
the Security Council itself on the contentious issues before us."
</P>
<P>
Later, the Secretary-General told reporters that in taking the
comprehensive review, it might be helpful to engage the Iraqis
much more closely.
</P>
<P>
Ruling out the need to apply any military means to pressure
Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions, Annan said the determination
of the Security Council to see the tasks through "will help us
alone".
