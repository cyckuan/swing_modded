<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Should Be Protected: Pak PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Wednesday that the World Trade Organization (WTO)
must pay special attention to maximizing the trading potential of
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote address at the Ninth Annual Corporate
Conference of the Asia Society which opened Wednesday evening at
the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, Sharif said that
the new international economic regime must not only create a level
playing field but also protect the disadvantaged nations from any
form of exploitation.
</P>
<P>
"This is an age of interdependence. We expect that a spirit of
fair play and constructive competition will prevail in the new
trading regime," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Disparities in incomes between nations and among people are
startling, Sharif said. Unless this is redressed, global progress
and stability will remain a distant dream, he added
</P>
<P>
In this world of interdependence, however, an island of
prosperity cannot sustain itself in an ocean of poverty, Sharif
noted. Prosperity and peace must go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
"We must strive for an interdependent world if four-fifths of
humankind are to be saved from the deep abyss of poverty," the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
On the recent financial crisis in Asia, Sharif said that the
roots of the crisis can be traced to the large flow of unregulated
and inadequately reported flow of private capital to the affected
counties going into imprudent lending to sectors like property or
services.
</P>
<P>
In other words, this was crisis stemming from the capital
account and not a current account deficit, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Viewed in this context, it will be appropriate to call this a
crisis of global financial management and not just an Asian
crisis, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The strategy for reinvigorating growth should focus on balanced
growth, on a wider dispersal of opportunities, and on securing the
integration of developing countries in the global market, Sharif
said.
</P>
<P>
This must be ensured by investment in their natural resources;
by expanding their infrastructure, especially the transport and
communication links; by developing their human resources; by
enhancing their productivity and efficiency; and by the
stimulation of demand, he added.
</P>
<P>
Priority should be given to assisting the developing countries
in their policies and programs of deregulation and liberalization,
in particular by safeguarding against likely adverse developments
in the transitional period, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Structural adjustment should be undertaken in the advanced
countries in order to stimulate demand for imports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Priorities should also be given to resisting new protectionist
tendencies especially those on environmental and social grounds;
and intensifying efforts for transfer and diffusion of technology
to the new power house economies, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The tremendous productive potential for reinvigorating world
growth has to be harnessed properly to avoid economic and social
dislocations on a large scale, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are indivisible and poverty anywhere is a
threat to prosperity everywhere, he said. "Ensuring world peace
and banishing poverty should therefore be high on our agenda,"
Sharif added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Not Prepared to Guarantee E-Commerce Tax Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government, fearing a
huge loss of potential income, is balking at a U.S. drive to
guarantee that Internet and global electronic commerce remain tax
free.
</P>
<P>
So far, Canada is one of the few countries that refuses to sign
on to the U.S. concept of not imposing duties or other taxes on
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
At a trade negotiators' meeting in Geneva last week, Canada
said it would only consider a four-year moratorium on taxing
Internet transactions.
</P>
<P>
The government insists it has not yet made up its mind whether
it will tax Internet transactions. At present, only goods and
services tax is levied on Internet sales at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
Revenue Minister Herb Dhaliwal had said that his government
wanted to make sure tax laws are "appropriately applied" to
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
"The department wants to ensure the integrity of Canada's tax
base continues to be maintained," he was quoted as saying in
Wednesday's Financial Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Canada's federal and provincial governments are also worried
that they will see their retail tax base quickly erode if Internet
sales remain tax free.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said
Tuesday that she had convinced most major countries not to impose
import duties or other taxes on Internet transactions.
</P>
<P>
"We already have a critical mass of countries that agree with
the duty-free cyberspace concept," Barshefsky said.

HANOI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- 12 Vietnamese fishermen were killed
and about 30 others reported missing in high seas after a
whirlwind blowing at up to 100 kph hit the country's central coast
off Quang Ngai province, the Vietnam news agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The twister, which struck on Monday morning, also sank three
fishing trawlers and damaged three others.
</P>
<P>
Five fishing boats carrying about eight fishermen each are
among the missing.
</P>
<P>
The whirlwind also sank 14 boats and caused 15 other boats to
go missing off the coast of the neighboring province Quang Nam.
</P>

On Sunday, two people were struck dead by lightning during a
thunderstorm in the central province of Quang Tri.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Holbrooke for Failed Trip in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday accused U.S
presidential envoy for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke of not exerting
pressure upon the Turkish Cypriot side to break the present
impasse of the Cyprus problem
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee meeting,
Greek Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis said that the
U.S. envoy's mistake was that he failed in exerting appropriate
pressure upon the Turkish Cypriot side and did not attribute
responsibility for the failure where it belonged.
</P>
<P>
He accused Holbrooke of maintaining "a policy of equal
distances."
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Greece would launch an international
campaign to inform public opinion and governments about the Cyprus
problem and Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government Monday expressed its regret and
disappointment with the lack of progress in the protracted Cyprus
problem, saying that the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
should bear the responsibility.

<P>
HANOI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Japan will jointly carry
out technological research for coal exploitation at Duong Huy coal
mine in Vietnam's biggest coal mining province of Quang Ninh,
according to Vietnamese press reports.
</P>
<P>
The two-year project will start within the year according to a
memorandum of understanding which has been just signed by the
Vietnam Coal Corporation (VINACOAL) and the Japanese Coal
Corporation (JCOAL).
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of Vietnam's exported coal is shipped to
Japan, which wants to ensure a stable source of coal from Vietnam,
according to an official of the Japanese Ministry of Industry and
Trade.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on a five-year project to conduct coal exploration
at the Red River Delta and a two-year project to exchange
technicians are underway between Vietnam and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, VINACOAL and its Japanese partners will probably
implement projects to study ventilation in coal mines, to build a
safety control center, and to build a coal sorting factory at Cua
Ong mine, also in Quang Ninh province, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prime Minister Visits Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
greeted Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi at the White House
Wednesday, but not mentioning the Marine jet accident that killed
20 skiers in the Italian Alps.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Prodi at the White House, Clinton first noted that
U.S. personnel from the Aviano air base were assisting in rescue
efforts after this week's storms in southern Italy and then
expressed thanks to Italians for their "hospitality toward United
States forces working to preserve peace in Europe."
</P>
<P>
"The history of our partnership is long and special; every
schoolchild knows that Columbus crossed the Atlantic in 1492,"
said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"That was only the beginning of a relationship that has now
flourished for centuries bringing us together in new ways
generation after generation," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his own remarks, from a reviewing stand on the South Lawn,
Prodi called their two nations "two citizens of the next
millennium bound by common values."
</P>
<P>
Prodi said he wanted to pursue a "vast sphere of free trade"
between the U.S. and Europe "not only to best utilize our energy
and to strengthen as much as possible our political and economic
ties but also as a common contribution to the global trade
liberalization."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters before
Prodi's arrival that Clinton would have nothing more direct to say
in public about the Marines' incident because the case was before
a military tribunal.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said Clinton was hoping privately to
assuage any remaining sore feelings among the Italian people, and
was anxious to see how Prodi will respond.
</P>
<P>
"This has been a subject of enormous concern and pain to both
of our governments," McCurry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We just need to see how they address it. I think we have dealt
with this in a sensitive way and in a way that is designed to
ensure that justice is done," the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
As Prodi arrived, a military court in Camp LeJeune, N.C., began
hearings into whether two crewmen should be court-martialed over
the Feb. 3 accident involving a low-flying Marine jet from the
U.S. air base in Aviano.
</P>
<P>
Following the accident, angry Italians decried American pilots
as careless "Rambos" and Communist leaders demanded the closure of
U.S. military bases in their country. Clinton phoned Prodi and
promised a full investigation.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Clinton also wanted to discuss the summit
of industrialized nations next week in Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
Prodi arrived here on Tuesday for his first visit to the U.S.
as the prime minister of Italy.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Efforts for African Timber Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Agriculture and
Rural Development Carlos Fernandes said here Wednesday that his
country has made "positive contributions" to the stable
development of Africa's timber industry since May 1996.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the two-year period during which Angola
has been the chairman country of the African Timber Organization
(ATO).
</P>
<P>
The minister told the press here in the Luanda Airport before
departing for the 18th ATO meeting to be held in Bangui, capital
of the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Fernandes said, Angola has done much
publicity work advocating rational development of forest
resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it also pressed for the industrialization of timber
exploitation among ATO member states so as to enhance the
capability of timber processing, which has increased both timber
export and job opportunities for the members.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes believed that these measures are in the interests of
all ATO member countries.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming ATO meeting, the minister said, it will
mainly discuss issues concerning ATO's cooperation with other
relevant international or regional organizations, as well as
membership applications by Mali, Senegal, Benin, Guinea and Togo.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1976, the ATO now has 13 members comprising Angola,
Tanzania, Liberia, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Nigeria,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo Republic, Cote d'Ivoire,
Gabon, Ghana, Sao Tome &AMP; Principe, and Equatorial Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Its goal is to coordinate policies on the protection and
utilization of forest resources among the member states.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Truth Body Sends out Reparation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has sent reparation notices to
the first 700 people officially declared victims of gross human
rights violations, the TRC said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu said the victims have been informed
that they were eligible to apply for reparations, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The TRC's reparations and rehabilitation committee receives
applications for reparation and decides who are victims of gross
human right violations eligible to apply for reparation.
</P>
<P>
Interim reparations are once-off payments, normally a maximum
of 2,000 Rand (400 U.S. Dollars), for victims who had suffered
hardship in the apartheid era and were in need, or their
dependants.
</P>
<P>
"For us it is a tremendous, historic day. It is almost like we
are beginning our work," Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
The commission had spent two years collecting statements,
hearing public testimonies and individually corroborating each of
the more than 20,000 statements received.
</P>
<P>
If a victim had suffered hardship and was in particular need,
the reparations committee would forward the application to the
president's fund, the body set up to make reparations payments.
</P>
<P>
A TRC staff member said that the amount of reparations could
be increased on a sliding scale if the conditions of the victims
and their dependants warranted it.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said the findings in a minority of cases, where people
had been found not to be victims of gross human rights
violations, would also be sent out soon.
</P>
<P>
These people would be able to appeal against the decision, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The truth body is scheduled to end its work on June 30 and a
final report on its findings will be produced at that time.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's First Satellite Rotating Normally in Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Information
Safwat el-Sherif said Wednesday that the country's first satellite
Nilesat 101 is now rotating in its pre-set orbit in outer space.
</P>
<P>
Nilesat will rotate in this orbit for the duration of its
presumed 16-year life span following its successful launching by
the Ariane-4 Rocket from the Korou air space in French Guyana,
South America on April 28.
</P>
<P>
Nilesat 101 is being tracked by five ground stations in Egypt,
France, South America and Australia.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that Nilesat is now rotating in a
regular manner at a distance of 36,000 kilometers from earth.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Egyptian Radio and Television Union Abdel
Rahman Hafez said there is a clear contact between the satellite
and the main ground station at Six of October City, about 30
kilometers southeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The timetable for synchronizing, correcting, tests, operation,
measuring capacity and ground coverage will complete by the end of
May, in time for Media Day on May 31.
</P>
<P>
On Media Day, the official celebration of operating the Nilesat
will take place, when President Hosni Mubarak will give the signal
to place television and radio programs on the satellite for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
There will be 50 general and specialized television channels,
open and encrypted, to be viewed by Egyptians and Arabs by the use
of small, low-cost dishes, Hafez said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has already signed contracts with Libya and Oman to lease
its space channels on the satellite. A space channel is expected
to be leased to Lebanon shortly.

<HEADLINE> Prices of Base Minerals Depressed in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's base minerals have
remained depressed in the first quarter of this year as a result
of low demand mainly from Asia where there has been a financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the performance of the financial sector during the
first quarter of the year, the Zimbabwe Financial Holdings
(Finhold) said a number of mining companies continued to close
down, especially gold mining companies, as operating costs rose
following the plunge of local currency last November, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, those mining companies which managed to increase
export volumes benefited somewhat from the weaker Zimbabwean
Dollar, as profitability in local currency terms improved.
</P>
<P>
"Among others, in the short term, copper prices are not
expected to recover from their recent low due to the fact that
the copper market is likely to remain in surplus by about 300,000
tons in 1998," Finhold said.
</P>
<P>
Nickel, which fell by 2.1 percent on the last quarter of 1997
to 5,310 U.S. Dollars per ton in the first quarter of 1998, was
likely to decline further to about 5,100 U.S. Dollars per ton in
the short to medium-term.
</P>
<P>
However, minerals like platinum and gold had shown some
improvement during the first three months of the year, with
platinum prices rising by 13.3 percent in January to 412 U.S.
Dollars per ounce in March.
</P>
<P>
Also, in the first quarter of this year, the gold market
showed signs of recovery as reflected by the fact that the price
of gold rose slightly by 5.3 percent from 288 U.S. Dollars per
ounce in January to 303 U.S. Dollars per ounce in March.
</P>
<P>
"In the short to medium-term, the price of gold is expected to
remain generally stable at around 315 U.S. Dollars per ounce as
supplies are expected to decline at a faster rate than demand,"
said Finhold.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein to Vote in Favor of N.Irish Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of IRA,
will recommend a "yes" vote in a referendum on the Northern
Ireland peace agreement, BBC radio reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It reported that a document released to reporters in Belfast
said Sinn Fein's policy-directing national executive had
recommended that members should campaign for it in referendums on
both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic on May 22.
</P>
<P>
"The (national executive), in the context of our legitimate
reservation, calls for a yes vote in the referendums north and
south," the document said.
</P>
<P>
The referendums will be held on the peace agreement struck on
April 10 by the major political parties in the province, including
Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Irish Republican Army was reported to have
changed its rules to allow members of Sinn Fein to take seats in a
proposed power-sharing assembly in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
In a major change in favor of the peace process in Northern
Ireland, IRA had dropped a constitutional bar to Sinn Fein members
sitting in what the outlawed guerrilla group calls "subservient"
parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein and the IRA had been opposed to the participation in
an assembly before, saying to do so would legitimize British
jurisdiction over Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> UK Oil Income Falls to Lowest Level in 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland said
Wednesday that daily average UK oil revenues fell to only 20.5
million pounds (33.8 million US dollars) in March, their lowest
level in real terms for at least 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The bank's latest Oil and Gas Index showed that daily oil
revenues in March were 34 percent down on the same period last
year and the lowest level since the index was first published in
1983.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the main reason for the big fall in income
lies in the price slide for North Sea benchmark Brent, which
averaged just 13.17 US dollars a barrel, the lowest in real terms
since 1973, and the lowest in simple cash terms for ten years.
</P>
<P>
It said that falls in oil output also contributed to the drop
in oil revenues as the average production of 2.58 million barrels
a day in March was 0.5 percent down from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Finally, a 3.4 percent appreciation of the pound against the
dollar, the oil industry's benchmark currency, since March 1997
further ate into the country's oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
"At current prices and exchange rates, production would have to
rise almost six fold to push real term revenues to their previous
peak," said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Even to reach the revenues recorded in March 1997, output
would have to rise by 51 percent," the report added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gas revenues also fell by 5.3 percent to 17.8
million pounds (29.4 million US dollars) in March, but were 6.3
percent up on last year.
</P>
<P>
It said that at 40.9 million pounds (67.5 million US dollars),
combined oil and gas revenues were 19.8 percent down on last year
and 6.4 percent down on February.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus: No Trouble in Ties With Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Wednesday rejected the
allegation that its ally Greece is intended to improve ties with
Turkey, which still controls a third of the island's territory.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
hailed the Cyprus-Greece cooperation as "perfect" and praised
Greeks' policy on the Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as a reaction to the criticism by House
President Spyros Kyprianou against the Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis that he subscribes to U.S. policy with regard to improving
relations with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
There is "no reason to question either the intentions or the
moves the Greek government makes in connection with the Cyprus
problem," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government is "fully briefed" about the Greeks'
moves towards the Cyprus issue which are "in the framework of the
common strategy."
</P>
<P>
The two governments agreed on a joint defense pact in 1993,
under which Greece will provide military assistance to Cyprus in
case it is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Greece, together with Turkey and Britain were guarantors of
Cyprus' independence under the 1960 Treaty of Establishment of
the Cyprus Republic.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Warring Parties Agree on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese warring sides
Wednesday reached an agreement on the recognition of the right of
self-determination for the people of southern Sudan and agreed to
continue to seek a negotiated settlement to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held here on Wednesday at the
end of a three-day Sudanese peace talks, Kenyan Foreign Minister
Bonaya Godana said that there is a "limited progress" at the
second round of the peace talks between the Sudanese government
and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement (SPLM).
</P>
<P>
He noted that limited progress was made in terms of the
government's acceptance of self-determination right for the
people in Southern Sudan but the progress was "not too
optimistic".
</P>
<P>
Attending the three-day peace talks opened on May 4 are the
Sudanese government delegation led by Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman and the SPLM delegation headed by Nhial Deng, Governor of
southern Bahr el Ghazal Province.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued by the IGAD (Inter-Governmental
Authority for Development) Ministerial Sub-Committee Meeting on
the South Sudan Conflict, the minister said that the right of
self-determination would be exercised through an internationally
supervised referendum at the end of an interim period.
</P>
<P>
The interim arrangement is to be negotiated and agreed upon by
the two parties through the IGAD peace process, said the Kenyan
minister who opened the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
According to Godana, the two parties to the conflict in
Southern Sudan were unable to reach a common ground on the
question of state and religion.
</P>
<P>
During the first round of peace talks held here last October,
the two parties could not agree on two issues, namely, the right
of self-determination for the people of southern Sudan and the
relationship between state and religion.
</P>
<P>
At the IGAD Ministerial Sub-Committee Meeting held here
between May 4 and 6, Godana said that the IGAD sub-committee
agreed to undertake shuttle diplomacy as a means of narrowing the
gap between the two parties on outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
On the humanitarian assistance to southern Sudan affected by
famine, The Sudanese government offered a ceasefire and immediate
stop of hostilities to facilitate the unhindered flow of relief
supply, while the SPLM declared that unhindered relief assistance
to the needy should not be linked to a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Referring to differences on the definition of southern Sudan,
Godana said that the SPLM required to plus Abyei, Southern
Kordofan and Southern Blue Nile in addition to three provinces of
Bahr el Ghazal, Equatoria and Upper Nile accepted by the Sudanese
government as southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The two warring parties agreed at the talks to convene the
third round of peace talks in three months time in Addis Ababa,
capital of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Sub-Committee meeting was attended by foreign ministers of
Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda, representative of current IGAD
Chairman Ahmed Issa Gabobeh and IGAD official Kinfe Abraham under
the chairmanship of Kenyan foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in southern Sudan broke out in 1983 between the
Moslem-ruled Khartoum government in the north and the SPLM
fighting for more autonomy and religious freedom in the animist
and Christian-dominated south.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 1.3 million Sudanese have reportedly been
killed during the past 15 years by the conflicts between the two
parties and natural calamities in southern Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Asian Financial Crisis Tops G-15 Summit Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The three-day G-15 summit which will
open here Monday will flesh out ways to deal with the financial
crisis in southeast Asia and to avoid a repetition elsewhere in
future, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Seven heads of state, three vice presidents and a number of
ministers will attend the eighth summit of the group of 16
developing countries, in which they will issue a communique
spelling out the group's stances on economic and political issues.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial turbulence will be among several main axes
of the communique to be issued at the end of the annual summit,
MENA quoted the draft document as saying.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the G-15 foreign ministers Saturday,
Malaysia will present a report outlining its viewpoint on the
financial crisis and lessons drawn from it in order to avoid a
repetition.
</P>
<P>
The draft final communique will also outline ways of
strengthening South-South cooperation and at the same time
activating constructive North-South dialog.
</P>
<P>
It will call for easing the burdens of debts of developing
countries in general and the G-15 countries in particular and ask
the international community to offer effective solutions to this
problem.
</P>
<P>
Mounir Zahran, Egypt's permanent delegate at the U.N. European
headquarters in Geneva expected the signing during the Cairo
summit of an agreement to set up a union of chambers of commerce to
promote trade exchange among G-15 countries.
</P>
<P>
Inter-trade exchange among G-15 countries represented about 9
percent of their overall trade volume which amounted to about
796 billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"A new mechanism, a union of chambers of commerce, was required
to promote trade, strengthen relations among businessmen and
remove trade obstacles among them," Zahran said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia will propose the launching of a technology
data project to activate trade exchange and industrial
cooperation. The proposal will be presented to a meeting of the
G-15 ministers of trade on Friday.
</P>
<P>
India will present a report on the obstacles to trade exchange
between developing and advanced countries and to the flow of G-15
trade to world markets.
</P>
<P>
As a group of developing countries from Latin America, Africa
and Asia, the G-15 was founded in 1989. Kenya became the 16th
member last year, joining Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Algeria, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Nigeria, Argentina, Jamaica,
Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Peru and Chile.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 members, accounting for 30 percent of the world's
population and 27 percent of land area, represent the emerging
economies of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Their total gross domestic product makes up 39 percent of the
third world and exports, 31 percent of the developing countries'
total.

<HEADLINE> Angola Decides to Expand Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A meeting on the involvement of
Angola's private sector in infrastructure construction was
concluded here Wednesday, with a resolution to expand the
country's privatization so as to restore the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, jointly sponsored by the Angolan Ministry of
Economic Planning and the World Bank, resolved to revise laws
concerning economic sections under state monopoly, and to allow
the participation of private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the meeting, telecommunications, transport and
road, health infrastructure, energy and water are now among the
priorities opened for the privatization.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the meeting agreed that the resolution will
invite remarkable changes in the structure of Angola's strategic
departments and ensure faster restoration of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1998-2000 economic rehabilitation program of the
Angolan government, the privatization will be realized through
open tender.
</P>
<P>
However, the government delegates stressed at the meeting that
priority should be offered to national enterprises for
infrastructure privatization.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Tanzania and Bolivia shared their
experiences in privatization at the meeting, which was opened
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Proposes U.N. Debate on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia will bring back before the
U.N. Security Council its proposal to discuss ways of supporting
U.N. secretary-general's good offices mission in Cyprus, a Russian
diplomat said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides, Russian ambassador Georgi Mouradov said before
U.S. Presidential Emissary Richard Holbrooke's visit to the island
a few days earlier, "the U.S. had requested we cancel the debate
at the Security Council until after a visit here by Richard
Holbrooke and we had agreed."
</P>
<P>
Following Holbrooke's visit to Nicosia, which ended on Monday,
Moscow "will bring back the same proposal as the visit's results
make a debate necessary," the Russian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke had three days of extensive consultations with the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, but failed to get them back
to the negotiating table as Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
insisted on the recognition of his self-styled regime in northern
Cyprus and the withdrawal of Cyprus' application to join the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on Russia's proposal, Mouradov said it aims to back
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's good offices mission, the
bicommunal dialog between the two sides and to support Annan's
special advisor for Cyprus, Diego Cordovez.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez, who chaired two rounds of peace talks between
Clerides and Denktash last summer, is expected to visit the island
soon, said Mouradov.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to cooperate with all Security Council
permanent member states to solve the Cyprus question and facts
have proven that joint efforts could be more productive, instead
of isolated efforts by any country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Denktash's preconditions, Mouradov said Russia
supports the continuation of the dialog between the leaders of
the two communities and all U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third in the wake of a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' peace process came to a standstill last summer when
Denktash, angered by European Union's decision to open accession
talks with Cyprus, walked out of peace talks with Clerides.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the divided
island in a bizonal, bicommunal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> UK Must Be Prepared for Single Currency: Beckett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) - Businesses in Britain will only thrive
if they plan ahead for the euro, the President of the Board of
Trade, Margaret Beckett told audience at a seminar in Birmingham
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first in a series of events to be held around the
country to discuss how business should prepare for the single
currency.
</P>
<P>
Beckett said: "The introduction of the single currency - the
euro - across the European Union on 1 January next year will
change the business environment not just in those 11 countries,
bet across the whole of Europe."
</P>
<P>
Many KU companies believe that because Britain is not joining
in the first wave, they do not need to take any action, Beckett
warned: "They are wrong." Adding "The euro zone will account for
nearly half of British exports and over 40% OF British overseas
direct investment."
</P>
<P>
So even though Britain is not in the first wave, its businesses
will be affected and must be prepared to address the changes which
EMU will bring, she stressed.

<HEADLINE> LIFFE to Launch Innovative Futures Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) - The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) announced Wednesday it would
introduce a series of contracts called LIFFE Libor Financed Bonds.
</P>
<P>
The new Bonds will replicate the interest rate and price
sensitivity of interest rate swaps, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Initially the contracts will be denominated in deutschmarks
with the provision to convert to the euro at the start of Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The first of these contracts will be positioned at the 5 and 10
year areas of the swaps curve and will be launched in the fourth
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The LIFFE Libor Financed Bond adopts a pricing mechanism that
ensures that its price performance replicates the price
sensitivity of an interest rate swap.
</P>
<P>
The contract can be considered similar to a cash settled bond
futures contract with only one bond in the deliverable basket.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Hodson, Chief Exekcutive of LIFFE, said: "This
initiative reflects the increased efficiency and enormous growth
of the swaps market."
</P>
<P>
"It also recognizes market expectation that the euro-swap curve
will become the benchmark for the European fixed income markets,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> London Airports Suffer Worst Delay in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) - Delay as Britain's six largest
airports increased last year to their highest level since 1991,
the Financial Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as saying the
average delay was 16 minutes, compared with 14 minutes in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, flights were delayed by an average of 20 minutes and
by 18 minutes in 1991. The figures are averages of all flights
from the airports and not just of those that were delayed.
</P>
<P>
The CAA said last year's performance was still better than in
the late 1980s, in spite of a 24 percent increase in the number of
flights since then.
</P>
<P>
Last year's delays had a variety of causes, including weather,
industrial action, air traffic control difficulties, defective
aircraft, missing passengers and security hold-ups.
</P>
<P>
International flights were delayed more often than domestic
services. Delays were also more likely on long-haul routes than on
short-haul flights.
</P>
<P>
According to the CAA, the worst airports for scheduled
passengers were all in London. Delays at Gatwick and Luton
airports averaged 16 minutes. At Healthrow, the average delay was
14 minutes.

ABU DHABI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin Wednesday called for support for the Palestinian cause, the
news agency of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Palestinians and Arab and Islamic nations to
maintain contacts, interactive relations, joint actions and
perseverance in their support for the Palestinian rights by all
ways and means.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Sheikh Hamid Bin Rashid Al Naami, ruler of
the Ajman Emirate, one of UAE's seven component emirates, Yassin
said that his recent visits to a number of states in the region
have been successful.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Palestinian radical movement arrived here on
Monday after wrapping up his visit to Iran, before which he had
traveled to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Yassin said that he explained Hamas' positions on issues
regarding the Palestinians, and won full understanding and
cooperation from leaders of the aforesaid countries.
</P>
<P>
Hamas' moves are not against anyone except the enemy that has
usurped Palestinian lands and legitimate right of
self-determination, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that efforts made by struggling Palestinian
organizations will be victorious, and that Arabs and Muslims will
celebrate victory at the Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

Czech Republic complicates the issue.
</P>
<P>
NATO decided last December that the principle of rotation
between countries for key commanding posts would be applied and
that 50 percent of the posts of a head-quarter should be allocated
to foreign nationals to guarantee a multinational character of
inter-allied staff headquarters.
</P>
<P>
General Klaus Naumann, chairman of the NATO Military Committee,
said that the three invitees should be included in the
head-quarters and for precise jobs.
</P>
<P>
The general told the press that the discussion was just like,
to use military terminology, the first shot to help train in later
rounds of shells. Wednesday's discussion was to seek views from
member states, the general added.
</P>
<P>
The military committee, the highest military authority within
the western alliance, had to be cautious for NATO had failed its
internal adaptation attempt the first time in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs of staff adopted, according to the military
committee chairman, a basic document concerning the internal
adaptation and agreed on an outline implementation plan that
demands that the internal adaptation should be achieved no later
than April 1999 by means of simultaneous activation of the
regional headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The outline implementation plan will be submitted by the
military committee to the autumn meeting of NATO defense ministers
for approval.
</P>
<P>
A tricky issue remained as how to maintain the military
hierarchy and balance the national and NATO responsibilities
through the appointment of generals with different numbers of
stars.
</P>
<P>
Naumann described the issue as both interesting and
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chiefs of staff also met their counterparts from the
three invitees, Russia, Ukraine and from the 28 Partnership for
Peace member countries.
</P>
<P>
A broad range of issues were dealt with during these meetings,
including the current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the
follow-on force to replace SFOR, the interoperability of NATO
integration, the defense of air space for the three invitee
countries and the trials of the Combined Joint Task Forces.

<HEADLINE> Martyrs' Day Marked in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 30,000 Lebanese, mostly
students, gathered in the Martyr Square here on Wednesday to mark
the Martyrs' Day, commemorating those who sacrificed for the
country's independence and liberation.
</P>
<P>
The move came as fighters of the Hezbollah, or Party of God,
are leading a guerrilla war against Israeli occupation of south
Lebanon. Many fighters of the Hezbollah and other resistance
forces have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the gathering, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
reiterated Lebanon's rejection of Israel's withdrawal offer,
saying the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 can not be
negotiated.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a border strip in south Lebanon to
allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Due to heavy casualties that the Israeli troops have been
suffering, the Israeli government has decided to withdraw from
Lebanon under the condition that security arrangements be
negotiated with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, insisting that the withdrawal
be unconditional under the U.N. resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will never hold talks with the Jewish state over this
issue, Hariri said. He demanded Israel withdraw its troops
immediately and unconditionally from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the role of the young people, he said that his
government will give priority to them and the whole society should
consult with them over the nation's development and future.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (xinhua) -- Africa was likely to emerge
as a key transit region for traffickers of drugs such as cocaine
and heroin, a study by the United Nations International Drug
Control Program (UNDCP) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Weak law enforcement structures, acute economic, political and
social problems in Africa and the strengthening of legal control
in other parts of the world, were all factors in the continent's
emergence as a drug conduit.
</P>
<P>
The Study found that already South Africa, Kenya and some West
African countries were being used by international drug
trafficking syndicates.
</P>
<P>
The study also said that resource and technical constraints
made it difficult for law enforcement agencies to take effective
action against drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Leakage from drug trafficking through sub-Saharan Africa into
local communities and major cities is exacerbating the social
problems associated with poverty, political and tribal conflicts
and the spread of HIV/ AIDS infection.

LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Liberian Defense Ministry Daniel Chea
Wednesday accused some of the country's former soldiers of trying
to make trouble, arguing that the government's treatment of the
demobilized soldiers was correct.
</P>
<P>
Some retired soldiers, unhappy with the low pay offered by the
government, went to the Central Bank last weekend to demonstrate
and they besieged the Defense Ministry Tuesday for better
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Chea, who was reported to have fled from the ministry
building, said the incident was caused by a few disgruntled
former soldiers who were trying to making some problems.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way this country can afford to run a 400,000-man
army" after seven years of civil war, the minister said, quoted
by a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Most of the former soldiers were voluntary in the disarmament

AMMAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Wednesday made a telephone call to brief Jordanian King Hussein on
the just-concluded London Mideast peace talks, Jordan's official
news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, Arafat reaffirmed the
acceptance by the Palestinian National Authority of a United
States proposal calling on Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried to bridge the
gap between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
over Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank. But she failed to
persuade Netanyahu to accept the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Hussein that the PNA has also accepted U.S.
suggestion made during the London talks to hold negotiations in
Washington between the Palestinians and the Israelis on May 11 if
the two sides achieve tangible results in follow-up talks on troop
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that PNA's acceptance of the two U.S. proposals
shows its commitment to making peace with Israel and determination
to win the right to exercise sovereignty over its national soil.
</P>

He expressed satisfaction with the U.S. efforts to help achieve
tangible progress in the peace process between the Palestinians

<HEADLINE> Moi Urges Cut Down on Public Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Wednesday called for reduction of public expenditure to ease the
financial pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an economic consultative meeting held here, the
president said that the reduction would "enable us to lower the
tax burden on the private sector, thus encouraging firms to make
the investment that is necessary for Kenya's growth."
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that over the past decade, the government had to
increase short-term domestic borrowing by six fold in order to
finance the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
According to a working paper distributed at the meeting,
Kenya's domestic debt has more than doubled from 63 billion
Kenyan Shillings (about 1.05 billion U.S. Dollars) in 1992 to 150
billion Shillings (about 2.5 billion Dollars) at present.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that over 25 percent of all public
expenditure was required to meet the interest on government
domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
He said that interest payment for domestic debt, and salaries
and allowances for civil servants and teachers would consume more
than 80 percent of total public expenditure, leaving few
resources for capital investment.
</P>
<P>
Moi told the one-day meeting, which was attended by government
ministers, members of parliament from both ruling and opposition
parties, diplomats and officials from the World Bank and other
international bodies, that the Ministry of Finance had already
instructed all ministries to review their activities and
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
He urged the meeting to make specific proposals on reducing
the share of public expenditures relative to gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, President Moi called for unity among Kenyan
people, saying that "if we throw our peace out of the window,
there is no development that can take place in this country."
</P>
<P>
The working paper prepared by a team of advisors said that
domestic debt had become a serious structural constraint to the
achievement of rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The current high levels of interest rates on bank lending
ranging from 30 percent to 40 percent have drastically
discouraged economic growth since the private sector cannot
afford to borrow money at such high interest rates, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
The team appointed by President Moi on April 30 noted that
bold measures should be urgently taken to deal particularly with
the high domestic debt and interest rates problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the working paper, the current level of
corruption in the East African country is adversely affecting
efficiency and effectiveness of government policy and operations.
</P>
<P>
During the discussions, Kimani Wanyoike, Chairman of the
opposition Ford People, pointed out that political will on the
government side and security provided by the state machinery were
the prerequisite in solving the current economic problems.

UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Two of three children who do
not finish primary school are girls despite direct benefits of
girls's education to economies and family health, according to the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF, together with the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the Inter-American Development Bank are
holding a conference in Washington from May 6-8 on Educating
Girls: A Development Imperative, UNICEF said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The conference, bringing together the public, private and
nonprofit sectors from various countries, is mobilizing
international efforts to advance girls' education.
</P>
<P>
"If countries want to achieve economic and social development,
no investment has a higher pay-off than educating girls," said J.
Brian Atwood, Administrator of USAID, adding that girls are too
often the last to be reached by expanding education systems.
</P>
<P>
Education for girls is the key to overall improvements in the
standard of living, to better agricultural and environmental
practices and to greater involvement and gender balance in
decision-making at all levels of society, echoed Executive
Director of UNICEF Carol Bellamy.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Wednesday emphasized the importance of convening an Arab summit as
soon as possible to confront the serious challenges facing the
Palestinian people and the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his meeting with Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual at noon, Arafat said such an Arab summit should also deal
with developments after the failure of the London meetings on the
stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He described the London meetings as "ferocious political
battle" to rescue the peace process from Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's intransigence and adamant determination to
avoid the full implementation of the signed agreements with the
Palestinians, hence, escaping from the peace process as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Netanyahu took part in a series of meetings in
London on May 4 and 5 with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in an effort to push forward the peace process after a
14-month deadlock, but failed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side rejected a U.S. peace proposal that called for
an Israeli withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat pointed out that there is a new attempt to maintain
U.S. mediation through the prospective invitation of the
Palestinian and Israeli parties for talks in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat praised Algeria's strong stance in support of the
Palestinian people. This stance, he said, will "help us confront
these difficulties and challenges."

Arafat arrived here on Wednesday morning and left later in the
day.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Peace Progress Hinges on Accepting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The success of the coming Washington
peace talks depends on the acceptance by the Palestinian and
Israeli sides of the U.S. proposal, Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have already accepted the American plan which
calls for a further Israeli withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the
West Bank, while Israel has not to date announced its stance on
the issue, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day London talks that wrapped up Tuesday,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright set a deadline of next
Monday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the
U.S. initiative, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
If the Palestinians and Israelis accept the U.S. proposal,
Washington's leading role in the peace process will be clearly
demonstrated, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Progress can never be achieved without accepting all key
elements of the U.S. initiative and a further Israeli redeployment
before the final status negotiations begin," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess steps taken in the peace process so far, Moussa
said that he cannot voice any optimism or pessimism until he meets
with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat here
Thursday and gets to know the Israeli stance which has not been
determined yet.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet will discuss the new U.S. initiative and
made a decision on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Albright is known seeking Israeli approval of a further
pullback of 13 percent from the West Bank, an interim withdrawal
proposal acceptable to Arafat but shunned by Netanyahu who has
offered no more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who started a tour of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia
following the London talks Tuesday, will make a full assessment of
the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March
1997 over Israeli settlement construction and long-delayed
withdrawal from the West Bank.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Uzbek President Islam
Karimov Wednesday expressed here his satisfaction with talks with
Russian leaders on the bilateral relations, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Karimov, who arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for a three-day state
visit, had talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the talks Kiriyenko told a briefing that he and Russian
leaders reached several agreements which will create new powerful
momentum for the development of the two countries relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the results of the talks would hasten solutions to
"overdue issues in the economic and political and humanitarian
spheres and in the sphere of defending interests of Russia in
Central Asia."
</P>
<P>
In Kiriyenko's view, it is crucially important that relations
between Russia and Uzbekistan are built on a clear understanding
of their economic interests, and not on attempts to substitute the
real economic interests by general talk about cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to Kiriyenko, the accords signed Wednesday by the
Russian and Uzbek sides will improve the trade development of the
two countries. The two countries' trade made 1.6 billion dollars
in 1997 and increased by 21 percent in the first quarter of this
year.

<HEADLINE> WFP Accused Liberians of Looting Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has been
complaining about the lack of security in Liberia as some of its
food donation to the country has been looted in two incidents.
</P>
<P>
A WFP regional manager said Wednesday that in the first
incident, a vehicle of WFP food was stopped at a check point when
entering a township in the capital Monrovia and the food loaded
was looted by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The food was not returned despite the protest of officers of
the WFP and other international aid agencies, he said, quoted by
a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The second incident took place on May 2 when a convoy truck
was stopped on the way to a northwestern town by a group of
citizens armed with knives.
</P>
<P>
"They stopped the vehicle and they proceeded to loot 32 tons
of food," the WFP manager said, adding that about 13 tons of the
food was reclaimed, with the balance still missing.
</P>
<P>
One of the WFP personnel was seriously injured in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the incidents might be triggered
off by the poverty in these areas as a lot of people there have
no income, the country is being rehabilitated and the
agricultural sector is not producing much.
</P>
<P>
"These people are taking the food probably because they are
required to feed themselves or to generate some income from the
sale of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has met the country's defense minister to protest and
asked him to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Although there are many problems in the country, he said, the
WFP hopes the government would ensure the security of relief
agencies like WFP to help the country rebuild itself.

WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton has
decided to cut its major naval force in the Gulf from two aircraft
carriers to one temporarily from late May as the situation in the
region has calmed down since the Iraqi crisis on weapons
inspections early this year, Pentagon officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The carrier Independence is scheduled to leave the waters for

there alone for about three weeks, maintaining the watch over
Iraq, the officials said.
</P>

The aircraft carrier Eisenhower, originally scheduled to
replace the Independence on May 13, will remain in the naval port
Norfolk, Virginia, until June 10, they said.

additional forces could be added to the region if the situation in
the Gulf become troublesome.

"The president has made no final decision regarding force level
adjustments in the Arabian Gulf region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters the
president was considering cutting back on the dozens of warships
in the Gulf as "the conditions are somewhat less threatening than
when they were being built up."

<P>
The Clinton administration is under mounting pressure from
Capitol Hill to slim the deployment, which lawmakers argue has
proven costly both financially and in troop morale.
</P>
<P>
A seven-senator delegation just back from a tour of overseas
outposts on Wednesday said they found the troop morale was
extremely low among U.S. forces sent to the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Terms Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic growth
continued at a "moderate to strong" pace in March and April
throughout much of the country but some regions reported weaker
points, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's central bank noted in its "Beige Book" survey of
regional economic developments through early last week that
"expansion was occurring in nearly all districts, although Dallas
reported some signs of slowing growth amid basically strong
regional economic conditions and Minneapolis noted some weakening
of business activity."
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey report, named after the color of its cover, was
compiled from reports submitted by it's 12 district banks. It will
be used when Fed policy-makers sit down May 19 to determine
whether or not to raise short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"despite increases in labor costs, business contacts indicated
that competitive pressures were holding prices in check for most
goods," it said.
</P>
<P>
Nationwidely, there were only two districts -- Dallas and San
Francisco, recorded increases in service prices.
</P>
<P>
"Labor markets continued to be tight," the report said. "There
was some evidence of increased wage pressures in service
industries and for computer and technical professionals."
</P>
<P>
Although the report had a generally upbeat tone, the
Minneapolis bank said "increasing weakness in farming and other
natural resource sectors is casting a pall over spending in rural
areas... (of) Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota."
</P>
<P>
The Dallas district bank said economic activity in its region
was slightly slower than at the start of the year. It said Asia
had weakened manufacturing and lower oil prices had caused "a
strong shift away from oil-directed drilling."
</P>
<P>
In general, the report found "generally robust" consumer
spending and increased factory production in a wide variety of
industries, especially in production of construction materials and
furniture and appliances.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted Asia-linked declines in production of
electronic items in the Boston district, chemicals in the St.
Louis, Dallas and Cleveland regions, metals in the Philadelphia
district and machinery in the Richmond district.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges N.Irish Voters to Say Yes to Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Wednesday urged all sides in Northern Ireland to vote "yes" in the
upcoming referendum on peace deal and isolate the paramilitary
gunmen who do not observe peace.
</P>
<P>
While campaigning for a "yes" vote in Belfast, the provincial
capital of Northern Ireland, Blair said the splinter groups not
observing the ceasefire must not be allowed to dictate the
political agenda in the province.
</P>
<P>
Referendums on the peace deal are being held in Northern
Ireland and in the neighboring Republic of Ireland on May 22.
</P>
<P>
The political settlement will lead to a new power-sharing
assembly in Belfast and establish a new council to develop links
between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
</P>
<P>
Blair was joined by John Major, the former Conservative prime
minister who had played a key role in initiating the peace process
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In a lunch-time address in Belfast to 300 businessmen, Major
also urged them to back the historic peace agreement reached last
month.
</P>
<P>
"A narrow majority or a big 'yes' from one side and not the
other would present a problem," he said. "It could happen. Let's
hope we get a substantial 'yes' vote."
</P>
<P>
Major predicted a "wall of investment" from abroad if Northern
Ireland voted in favour of the agreement, leading to more jobs and
greater prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,200 people have died in 30 years of sectarian conflict
involving thousands of British troops, republican guerrillas
seeking a united Ireland and pro-British "loyalist" extremists.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Court Finds Former PM's Husband Guilty of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish criminal court on
Wednesday found former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's husband Ozer
Ciller guilty of misleading a parliamentary commission
investigating the couples' wealth.
</P>
<P>
The court convicted and sentenced him to five months in
prison, but commuted the prison term to a small fine of about 10
U.S. dollars, suspended for five years, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ozer Ciller was found to have presented a parliamentary
commission with false translations of documents pertaining to the
Cillers' ownership of property in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Tansu Ciller became Turkey's first woman prime minister in
1993 and served for nearly three years before entering into a
coalition with arch-rival and current Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz. The Ciller-Yilmaz government collapsed under graft charges
brought by the Islamist opposition. Tansu Ciller was accused of
amassing vast wealth and property while in power.
</P>
<P>
Tansu Ciller then shocked observers by joining a coalition
with the Islamists who helped her vote down the corruption
charges in parliament before the alliance collapsed last June.
</P>
<P>
Parliament voted last month to set up another inquiry into
the Cillers' wealth. Tansu Ciller denied any wrongdoing and has
brought similar charges against Yilmaz, which the parliament also
voted to investigate.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The 27th session of Arab Financial
Institution Conference opened here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five Arab finance or economy ministers, 14 governors of
central bank and more than 300 bankers and economists from Arab
countries and international institutions attended the two-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
called on the Arab countries to bolster cooperation in every
domain, especial in finance and economy.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the achievements Lebanon has gained after
the 15-year-long civil war ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The convening of the conference indicated that Lebanon has
restored its financial and economic role in the region, Hariri
said.
</P>
<P>
The last time that Lebanon hosted the conference was in 1973,
two years before the country plunged into the civil war, which
destroyed its position as a regional financial center.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing conference will focus on the challenges that Arab
financial sector will face in the next century, economic reforms
in the Arab countries, lessons from the Asian financial crisis and
its impact on Arab economies.
</P>
<P>
It will also discuss the operations of Arab stock and bonds
markets and investment opportunities in Egypt and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Continue Commitment to Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government will continue its
commitment to helping Jordan develop its national economy through
wide-ranging means, a U.S. official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been helping the kingdom implement economic
reform programs, develop industrial zones and finance small-scale
projects, said Lewis Lak, director of the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID)'s mission in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has enlisted much advice from the U.S. in implementing
its economic reform programs, which were started in 1989 to lift
its economy out of predicament starting before the 1990-91 Gulf
crisis, said Lak at a joint press conference with a visiting USAID
delegation.
</P>
<P>
While referring to the small-scale projects, Lak said that
among them are those aimed to improve the quality of water used in
the agricultural sector. Some of Jordan's agricultural products
have been rejected by the regional market for alleged pollution of
irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
Visiting USAID administrator J. Brian Atwood complemented Lak's
remarks by saying that there are also some joint projects such as
pharmaceutic companies that will be hopefully established soon.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. is studying the possibility of ironing
out the obstacles that prevent foreign investment from flowing
into Jordan, added Atwood, who arrived here Tuesday on a working
visit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to Jordan Wesley Egan also said that as part of
the U.S. efforts in this regard, officials of the two sides have
been holding talks on issues of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Through these talks, the U.S. intends to support and help the
kingdom implementing the Intellectual Property Law, the
ambassador added. Jordan has been listed by the U.S. as one of the
top countries that violate the law seriously.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the U.S. Embassy in Jordan,
the U.S. provided the kingdom with a total of 1.55 billion
U.S. dollars of economic and military aid from 1990 to 1997. It is
the second largest donor to the kingdom, coming only after Japan.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Illegal Arms Shipment to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The report by some Western agencies
about the alleged illegal arms shipment to Sierra Leone which
involved Nigeria was out of fact, a Nigerian defense official
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Britain has begun investigations to
reveal whether Nigeria was involved in illegal shipment of arms
used by the west African peace keeping force (ECOMOG) to restore
the civilian government in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The British report charged that the arms sale was a breach of
the international arms sanctions imposed on Sierra Leone
following the ousting of the legitimate government in a coup last
May.
</P>
<P>
The report said the then ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
of Sierra Leone made the clandestine arms deal with a British
company.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the report," and "We never heard of the
deal," Col. Godwin Ugbo, spokesman of the Nigerian Defense
Headquarters, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG was in Sierra Leone to carry out a
peace keeping mission, and arms and ammunition were certainly
needed for such a mission, said Col. Ugbo, adding, "it is
different."
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG drove the military junta out of the capital Freetown
and is mopping up the remnants of the junta forces and allied
rebels, he said, adding that some people who were talking of the
issue were something of hypocrisy.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Earmarks $100m for S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has earmarked 100
million U.S. Dollars in emergency support for Sierra Leone
following the reinstatement of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in
March, a report reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted state radio as saying that a World Bank
delegation was in Sierra Leonean capital Freetown "to assess the
security situation in the country following the suspension of the
bank's programs following the May 25 coup last year".
</P>
<P>
The military junta that seized power in May 1997 was
overthrown by the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG in
February, though fighting continues in the diamond-rich east of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the World Bank loan would be used for
"capacity building, for the creation of job opportunities and for
the improvement of the standards of the judiciary in the
country".
</P>
<P>
Senior Finance Ministry officials confirmed that a World Bank
team was in Freetown, adding that this was the first visit since
the bank closed its office in the aftermath of the coup.
</P>
<P>
The officials said delegations from the European Union and
former colonial power Britain were also in Freetown and were
considering emergency help.
</P>
<P>
Though no figures had been decided, sources at the Finance
Ministry said help from these sources "certainly will be around
the figure of the 680 million Dollars the international community
pledged Sierra Leone to rebuild the country after the signing of
the Abidjan peace accord in 1996."
</P>
<P>
The Abidjan accord ended Sierra Leone's five-year-old civil
war and paved the way for the elections that produced the Kabbah
government. But the rebels again took up arms after the May 25
coup and allied with the military junta.

<HEADLINE> S. African Union Denies Power Cut Threats to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Congress of South African
Trade Unions (COSATU) distanced itself Wednesday from a threat to
cut electricity supplies from South Africa to Swaziland to force
political change in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president of the South African trade unions coordinating
council, George Nkadimeng, reportedly said on May 1 that COSATU
would cut power supplies from South Africa's state-owned power
utility, Eskom, to Swaziland, unless the Swazi government lifts
the ban on political parties in the coming election.
</P>
<P>
Nkadimeng has reportedly threatened a month-long power cut to
disrupt Swaziland's October elections, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
COSATU public relations officer Nowetu Mpati told Swazi media
that Nkadimeng had no mandate to speak on behalf of COSATU.
</P>
<P>
She said COSATU also distanced itself from the request made by
Nkadimeng that the Swazi government stop writing letters to
President Nelson Mandela complaining about COSATU's joint goods
blockade on Swazi borders with the Swaziland Federation of Trade
Unions (SFTU).
</P>
<P>
Mpati said though COSATU supports the SFTU's boycott call,
Nkadimeng had no right or mandate to speak on COSATU's behalf.
</P>
<P>
She said COSATU had no intention of cutting power supplies to
Swaziland as this would violate a government-to-government
agreement.
</P>
<P>
COSATU would continue to support the SFTU but would do so
through peaceful means and would do nothing to undermine
Swaziland's monarchy, Mpati said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the South African government apologized to the Swazi
government for the union threats.

ANKARA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy
Spokesman Sermet Atacanli on Wednesday called on Greece to take up
the issue of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has
opened a bureau in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Atacanli said that Turkey
is concerned about the opening of the PKK office in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Turkish Foreign Ministry summoned Greek
ambassador in Ankara Dimitris Nezeretis and gave him a verbal note
in protest against Greece's support for the opening of the PKK
bureau in Athens.
</P>
<P>
The PKK officially opened the bureau in Athens last
Thursday, the first of its kind in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of sheltering and
training PKK rebels. But Greece has denied the charges, saying that
"there is not PKK bureau in Athens."
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 14-year-old separatist war
in eastern and southeastern Turkey for autonomy, which has
claimed about 35,000 lives since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Final Decision Made on Carriers Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
Wednesday that he had not made any final decision about reduction
of U.S. aircraft carriers from two to one in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"No final decision has been made on that yet," Clinton told
reporters at a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, defense officials said earlier in the day
that the aircraft carrier Independence was scheduled to leave the
Gulf region in late May and will not be replace at least
temporarily as originally planned by the Norfolk-based carrier
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
They said the Eisenhower would remain in the naval port
Norfolk, Virginia, until June 10, and the carrier John Stennis
would be in the Gulf alone for about three weeks, maintaining the
watch over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There would be a "gap, a temporary gap" in the Gulf, a military
source said. "It means there will be one carrier in the Gulf for a
short time," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton called the reports about the timetable
"speculation."
</P>
<P>
"The Eisenhower is sailing on schedule as you probably know,
and there has been some speculation about the timetable there,"
the president said. "I can tell you that (Defense) Secretary
(William) Cohen has not recommended a final decision to me on this
and I have certainly not made one."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters that the
president was considering cutting back on the dozens of warships
in the Gulf as "the conditions are somewhat less threatening than
when they were being built up."
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said the United States was still keeping "all of
our options open" with regard to tensions with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing I want to reaffirm is our determination to see
the United Nations resolutions complied with and the inspection
regime continue until it finishes its work," he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Drug
Control Program (UNDCP) has called for more assistance to Africa
in personnel training, employment diversification and judicial
reform to resolve its increasing drug trafficking problem.
</P>
<P>
Releasing its study findings to the press here on Wednesday,
the UNDCP said various African countries are being used as
springboards for international trafficking syndicates from Latin
America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
With 321,292 kilograms of cannabis seized in 1996, Africa
accounted for 12 percent of worldwide cannabis seizures, although
its seizures in cocaine and heroin were negligible, the UNDCP
said.
</P>
<P>
Citing Africa's success in fighting drug trafficking, the UNDCP
said Nigeria has taken a major crackdown with the number of
arrests tripled from 775 in 1995 to 2322 in 1997, of which 2143
were related to cannabis crimes.
</P>
<P>
UNDCP's anti-drug campaign follows the announcement of the U.N.
Special Session on Drugs to be held here on June 8-10 which will
enforce worldwide efforts against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
One of the UNDCP's objectives is to decrease world drug
consumption and supply significantly in ten years.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Wednesday
dismissed as nonsensical Israel's criticism that the United States
was trying to dictate terms for the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe Israel or any other country should accept the
dictates of the United States in a peace process," Clinton said at
a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
"We cannot and we should not attempt to impose a peace on parties,
because they have to live with the consequences."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders to
Washington next Monday for a final peace accord if Israel first
accepts U.S. proposals on 13.1 percent withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has complained to
Israel's Army Radio that he was ready to go to Washington but did
not want to be pressured into agreeing to "certain conditions that
are unacceptable to us."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it was Netanyahu's original idea to try to push
for more rapid momentum toward a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"There's no way in the world I could impose an agreement on
them or dictate... to them even if I wished to do that, which I
don't because when the agreement's over, whether it's in the
Middle East or Ireland or Bosnia or any place else, they have to
live with the consequences," he said.

<HEADLINE> German Politicians Hails Daimler-Chrysler Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- German politicians Thursday hailed the
proposed merger of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG and the U.S. carmaker
Chrysler as proof of the vigor of German industry and a chance to
create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt described the plan
announced by the two companies earlier Thursday as a "wise step"
and a "extremely important deal" through which the German
industrial giant would be able to secure its presence in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the sidelines of the German-Franco summit in
Avignon, France, Rexrodt also told the German news agency DPA that
he hoped the merger would help create new jobs in Germany.
</P>
<P>
German Transport Minister Mathias Wissmann said that he saw in
the lastest development a clear opportunity for German industry to
improve its competitive edge and to get a foothold in new markets.
</P>
<P>
Germany's main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) also
saw the marriage of the largest German industrial concern and the
third-largest U.S. carmaker as a further proof of German
industry's strength following media giant Bertelsmann's takeover
of the U.S. publisher Random House and BMW's successful bid for
the British firm Rolls-Royce just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Daimler-Chrysler merger, which is believed to be the
biggest industrial fusion of all time, would create the world
third-largest carmaker with combined worldwide sales of 130
billion dollars and a combined workforce of 421,000 employees
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Cut Oil Excise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government plans to cut
oil excise by an average 18 percent to deal with a sharp decrease
in oil and petroleum product prices on the world market, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In draft legislation published by the government Thursday, the
average rate of excise on oil, including stable gas condensate,
will be lowered from 55 rubles (nine U.S. dollars) to 45 rubles (7.5
dollars) per ton throughout 1998.
</P>
<P>
The draft will be submitted to the State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, for review.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1998, oil excises in Russia decreased
by 25 percent, while petroleum product excises fell 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federal budget lost about 5.6 billion rubles
(916 million dollars) as a result of the sluggish oil market,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Motorin said the proposed
measure will cost the budget about 2.6 billion rubles (430 million
dollars) this year, prompting a search for resources to compensate
for the loss.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said that the decision
was difficult, especially for the budget, but it was inevitable
given the crisis on the international oil market.

<HEADLINE> Russian Bank Chief Warns of Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Central Bank President Sergei
Dubinin on Thursday warned the government that it was on the edge
of a financial crisis caused by a burgeoning foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted the bank chief as saying that
the consequences of such a crisis would be comparable with the
hyperinflation in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet session devoted to the budget policy through to the
year 2001, Dubinin said in a report that the spending on servicing
of foreign debt in 2001 will exceed 12 percent of total budget
spending.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry had noted the expenditure under the
federal budget for servicing the national foreign debt had risen
from 0.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1993 to 6.85 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Dubinin said the Finance Ministry planned to draw on fewer
external sources for financing the deficit of the federal budget
and use them mostly on a medium-term basis for repaying Russia's
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Dubinin urged the cabinet to step up efforts on tax collection
and to draft budget expenditure on a basis of pessimistic
scenarios.

<HEADLINE> Daimler, Chrysler Agree on Mega-Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- In a massive shake-up of the global auto
industry, Germany's largest industrial concern Daimler-Benz AG and
Chrysler, the third-largest carmaker in the U.S., announced Thursday
that they will merge into a trans-Atlantic manufacturing giant.
</P>
<P>
The merger, believed to be the biggest industrial fusion of all
time, would create the world's third-largest vehicle firm with
combined worldwide sales of 130 billion U.S. dollars and a
workforce of 421,000.
</P>
<P>
The new company, to be launched by the end of this year under
the name DaimlerChrysler, will have two operational headquarters
in Stuttgart, Germany, and Auburn Hills, Michigan.
</P>
<P>
It will be co-headed by Daimler chief Juergen Schrempp and his
Chrysler counterpart, Robert Eaton.
</P>
<P>
The German newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung reported, however,
that the Schrempp-Eaton co-management is expected to last three
years, after which Eaton will switch to the supervisory board and
Schrempp will assume sole management.
</P>
<P>
The merger will take the form of a share swap, with Daimler
shareholders acquiring 57 percent of the new company and
Chrysler's 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
With a market capitalization of 92 billion U.S. dollars,
DaimlerChrysler would have "outstanding" prospects for growth
along with new job opportunities, the companies said, adding that
there were no plans for lay-offs or plant closures.
</P>
<P>
With the merger, which still needs to be approved by the
shareholders of both companies and anti-trust authorities, Daimler
and Chrysler said they expected to achieve savings of 1.4 billion
dollars in 1999 and a further three billion dollars annually
within three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts noted that Chrysler's alliance with
Daimler-Benz would lend it the prestige associated with the German
carmaker and help its efforts to improve car quality.
</P>
<P>
Daimler was also expected to share in the success of Chrysler's
Jeeps and its best-selling minivans, and together, the two
companies would cut costs with a joint strategy for supply and
production.
</P>
<P>
They also said that in an industry plagued by overcapacity, the
Daimler-Chrysler move was most likely to trigger off a wave of
big mergers among rivals.

<HEADLINE> Annan Arrives in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
arrived in Bujumbura, capital of Burundi Thursday afternoon to
have meetings with President Pierre Buyoya and some of the main
politial leaders of the country.
</P>
<P>
Annan's scheduled five-hour stay in Bujumbura for meetings
with army-backed President Pierre Buyoya and some of the main
political leaders, set the stage for his next visit to
neighboring Rwanda, said a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to Burundi's National Assembly, Annan, the most
important dignitary to visit Burundi since the army coup in 1996
which installed Major Buyoya, detailed the cost of the country's
protracted ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The profound crisis in Burundi for the past five years has
divided its children, dismantled its institutions, destroyed its
infrastructure, ruined its economy and, in short, put its future
in jeopardy," he said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have died due
to the fighting between the Tutsi-dominated army
and rebels of the Hutu majority.
</P>
<P>
He told the Burundians that the United Nations stands ready
to help but they have to decide themselves to build a better
future.
</P>
<P>
Annan's aides said his main goal is to promote internal
political negotiations which are still in their infancy.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's visit produced immediate fruits. An aide to
Julius Nyerere, the international mediator on Burundi, announced
on Thursday that the next round of external talks between the
warring parties will be held around June 15 in Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya has met some of the conditions set by regional states
before they will formally lift ineffectual economic sanctions
imposed after the coup.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Annan is due to meet two prominent Hutu
politicians recently released from house detention,including
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who was toppled as president in the 1996
coup.

<HEADLINE> Orchid Show Held in Honor of Patriotic Chinese General (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-seven years after bidding
farewell to his home in this capital of northeast China's Liaoning
Province, General Zhang Xueliang can only convey his nostalgia
through 13 pots of rare orchids he asked a friend to bring back
here today.
</P>
<P>
The orchids, grown by the general who now lives in Hawaii after
decades of house arrest under Taiwan's Kuomintang regime, were put
on display at his former residence to mark his 98th birthday,
which falls June 3.
</P>
<P>
Also on show are photographs of the general, and paintings and
seal cuttings by leading artists such as the late painter Guo
Xihe, which are birthday presents for Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The display has attracted orchid lovers and admirers of the
general from Beijing, Taiwan and Japan.
</P>
<P>
An almost-legendary figure in modern China, General Zhang,
along with another Kuomintang general called Yang Hucheng,
arrested Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek on December 12, 1936 in
Xi'an, northwest China, and demanded that he cease the civil war
and fight the Japanese invaders in alliance with the Communists.

<HEADLINE> Orchid Show Held in Honor of Chinese General (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Xi'an Incident, as it is recorded in history books, led to
the second period of cooperation between the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and the Kuomintang (KMT), the two rival political
factions in the country at the time, which later led to the
Chinese people's victory in the War Against Japanese Aggression
(1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
As a result of defying Generalissimo Chiang, General Zhang
Xueliang was placed under house arrest, first in
mainland China, and then on Taiwan after 1949. He only regained
his freedom in the early 1990s, and went to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
During all those years, General Zhang devoted himself to
growing orchids, said Huang Xiuqiu, the general's friend, who
brought the orchids and is head of a worldwide orchid-growers'
organization.
</P>
<P>
"Hearing that a special orchid show would be held in his
hometown to mark his birthday, the general was highly delighted
and grateful. He wishes good health and happiness to everyone,"
said Huang, who met the general in Hawaii in April.
</P>
<P>
For Liu Peizhi, a former vice-minister of agriculture, this
show is a very special occasion, as the general was his
savior. Around the time of the Xi'an Incident, Liu was sent to
Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng's troops as a representative from
the Red Army, and was nearly shot by the generals' subordinates.
</P>
<P>
"It was General Zhang who gave the order that I be freed, which
saved my life," said Liu.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Computer Industry Trade Mission Leader on HK Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- John E. McPhee, leader of a
computer industry trade mission from the United States, said here
Thursday that no one visiting Hong Kong can go away without being
impressed with the vibrant nature of the area and the people.
</P>
<P>
McPhee, acting deputy assistant secretary of Technology and
Aerospace Industries under the U.S. Department of Commerce, said
Hong Kong has an energy about it that is tempered by pragmatism
and the experience that comes from being an Asian business center.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks in an interview with Xinhua before he and
his delegation left here for Shenzhen Thursday afternoon after
attending the opening ceremony of the Computer Expo at the Hong
Kong Conventional and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
"Our trade mission has come to Hong Kong because we know that
business opportunities exist for companies with the latest
information technologies to manage change and increase
productivity," McPhee said.
</P>
<P>
"We know that Hong Kong has an entrepreneurial spirit and a large
number of small and medium sized businesses."
</P>
<P>
In the U.S. economy, he said small and medium-sized companies
have been the largest source of technical innovations, new
employment and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that Hong Kong's economy will also continue to
benefit from the contributions of its small companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-U.S. relations, McPhee said that the U.S. and Chinese
governments have a bilateral group called the Joint Commission on
Commerce and Trade (JCCT) which works cooperatively to foster
business and trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Within the JCCT co-chaired by China's minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation and the U.S. secretary of Commerce,
he said, several sub-groups exist, including one that covers the
information technology industries.
</P>
<P>
The Information Technology Sub-group has cooperated in a number
 of work plans which have included many business facilitation
activities.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said this trade mission is one of the events on the
current 1998 work plan that both governments support.
</P>
<P>
Since its formation in 1994, the sub-group has met five times
to review the progress achieved and plan future events.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite pleased with the success of the cooperative
events which the sub-group has sponsored and look forward to
continuing our joint efforts in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
McPhee has been responsible in the Department of Commerce for
analyses, trade policy development and export assistance affecting
the high technology industries for over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that only the private sector has the resources to
develop technical solutions and create the infrastructure that
will be necessary for users globally to conduct business
electronically with the same confidence they do face-to-face or
via telephone," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tremendous growth in the use of the Internet is reflected
in the statistic that usage of the Internet doubles every 100
days, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, one billion people will be using the
Internet, up from 100 million today.
</P>
<P>
"That makes for a very unpredictable, but very exciting
future," he said.

<HEADLINE> Scholar: Chinese to Win Nobel Literature Prize in 50 Years (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A famous Chinese scholar said here
today that a Chinese writer would win the country its first Nobel
literature prize in middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Ning of the Beijing Languages and Culture
University said that Chinese literature has made rapid progress in
the past two decades, and has entered a period of preparation for
wining the Nobel Prize. He predicted that if undisturbed by
reasons apart from literature, a Chinese writer would appear in
the Nobel prize-awarding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Wang was the first Ph.D in English comparative literature in
China, and is a member of the International Comparative Literature
Association.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out leading writers Mo Yan, Shi Tiesheng, Wang
Anyi, Yu Hua and Su Tong as possible Nobel winners.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the director of the Association has asked
China's literature professors and critics to recommand Chinese
candidates for the prize.

<HEADLINE> Scholar: Chinese to Win Nobel Literature Prize in 50 Years (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang said that another consideration of the Nobel Committee is
that it also cares about the arrangement of nationalities and
regions. But in its 90 years' history it has never cared much
about China, whose population accounts for one fifth of the
world's total.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the 1919 New Culture Movement, after
division and reconstruction, Chinese literature has merged into
the mainstream of the 20th century's world literature. Early in
the 1930-1940 period, the Nobel Committee noticed great
achievements in Chinese literature, and thought of Lu Xun, Wen
Yiduo and Ai Qing as prize candidates.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted, "For various reasons outside literature, Chinese
didn't realize its wish to win the Nobel Literature prize." He
believed that with economic and culture development, China has
more possibilities now to hold an equal dialogue with the
world. He hoped that foreigners would look at Chinese writers and
literary works without any bias.
</P>
<P>
Another point which should be noted was that while Chinese
literature translators took great effort to introduce foreign
literature works into China, they ignored a more important
task: introducing good Chinese works to the outside. This was an
important reason why Chinese writers were not taken seriously by
the committee.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ma Yueran, chairman of the committee, also noted
this: "Good Chinese literature works do not have fairly good
translation."
</P>
<P>
On the Chinese contemporary literature itself, Wang thought
there had some points worthy of consideration. He said that among
the current Chinese writers, there are few language masters with
profound Chinese and western culture background and aesthetic
cultivation. It will cost 50 years' time to change such situation
utterly.

<P>
Li said that he hoped that the visit by Pundari and his
entourage would play a positive role in enhancing the friendship
and cooperation between the two nations and their parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and Papua New Guinea, both in the
Asia-Pacific region, have much in common in international affairs,
despite their geographic distance from each other.
</P>
<P>
It will benefit the peace, stability and development of the two
sides as well as that of the Asia-Pacific region, to strengthen
their friendship and cooperative ties in all areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pundari said China's social and economic development has left
a very deep impression on him.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China had provided aid to Papua New Guinea. From a
long-term point of view, he noted, the bilateral cooperation will
only have vitality if the two nations use their respective
advantages to continue cooperation in new forms.
</P>
<P>
Pundari agreed with him, and said Papua New Guinea is rich in
resources, and welcomes Chinese businesses to invest there. The
two sides can cooperate in the fields of agriculture, fisheries
and mining, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Li thanked the Papua New Guinea government for adhering to
its "one China" policy on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He briefed the visitors on New China's development process
since its founding in 1949, especially the great changes that have
taken place since China initialed reform and opening-up 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
China will encounter many difficulties and problems on the road
ahead, despite the great development already achieved, he added,
but China is confident that it can handle its own matters well,
and ``we have a bright future.''
</P>
<P>
Pundari said both nations have always respected each other's
sovereignty, and Papua New Guinea will, as always, stick to its "one
China" stand.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has toured cities and the countryside in China,
and was deeply impressed by the harmonious lives Chinese people
are leading, and the various rights they enjoy, he noted, adding
that the Chinese government has made great efforts to ensure the
basic rights of its people.

<HEADLINE> Last Minute Election Registration for Cambodian Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Funcinpec, one of Cambodia's two
ruling parties, scraped in before the deadline Thursday for
registering to compete in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Parties or individuals who failed to register with the National
Election Committee (NEC) by 17:30 local time Thursday would be
barred from running in the July 26 elections, but those registered
were still subject to approval by the NEC, said NEC officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Funcinpec, led by deposed first prime minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 38 other parties including Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and Sam Rainsy
Party, an ally of Funcinpec, were registered.
</P>
<P>
The NEC registration, which began March 28, is the last of two
registrations required to compete in the elections. The first is
with the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec has nominated 122 formal parliamentary candidates
and 130 alternates to compete in 23 cities and provinces.
Prince Ranariddh will stand in the Phnom Penh election district.
</P>
<P>
The CPP, another ruling party and the biggest rival of
Funcinpec, has submitted a list of 122 formal candidates and 140
alternates. Hun Sen will contest the Kompong Cham election
district.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec narrowly won the 1993 election with 58 seats in the
120-seat parliament, but it was forced into a coalition with the
CPP, which won 51 seats, when the CPP threatened to continue the
long-running civil war.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says "Not Now" to Talks over Kurils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia has ruled out talks with Japan
on the sovereignty of the disputed South Kuril islands until it is
in a stronger position to negotiate, President Boris Yeltsin's
press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Mayak radio station, the presidential
spokesman said Russia was in a weak state and had no ability to
discuss and resolve "territorial issues".
</P>
<P>
Russia and Japan have been at odds over rival claims to four
islands seized by the Soviet Union after the Second World
War. Many discussions on the issue had been conducted in the last
few years without any substantial results in sight.
</P>
<P>
"Only a strong state can raise and resolve such matters,"
Yastrzhembsky said. "If that is not the case, it is enough to show
weakness just once and a domino effect will follow."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman emphasized a statement he made earlier during a
visit to the South Kurils, the disputed islands, that "Russia does
not have land to spare".
</P>
<P>
On a Russia-Japan treaty to formally end the war, Yastrzhembsky
said all Russian diplomats would proceed from the principle of
Russia's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
A bilateral subcommission charged with formulating a treaty
failed to achieve a breakthrough during its second meeting of
deputy foreign ministers in Moscow Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Japan has refused to sign a formal treaty with Russia until the
four islands seized by the former Soviet Union are returned.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Remove China from Watch List Under "301" Statute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao called on the U.S. government to comprehensively evaluate
China's achievements in protecting intellectual property rights
and to remove China from the watch list under the "Special 301"
statute as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark when responding to a question at today's
news conference.
</P>
<P>
The "Special 301" statute requires the U.S. trade
representatives to review annually the conditions of intellectual
property protection among the U.S. trading partners.
</P>
<P>
After expressing the regrets of the Chinese government for
being listed under the "Special 301" statute, he pointed out that
China has seriously undertaken the obligations in the
Sino-U.S.Intellectual Property Rights Agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has taken comprehensive and powerful
measures to implement the law on protection of intellectual
property rights and launched massive campaigns against piracy.
</P>
<P>
China will, as it always does, promote the protection of
intellectual property rights from legislative, judicial and
administrative aspects, he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Cities Urged to Introduce Anti-Disaster Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China should set up comprehensive
systems in its major cities to fight natural calamities and
increase urban areas' ability to prevent disasters.
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters will bring 200 billion to 250 billion yuan
(about 30 billion US dollars) annual economic losses for China in
the coming few years, according to experts attending a symposium
on reducing disasters here today.
</P>
<P>
Specialists in urban construction and disaster prevention
suggest that China should establish comprehensive urban disaster
prevention systems by means of engineering technology,
legislation, administration and education to guarantee the
sustainable development of cities.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of China's large cities and half of the
country's population are located in the country's eastern coastal
areas, which are vulnerable to floods, earthquakes, and
meteorological and marine calamities.
</P>
<P>
"A large number of cities act as the windows of China's
opening-up. Their safety is of vital importance to the nation's
economy and the people's livelihood," said Chen Weibang from the
China Urban Science Institute.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 50 percent of China's national income and
70 percent of its gross value of industrial output are produced in
the urban areas. At present, the country's urban population
accounts for about 30 percent of the total, and the ratio
will increase to 45 percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that natural disasters in cities are more complex
than in the countryside. For instance, earthquakes may cause
fires, cut off water supplies and cause outbreaks of
pestilence. "Programs to prevent earthquakes, floods and fires
should be included in the comprehensive plans for urban
development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that related departments should formulate laws and
regulations to define the responsibilities of governments and
enterprises in the work of disaster prevention and alleviation. In
addition, more input is needed in research into anti-seismic and
anti-fire technology.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Foreign Exchange Reserve Hits 35 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange reserve
reached 35.54 billion U.S. dollars by the end of April 1998, up
15.5 percent from the previous month, the central Bank of Korea
(BOK) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The mounting foreign exchange reserve, excluding South Korean
banks' foreign currency holdings at their overseas branches, hit
30 billion U.S. dollars two months earlier than the end-of-June
deadline set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Last December, South Korea signed an agreement with the IMF for
a bailout loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars tied with tough
conditions.
</P>
<P>
It was also the first time that the country surpassed the mark
in nearly two years since July 1996, when saw the reserve stood at
31.24 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bankers attributed the rising reserve to the nation's
continuing current account surplus, insurance of bonds valued at
3.29 billion U.S. dollars in the United States last month and
improvement of liquidity among domestic financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world, has
been in a financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and
bad loans of financial institutions since late 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that China is ready to make joint efforts with Kazakhstan to
develop a bilateral relationship of comprehensive cooperation
toward the next century.
</P>
<P>
During 100-minute talks with visiting Prime Minister Nurlan
Balgimbaev of Kazakhstan here this afternoon, Zhu said that the
visit would have positive impact on the growth of Sino-Kazakhstan
good-neighborly ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-Kazakhstan exchange and cooperation in
various areas have constantly expanded and made satisfying
achievements featured by increasingly stable bilateral political
relationship of mutual trust since the two countries established
diplomatic ties six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement and a series of agreements concerning
border issues and arms control signed by China and Kazakhstan have
laid a solid political and legal foundation for the development of
bilateral relations, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu emphasized that China has always placed importance to its
friendly ties with Kazakhstan and there exist no obstacles for the
two neighboring countries to foster a relationship on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Balgimbaev agreed with Zhu on his evaluation of bilateral
relations. Kazakhstan is satisfied with the smooth growth of the
two countries' ties and hopes that leaders of the two nations
would increase mutual contact and exchange visits to help
strengthen bilateral cooperative relations, he told Zhu.

</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed his thanks for Kazakhstan's stance of supporting
China on the issue of opposing national splittists.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade cooperation, Balgimbaev said
such cooperation has been effective and Kazakhstan welcomes
Chinese enterprises to invest or do business in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that trade volume between China and Kazakhstan has
registered fairly fast increase in recent years thanks to the
joint efforts of both sides. The Chinese government encourages
cooperation between enterprises of the two countries, especially
supports large firms of the two countries to conduct direct
exchange and implement the agreements which are already reached,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also exchanged views on certain
projects of economic and trade cooperation. They agreed that the
economic and trade ties between the two countries would have a
broad prospect since they enjoy geographic advantages.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, Zhu and Balgimbaev attended a signing
ceremony for five agreements, including those on China's gratis
aid to Kazakhstan and bilateral cooperation in the fields of
space, tourism, sports and culture.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Denies Plans to Recruit School Leavers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A government spokesman Thursday
denied plans to launch a new recruitment drive targeting school
leavers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, government spokesman and
Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the government has no
plans whatsoever to recruit school children to the army as
reported by the weekend Sunday Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The minister accused the newspaper of deliberately carrying the
report saying that the army was targeting school children to
coincide with a visit to the country by a senior UN official.
</P>
<P>
Special representative of the UN Secretary General Olaara
Otunna arrived in Colombo Sunday on a week-long tour to study the
impact of Sri Lanka's war on children.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times reported that the military was planning to ask
village officials to identify schools where officers could carry
out propaganda campaigns to encourage youngsters to enlist.
</P>
<P>
He said publication of such reports will benefit the rebels.
There is a doubt in the publication of such baseless reports at a
time when the UN envoy is touring Sri Lanka to inquire into
children who are involved in the war.
</P>
<P>
This would create a negative image within the international
community, said the minister.

BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Qinghong, alternative member of
the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), met today with Nonaka Hiromu, acting
secretary-general of Japanese Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
</P>
<P>
Zeng expressed his welcome to Hiromu's visit to China on the

Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Zeng went on to say that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit
to Japan this fall is of major historical significance, and that
both sides should seize the opportunity to jointly form the
framework for the long-term and stable bilateral relations of good
neighborliness oriented toward the 21st century, so that the
people of the two countries may enjoy friendship from generation
to generation.
</P>
<P>
Hiromu said that he was very glad to visit China on this
occasion and that Japan will forge friendly ties with China
on the basis of reviewing its own past.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that young Japanese statesmen should bolster their
exchanges with China to promote mutual understanding and trust, in
order to push forward Sino-Japanese friendly relations for
generations.
</P>
<P>
Zeng briefed the Japanese guests on China's domestic situation,
and both sides also exchanged views on international issues of
common concern.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Contacts Continuing Over Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Thursday that contacts are continuing over the
possible Washington talks next Monday, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who made the remarks during a meeting of the
Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, did
not elaborate what kind of contacts he was making.
</P>
<P>
But he indicated that he was in contact with related parties so
that Israel would accept the U.S. invitation to attend the White
House summit, which is due to launch the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
After her separate meetings with Israeli and Palestinian
leaders in London early this week, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright stressed that the American invitation is
conditional.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Israel must accept the U.S. peace proposal
before the summit, which calls on Israel to hand over 13.1 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians during the second
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that any redeployment of more than 9
percent would damage its national security interests. And the
right-wing parties have threatened to topple the government if
Netanyahu agrees to a 13 percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu may ask the U.S. to
delay the Washington talks for a few days to give him more
time to discuss the American plan with the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Channel Two of Israel Television
Wednesday night, Netanyahu publicly called for U.S. Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross to return to the region before Monday to modify
the American initiative.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reiterated that he would not accept any dictates
from anyone.

danger of losing the American support, terming the U.S. backing as
Israel's second most important security asset after the Israeli
Defense Forces.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Invites Bids for Sewage Treatment Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- This east China metropolis today
invited bids for designs for a new sewage treatment project to
be constructed in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
When the new sewage treatment project is completed, all of
Shanghai's waste water will be properly treated by sewage
treatment facilities instead of being directly discharged into
local rivers, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now produces about five million cu m of liquid sewage
daily, most of which used to be discharged into the Suzhou and
Huangpu rivers or their tributaries without any proper treatment
due to a lack of necessary treatment facilities, severely
polluting these rivers.
</P>
<P>
The city spent 2.5 billion yuan building a pipeline facility on
the northern bank of the Suzhou River in the early 1990s. The project,
with a designed capacity of treating 1.7 million tons of sewage
daily, now treats 1.4 million tons of liquid sewage collected
from nearby urban districts and discharges the treated water into
the Yangtze River estuary.
</P>
<P>
Construction started on another pipeline facility last year on
the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, a major source of urban
water supplies. The project, which will cost 4.8 billion yuan,
will have a designed daily treatment capacity of 1.7 million cu
m of sewage.

<HEADLINE> ``Natural Disasters Pose Threats to China's Economy'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expert predicted today
that natural disasters will cause increasingly bigger losses to
China's economy at the turn of the century, costing a total of 200
billion to 250 billion yuan (about 30 billion US dollars) each
year.
</P>
<P>
The direct economic losses, quadruple the figure for the early
1980s, will be caused mainly by droughts, floods, typhoons and
frost, Prof. Ma Zongjin, an academician with the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, told a national symposium on reducing natural
disasters in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said natural disasters caused an average of 36.2
billion yuan (about 4.3 billion US dollars) in direct economic
losses a year during 1950s, and the figure rose dramatically to
102.1 billion yuan (about 12.3 billion US dollars) by the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949 more than 500,000 people have died in natural
disasters in China, which cost a total of 2.5 trillion yuan (about
300 billion US dollars) in economic losses, statistics showed, and
the average economic losses amounted to three to six percent of
the country's GDP a year, much higher than in the developed
countries, such as the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Natural disasters have already became a major factor that
hinders economic growth in China," said Zhou Guangzhao,
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress and chairman of the Chinese Association for Science and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries which suffers the most seriously
from natural disasters, due to its large population, complicated
climate, geographic conditions and vulnerable ecological
environment, Zhou explained.
</P>
<P>
The key to reducing losses from natural disasters lies in the
prediction and assessment of major disasters, Prof. Ma noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on experts in the social sciences to make joint
efforts together with experts in the natural sciences to reduce
losses from natural disasters, which also affect many other
aspects of society in addition to the economy.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium, the third of its kind to be held in
China, is organized by the Chinese Association for Science and
Technology as one of the activities to mark the "International
Decade for Reducing Natural Disasters". It has attracted more than
500 scientists from all over the country.

<HEADLINE> China Works with UNESCO, Japan to Rebuild Imperial Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China is working with the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
and Japan to rebuild part of an imperial palace situated near
Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Following more than three years of concerted preparations
between the three parties, rebuilding work on the basis of the
site of the imperial palace started here today.
</P>
<P>
Present at the ceremony to mark the beginning of the project
were Zhang Pai, deputy director of China's State Cultural Relics
Bureau, Nobaru Noguchi, UNESCO representative in Beijing, and
Yutaka Yoshizawa, a Japanese diplomat stationed in China.
</P>
<P>
The Hanyuan Hall of the imperial palace of the Tang Dynasty
(618-907) was completed in the year 663. The huge
complex was destroyed in a war at the end of the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 UNESCO decided to rebuild the Hanyuan Hall, with Japan
offering one million US dollars to fund the project.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Bank Raises Certificate Rates Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia (BI), the central
bank, announced here Thursday to raise BI certificate (SBI)
interest rates by between 4 percent and 12 percent in a bid to
stabilize the rupiah currency against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, BI Governor Syahril Sabirin said the
central bank was forced to make the choice of raising the SBI
rates following recent developments which have disturbed the
government's efforts to stabilize the rupiah, especially the
non-technical factors.
</P>
<P>
The governor, however, did not give details about the
non-technical factors.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, overnight SBI interest rate will
be raised from 44 percent to 48 percent, two-day SBI rate will be
raised from 45 percent to 49 percent and three to six days SBI
rate will be raised to 50 percent from 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate for one-week SBI will be raised from 48
percent to 54 percent while two weeks SBI rate will be raised from
49 percent to 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
The one month SBI rate will be increased to 58 percent from 50
percent, the two months rate will be increased to 48 percent from
44 percent and the three months rate will be raised to 44 percent
from 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
For six months and one year SBI, the rates will be raised
respectively from 23 percent to 34 percent and from 21 percent to
33 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SBI is short-term rupiah-denominated obligations issued by
the central bank to drain excess liquidity from the market.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time since March 23 this year for Bank
Indonesia to raise SBI rates following the fluctuation of the
rupiah and the sharp increase of the prices of basic commodities
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the rupiah, which has lost more than 70
percent of its value against the U.S. dollar in the past ten
months, picked up to 7,000/8,000 per dollar from 9,000/10,000 per
dollar in the last few weeks following the signing of economic
reform program between Indonesia and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
However, it dropped to 9,400/10,000 per dollar Thursday.
Analysts said the heated political situation undermined the
positive signal from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations staged by students in the country in the last
two months have spread in recent days and some riots have taken
place in several cities, military authorities said.

<HEADLINE> ``China's Shipping Sector Contributes to Economic Growth'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official today said
that China's shipping sector has contributed greatly to the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Hong Shanxiang, vice minister of Communications, made the
remark at a six-day seminar which opened today in this east China
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1997 the country had more
than 2,000 berths for ships of 10,000 dwt, which handled 36,000
ships from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inland river shipping mileage reached 110,000
km, including a 5,800-km route which can handle 1,000-dwt vessels.
</P>
<P>
China's container shipping has maintained a rapid growth rate
of 25 percent in the past decade. The business volume reached ten
million TEUs (20-Foot Equivalent Units) in 1997, up 31 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
China has drawn up an overall plan to promote the development
of the sector in the next few years. By the year 2000 the country
will have built 100 new berths and to have increased its handling
capacity by 200 million tons a year. Conditions on 2,400 km of
inland water routes will also have been improved.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 experts and officials from overseas and China
attended the seminar, named the "International Workshop on
Shipping Policies and Development"
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by China's Ministry of Communications, the seminar is
expected to promote the healthy development of the sector and
improve Sino-overseas cooperation in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The specialists attending will discuss the future of the
shipping industry, China's shipping policy, international
shipping competition and other related topics.
</P>
<P>
A research tour will be held during the seminar.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong residents have responded
enthusiastically to the five-day opening of the Chek Lap Kok new
airport with all tickets sold out within two days.
</P>
<P>
"The New Airport Experience" program is being sponsored by the
Hong Kong Airport Authority.
</P>
<P>
Clinton Leeks, director of the Corporate Development, said that
62,500 tickets had been available, with 53,000 sold through
branches of the Standard Chartered Bank and the rest snapped up
through group bookings which were made direct by telephone to an
authority hotline.
</P>
<P>
Group bookings were eight times oversubscribed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will be able to handle up to 35 million
passengers and 3 million tons of cargo a year during its initial
operation. Upon full development in the longer term, the airport
will have an annual throughput capacity of 87 million passengers
and 9 million tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>
Leeks said that he was delighted with this warm response to the
program.
</P>
<P>
"This shows the tremendous level of interest Hong Kong people
have in their new airport. It is very satisfying that after so
many years of hard work by so many we can now show the public just
what has been achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Leeks said: "our prime task now is to have the airport
ready to begin operations on July 6."
</P>
<P>
Another opportunity for the public to visit the airport will
come on June 21 when the Mass Transit Railway Corporation will
hold its charity ride to mark the opening of its Airport Express,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Plunges Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah on Thursday
closed at 8,400/9,400 against the U.S. dollar in the Jakarta money
exchange market, a sharp decrease compared to Wednesday's close of
7,900/8,400 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah broke through the level of 10,000 per dollar in the
morning trading, and gradually recovered at noon, currency dealers
said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the heated political situation triggered by
students demonstrations in the country's big cities was the main
cause of the weakness of the local currency.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the approval for the release of the IMF
(International Monetary Fund) bailout fund on May 4 was
overshadowed by students protests, urging the government to cut
skyrocketing prices and introduce major economic and political
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 70 percent of its value against
the U.S. dollar since July last year when the monetary crisis hit
the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, central bank director Miranda S. Goeltom said the
government will not interfere in the market to stabilize the
rupiah. "We can carry out a consistent policy to strengthen the
value of rupiah," the director noted.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Head of State Orders Release of 142 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State, General Sani
Abacha has ordered the release of 142 detainees with immediate
effect, said Minister of Internal Affairs Bashir Dalhatu.
</P>
<P>
The move is a fulfilment of Abacha's promise last November,
when he pledged to grant freedom to those whose release will no
longer pose a threat to the peace and security of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian media, however, Thursday expressed disappointment
over the list of the released, which includes none of the
prominent detainees whose release has been much called for, such
as M.K.O. Abiola, the acclaimed winner of the annulled June 12,
1993 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Media reports noted that of the 60 persons Pope John II had
asked Abacha to release on his March visit to Nigeria, three are
on the list of the release.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement of Dalhatu distributed at a press
conference in Abuja on Wednesday, the released persons are
convicted prisoners of 60 years old and above, prisoners serving
life sentences, detainees who have been in custody for more than
10 years and those awaiting trial for minor offenses.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the government is determined to
continuously appraise the circumstances of all incarcerated
people with a view to integrating them into the society as
reformed citizens.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Chinese
government, led by Health Minister Zhang Wenkang, left here today
for Geneva to attend the 51st World Health Assembly May 11-16.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Zhang will address the assembly, commenting on the
achievements of the World Health Organization (WHO) over the past
half century, looking forward to health developments in the next
century, and briefing participants on the principles and policies
of China's health services as well as reform and development in
this area.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Switzerland, Zhang will meet senior
officials from the WHO Secretariat and former Norwegian Prime
Minister G.H. Brundtland, secretary general-elect, and discuss how
to expand cooperation between China and the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also will sign a memorandum of cooperation with
Britain. Zhang also expects to exchange extensive views with
health ministers of other countries on bilateral cooperation and
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 30 topics on the agenda of the coming
assembly, including deliberating the 1998 World Health Report,
activities marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of
the WHO, formulating the Health for All Strategy in the 21st
Century and delivering the World Health Declaration, passing the
nomination for the secretary general, and reviewing the WHO
Constitution and regional arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Recovery Not Far, Reforms Needed: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) predicted
Thursday that the recovery of the Asian economy from the financial
crisis will take place in a couple of years though a specific
timetable is not available now.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he called for reforms of economic and
financial systems in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The prediction and call came from the second session of the
on-going Ninth Annual Corporate Conference of the Asia Society,
which was held Thursday at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
Responding to inquiries from the audience after delivering a
keynote address at the session, HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa said: "If it is a normal situation, I would think it will take
Asia a couple of years to bottom out and then recovery will
start."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that it is really very difficult to tell the
timetable because market forces are at play, events which are very
often beyond the control of any single government at play, and
these are all forces that will affect the speed of recovery.
</P>
<P>
As for the cause of the crisis in Asia, Tung pointed out in his
address that the recent Asian financial crisis is a new phenomenon
brought about by an increasingly open global financial market
system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the existing international and multinational
structure for international trade and finance was designed 50
years ago and that needs to be upgraded to suit the new
environments for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, Hong Kong fully supports calls for global
efforts to design a new international financial architecture,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung's idea was shared by Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Pham
Gia Khiem, who also delivered a keynote address at the session.
</P>
<P>
Pham said that with the support of the world community,
countries and regions in Asia will be able to get their economies
recovered soon in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on Asian countries and regions to abandon
the easy-going way of growth and continue economic reforms and
integration.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the present conditions of the economic crisis
require the governments and people of these countries ... on one
hand fully develop all economic potentials and comparative
advantages in human resources and on the other hand completely
abandon the easy-going way of growth, persistently continue
economic reforms and integration, combine domestic strength with
external assistance," Pham said.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, he added, "we shall be able to gradually get the
situation right and build up an Asia of more dynamic and
sustainable development based on a new foundation more adaptive to
changes as mankind enters the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
President Mitsuo Sato of the Asian Development Bank also
delivered a keynote speech at the session, calling for reforms of
financial institutions on a broad basis.

<HEADLINE> HK to Conduct Telephone Poll for Public Opinions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Home Affairs Bureau of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government will
conduct a five-day survey over residential telephones to gauge
the public's perception of problems in the SAR, it was announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The May 11-15 survey will be the 76th in the series to monitor
public opinion trends over perceived problems in Hong Kong,
government's overall performance and expectations about the local
situation.
</P>
<P>
A resident from each household aged between 15 and 64 will be
contacted in the evening by using a random sample of residential
telephone numbers contained in the latest local telephone
directory.
</P>
<P>
A Home Affairs Bureau spokesman assured that all information
provided by the respondents would be treated with the strictest
confidence and it would not be used for any purpose other than the
survey.
</P>
<P>
"The respondents may wish to know that their assistance will
contribute to a better mutual understanding between the public and
the government. The few minutes it takes for them to respond to
the survey questionnaires would surely serve the greater good of
the community," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar dived half a
U.S. cent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 63.58 U.S. cents, from 64.10 late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It had begun the day at 63.73 U.S. cents, following a fall in
the price of gold and a weaker Japanese yen against the United
States dollar.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it was "comfortable for the present with
maintaining the current structure of short-term interest rates."
</P>
<P>
However, it said the stance of policy will be continually
reviewed as new information comes to hand about the likely course
of inflation and activity, including the impact of the Asian
crisis on growth and the strength of domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar received a brief reprieve through the
release of better-than-expected employment figures, but renewed
its downward journey as interest rate speculation overshadowed the
data.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said the number of employed
people in Australia rose 58,200 to 8,572,100 in April, following a
15,500 fall in March.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate was a seasonally adjusted 7.9 percent in
April, from 8.2 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 84.72 from 84.85 against
Japanese yen, and at 1.1235 from 1.1359 against Deutsche marks.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Down Marginally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket Thursday
closed down marginally, as the National Australia Bank's (NAB's)
first half profit result met expectations and it raised its
dividend.
</P>
<P>
Funds manager AUSBIL Partners equities director Paul Xiradis
said that the banking sector made modest gains and the NAB's
interim performance after abnormals had been at the upper end of
market expectations.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed down 7.2 points, or 0.26
percent, at 2780.8, trading between a high of 2788.0 and a low of
2761.0.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index dropped 12.5 points, or 1.05 percent,
to 1179.2, with resources giant BHP continuing to lose ground,
falling 29.2 cents, or 2.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
Both speculation that BHP could appoint an internal replacement
for former chief executive John Prescott and concern that
commodity sales to Japan could be hit by the weak Japanese economy
were weighing on the stock, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index closed down 2.5 points at 4784.7,
with Westpac Banking Corp, ANZ Banking Group, Lend Lease Corp,
Woolworths, Coles Myer and Rio Tinto halting further declines.
</P>
<P>
Topping turnover was Telstra Corp with 12.71 million shares
traded, valued at 46.72 million Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was a thin 262.61 million shares valued at
819.33 million Australian dollars (524.37 million U.S. dollars).
Falls outnumbered rises 658 to 388, with 429 stocks steady.
</P>
<P>
The gold index closed down 22.5 points, or 1.68 percent, at
1316.1 after gold bullion fell 2.85 to 300.70 U.S. dollars in
Sydney trading.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Stresses Strength of Ties With Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian presidential advisor Osama
al-Baz has said on Thursday that Egypt and Qatar share strong
relations based on sisterly Arab ties, Arab solidarity and unity
of destiny.
</P>
<P>
In an interview over the telephone with the Voice of Arabs
Radio from Doha, al-Baz said his on-going visit to Qatar comes
within the context of bilateral consulations over pressing issues
in the region and the current developments of the peace process in
addition to means of confronting challenges facing the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
He said he conveyed a message to Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben
Khalifa Al Thani from President Hosni Mubarak on the Mideast peace
process developments, bilateral ties and issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
He said that he discussed with Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh
Hamad Ben Jassem Ben Jabr Al Thani on the forthcoming meeting of
foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration group, to be held in
the Qatari capital by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, originally set for early this year, was postponed
due to a growing row between the two countries after Cairo
boycotted the Middle East and North Africa economic conference
hosted by Doha last November. Egypt recalled its ambassador, but
sent him back later.
</P>
<P>
Al-Baz on Tuesday started a three-day visit to Doha, nearly two
months after the Qatari emir held talks with Mubarak in Cairo in
what was viewed as a fence-mending effort to end disputes between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The relations of the two Arab countries soured in 1996 when
Qatar accused Egypt of involvement in a failed coup in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
A summit meeting mediated by Saudi King Fahd between the Qatari
emir and Mubarak at the end of last year failed to bridge the gaps
between the two sides. Qatar later expelled Egyptian laborers.
</P>
<P>
But there seemed to be a thaw in their relations after the two
countries signed an agreement earlier in March to allow Egyptian
workers back to finish their contract terms in Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Digital Boosts Exposure in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Digital Corp. of the United States
today delivered the first batch of personal computers (PC) to a
local buyer that were produced in its China-based factory.
</P>
<P>
Digital has followed IBM and Hewlett Packard to locate a
production base in China.
</P>
<P>
Franklin Sze, Digital's manager in charge of PC products in the
Asia-Pacific region, said that the establishment of factories in
China will help the company cut costs and provide supply and
service to Chinese users in the quickest way.
</P>
<P>
Digital's branch in China, known as Digital Equipment China
Inc. (DEC), set up a joint venture factory with Start, the largest
producer of computer peripherals in China. The factory is in
Fuzhou, a city in south China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The 30-million-U.S.-dollar joint venture produces Digital
desktop PCs and servers based on PT II and MMX.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Digital said that the Fuzhou factory has a
capacity of producing 300 PCs every day.
</P>
<P>
Chinese manufacturers now have more than 60 percent of China's
PC market.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months international computer manufacturers
have stepped up efforts to localized their business in
China. Intel opened a large computer chip plant in Shanghai today.
</P>
<P>
Intel is a major supplier for China's PC manufacturers,
including the Legend Group which turned out its one millionth PC
on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Persuade Buyoya to Accept Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary General of the
United Nations Kofi Annan said here Thursday that he will
encourage Burundi President Pierre Buyoya to accept the mediation
over the Burundi crisis for a national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a press conference before leaving for the Burundian
capital of Bujumbura in the morning, Annan reaffirmed the UN
support for the efforts by the leaders in the Great Lakes region
to find a way out for the Burundi crisis.
</P>
<P>
"My message to President Buyoya would be to encourage him to
press ahead with the reconciliation and reach out with other
parties and work with (former) President Nyerere and regional
leaders to solve the conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary General noted that some progress has been made
for Burundi to meet certain conditions set by Nyerere and other
regional leaders for lifting the economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace talks were stalled last year after the
military authority led by President Pierre Buyoya said it had no
faith in Nyerere, the international mediator in the Burundi
political conflicts, who advocates imposing economic sanctions on
the central African nation.
</P>
<P>
East and central African nations, backed by the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), have imposed sanctions on Burundi since
August of 1996, two months after Major Buyoya toppled a civilian
government led by President Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the refugees situation in western Tanzania,
Annan said that the UN will do what it can do to help them. He
also appreciated the Tanzanian government's hospitality to the
refugees especially the new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the numbers (of refugees fleeing into Tanzania)
will not grow", he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan also said that the UN will continue to investigate the
human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but
its relationship with Congo is much wider than the human rights.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that on May 17, the head of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) will attend a conference in Congo to
explore the types of assistance the UNDP can provide.
</P>
<P>
"There has been quite a lot of negligence of that country," he
said. "They need assistance in infrastructure repairs,
institution building, the social and economic development for the
establishment of a good governance."
</P>
<P>
Questioned about what UN can help Tanzania, one of the poorest
countries in the world, Annan said he has recommended to the UN
to give consideration to relieve heavy debt burden of African
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the peace progress in the Middle East, the UN chief said
that the UN has played a very constructive role and will work
with all the parties concerned to really work together and make
the kind of compromise necessary to realize a real and lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
"What I hope and plead for is that we make progress on the
Palestinian front and eventually on the Lebanese and Syrian as
well," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here Wednesday afternoon from a visit in
the northern region of Arusha, had meetings with Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa and foreign minister Jakaya Kikwete
about the regional issues, Tanzania's role of peace keeping and
the UN-Tanzanian relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner after the talks at the State House
Wednesday night, President Mkapa expressed appreciation for
Annan's recent report to the UN Security Council which calls for
more attention to and investment in the poorest continent of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is on his first official visit to Tanzania since he
came to office as the UN Secretary General, spoke highly of
Tanzania's role in the liberation of the Southern Africa and in
the world affairs especially in its support to the U.N. affairs
like hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Great
Lakes region countries.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief also said that Africa now is at a turning point
for development as the whole continent witnessed less conflicts
and has made economic progress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Arusha Tuesday, Annan was encouraged by
the progress made by the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda (ICTR), saying that the Tribunal has effected major
improvements in its operations and is moving ahead to fulfil its
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Annan's remarks were apparently to clear the air over mounting
criticism on the inefficiency of the ICTR in executing cases.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal opened its first trial only in January last year,
more than two years after its establishment in November, 1994
under a UN Security Council resolution. But only two cases are
approaching its final leg till now.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived from Nairobi, Kenya, toured the ICTR
premises and attended a court session before departing for
sightseeing in the well-known Ngorongoro Crater National Park
with his wife Nane Annan.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Govt Calls for Truce Following Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Khartoum negotiators voiced a
strong call for ceasefire Thursday, one day after the end of
their peace talks at which the southern rebels claimed new
advance on the battle fields.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) said Wednesday
that they seized Wadega garrison in Southern Blue Nile State
while the three-day talks went under way.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Sudan is ready to accept an immediate
cease-fire and cession of hostilities if the other party
reciprocates," said Riek Machar, the Assistant of the President
of Sudan at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The ceasefire... has been called by Khartoum since January...
The IGAD summit also called for ceasefire, the European Union,
less than a week ago, called for ceasefire, and yesterday the
U.N. Security Council also called for ceasefire,"
</P>
<P>
"We wished the SPLA can be responding" to these calls aimed at
ensuring free and safe humanitarian access to the southern Sudan
where famine is biting, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that the Islamic law should remain as the
main source of the country's constitution on which Khartoum is to
hold a national referendum this month. The separation of state
and religion is one of the key goals for which the SPLA has
fought since 1983.
</P>
<P>
However, Machar said there was a certain progress achieved by
the negotiations this time.
</P>
<P>
"We're happy with the results of this second round of peace
talks. For reasons: the agreement on humanitarian access to the
needed population in southern Sudan" and on an internationally
supervised vote on self-determination for the south, he said.
</P>
<P>
Series of peace talks between the Sudanese warring sides
restarted at the end of October last year after a three-year
deadlock due to the brokering of the regional Inter-Government
Authority of Development group.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the just-ended talks, the Sudanese government agreed
to allow U.N. aid agencies to fly five C0130 aircraft and other
modes of transport to deliver food and other humanitarian items
to famine-affected areas in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The war broke out in 1983 between the Moslem-ruled Khartoum
government in the north and the SPLA demanding more autonomy and
religion freedom in the animist and Christian-dominated south.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 1.3 million Sudaneses have been killed by the
war and war-related famines. Another 365,000 now live on alien
lands as refugees.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Should Set Up Special Tribunals for Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin
Ahmed has suggested that special tribunals be set up for quick
disposal of serious default bank loan cases in the country, media
reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president made this suggestion while inaugurating a lecture
on banking ethics in Dhaka Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Till today, the amount of money due from the defaulters is
about 140 billion taka (about 3.04 billion U.S. dollars), and its
non-payment had been disrupting the banking system," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recently publication of a list of 2,117 loan
defaulters having loans of over 10 million taka (about 2.2 million
dollars), he said "it is undisputed that the big borrowers are the
worst defaulters, and it is they who pose threat to the national
economy."
</P>
<P>
For this, he pointed out, the genuine businessmen and
industrialists were being deprived of bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector "will be strangled unless the government
enables the bank authorities to take action against the
influential and manipulative loan defaulters and their
collaborators," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Diet Blamed for Increase in Cardiovascular Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Dietary changes have raised the
incidence of cardiovascular diseases fivefold in Shijiazhuang
City, capital of north China's Hebei Province, in the past 20
years.
</P>
<P>
A 20-year follow-up investigation by the Hebei Academy of
Medical Science shows that the death toll from cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular disease has accounted for at least 30 percent of
the disease death toll in Hebei Province in the past dozen years.
</P>
<P>
The investigation focused on the nutrition elements in urban
and rural residents' diets found that with an improved living
standard the amount of grain in people's calorie intake dropped
from 65 percent to 17 percent while their daily intake of
cholesterol reached 691 milligrams, double the level recommended
by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the investigation indicated that Hebei
residents' daily diet contains too much fat, protein and edible
oil which contribute to the development of cardiovascular
diseases.

that China will actively participate in international cooperation
in cracking down on drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Luo's remark came during a meeting with a delegation from the
United Nations Drug Control Program (DCP) led by its executive
director, Pino Arlacchi, who is also deputy secretary-general of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
China is among the countries which have suffered the most
historically from drugs, and the Chinese people have exerted great
efforts for 100 years in seeking total elimination of drugs, Luo
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese government's achievements in
both the domestic and the international drug control fields have
not only safeguarded the interest of the Chinese people but also
contributed a lot to the world's overall fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
China, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has
always supported the DCP's guiding role in the international drug
control sector, Luo sai, and appreciates the DCP's assistance. The
DCP will continue to receive China's full support in its drug
control strategy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi expressed satisfaction with China's cooperation in
recent years. He said China has set a good example for the rest of
the world to follow in fighting drugs, and is able to avoid the
harm of illegal drugs while advancing its social and economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accuses West of Funding Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Senior Nigerian officials have
accused Western nations of funding the May Day riot in the
southwestern city of Ibadan, which had led to at least seven
deaths.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon attended by diplomats in Abuja
Wednesday, Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said the Nigerian
government had found out that the Ibadan protests were funded by
some foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed known that those who perpetrated the act in
Ibadan were funded and financed by some Western countries which
have made it their own commitment that except one or two of their
friends take power in Nigeria, they will not have the legitimate
choice of Nigerians," said Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
The minister said further that there were some Western
European countries "that have made it a point to ensure that they
support crisis, terrorism and destruction in Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "it will be better to let Nigeria resolve her
own problems internally" and that destabilizing Nigeria will not
be in the interest of Western nations.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking Wednesday on the Hausa Service of the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Alhaji Wada Nas, the special
adviser to Nigerian leader General Sani Abacha, blamed the
anti-Abacha demonstration in Ibadan on hostility of the U.S. and
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The hostility against Nigeria, he said, is not because of lack
of democracy or human rights, but because the Americans have a
hidden agenda, which would one day come to light.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos has
ordered agencies concerned to study granting a loan restructuring
or debt moratorium for farmers affected by the El Nino phenomenon,
a presidential press release said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ramos issued the order to the Department of Agriculture, the
Land Bank of the Philippines and other agencies after receiving
reports of severe decline in farm production in some areas,
especially those hit by the prolonged dry spell.
</P>
<P>
To combat the effects of the El Nino, Ramos also approved the
revision of the crop insurance scheme and the premium rates for
rice and corn of the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Ramos as saying that the new rates are expected to
"further improve the farmers' access to crop insurance and thereby
promote high agricultural production."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president was told that the Social Security
Systems and the Government Service Insurance System, the two major
players in the insurance industry, have been urged to increase
fund releases for the distressed areas.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino has brought about famine and outbreaks of diseases
in the southern Philippines. About 3.4 million people have been
affected and at least 80 of them killed.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- South African ambassador to
the United States has written to all 100 U.S. senators to correct
the widespread impression that Pretoria is hostile to the African
Growth and Opportunity Bill.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa supports passage (of the bill)," ambassador
Franklin Sonn wrote, adding that "for the first time there has
been a real attempt by the U.S. congress to bring legislative
focus onto Africa and to recognize Africa as an important part of
the global economy", Business Day reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bill has been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives
but it is still under the scrutiny of the senate.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference with visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton in March, South African President Nelson Mandela called
the legislation "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki also said Africa does not welcome
the bill, which replaces aid with trade.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the bill, including labor unions and the U.S.
textile industry, have been exploiting these remarks as part of
their campaign to derail the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Sonn said South Africa was "particularly" in favor of
provisions extending duty free treatment to African textiles and
clothing and expanding the range of other African goods granted
preferential access to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also "appreciates" the bill's support for African
debt relief and for using U.S, government debt guarantees to help
launch private investment funds for African projects.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had only criticized the bill's "conditionalities", and
had emphasized that they remained "a subject for ongoing
discussion", Sonn said.

<HEADLINE> Consulate-General's Discussions with LegCo Candidates "Inappropriate": Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Commissioner's
Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said here
Thursday that it is inappropriate for foreign consular offices and
their personnel to get involved in matters concerning the
elections for the first Legislative Council (LegCo) of the Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the statement when commenting on British
consulate-general inviting candidates of the LegCo for discussion.
</P>
<P>
"The election for the first LegCo is entirely an internal
matter within the high degree of autonomy enjoyed by the HKSAR,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The election methods formulated by the HKSAR Government on its
own for the first LegCo are consistent with the relevant
provisions of the Basic Law and the actual conditions in Hong
Kong. These methods have reflected the principle of developing
democracy progressively in Hong Kong, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that preparations for the coming elections
are being carried out "in an orderly manner," and "we are
confident that the HKSAR is capable of making the elections for
its first LegCo a success, and that the elections will be held in
a democratic, fair and open manner."
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to China, the spokesman added, the
question of Hong Kong is entirely an internal matter of China. In
accordance with Article 55 of Vienna Convention on Consular
Relations and Article 24 of Regulations of the People's Republic
of China on Consular Privileges and Immunities, foreign consular
offices and their personnel shall not interfere in the internal
affairs of the state to which they are accredited.
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, it is inappropriate for foreign consular offices
and their personnel in Hong Kong to get involved, in whatever way,
in matters concerning the elections for the first Legislative
Council of the HKSAR," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Talks Between Government, Striking Nurses Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Talks between the government and
striking nurses in New Delhi did not yield any result and the
strike would continue in the city, a Delhi Nurses Union (DNU)
spokesperson said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nurses gathered in front of the Health Ministry headquarters in
large numbers and raised anti-government slogans following the
failure of talks, which were held here Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The nurses would not relent unless the government agreed to a
hike in their pay scales, which the spokesperson claimed were the
lowest in the country vis-a-vis their qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Medical services in the capital remained paralyzed for the
third day Thursday. City Health Minister Harsh Vardhan warned
Wednesday against harsh measures if the nurses remained
indifferent to the woes of the patients.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which started here Tuesday, has been called by DNU
to protest against the backtracking by the government on the
agreement signed with it in last September on pay scales and other
demands. The government has said that it was open for talks with
agitating nurses over their demands, but ruled out any pay hike.

BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao here today urged the British government to
"immediately stop the interference in the election of the
Legislative Council (Legco) of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR)."
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark in response to a question on the British HK
Consulate General's meeting with certain candidates of Hong Kong's
first Legco. The election will be held in late May.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, it is widely reported that the British HKSAR
Consulate General recently invited several Legco candidates to
discuss the future election. "It is the direct interference in the
affairs of HKSAR," he said, adding that the move "violates the
Joint Declaration signed by the two governments and arouses
adverse affections from the Hong Kong people and press."
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the British government to stop such action and
strictly observe the Joint Declaration for the sound development
of Sino-British ties.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko said Thursday that the formation of the Russian
government will be finalized on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the first meeting of the recognized cabinet, Kiriyenko
said that President Boris Yeltsin and he will wrap up Friday their
discussion on the structure and the appointments of new ministers.
</P>
<P>
So far, three deputy prime ministers and 17 ministers have been
appointed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kiriyenko said that throughout the process to select
ministers, both he and Yeltsin maintained active contacts with
members of parliament and tried to take into consideration their
proposals on forming the government.
</P>
<P>
The process was based "not on a political but on a professional
approach in selecting personnel," said Kiriyenko, who was
confirmed as the prime minister on April 24 by the State Duma, or
lower house of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Victor Chernomyerdin and his cabinet were
dismissed by Yeltsin on March 23, which led to a month-long
government crisis in the country.

<HEADLINE> Face-to-Face Talk With Ranariddh No Obstacle:Hun Sen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said Thursday that face-to-face meeting between
him and former Cambodian first prime minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh is just a question of time.
</P>
<P>
"There is no obstacle for that (the meeting)," Hun Sen said at
a press conference held in Bangkok Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said that it is not hard for him and Ranariddh to work
with each other since they have had relations before.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian prime minister said that they need to cooperate
not only for the upcoming election but also for the future of
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he "would not close all the door" in the political
field, but will "only close the door to the khmere rouge
hard-liners."
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether Ranariddh had to abandon his title of
first prime minister before their meeting, Hun Sen said during
their talks through telephone, Ranariddh never requested to meet
him as the first prime minister, but as the one who used to work
with him.
</P>
<P>
"I would not agree with a meeting with the prime minister,
which in this way will create two governments in Cambodia," Hun
Sen said.
</P>
<P>
"But i can accept the meeting (with Ranariddh) as the person I
used to work together, or in the individual capacity, or of one
party to another, or as one party leader with the prime minister,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
For the upcoming election scheduled on July 26, Hun Sen
stressed that the election must be held as planned.
</P>
<P>
"There would not be any delay to the election, and if there is
any delay, it would be next five years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also proposed three options to use state-owned and
private-owned radio stations so that all political parties in
Cambodia can be given equal access to the electronic media.
</P>
<P>
He also warned all foreign media broadcasting in Cambodian
language to remain neutral during the election.
</P>
<P>
Concerning refugees in Thailand, Hun Sen said it is the target
of his government to let them return to place they would like to
return, especially before the election.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen refused to forecast the result of the election, saying
the result will be known after counting all the votes.
</P>
<P>
However, he said if his Cambodian People's Party (CPP) wins, he
will organize a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
And if the CPP loses, he would also be pleased to transfer
power peacefully and join the coalition government if invited, or
stay opposition if not.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, who came here Wednesday for a two-day visit, will meet
Thai New Aspiration Party leader, former prime minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh later Thursday.

BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said here Thursday that the trial of Khmer Rouge
leaders would be an "unchangeable target" of his government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Hun Sen said the trial of Khmer
Rouge leaders is but a question of time.
</P>
<P>
He said that people are currently concentrating on the upcoming

</P>
<P>
Talking about whom would be tried, the second prime minister
said it is not for the politicians to say, but for the prosecutors
to make discussions after investigation.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia would also ask cooperation from Thailand to arrest
Khmer Rouge leaders and send them back if they flee into the
country, said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
But Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said that there is no
Khmer Rouge leader in his country.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Urged to Observe Peace Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The international community has
urged the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) to cooperate with the government in the peace process in
the country, a senior U.S. official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Donald Steinberg, the U.S. Ambassador and one of the
representatives of the international observer nations to the
Angolan peace progress, said here that the international
community are "deeply concerned" over UNITA's refusal to observe
the Lusaka peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting between the international observers
and the Government representatives, Steinberg said that UNITA,
whose uncooperative attitudes have made it impossible to
accomplish the new timetable for implementing the peace process
by the end of March as scheduled, is still occupying some
"sensitive areas" like central Angola's Bailundo and Andulo.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international community is losing its
patience about these.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Faustino Muteka, head of the government mission to
the joint peace process committee, said on the same day that the
re-establishement of government institutions in the UNITA
controlled areas should be given top priority.
</P>
<P>
Though major progress has been made in the past months, he
said, some important tasks are still to be accomplished. He urged
that UNITA should move its headquarters to the capital city,
Luanda, as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jonas Savimbi, the UNITA leader had refused to
move into the residence the government prepared for him in
Luanda.

MACAO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira has
pledged that his government will strengthen the police forces to

He said at a weekly police forces meeting on Wednesday that his
government will "continue to provide the police forces with all
the help they need to fulfill their mission for the safety and

Macao police launched a series of actions in the past week,

seizing a batch of firearms and explosives.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News reported on Thursday that the governor
expressed his support to the way by which the police forces have
been carrying out their duties.
</P>

The report said he "reiterated his appreciation and praise for
the police forces efforts and reaffirmed his support and
solidarity."
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, at least seven civil servants,
including several of middle and senior ranks, were either murdered
or attacked. The police fought back last week and detained an
alleged triad boss, who has since been on pre-trial detention in
jail.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade Surplus Increases in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's trade surplus
increased by a significant 49.2 percent to 3.72 billion ringgit
(about 1 billion U.S. dollars) in March this year from 2.5 billion
ringgit (675.675 million dollars) in February as a result of a
much faster growth in exports.
</P>
<P>
The March trade surplus represented an increase of 112.4
percent increase over the same month last year, the Statistics
Department said in its external trade summary for March 1998
released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bigger surplus was due to a much faster export growth of
31.2 percent to 24.501 billion ringgit (6.621 billion dollars) in
March from the year ago level, compared with a slower 22.8 percent
growth in imports of 20.778 billion ringgit (5.615 billion
dollars), it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the department, if trade in lumpy items, namely,
aircraft and ships/tankers, including their accessories, were
excluded from the import and re-export data, an impressive trade
surplus of 4.9 billion ringgit (1.324 billion dollars) would be
recorded in March.
</P>
<P>
Cumulatively, Malaysia's external trade balance registered a
favorable surplus of 8.8 billion ringgit (2.378 billion dollars)
during the first quarter compared with the 2.0 billion ringgit
(540.54 million dollars) in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
This was due to a substantial growth of 42.5 percent in exports
and a lower rate of growth at 29.9 percent in imports.
</P>
<P>
Total exports and imports for the January-March period were
69.8 billion ringgit (18.864 billion dollars) and 61.0 billion
ringgit (16.486 billion dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Region Plans Compulsory Education Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The central government will spend
290 million yuan (35 million U.S. dollars) to help nine
poverty-stricken counties in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region develop compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
The nine counties make up 45 percent of Ningxia's population
and 66.6 percent of its size.
</P>
<P>
To date, 11 of the 23 counties and cities in Ningxia have
completely carried out the nine-year compulsory education
requirement, providing a chance to attend school for 96.7 percent
of school-age children.
</P>
<P>
A local educational official said that the investment will be
used to build new schools, repair campus buildings, buy books and
teaching equipment, and hold training programs for teachers.
</P>
<P>
The investment is part of the country's largest compulsory
education project in poor areas, which will spend a total of 2.4
billion yuan to carry out compulsory education nationwide by
2000.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Opposition Seeks Alliance in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's biggest
opposition party, the National Party (NP), has reiterated its
call on opposition parties to fight next year's general election
on a joint platform, newspapers published here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NP leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk urged Wednesday small
parties to join his party's fight to prevent the African National
Congress (ANC) from obtaining a two-thirds majority in the
election, which would enable the ANC to change clauses in the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in Pretoria that this could be done if
opposition parties stopped wasting energy by fighting one
another.
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority for the ANC would spell grave danger for
democracy, as the ANC had already indicated it might reconsider
the position of the Reserve Bank, scrap the property clause in
the constitution and get rid of watchdog institutions such as the
auditor-general, Van Schalkwyk said.
</P>
<P>
It was of crucial importance that opposition parties put their
resources, financial and otherwise, together to fight the ANC, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The ANC at this stage had budgeted some 150 million Rand (30
million U.S. Dollars) for its election campaign, while the NP's
maximum would be about 40 million Rand (8 million Dollars), he
said.
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk said the NP would seek a possible alliance with
the Democratic Party, the Freedom Front, both white-based
parties, and the Inkatha Freedom Party, the biggest black
opposition party, because their policy frameworks were in line
with that of the NP.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation would entail a loose coalition between these
parties based on a joint manifesto, and aimed at giving all
leaders equal status, he said.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, a close coalition such as the ruling alliance
of the ANC, South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress
of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), was not viable as smaller
opposition parties might be afraid of being absorbed, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pan Africanist Congress and the United Democratic
Movement would not be considered as they "were too far away from
us", Van Schalkwyk said.

XINING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Xining, capital of Qinghai Province,
is in fine bloom this spring as colorful tulips, elegant peonies

</P>
<P>
The highland city is only one of the places in Qinghai on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau benefiting from a booming flower industry.
</P>
<P>
People in Qinghai have a long-standing love for flowers and the
province's plentiful sunshine and sharp differences between
daytime and night-time temperatures are suited for growing
flowers. However, flower-growing long had been a family business.
</P>
<P>
With constant improvements in the living standard, more and
more people began to look for flowers in marketplaces for
weddings, festivals, or for hospital patients.
</P>
<P>
Seizing the opportunity, shrewd business people in the province
have built more than 1,000 flower-growing centers with a combined
annual capacity of more than 500,000 flowers, and opened a dozen
flower markets.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Minority Area Expects To Get More Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
the largest region of ethnic minorities in China, plans to use 168
million US dollars worth of foreign investment this year.
</P>
<P>
Of that, 128 million US dollars will be in the form of loans,
and the remainder will be direct foreign investment, said
Abul'ahat Abdurixit, chairman of the regional people's government.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for farms, water conservation projects,
and the textile and manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang covers a sixth of China's territory and its 5,400-km
border runs along eight countries. The region is China's largest
cotton producer and has 2.4 billion tons of proven oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the central government has shifted its
emphasis of economic development from coastal areas to the central
and western parts of the country and Xinjiang has major
attractions for overseas investors. In the past five years, it has
held five foreign trade fairs, where 815 contracts were signed,
worth 1.1 billion US dollars.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China will send air force and navy
units to the South China Sea to enforce the ban on fishing from
May 15 to September 10.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Chinese laws on marine waste dumping and
fishing, the joint inspection team also will enforce regulations
on maritime utilization and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The air force will make inspection flights in the east and west
coastal waters off Guangdong Province as well as the Zhujiang
River delta area, according to sources with the maritime aquatic
department in south China's Guangdong Province and the South China
Sea Branch of the National Bureau of Oceanography.
</P>
<P>
If an illegal activity is spotted, inspection ships will be
dispatched to the target marine space.
</P>
<P>
The inspections have been necessary to counter serious problems
in excessive, unpaid and disorderly utilization of maritime
resources near Guangdong in recent years, authorities said. The
province expects this round of law enforcement to dispose of a
number of serious violators in its coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 is the international oceanic year. The inspection
will help bring maritime resources under closer governmental
administration.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Spending More on Housing, Electronic Goods, and Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Consumer spending is up in China,
and housing, electronic goods, and travel are popular items,
industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
According to people at a seminar on consumer trends here
recently, at least 60 million urban families have no housing of
their own and the average living space in two-thirds of China's
cities is below the national average.
</P>
<P>
But, savings deposits have grown to 4 trillion yuan (481.9
billion US dollars), and there is 30 billion yuan in housing funds
available, increasing home buying power.
</P>
<P>
So, in order to improve housing conditions, the Chinese
government has removed some housing construction charges and has
called for a better installment-buying system and is working out a
housing reform.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that a home buying enthusiasm could last
until the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, electronics and information technology goods have
been growing by 27.5 percent annually, with telephones and
computers being the two hottest items and analysts say that demand
is expected to remain high.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, home appliances will remain strong in coming
years. It is expected that over the next five years, rural areas
will need 140 million more refrigerators, 160 million color
televisions, and 166 million washing machines.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Invests in China's Tea Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese company has set up a
joint venture to produce Japanese-style green tea in the Dabie
mountainous area in geographical conditions usually avoided by
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, the Henan Xinlin Tea Co. Ltd., has delivered
its initial production to market. The company, with an investment
of 2.9 million U.S. dollars, is located in Xinxian County in
central China's Henan Province, traditionally renowned for its
tea-growing.
</P>
<P>
Haramo Yasinao, president of the Tokyo Huayu Company, the
Japanese partner, recently expressed his confidence in the
company's success and pledged that the green tea, produced with
Japanese equipment and techniques, will be among the best in China.
</P>
<P>
"Although the region is relatively impoverished and isolated
from the outside world, we treasure its abundant tea resources and
diligent and modest local laborers," he said. "We believe the
project will be mutually beneficial to both parties."
</P>
<P>
To date, 101 foreign-funded companies have been established in
the Dabie mountainous areas, where late military strategists Liu
Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping based their forces against the
Nationalist government headed by Chiang Kai-shek during the civil
war (1946-1949).
</P>
<P>
The region has attracted more than 80 million U.S. dollars in
contracted foreign investment to its light industry, processing of
agricultural products, catering and mineral resource development.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Balance of Payments Posts Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Governor of Central Bank of the
Philippines Gabriel Singson announced Thursday that the country's
balance of payments posted a 1.8 billion-U.S.-dollar surplus as of
mid-April this year.
</P>
<P>
This represented a 380 percent increase over the year-ago level
of 367 million U.S. dollars. Preliminary reports said the surplus
mainly came from an improving trade position and loan inflows,
Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Balance of payments was the difference between a nation's
payments to foreign countries and its total receipts from foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months this year, the Philippines'
merchandise exports grew by 24 percent to 6.82 billion dollars,
further narrowing down the country's trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
During the first two weeks of April, a total of 1.24 billion
dollars flew into the country, including a 750-million-dollar
Paris Club loan from a consortium of foreign banks and the
proceeds of the national government's bond flotation amounting to
5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international investors' confidence in the local
economy was regained, witnessed by the net inflow of 400 million
dollars in portfolio investments during the period, Singson said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Further Lower in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued falling in
Tokyo Thursday in tandem with a fall in the Japanese yen and the
yield on long-term Japanese government bonds.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped 100.81 points or 0.66
percent from Wednesday's close to 15,143.03.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 10.79 points or 0.90 percent to
1,189.87.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the First Section remained thin at an estimated 360
million shares, almost unchanged from Wednesday's 350 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
Nissan Motor was Thursday's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Nikkei index tested the 15,000 line just after
seeing the U.S. dollar hit a high of 133.65 yen around noon, up
more than 1 yen from Wednesday's levels.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the key 10-year government bond, meanwhile,
registered yet another record low of 1.355 percent in the
afternoon, reflecting the widespread pessimism about the course of
the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Tokyo market sentiment was also dampened by
morning drops in other Asian markets, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,329 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outpaced gainers 760 to 364, with 151 remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Re-Write History Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The ruling African National
Congress (ANC) of South Africa will rewrite the country's past
and correct the mistakes of four decades of apartheid
historiography.
</P>
<P>
Nhlanhla Ndebele, a 30-year-old graduate of Wits University,
has been appointed to research the ANC's massive archive, the
Star daily quoted parliament Speaker Frene Ginwala as saying
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the appointment as "historic", Ginwala said "the
ANC has brought its archives back to South Africa. Part of the
project is to build a common understanding of our past."
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu was also quoted as saying
that the study would mark a fresh step in the creation of a new
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa led by President Nelson Mandela and his
Government of National Unity, abolished in 1994 apartheid which
dominated for decades in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ndebele, who was supposed to spend three years to finish
researching the ANC archives, said he hoped his work would be the
starting point for further study into South Africa's bloodstained
past. This project "will change the way history is taught in our
schools," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ANC archives, scattered all over the world when the
organization was in exile for years, were established at Fort
Hare University in the Eastern Cape Province two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Photographer Comments on Changes in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- "Unbelievable changes have taken
place in China, compared with what I saw during my last trip to
the country 20 years ago," reports Stig T. Karlsson, a 68-year-old
Swedish photographer.
</P>
<P>
In the late 70s, Mr. Karlsson visited India, Japan, and China
and marveled at China's well-organized society and human
interests, and later published a book about his Asia trip,
entitled "At Home In China".
</P>
<P>
Karlsson is making a 20-day visit to China now at the
invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Culture and started in
Guangdong Province in the south, where he was surprised at the
changes in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
"China's villages have developed to such an unbelievably high
level," he says, commenting on how traditional and uncreative
Chinese farmers used to be.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, Karlsson visited the home of Zhang Maogen, a
retired steel plant worker. During his first visit, he had stayed
with Zhang's family for seven days. This time he spent three days
with them, taking pictures of their daily life.
</P>
<P>
He says he's happy to see that Zhang's family has so many
modern electric appliances, and that the couple's warm feelings
and kindness towards others remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
One thing that attracted him most in China was the vividness of
Shanghai, and he says he feels at home when he's in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
However, he says he's worried about the large number of
skyscrapers there and wonders whether the city government will
protect old buildings, since so many new buildings have
appeared. And he wonders whether the city's industries and traffic
will pollute the environment, pointing to the fact that the city's
air is not as clean as it was 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mr. Karlsson revisited India and Japan and he is
planning another album on Asia, but with China as the main theme
still.
</P>
<P>
"I will come back to China after 20 years, when I am 88 years
old," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A large field containing
rich lead and zinc deposits has been found in Longhua County of
north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The proven reserves are estimated at one million tons,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The field, which also contains other minerals including
sulphur and molybdenum, can be turned into eight mining zones
in accordance with the distribution of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
The mine will be able to produce more than 100,000 tons of
refined lead and zinc ore powder a year, with the concentration of
lead and zinc amounting to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the field can sustain 50 years of development
and the full investment should be recovered five years after the
mine begins production.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Coffee Exports Drop for Bad Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's coffee exports have
dropped dramatically due to bad weather, slashing the country's
export income and inflicting a heavy blow to the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released Wednesday by the Uganda
Coffee Development Authority, the coffee exports in the last
seven months totaled 1.54 million bags (60-kilo) valued at 147.4
million U.S. Dollars, a decline of 48 percent in volume and 36
percent in value compared with the same period of the last export
year.
</P>
<P>
April witnessed an export of 138,264 bags of coffee with a
value of 24.2 million Dollars, nearly 50 percent down from last
April's 268,825 bags.
</P>
<P>
While the unit value remains relatively stable, torrential
rains brought by the El-Nino phenomenon were usually blamed for
the sharp cut in coffee export.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is uganda's single largest foreign exchange earner. It
accounted for 68 and 56 percents of total exports in the last two
years respectively.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997 was close to 6
billion Dollars and its total export earnings were 622 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The overall fall in exports in tandem with the decline on the
cumulative basis partly explains the weakening of the Ugandan
Shilling against the U.S. Dollar during April. The exchange rate
between Dollar and the Ugandan Shilling declined from 1:1100 to
1:1275 at the end of April.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress in New and Renewable Energy Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China has made progress in
developing new and renewable energy from water, solar, wind,
geothermal and tidal sources, according to a senior official with
the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
To date, the country's annual utilization rate of new and
renewable energy has reached 300 million tons of standard coal,
accounting for a quarter of the national consumption of primary
energy and more than 47 percent of energy consumption in rural
areas, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The country has made world-renowned progress in small
hydropower utilization. Nearly 7,000 small hydropower stations
have been set up with an installed capacity of 20 million
kilowatts (kw), generating more than 50 billion kilowatts/hour
(kwh) of electricity, accounting for 25 percent of the total that
can be exploited.
</P>
<P>
Some 75 percent of rural households in China have installed
coal-saving stoves. More than 5.7 million rural households used
bio-gas with an annual bio-gas production of 1.5 billion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
In terms of using the solar energy, there were 5 million square
meters of solar heaters, 6 million square meters of passive
solar-heated housing, 40,000 square meters of solar greenhouses
for agricultural uses and 150,000 solar stoves.
</P>
<P>
Wind energy has been used for major electricity generation. To
date, 160,000 household mini- and small-size wind generators are
in use with a combined capacity of 15,000 kw, mostly distributed
in the remote pastoral areas, mountain areas and islands. China
has imported medium- and large-size wind generators from Denmark,
the Netherlands, and the United States to equip 15 power plants
which have 120 generating units with a capacity of 30,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
China is also rich in tidal energy, 90 percent of which is
located in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. Some 10 tidal-power
stations have been set up nationwide with a total installed
capacity of 7,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
The reserves of small coal mines that can be exploited reach
more than 10 billion tons. The reserves have been mined for more
than 500 million tons of coal annually, making up 40 percent of
the national raw coal production.

NANCHANG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi Province will
increase investment this year to spur economic growth, according
to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi's investment in fixed assets this year is expected to
be 16.5 percent up on last year, according to the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi is set to achieve an economic growth rate of 8 percent
this year and will, moreover, strive for a rate as high as 11
percent, Governor Shu Shengyou said.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve the goals, we have increased investment on the
basis of economic restructuring," Shu said.
</P>
<P>
More funds will be invested in water conservation, energy,
transportation, telecommunications, environmental protection and
technical innovation, Shu added. He called on the state-owned
enterprises and overseas-funded and privately-run enterprises to
increase investment.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi has raised 53.4 billion yuan for 74 key projects in the
last five years, 41 of which have already been completed.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the projects has considerably reduced the
effects of such "bottleneck" sectors as power, railways and
highways, experts said.

JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Namibia and Botswana, locked
in a territorial dispute involving islands in the Linyanti-Chobe
river, Wednesday initialled an accord indicating they would opt
for a diplomatic solution, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from both countries met behind closed doors
on Tuesday and Wednesday, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's major daily newspaper, The Namibian, reported that
the delegates were mandated by their governments to hammer out an
agreement to establish a joint delimitation commission.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Namibian delegation, Albert Kawana, told reporters
that there was an agreement a long time ago between the two
governments to come to a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
The two governments must still sign the agreement before it is
ratified in parliament, while the two countries will have to
agree on a date on which the agreement will be signed by top
officials.
</P>
<P>
A joint commission will have to demarcate the entire stretch
along the Linyanti-Chobe river, comprising about 350 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are disputing Kasikili Island, which is
called Sedudu in Botswana, and the island of Situngu.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has stationed a number of troops on both islands.
</P>
<P>
Tensions grew on the island of Situngu late last year when a
Botswana Defense Force unit allegedly trooped on the island and
harassed Namibian villagers farming there.

<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- American world champion Marion Jones
is facing a tough challenge from well tuned-up host Li Xuemei in
the world fastest woman 100 meters race starting next Tuesday in
China's northwestern city Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old multi talented American, a
basketballer-turned-sprinter, has to fight Li tooth and nail in
the unprecedented commecial race for women sprinters if she wants
to retain the title of the world 100-meter queen.
</P>
<P>
Li, who surprised the world last year with a 10.79-second run,
the second fastest time in the world last season to Jones' 10.76,
tuned up her shape brilliantly by registering the year's world
best of 11.01 at a national Grand Prix meeting in her hometown
Chengdu on April 18.
</P>
<P>
But Jones, who won the 100-meter title at last year's world
championships and clocked 6.95 in the 60 meters two months ago,
the year's world best, also has showed that she is in a superb
form after long jumping a fabulous 7.05-meter early this week in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever wants to win the showdown, she has to romp home in a
sub-11-second dash, " Li's coach Zhang Rongwei said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese Athletics Association, the organizer
of the race, Olympic champion Gail Devers will skep the race, and
Zhanna Pintussevich of Ukraine, world 100-meter silver medal
winner last year, also withdrew from the duel with a last minute
decision.
</P>
<P>
The other world class foreign sprinters due to compete are
Savatheda Fynes of Bahamas, last year's world bronze medal winner,
Chandra Sturrup of Bahamas, the 1996 Olympic 100-meter fourth
finisher with a personal best of 11 seconds, and Carlette Guidry,
a member of the U.S. 4x100m relay winning team at the 1996
Olympics with a 10.94 personal best. All the four foreign dashers
are based in the United States and trained by Amerian coaches.
</P>
<P>
Susanthika Jayashinghe of Sri Lanka, the world 200m runner-up
who was tested positive last month, was kicked out of the IAAF
sunctioned race.
</P>
<P>
Jones will fly to Chengdu on May 10 after completing an IAAF
Grand Prix meet in Japan this Saturday. The race will be held in
a 30,000-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the appearence fee for Jones is about
45,000 U.S dollars. Whoever breaks the world record will gain
100,000 U.S. dollars as a bonus.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Defines New Criteria of Model Workers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Even in the 1950s and '60s, the model workers were encouraged
to combine hard work with ingenuity. Now the latter has
undoubtedly carried greater weight," said Su Neng, head of the
department in charge of appointing model workers under the
All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
This change of criteria has mirrored social progress in China,
and is in line with the Chinese government's principle of
"revitalizing the country through science and education," he added.
</P>
<P>
Another conspicuous figure in this year's top 10 model workers
is Zhang Weidong, a construction worker from Anshan City in
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
A former laid-off worker, the 51-year-old Zhang is the sole
representative in the top 10 of workers in the northeastern China,
a traditional industrial base which is home to a large proportion
of the country's state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In March of 1992, Zhang, then head of a tilers' squad in a
state-owned construction firm, voluntarily applied for a layoff to
help the 32 other laid-off workers from his firm to find a new way
of living. Now they are running a housing decoration company with
annual profits of more than 300,000 yuan (about 36,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Zhang's action has shown the Chinese workers' understanding
of, support for and active participation in the reforms. It has
also reflected the working class' lofty spirit of sharing the
worries and burdens of the country, which is most needed in our
time," Su said.
</P>
<P>
A new social group that has emerged since the early 1990s with
the deepening of reforms in the state enterprises, China's
laid-off workers now total 8.6 million according to the latest
official statistics. It has become a common concern of the
government and the society to provide them with new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Media reports show that this year across China, many former
laid-off workers who have scored success in their new jobs won the
titles of model workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's annual development
program (ADP) has been progressing slowly due to constraints in
fund release, lack of cooperation and proper policy guidelines and
some other reasons, an English daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Express quoted officials concerned as saying that
the reasons for the lower pace also include delay in preparation,
revision and approval of projects, lack of manpower, delay in
appointment of consultants and settlement of tender documents, and
problems in acquisition of land.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the government funded 63.7 billion taka (1.38
billion U.S. dollars), or half of the ADP's total budget in the
first nine months of fiscal 1997-98 (July, 1997-July, 1998), 6
percent less than that of the same period of the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The amount spent during the same period of the last fiscal year
was 70.05 billion taka (1.52 billion dollars), 56 percent of the
total ADP budget of 125 billion taka (2.72 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ADP includes a total of 1,240 projects, of which 48 are
identified as high priority projects, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Shanghai has asked the industrial sector to increase investment
and exports in the second quarter to offset the negative effects
of the Asian financial crisis and to ensure 10-percent industrial
growth for the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output here rose 8.9 percent in the first four
months of the year, compared with a year ago and exports of 14
major machinery and electronics products was 284 million US
dollars in the first three months, up 6.97 percent from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Southeast Asia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea
(ROK) were down a great deal. Exports of metallurgical products to
Japan and the ROK were down 40 percent and exports of steel to
Southeast Asia dropped 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Large imports of low-priced industrial raw materials like
chemicals and fertilizers for farm use affected industrial
production in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
And businesses in Shanghai have been asked to adjust their
product mix, develop different products, and increase the supply
of marketable goods.
</P>
<P>
The city will also look for new markets in Africa, the Middle
East, Europe, and Africa and change its export strategy and will
build more high-tech production centers.

The new route, which ended the record of no direct air flights
between Jiangxi and Guizhou, actually starts in Nanjing, capital
of east China's Jiangsu Province, extends to Nanchang, capital of
Jiangxi Province, and ends in Guizhou, capital of Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The air route will help enhance regional cooperation and
economic contact between the more-developed east China and the
under-developed southwest areas, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Turning Eroded Land into Orchards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The gentle green mountains around the
town of Hetian in western Fujian Province, east China, would
hardly make a person think of it by its previous name -- Flaming
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
It had got that name because of the reddish eroded earth on it
and was one of the country's most serious victims of water
erosion, with 44.6 percent of its land, or 15,800 ha., in that
state. An 18-year-old pine tree there would only grow one meter
high.
</P>
<P>
The serious deterioration of the environment had resulted in
equally stubborn poverty and a per capita annual income of 106
yuan in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, however, things there have gradually changed after
a large program was started to control water erosion. Every year,
the provincial government has since allocated 200,000 yuan for
the project.
</P>
<P>
A decade of planting and soil improvements has recovered 10,000
ha. of eroded land, or 60 percent of the destroyed coverage. Soil
erosion at Hetian is basically under control and annual soil
losses are down from 8,590 tons per sq. km. to 449 tons.
</P>
<P>
Fruit trees have also been planted in an area of 6,700 ha., on
which chickens are also raised.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the town's per capita annual income was up to 2,700,
well above the country's poverty line of 500 yuan.

<HEADLINE> China Defines New Criteria of Model Workers(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Around this year's May Day, the
Chinese news media acquainted the public with a new hero -- Wang
Tao, an auto mechanic from central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 42, ranked first on the list of China's newly appointed
"National Top 10 Outstanding Workers," the country's paramount
honor for urban laborers.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Wang worked extremely hard with no
complaints, and was always ready to help his fellow workers or
clients. He certainly shared all typical virtues of the previous
national model workers China had appointed since the founding of
the People's Republic in 1949.
</P>
<P>
What makes Wang different from his predecessors is that, in his
decades-long efforts to perfect his skills, he invented a unique
method of operation, which was later introduced to all mechanics
in the Dongfeng Motor Company, one of China's leading car makers
and Wang's employer.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang's most impressive achievement is that, with only
a high school education, he wrote two technical books on
automobile maintenance of 200,000 words.
</P>
<P>
"As a worker, you need to work conscientiously," Wang
said. "And for a worker living in the new period, it's not enough
to contribute only your physical labor, you must also use your
brain and always seek to improve yourself."
</P>
<P>
According to a Beijing sociologist, the wide publicity Wang
received recently reflects the Chinese government's higher demands
on the quality of industrial workers as the country's reform and
opening-up drive is now opening a new chapter.
</P>
<P>
"In today's world, the survival and development of enterprises
are mainly decided by science and technology," the sociologist
said. "China is eager to encourage its workers to constantly
improve their educational and technical levels, and show
creativity and a pioneering spirit while working diligently, so as
to help add vitality to, and raise the competitiveness of, the
industrial sector."
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, workers that only know hard work and
thrift, who used to be popular candidates for the honor of model
worker under China's planned economy from the 1950s to the early
1980s, are now giving way to those who have displayed technical
competence, creativity or a good command of modern science and
technology in their jobs.

<HEADLINE> Success Manifested Everyday in HK: Tung Chee Hwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on Thursday lauded the
continued success of Hong Kong after its return to China, saying,
"The success is manifested everyday in Hong Kong and in every
possible way."
</P>
<P>
Calling 1997 an extraordinary year for the territory, Tung said
at the ongoing annual Corporate Conference of Asia Society, "July
1 saw the smooth and seamless return of Hong Kong to China,
thereby ending 157 years of colonial rule." "Indeed, the people of
Hong Kong had looked forward to this great occasion with immense
pride."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Hong Kong people are confident in managing
their future. "The ultimate source of our confidence is the solid
promises of the constitutional document, our Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
To ensure that Hong Kong's international and cosmopolitan
outlook is maintained, Tung continued, "we will continue to
assimilate the knowledge and experiences of the West while we
preserve the virtues of Chinese culture."
</P>
<P>
"If there has been any changes at all in Hong Kong since the
handover, it is the mindset of our people," he pointed out. "Hong
Kong is no longer an enclave economy with an artificial and
psychological barrier created by the date of June 30, 1997, and
the border between Hong Kong and the mainland of China."
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that in the immediate years before the handover and
during 1997, tens of thousands of Hong Kong people who had
previously migrated overseas returned home. "They feel the pride,
they sense the opportunity and they want to participate in
building a better tomorrow," he declared.

<HEADLINE> HK Passes Test of Financial Crisis: Tung Chee Hwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here
Thursday that Hong Kong has "passed the test" of a financial
crisis that has affected Asia since last July.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing annual Corporate Conference of Asia
Society, Tung said 1997 was an extraordinary year for Asia at
large when structural weaknesses of some Asian nations triggered
the financial crisis that reverberated around the world.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive noted that those economies that have sound
fundamentals, credible policies and low leverage, such as China,
have succeeded in weathering the storm. "Those with free markets,
strong regulations, rule of law and stringent fiscal discipline,
such as Hong Kong and Singapore, have passed the test."
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Asia has been painful but the
fundamentals in Asia have not changed, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to prudent fiscal management, Tung said, Hong Kong's
foreign exchange reserves stood at 92.8 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of 1997 -- the third largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"These huge reserves provide not just 100 percent, not just 200
percent, but 800 percent backing for the currency in circulation,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he did not believe Hong Kong needs to devalue the HK
dollar, saying, "It is not in the interest of Hong Kong to do so."
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the total value of Hong Kong's trade in goods
and services in a year is equal to well over 250 percent of its
GDP, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Tung pointed out that the SAR government is "conscious
of the high costs although Hong Kong does not wish to become more
competitive through devaluation." To tackle these problems, the
government has planned a series of measures which were announced
in Tung's Policy Speech delivered on October 8 last year.
</P>
<P>
Tung admitted that as a result of several attacks on the Hong
Kong dollar in the past few months, interest rates have gone up
and remained relatively high. This has resulted in a slowdown in
economic growth, an increase in the unemployment rate and a
decline in the stock and property markets.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "we are not allowing the Asian financial
turmoil to derail our long-term focus of building a Hong Kong
which is fair, free, prosperous and economically competitive."
</P>
<P>
The government is able to continue with its massive plan of
investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong
Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st century, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi's Coastal Cities Developing Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Coastal cities in the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region have been developing fast and becoming outlets
for southwestern China in the opening up process.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the Chinese government decided to turn
Guangxi into a passage to the sea and now, cities like Beihai,
Qinzhou, and Fangcheng are the points connecting southwestern
China's economy with Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi government spent a lot on infrastructure in those
three cities, building expressways, railways, airport, roads, and
waterways.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in their economy and investment environment has
attracted investors from the neighbouring provinces of Sichuan,
Yunnan, and Guizhou, and from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Beihai developed from a sleepy town into a medium-sized city
with its GDP reaching 11.2 billion yuan last year. It has also had
growth in its ocean economy and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Qinzhou became a new port city with 46 overseas-funded projects
worth 769 million US dollars and had a GDP of 12.7 billion yuan in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Fangcheng has become one of the largest ports in southern
China, handling 6.5 million tons of goods every year, accounting
for 70 percent of Guangxi's total. Its trade with Vietnam was
worth two billion yuan last year and accounted for half of the
total of the country trade with Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt's Overspending Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce (ZNCC) has said it is perturbed about the public
sector's continued show of financial mismanagement coupled by
propensity to borrow heavily on the domestic money market.
</P>
<P>
ZNCC Chief Executive Wonder Maisiri said Wednesday it was
apparent that the government created opportunities for itself to
spend money which the country could "ill afford" given the
turbulent economic situation facing the country, a report from
the Zimbabwe News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while responding to the Auditor General's
Report for the 1995/96 financial year, which revealed the
government exceeded its borrowing limits by 72.8 billion
Zimbabwean Dollars (4.3 billion U.S. Dollars) without
parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
He said in heavily borrowing on the domestic market, the
government was crowding out the private sector, which is
struggling to make ends meet and to sustain businesses due to
punitive high inflation and commercial interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He said revelations by the Auditor General's Report that
ministries were not respecting the parliament's authority by
overspending were a depressing scenario.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Zimbabwe will await impatiently to see what
punishment will be metted out by parliament to the offending
ministries," he said, "this indeed smacks of bad governance which
can hardly be condoned by our economically ailing society."
</P>
<P>
"What is equally staggering and embarrassing is the lack of
transparency in the matter in which public funds collected by
ministries are not accounted for," he said.

<HEADLINE> Second Quarter Work Key to Economic Growth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Economic work for the second quarter
of 1998 is of vital importance for China to meet this year's 8
percent growth in its gross domestic product (GDP), the People's
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
China had a 7.2 percent GDP growth rate during the first
quarter, 2.2 percentage points lower than the same period last
year. To hit this year's projected economic growth target, GDP
increases for the other three quarters must be higher than 8
percent, the paper quoted sources at the State Development
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The greatest potential to promote rapid economic growth this
year lies in investments, which should be put into place as soon
as possible as the results can only be felt in the latter half of
the year, the paper reported in a signed article.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, priorities should be given to:
</P>
<P>
-- Speeding up projects already under construction;
</P>
<P>
-- Trying to complete feasibility studies and preparations for
newly approved projects, and get them started within the year;
</P>
<P>
-- Selecting some marketable and efficient products and
enterprises, and increasing investments for equipment replacement;
</P>
<P>
-- Treating medium- and small-size businesses and township
enterprises the same as state-owned ones in terms of offering
credit loans and other services; and,
</P>
<P>
-- Carrying out policies that aim to increase exports, such as
credit loans to support exports of complete sets of equipment and
labor contracts, and export tax refunds.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission warns that a down-to-earth manner is
necessary in this effort to avoid inefficient high-speed growth
and a bubble economy.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Engineering Producing Hardier Tomatos for Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a
better kind of the tomato by splicing genetic material from a
cold-water fish with the pollen of tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
After ten years of research, they have gotten tomato seeds with
greater resistance to cold than ordinary ones. The sprouted plants
were found to be capable of surviving for six hours at four
degrees below zero Celsius in experiments. Further experiments
showed that the seeds can be planted 15 days earlier than ordinary
seeds in the spring and can survive a late frost, which kills
ordinary tomato plants.
</P>
<P>
And the harvest season of these tomatos can last a month longer
than that of ordinary ones.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yong, who was in charge of the research in Harbin, the
capital of Heilongjiang Province, says that the new tomato plants
have high yields and the tomatos have a vitamin C content that is
15 percent greater than ordinary ones, and they taste better.
</P>
<P>
The seeds have become a best seller since they were approved by
government departments last year. They were sold for 200,000 yuan
(24,000 US dollars) per kilogram to an agricultural research
institute in Liaoning Province in northeastern China -- or twice
the price of gold. People keep coming to buy them.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Sino-U.S. Textile Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government recently decided
unilaterally to cut the quotas of Chinese textiles by 300 percent,
which are valued at 5.1 million U.S. dollars, because of Chinese
firm's alleged shipments of textiles through third countries.
</P>
<P>
The textile trade is an important component of
Sino-U.S. trade. Since the two countries signed their first
agreement on textile trade in September of 1980, China's exports
of textiles to the United States have continually increased. In
recent years, China's annual exports of textiles to the United
States have been worth 4-to-5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A fourth Sino-U.S. agreement on textile commodities was due by
the end of 1996. To reach a new agreement, the two countries held
five rounds of negotiations since October of 1996, and extended
the overdue agreement to Jan. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new four-year Sino-U.S. textile products agreement was
signed on Feb. 2, 1997, which laid the foundation for further
development of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The illegal shipment of Chinese textile products is an
important issue in the two countries' textile trade. In June of
1996, the United States, without providing clear evidence or
consulting with China, unilaterally eliminated quotas on 13
categories of textiles and, for the first time, cut five kinds of
quotas by 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
This act of the United States, violating the principles of the
bilateral textile trade accord, was opposed by various relevant
parties because it has brought substantial loss to not only
Chinese firms, but also to U.S. importers, retailers and
consumers. It has also seriously affected the Sino-U.S. textile
trade.
</P>
<P>
Although China has demanded the United States to change its
decision, the U.S. side did not make a positive response. In
return, China temporarily halted the imports of U.S. beverages and
agricultural produce effective Nov. 10, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children Feeling Greater Parental Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Liu Yan's parents, teachers, and
neighbors all praise her and say she is a wonderful girl, but her
response is, "They love me too much."
</P>
<P>
Growing up in a period of reforms and opening-up in China as
she does is not easy, and the 17-year-old girl says, "We do have a
generation gap between us and our parents and grandparents."
</P>
<P>
And, although she respects them and obeys their orders, she
still wants to do whatever she likes.
</P>
<P>
Many young Chinese urbanites, like Liu, feel they are facing
pressures that excessive love brings in families that are
accustomed to taking care of everything involving their children.
</P>
<P>
And Chinese children traditionally listened to their parents
and followed their advice carefully. But, today's urban children
are maturing earlier than previous generations of the
Chinese. According to a recent survey by a Beijing-based polling
organization, urban children between the age of 13 and 19 in
Beijing and Shanghai are already suspicious of their parents and
are constantly disagreeing with them.
</P>
<P>
Most of those surveyed said that they feel lots of warmth and
love from their parents, but they lack emotional exchanges and
some mutual trust with the older generation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese parents often tell their children to study more and
provide them with outstanding examples to emulate, and children
say that they treasure even casual opportunities to spend time
with their parents.
</P>
<P>
Liu Li, a 42-year-old music teacher in Beijing, says that many
parents are willing to devote all their holidays to being with
their children in part-time arts schools or cram courses.
</P>
<P>
Liu says that his music class has more than 100 children, every
one of whose parents expect him or her to be an outstanding
musician. And, many parents, who went through the Cultural
Revolution from 1966 to 1976 and spent their younger years there,
often had no way of realizing their hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
And finally, the survey found that boys feel more pressures from
their parents than girls do.

<P>
YINCHUAN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous region is making efforts to improve its investment
environment, develop foreign trade, and increase cooperation with
the eastern part of China, according to Ma Qizhi, the region's
acting chairman.
</P>
<P>
Ma told a recent conference that Ningxia had over 300 million
US dollars worth of exports and imports last year, registering an
annual increase of 18.6 percent. The increase in exports was 17.4
percent, much higher than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the region approved over 400
overseas-funded projects and used 240 million US dollars worth of
investment.
</P>
<P>
Exports of overseas-funded enterprises accounted for 14 percent
of the region's total last year.
</P>
<P>
Ma says that, using its resource advantages, the region has
established exports centers for 370 products like metals, coal,
and cashmere.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has also found ways to cooperate with other areas in
technical and economic fields and developed more than 500 projects
with eastern provinces over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
With the capital city of Yinchuan as the center of opening up,
Ningxia has formed a new economic structure based on resources and
raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has also been developed over the past five years, and
there have been over eight million domestic and overseas tourists,
bringing nearly 700 million yuan in revenues.

<HEADLINE> Cervical Cancer Turns into Major Killer in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Long ignored cervical cancer is
turning into a major killer in sub-Saharan Africa, leading
thousands of women in child-bearing age to death, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The disease now is the leading cause of death in the cancer
diseases and the number of its victims is rising in sub-Saharan
Africa, medical experts were quoted as warning by Thursday's
Daily Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 500,000 cases of cancer of the cervix
occur every year with 200,000 to 300,000 dying from the disease
annually worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Professor J.K. Mati, a cancer expert, says 80 percent of the
victims were in the developing countries with the peak age being
between 35 and 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas in developed countries there has been a marked
reduction in the rates of mortality associated with cervical
cancer. In the last two to three decades, in the sub-Saharan
Africa, mortality remains high," he says.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase to late diagnosis and lack of
adequate equipment for successful treatment.
</P>
<P>
High illiteracy levels among women in Africa and rising
poverty have aggravated the already bad situation on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"Cervical cancer mortality is higher among the poor, who lack
easy access to health facilities. Advanced cervical cancer is
more common among rural-based women," Mati says.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the risk of contracting the disease, he urges women
to avoid having multiple sexual partners and to give up smoking.
</P>
<P>
He says scientists have also discovered some relationship
between certain methods of contraceptive use and cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
"A slight association has been shown between oral
contraceptive use (the pill) and cervical cancer, the risk being
higher among women who had used the method for five or more
years," he says.

<HEADLINE> Former Muslim, Croat Republics Asked to Stop Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Westendorp, the high
representative of the Peace Implementation Council, has asked the
former Muslim and Croat republics to stop immediately all their
government-style administrative activities.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp, who accused the already dissolved republics of
continuing these functions, made the demand in a briefing note to
other international organizations and all foreign embassies in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to a decision made on April 6, 1998 by
the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation, the Croatian Republic of
Herzeg-Bosna and the former Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
should cease all their functions, and legal documents issued by
the two entities were void.
</P>
<P>
The former Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established
by the Muslims in 1991 soon after the dissolution of the former
Yugoslavia. It was followed by the establishment of the Croatian
Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and the Republic of Srpska. Civil war
broke out immediately among the three entities.
</P>
<P>
After the Dayton Agreement, which brought an end to the bloody
civil war, Bosnia become a united country with two entities,
namely the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation and the Republic of
Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, after the establishment of the Bosnian
Muslim-Croat Federation and the unification of Bosnia, the former
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Republic of
Herzeg-Bosnia should have ceased to be.
</P>
<P>
But since both the Muslims and the Croatians fear that their
interests cannot be protected properly, they keep the republics
although they have ceased to exist by name. They accuse each other
of failing to abide by the Dayton Agreement.
</P>
<P>
A recent call from a Croatian leader for a federation of three
separate entities by the Croatians, Muslims and Serbs has caused
great unrest in the country.

MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Uzbek President Islam
Karimov Wednesday expressed here his satisfaction with talks with
Russian leaders on the bilateral relations, the Itar-Tass news

</P>
<P>
Karimov, who arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for a three-day state
visit, had talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Karimov told a briefing that he and Russian
leaders reached several agreements which will create new powerful
momentum for the development of the two countries relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the results of the talks would hasten solutions to
"overdue issues in the economic and political and humanitarian
spheres and in the sphere of defending interests of Russia in
Central Asia."
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said that it is crucially important that relations
between Russia and Uzbekistan are built on a clear understanding
of their economic interests, and not on attempts to substitute the
real economic interests by general talk about cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister said that the accords signed
Wednesday by the Russian and Uzbek sides will improve the trade
development of the two countries. The two countries' trade made
1.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 and increased by 21 percent in

<HEADLINE> Asia Should Abandon Easy-going Way of Growth: Vietnamese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister
Pham Gia Khiem said here Thursday that Asian countries should
abandon the easy-going way of growth and continue economic reforms
and integration.
</P>
<P>
Pham said at the morning session of the on-going Ninth Annual
Corporate Conference of Asia Society that with the support of the
world community, the Asian countries will be able to get their
economies recovered soon in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the present conditions of the economic crisis
demand the governments and people of these countries ... on one
hand fully develop all economic potentials and comparative
advantages in human resources and on the other hand completely
abandon the easy-going way of growth, persistently continue
economic reforms and integration, combine domestic strength with
external assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, he added, "we shall be able to gradually get the
situation right and build up an Asia of more dynamic and
sustainable development based on a new foundation more adaptive to
changes as mankind enters the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese official said one of the very important
characteristics of Asian economy is its high domestic savings
rate, from 30 percent to 40 percent of GDP, a very decisive factor
to ensure capital supply for a high and stable economic
performance.
</P>
<P>
In spite of continuous high growth for years, Pham said, the
region's economies displayed structural weaknesses and serious
macroeconomic imbalances as evidenced by overvalued exchange
rates, capital-intensive and properties development projects with
low rate of return, and the domestic monetary and financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
Pham noted that removing the present obstacles does not only
call for the efforts of Asia alone, but also of the world
community, including the financial support of countries and
international financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
In a world of increasing globalization and interdependence with
growing shared interests, "we should and must work closely
together to overcome any hardship as it appears in the course of
development." he said.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the morning session of the conference, Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region reviewed the development of Hong Kong after its return to
China about 10 months ago and in the aftermath of the recent
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that "success is manifested everyday in Hong Kong"
after the handover and the region has "passed the test" of the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the session, President Mitsuo Sato of the
Asian Development Bank called for reforms of financial
institutions on a broad basis.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Proposes Unconditional Diplomatic Ties with Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
has proposed establishing diplomatic ties between Yugoslavia and
Bosnia immediately and unconditionally, the Oslobodenje daily
circulated in Sarajevo reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Milosevic's proposal had been delivered
Monday by Milorad Dodik, the prime minister of the Serb Republic
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to Alija Izetbegovic, the chairman of the
Bosnian Presidency.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Yugoslavia "respects the sovereignty and
the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina" while "Bosnia-Herzegovina
respects Yugoslavia's right of inheritance."
</P>
<P>
Both countries should set up diplomatic relations and exchange
ambassadors "immediately and unconditionally," and agree to solve
between themselves the issue of ownership of assets left over from
the breakup of the former Yugoslavia "in accordance with the
international law," the proposal added.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Izetbegovic's office on Wednesday evening
said Bosnia was in contact with Yugoslavia on establishing
diplomatic ties. But a final decision would be made by relevant
state organs of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace accord which ended the 1992-95 civil war in
Bosnia calls for mutual recognition and the establishment of
diplomatic ties among the countries founded following the breakup
of the former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> India Reiterates Commitment to Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- India has reiterated its
commitment to developing good-neighborly relations with China.
</P>
<P>
In its first official response to strong Chinese reaction to
Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes' repeated anti-China
remarks in recent days, an Indian External Affairs Ministry
spokesman in a written statement issued here later Wednesday
evening said India would continue the process of normalizing ties
with China and develop a friendly, cooperative and mutually
beneficial relationship with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes in his lecture here on May 3 called China "India's
potential threat number one." A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
on May 5 dismissed his anti-China remarks as "groundless" and
"ridiculous and not worthy of refutation."
</P>
<P>
The Indian spokesman said eliminating differences and promoting
understanding would contribute to the development of
good-neighborly relations between India and China, two of the
world's largest and most populous countries, and would also
contribute to the promotion of regional and international peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
In recent years there has been steady improvement in Indo-China
relations with both sides agreeing to build a constructive and
cooperative relationship oriented toward the 21st century, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the five principles of peaceful coexistence,
jointly enunciated by India and China, are of continuing relevance
to the development of inter-state relations," he said. "We see our
relationship as one in which the two sides would be responsive to
each other's concerns."

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, U.S. Sign Accord on Nuclear Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and the United States signed an
agreement on cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the U.S. government will provide Ukraine
with about 30 million U.S. dollars to help the country modernize
its nuclear fuels sector.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris
Tarasyuk and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Stephen Pifer.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk told the press after the signing ceremony that the
agreement had laid a foundation for furthering the strategic
partnership between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the signing of the agreement marked the start of
preparations for the country's independent manufacturing of
nuclear fuels.
</P>
<P>
It was also an important step on the way to a smooth shutdown
of the Chernobyl nuclear power station, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the agreement's importance in ensuring nuclear
security, Ambassador Pifer said U.S. technology would help Ukraine
better use its nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. companies, he said, were interested in joining
efforts to build two power generating units for the Rovno and
Khmelnicky nuclear stations as future replacements to the
Chernobyl station.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was initialed by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on her March 6 visit to Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Will Continue to Push Japan for Economic Solutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States will continue
to encourage Japan to make a greater effort to resolve its economic
problems in order to enhance global economic growth, a Clinton
administration official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told a press briefing that
he expected Japan's problems to be a central part of the economic
discussions at meetings of finance officials this weekend in
London and next week when U.S. President Bill Clinton and leaders
of major industrial countries gather for their annual economic
summit.
</P>
<P>
"Among industrialized nations, the focus will be on Japan more
than anything else," he said commenting on upcoming meetings of
the G-7, which groups the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Britain,
Canada and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Finance and foreign ministers of G-7 nations will meet Friday
in London and will be joined on Saturday by officials from Russia
as they prepare the agenda for the May 15-17 economic summit in
Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier this week, President Clinton said he
would meet with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
wanted "an extended period" with him to review economic concerns.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration is worried that Japan is slipping into
a recession and if it does not act more forcefully the weakness in
the world's second-largest economy could stir up the Asian
financial crisis and threaten other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government last month released details of a 127
billion U.S. dollar package designed to use temporary tax cuts and
increased spending on public works projects to jump-start the
country's weakened economy.
</P>
<P>
But the administration has repeatedly warned that the stimulus
package is not enough unless it is accompanied by major reforms of
Japan's ailing banking system and further moves to deregulate the
economy with an aim toward lowering trade barriers that keep U.S.
and other foreign goods out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Rubin indicated that finance ministers and central bank
governors had an extended discussion of Japan's problems last
month in Washington during the spring meetings of the
International Monetary Fund; the London meeting will be a review
of developments since then.
</P>
<P>
He said the upcoming meetings were designed to prepare the
agenda for Clinton and the other heads of state for talks on the
global economy, the Asian crisis and other issues, such as the
progress being made by 11 European nations toward implementing a
single currency and the economic development in Africa, one of
Clinton's global priorities.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia not to Compromise on Copper Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- It seems that Zambia will not
compromise in the foreseeable future on the privatization of its
copper mines as Mines Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye has
slammed any actions against his government's will.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Kitwe, capital of Zambia's Copperbelt Province
Tuesday, he said the Zambian government condemned ultimatums and
veiled threats being issued by local and international forces
over the privatization of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
The minister described the actions as "unhelpful" to a quick
conclusion of the sale of the remaining ZCCM mines.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process is in danger of being hijacked by
foreigners who will dictate which mines to privatize, when, to
whom and for how much, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mines minister said that Zambia is being subjected to
unacceptable arm twisting methods, bribery and blackmail over the
sale of Nchanga and Nkana mines, two biggest divisions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia discontinued the negotiations last month with Kafue
Consortium on the sale of Nchanga and Nkana mines, which make up
65 percent of the ZCCM assets.
</P>
<P>
Due to falling copper prices in the international market,
Falconbridge Mining Company of Canada pulled out of the project
of Konkola Mine in March this year and two months earlier,
another Canadian firm withdrew its bid for Chambishi mine just
before signing the sale transaction agreements, citing the same
reason.
</P>
<P>
Kafue Consortium also called for renegotiations over the price
of the two biggest mines just before enterning into a final
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The consortium had reportedly agreed to buy the mines at 400
million U.S. Dollars but later pegged its bid price at 250
million Dollars and this was turned down by Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), which has 10
percent share-holding in the Kafue Consortium claimed that the
main reason for the failure of the negotiations was because the
Zambian government was more concerned with the purchase price
than long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
CDC Chief Executive Roy Reynold said both the government and
the ZCCM did not appreciate the long-term investment of one
billion U.S. Dollars the consortium was willing to pump in to
revitalize the two mines.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba declared that Nchanga and
Nkana will not be sold off at give-away prices.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's negotiating team leader Francis Kaunda attributed the
collapse to "bad faith and dictatorial terms" by Kafue
Consortium.
</P>
<P>
He charged that initially the consortium had agreed to assume
35 million of ZCCM's 75 million Dollar debt stock upon
acquisition of the mines but it later back-tracked.
</P>
<P>
Besides reducing its cash offer, the Kafue Consortium included
other mining assets as part of the package, Kaunda said.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded a seven-year 100 percent exemption on mineral
royalties as well as a five-year exemption for excise duty and
import duty on fuels.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the lower copper prices could be one of the
main concerns to investors in the mining sector.
</P>
<P>
Another reason could be ZCCM's 800 million Dollars debt.
</P>
<P>
The Kafue Consortium, which comprises Avmin (South Africa),
Noranda (Canada), Phelps Dodge (USA) and the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (UK), won the bid for the two mines in
1997 after the Zambian government went through a protracted
process to pick the best buyer of the two divisions.
</P>
<P>
The Mine-workers Union of Zambia (MUZ) said failure of the
negotiations will delay the envisaged economic boom on the
Copperbelt.
</P>
<P>
"We are very disappointed because we hoped the earlier
privatization of the two divisions will result in the economy
picking up especially on the Copperbelt," said MUZ President Paul
Kafumbe.
</P>
<P>
Many businesses on the Copperbelt depend on the mines and the
failure of the talks meant that the economic environment will not
improve soon.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the talks have also thrown into disarray the
union's plans to negotiate improved working conditions with the
new owners.
</P>
<P>
Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ) Chairman Moses Banda
said that the bundling of the ZCCM assets in packages exposes the
country to the whims of the bidders, who form consortiums
reducing Zambia's bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
Because of copper price falls and outdated equipment, lack of
investment and mismanagement, annual copper output of the country
has decreased gradually to about 300,000 tons in recent years
from its peak 750,000 tons in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investment, advanced technology and
management to revive the stagnating copper production, the
government has invited foreign tenders for the ZCCM mines and
assets.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Governor Outlines Reform Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's newly-appointed central
bank Governor Chatumongol Sonakul has committed himself to
reducing foreign debts and easing the cash squeeze for exporters.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol hinted that interest rates would remain high as
they are the best defense against national debts and liquidity
crisis, the Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's foreign debts currently stand at 90 billion U.S.
dollars, said Chatumongol, who was appointed the central bank
governor on Wednesday to replace Chaiyawat Wilbulswasdi.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat was blamed for being incompetent in handling the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said that if the baht remains at the current level
of around 38 to the dollar, there will be less pressure on the
central bank to increase interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He said he is committed to reforming the central bank but would
not change the short-term policies.
</P>
<P>
One of the tasks, he said, is to reduce speculative short-term
capital inflow and encourage productive long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the capital outflows stem from interest payments on
financial institutions' revolving credit and foreign speculative
investment. The figure had reached 4 billion U.S. dollars," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Excessive consumption, especially of imports, has to be reduced
as higher inflation is expected in the next few months, making it
difficult for the central bank to lower interest rates,
Chatumongol said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the government's role in the reform of the bank,
Chatumongol said his close ties with the government does not mean
that there would be political meddling in his work.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Changes Capital's Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev signed a document Wednesday changing the name of the
country's capital Akmola to Astana, the natonal television
reported.
</P>
<P>
The president said the decision was made with wishes from
different social circles and at the request of executive and
representative organs in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The name of a national capital's name should project a positive
image and meaning, he said, but Akmola means "white tomb" in
Kazakh, and some news media have been defining the city in this
way, and that creates a very negative image, he added.
</P>
<P>
The new name, Astana, means "capital" in Kazakh, the president
said, adding that the state of Akmola will retain its original
name.
</P>
<P>
Astana, 1,300 kilometers north of the former capital Alma Ata,
covers 200 square kilometers with a population of 300,000. It
became the new capital on December 10, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Preparations for US-China Summit in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for the U.S.-China
summit are now in full swing as both sides are planning closer
cooperation in various fields, a senior U.S. official said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade David Aaron
said in a luncheon briefing sponsored by Asia Society that "Many
quarters of the Administration are forging ahead with what will be
important contributions to the summit and future relations
overall."
</P>
<P>
He made the speech following a visit last month to China where
he discussed the trade issues with Chinese officials, preparing the
ground for President Bill Clinton's trip to the People's Republic
in late June.
</P>
<P>
The strategic summit, the second of its kind in less than a
year, will further push forward the overall relationship between
the United States and China, David believed.
</P>
<P>
"We at Commerce are actively mapping out a blueprint to advance
commercial engagement," he said, figuring out project finance,
standards,testing and certification, commercial law and other
areas for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We also are working on broader aviation, housing,
infrastructure, and insurance initiatives, all of which have
important implications for the summit," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Beijing and Shanghai, David witnessed nearly
200 million U.S. dollars in signings, including more than 170
million dollars in contracts for U.S. power generation,
information technologies, and air conditioning equipment, and more
than 25 million dollars in investments for a U.S-Shanghai based
food venture.
</P>
<P>
"China's leaders are determined to achieve better relations
with the United States and a positive summit," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged China to further open its market to U.S. products and
services so as to narrow the huge trade imbalance between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that we are making progress. However, we need to
do more on matters dealing with industrial and agricultural
tariffs, distribution, professional, financial, and
telecommunications services," he said.
</P>
<P>
David disclosed that several dozen meetings are scheduled to be
held between the two countries over the next year in continued
effort to bridge differences and further cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshevsky also visited China last month in
preparation for President Clinton's China trip. Among other
issues, China's access to the World Trade Organization (WTO) was
high in their talks with Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
They both recognized that progress has been made by China on
the matter, but they insisted there is still a long way to go
toward China's full WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing, Speaking Wednesday at
an international trade conference here, said that after 11 years
of economic reform and efforts to gain access to the WTO,
including five time reduction of tariff, "China really has already
lived up to the conditions for entering that world trading body."
</P>
<P>
"We can only join ( WTO) as what we are, that is, as a developing
member of the international community. And of course, once inside,
we'll perform our obligations," Ambassador Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that China is ready to buy more things from the
U.S. in order to narrow the trade deficit between the two
countries. "However, we also hope that your country will further
relax its export controls so that we can buy some of your more
expensive things," he replied to an American participant.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed sanctions against China in 1989. Its
high-tech exports to China have since been strictly restricted.

<HEADLINE> Italy, U.S. Open on Military Option for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton and visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on
Wednesday the use of troops was an option to prevent ethnic war in
the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference following their meeting,
Clinton said he was ready to turn up pressure on Yugoslavia if it
continued to block a search for a peaceful solution to rising
violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can rule out any options, because we don't
want another Bosnia to happen," Clinton said when asked about the
possibility of sending troops to the region.
</P>
<P>
"Neither, however, do we want to get in a position where Italy
has to send troops to every one of its neighboring countries and
the United States has to send troops every time there's a dispute
in that part of the world," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said solving the problem would require finding a way to
grant the "legitimate aspirations" of ethnic-Albanian Kosovo
residents for more autonomy while honoring Serbian desires not to
give up a big part of their country.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said he agreed with Clinton. "We didn't rule out any
solution. We are just making an effort to arrive at a peaceful
solution," said the Italian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said troops conceivably could be used to guard against
cross-border arms smuggling. "Even this option is dangerous,
because in some ways, whenever you send troops, you send...
potential hostages to the situation."
</P>
<P>
He said he and Clinton had also discussed the possibility of
recovery assistance for civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Also at the press conference, the two leaders expressed their
satisfaction with the Italy-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"For more than 50 years, Italy has been among our closest
allies," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"As we celebrate all the ties that bind us, we are looking
ahead to the next 50 years, to an even stronger and more vibrant
partnership, which will shape a brighter future for all our
people," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his regrets about the the Marine jet accident that
killed 20 skiers in the Italian Alps in February.
</P>
<P>
Fighting back tears in his eyes, Clinton responded to a
question, "I regret terribly what happened, and I cannot bring
back the people who perished."
</P>
<P>
"But I will do my best to make sure that we behave in a
completely honorable way and a way that is completely consistent
with the commitments we have made."
</P>
<P>
Prodi referred to relations as being in a "magic moment". He
said: "We have no points of disagreements.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is only to build up strong relations and to bring
them into the future in a moment that is very favorable to that,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Prodi commended Clinton over the economic situation in the
U.S., saying it was very rare to see eight years of continuous
growth without inflation, but with decreasing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"And I think the Euro may give us the same possibility for
Europe," he noted.

<P>
Both Clinton and Prodi agreed that new negotiations should be
launched for a broader and stronger partnership between Europe and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Europe needs a new set of relations between Europe and the
United States, because these new events need a new organization of
our relations. So I'm very favorable to the proposal of a
trans-Atlantic new set of economic and political relations," Prodi
affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "What I want is a strong, united Europe that is
our partner in dealing with the challenges and in seizing the
opportunities to the 21st century world."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Clinton noted that U.S. personnel from the
Aviano air base were assisting in rescue efforts after this week's
storms in southern Italy and expressed thanks to Italians for
their "hospitality toward United States forces working to preserve
peace in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"That was only the beginning of a relationship that has now
flourished for centuries bringing us together in new ways
generation after generation," Clinton said at a welcoming ceremony
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
In his own remarks, from a reviewing stand on the South Lawn,
Prodi called their two nations "two citizens of the next
millennium bound by common values".
</P>
<P>
Prodi said he wanted to pursue a "vast sphere of free trade"
between the U.S. and Europe "not only to best utilize our energy
and to strengthen as much as possible our political and economic
ties but also as a common contribution to the global trade
liberalization."

<HEADLINE> NASA Scientists Record Largest Explosion in Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Astronomers from NASA said
Wednesday that they have recorded the largest explosion, called
a GRB971214 gamma-ray burst, in the universe.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the NASA headquarters here,
astronomers from several teams said GRB971214 gamma-ray burst may
be the largest energy release since the ``Big Bang'' which caused
the birth of our universe, hurling out more than 100 times the
energy the sun will emit during its entire 10-billion-year
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, located about 12 billion light years away in the
constellation Ursa Major, has two particular features. One is its
huge energy, and the other is its long distance. Therefore the
finding is a great accomplishment in astronomy.
</P>
<P>
The Gamma ray bursts were first detected on December 14, 1997,
by the Italian and Dutch BeppoSAX satellite and NASA's Compton
Gamma Ray Observatory satellite.
</P>
<P>
Gamma-ray bursts are mysterious flashes of high-energy
radiation that appear from random directions in space and
typically last a few seconds. They were first discovered by U.S.
Air Force Vela satellites in the 1960s.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Reforest in East Kalimantan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government should
allocate at least 850 billion rupiah (106 million U.S. dollars) to
rehabilitate the 500,000 hectares of forest ravaged by fires in
East Kalimantan in the last three months, a forestry official
said.
</P>
<P>
"We need about 1.6 million to 2.2 million rupiah to
rehabilitate every hectare of the burned forest," Director General
of Supervision at the Forest and Plantation Ministry Oesman Yoesep
said Wednesday in the East Kalimantan capital of Samarinda,
according to reports reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yoesep said it will take dozens of years to rehabilitate the
burned forest, following the fires which have caused economic
losses of 9.371 trillion rupiah (1.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Yoesep, of the 500,000 hectares of razed area,
some 306,000 hectares are located on forest concession holders'
land.
</P>
<P>
He said the local forestry office has been providing 29.9
billion rupiah for labor-intensive projects involving forest
rehabilitation, forest society development and agro-forestry
intensification.

<HEADLINE> Expert Predicts Decline in Venezuela's Oil Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's oil revenue this year
will drop by some 3 billion U.S. dollars when the crude price
averages between 13-13.5 dollars per barrel, a Venezuelan expert
predicted.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the "El Globo" journal, analyst Felix
Rossi Guerrero said he did not believe the oil price would soar up
to 15 dollars per barrel soon.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of oil prices in the international market would be
possible only if both members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) and independent oil producers agreed to
reduce their production by 500,000 barrels per day, Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
Crude prices fell by 40 percent from October to mid-March as a
result of weak demand in cash-strapped Asian countries, a
10-percent rise in OPEC's 1998 production ceiling, a mild northern
hemisphere winter and increased Iraqi exports.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement in March
to reduce their production by 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day
respectively to cope with the outbreak of an oil pricing crisis.
</P>
<P>
In March, Venezuela saw its crude basket go down to almost 10
dollars per barrel and now it has recovered to around 12 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Noting that certain stability and a slight price recovery will
be observed in the coming months, Guerrero added that the prices
would stay around 13 dollars per barrel, compared with 16.32
dollars during the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army Deserters Hired by Security Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Defense Ministry which
is attempting to get back some 19,000 army deserters through a
five-day amnesty ending May 10, has discovered that most of them
have been employed by security firms.
</P>
<P>
These private institutions have been warned not to recruit the
deserters but to hand them over to the nearest police station, the
official newspaper News Daily quoted military sources as saying
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's law, which the government hopes to strictly
enforce after the amnesty deadline, harboring a deserter, abetting
such desertion and employing deserters are punishable offenses.
</P>
<P>
In addition to private security firms, police believe, night
clubs and casinos also hire army deserters as strongarm men.
</P>
<P>
The government Monday declared a general amnesty period from
May 5 to 10 to give military deserters an opportunity to rejoin
the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that soon after the amnesty deadline raids will
be conducted on places where deserters are believed to be
employed and that the employers will also be arrested together
with the deserters.
</P>
<P>
Deserters who surrender before the deadline will not be
punished under the amnesty.

</P>
<P>
Armed ethnic Albanians ambushed a police patrol car in

<HEADLINE> Conference Stresses Importance of Girls' Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- About 500 leaders and experts from
28 countries representing governments, civil societies, businesses,
religions and the media gathered here on Wednesday to stress the
urgent need to improve education for girls throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
"Two of three children who do not finish primary school are
girls, despite the direct benefit of girls' education to economies
and family health," said a conference news release entitled
"Education of girls is a development imperative."
</P>
<P>
According to a 1997 Human Development Report of the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), there are about 110 million
children in the primary school-going group and another 275 million
children at secondary school level who are out of school in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
A 1998 UNDP report noted that almost one billion adults
worldwide are not literate and more than half of them are women.
</P>
<P>
Three out of every five of the 400 million illiterates in South
Asia are women and almost half of adult women in Africa are
illiterate. In India, three in every five girls drop out of school
before they finish the primary school course.
</P>
<P>
In Sub-Sahara Africa and in West Asia the gender gap in primary
school enrollment is worst. In Benin, there are 36 percent less
girls enrolling in primary school than boys; in Yemen, 34 percent;
in Chad, 28 percent and in Guinea-Bissau 26 percent. On average,
sub-Saharan primary schools see only 68 girls enrolling for every
100 boys.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is sponsored by the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID), the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) and the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) as well as other organizations in the effort to mobilize
leaders from public, private and nonprofit sectors to advance
girls' education.
</P>
<P>
A USAID administrator, Brian Atwood, stressed the importance
for girls' education to economic development. "If countries want
to achieve economic and social development, no investment has a
higher pay-off than educating girls.
</P>
<P>
"Educating girls contributes to economic growth, leads to
better cared-for families and to stronger democracies."
</P>
<P>
Enrique Iglesias, President of IDB, said: "The education of
girls is a key factor for improving social equity and reducing
poverty."
</P>
<P>
And UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said education for
girls was the key to health and nutrition of populations, to
overall improvements in the standards of living, to better culture
and to greater involvement and gender balance in decision-making
at all levels of society.

PANAMA CITY, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from eight Latin
American countries and Spain gathered in a forum here Wednesday to
seek ways to develop Latin-American cultures.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Education Minister Pablo Thalassinos inaugurated the
second Congress of National Culture and Identity Construction in
Latin America. The forum was attended by delegates from Bolivia,
Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Panama and Spain.
</P>
<P>
"This congress aims to join reflections and alternatives of
state-nation issues as well as those of identity categories and
national culture," Thalassinos said.
</P>
<P>
He called for more active participation in efforts to build
democratic and efficient states that promote inter-cultural
dialogue among various communities and ethnic groups in the region.
</P>
<P>
The delegates will discuss ways to promote national cultures as
argumentative expressions of the work and aspirations of
indigenous peoples, Afro-Americans, caucasians and mestizos
living in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
They will also analyze new examples of national cultures and
identities in the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
The first culture congress, held in Quito, capital of Ecuador,
in July 1997, established the base for new dialogue on culture,
development and integration in Latin America, organizers said.

The Panama meeting is expected to build an instrumental
framework for dialogue between official and non-governmental
institutions on the construction of a Latin-American identity,

BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai drivers may have "smart"
driving licenses in the near future which will help them register
vehicles and enforce traffic regulations.
</P>
<P>
The new driving license with a "smart card" feature will give
police quick access to the holder's record of traffic violations
using information stored in microchips in the card, the Transport
and Communication Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The license, with the size of a bank ATM card, would also
benefit holders by helping them bypass lengthy paperwork
procedures when they register their vehicles at motor vehicle
offices or pay fines.
</P>
<P>
An official in the ministry was quoted by the newspaper Bangkok
Post Thursday as saying the use of smart licenses would upgrade
Thailand's vehicle registration system to Western standards.
</P>
<P>
It would also help solve the problem of driving license
forgery, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Land Transportation Department, which is in charge of
issuing the new license, would allow private companies to produce
the cards through concession in return for fees to be collected
from holders at a certain rate.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Store For Foreigners Now Open To All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Friendship Store on the eastern
edge of Beijing's downtown area used to be open only to
foreigners, but it's been refurbished and is open to everyone now.
</P>
<P>
The store was set up in the 1960s when there was a serious
shortage of certain goods in China, to make life more convenient
for foreigners who were working here. As recently as the late 80s,
guards at the front door of the three-story Soviet-style building
would ask to see the foreign passport of anyone wanting to enter
who appeared to be Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In the past, foreigners paid for goods that were in short
supply by using foreign currency certificates, known
as 'FEC'. Their face value was the same as the renminbi (RMB), but
they sold for 30 to 80 percent more on the black market, and could
then be used by Chinese to buy some hard-to-get goods.
</P>
<P>
The store was quite prominent in those days because many VIPs
like presidents and premiers had visited it. And the average
foreign tourist, guidebook in hand, would find his or her way to
the store to buy essentials that the ordinary Chinese could not
afford.
</P>
<P>
But, with the reforms and opening-up and the economic boom,
China said good-by to the shortage of goods -- and to this system
of privilege. Foreigners in Beijing now do their shopping in any
store they choose, and at the same time, Chinese can easily buy
many goods almost anywhere that could previously only be bought by
foreigners in the old Friendship Store.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the store was merged with Xidan Market, one of
Beijing's biggest general department stores, and was closed
recently for redecoration. It opened for business 6 days ago.
</P>
<P>
You can see the change when the store's spokesman, Li Xiujun,
says, "What we should do is to change the store's image in an
all-round way, and we have to make more adjustments and respond to
the market economy."

<HEADLINE> Drive Against Drugs in China Gets Off to Good Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's anti-drug campaign has got
off to a very good start this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Chinese police cracked 22,000
drug-related cases, 6 percent up from the same period of
1997, today's China Daily quoted Yang Fengrui, vice director of
the Office of the National Narcotics Control Commission, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
About 28,000 people involved in these cases were caught, 7.6
percent up compared with the same period of last year, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months, police confiscated 1.6 tons of
heroin, 58.6 percent up, and 0.31 tons of opium, 98.7 percent up.
</P>
<P>
They also confiscated 0.5 tons of marijuana, 17.9 kilograms of
amphetamines and 43.2 tons of chemicals which can easily be used
to manufacture drugs, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
Yang warned that China's fight against drugs still faces an
uphill task.
</P>
<P>
The "Golden Triangle" area bordering southwest China's Yunnan
Province, where annual production of opium has reached 2,500 tons,
causes a great deal of harm to China, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, China had 540,000 registed drug addicts by
the end of 1997, more than 80 percent of whom are young
people. Drug abuse has spread to 1,920 Chinese cities and
counties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Education is urgently needed on the harm caused by drugs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A special nationwide anti-drug campaign launched last year
achieved the best results in the drug control in recent years, Yang
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 drug rings were smashed and 9,963 people taken
into custody. Both figures were 70 percent up on 1996,
according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
Police confiscated a record 5.477 tons of heroin last year.
</P>
<P>
Over 180,000 addicts received forced treatment in compulsory
rehabilitation centers last year, 50,000 more than in 1996, Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
He said, the Chinese government attaches great importance to
drug control and is determined to step up efforts to fight drugs.

BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The value in baht of Thailand's rice
exports during the first four months this year soared by 243.5
percent to 33.6 billion baht, according to figures released by the
Foreign Trade Department of the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the first four months of last year, the dollar
value of the shipments rose by 26.7 percent to 750 million U.S.
dollars, based on the average exchange rate of 44.8 baht for the
dollar for the period.
</P>
<P>
Pracha Charutrakulchai, director-general of the department, was
quoted Thursday by The Bangkok Post as saying export prospects are
good for the rest of the year because of high demand in several
markets, notably Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Bangladesh
and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will need to import as much as 5 million tons of rice
to cope with shortages this year.
</P>
<P>
"Thai rice exports are expected to increase steadily to between
400,000 and 500,000 tons a month in line with heavy world market
demand, including from countries in Africa and the Middle East,"

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in NZ Reaches Four-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in New
Zealand reached 7.1 percent in the first quarter this year, the
highest level in almost four years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics New Zealand said in a media release received on
Thursday that the total jobless figure is estimated at 129,000 at
the end of March, up 7,000 on the previous quarter and 13,000 more
 than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Employment Minister Peter McCardle blamed the rise on the Asian
 financial crisis and the drought in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"The widely forecast strengthening of economic and related
employment growth has been delayed," he noted.
</P>
<P>
But he believed that the impending tax cuts, the lower New
Zealand dollar, the expected easing of interest rates and some
other factors should facilitate strong economic growth later this
year.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that New Zealand's unemployment rate is below
the average of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development countries.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists have predicted that unemployment could
 peak at 8 percent by the middle of next year.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Finds New Gasfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The eastern part of New Zealand's

North Island could become the country's another major gasfield as
a
test well there has shown "commercial success," the Wellington
newspaper The Dominion reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Enerco company has drilled its first test well, which
produced 325,000 cubic meters of gas a day. But it believed that
the
potential could reach 2 million cubic meters a day.
</P>
<P>
Enerco is now drilling the second well, which the company said
is
showing signs of being at least as good as the first one.
</P>
<P>
After the output is ascertained, Enerco will invest 60 million
dollars (33 million U.S. dollars) to build a pipeline linking the

field near the town of Wairoa, 450 km north of Wellington, to
Napier,
118 km south of Wairoa. The gas will supply the Hawke's Bay
region.
</P>
<P>
The Wairoa will be the second largest gasfield in New Zealand
after Taranaki in eastern North Island.

<HEADLINE> 25 Killed by Landslides in Southern Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 people were killed and more
than 70 others were feared buried alive Wednesday when torrents of
mud and debris roared through densely populated areas in southern
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Two days of incessant rain caused local streams to burst with a
ferocious intensity, unleashing mud, debris and water that
engulfed hundreds of homes in the affected areas, the Italian news
media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Competent authorities have called out military helicopters,
thousands of fire-fighters, soldiers and emergency workers to the
affected areas to search for survivors.
</P>
<P>
The Government has declared a state of emergency, promising 29
million U.S. dollars in immediate aid to the victims.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano rushed to the
affected areas later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports quoted the Italian civil protection agency
as saying that at 1,800 people were left homeless throughout the
affected areas ranging between Naples and Salerno.
</P>
<P>
Mud and debris have also covered railroad tracks and roads,
bringing the distribution of relief supplies to a standstill.
Power and telephone lines were cut off in many parts of the
affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rain in the affected areas stopped by mid-day
Wednesday and meteorologists said the weather would continue to
improve.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Italy's civil protection agency, Andrea Todisco, told
the local media that many homes in the affected areas had been
illegally built too close to rivers or in areas prone to
landslides. As a result, the damage was aggravated, he said.

<HEADLINE> Polls Urged to Be Deferred in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Commission on Elections has been
urged to suspend elections in most parts of Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, because of "massive anomalies" in voter registration,
the Philippine Star Thursday reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region
in Muslim Mindanao and chairman of the Southern Philippines
Council for Peace and Development, Wednesday visited the poll body
in Manila to persuade it to postpone the polls in certain areas in
Mindanao "until anomalies in the registration lists are
corrected."
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the results of the coming elections will not reflect
the real voice of the people," Misuari said, denouncing reported
massive padding of voters' lists.
</P>
<P>
"The registration really needs to be rehashed after this
election. Where else can you see registered names belonging to
newborn babies, every child in the family, maybe even the dogs and
chickens?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Misuari's call came on the heels of a warning from the
Commission on Elections that there could be a failure of elections
in Mindanao. He did not identify the areas in Mindanao where there
are padded voters' lists being probed by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believed that mudslinging, cheating, fraud and
violence will occur in next week's elections, especially in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Misuari is the chief of the Moro National Liberation Front
which signed a final peace agreement with the government in 1996
after 24 years of war.

<HEADLINE> Former East German Swimmer Says She was Doped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A former East German swimmer told a
court on Wednesday she had been given performance-enhancing drugs
from the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
Birgit-Heike Matz said she was ordered to take "little blue
pills", which according to the prosecutors' charges contained the
banned steroid oral-turinabol.
</P>
<P>
From 1973 to 1978, Matz was in the training group of Rolf
Glaeser -- one of six officials on trial for allegedly causing
bodily harm to female swimmers by giving them drugs.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 until the end of her career in 1979, Matz, whose best
result was a third place in the European junior championships,
trained under the orders of another of the officials on trial,
Dieter Krause.
</P>
<P>
The six on trial -- four swimming coaches and two doctors --
are accused of giving 19 female swimmers steroids between 1975 and
1989.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, coaches Glaeser, Krause, Volker Frischke, Dieter
Lindemann and doctors Dieter Binus and Bernd Pansold, could face
several years in jail.
</P>
<P>
The trial, the first to put East Germany's doping policy under
examination, is scheduled to last until at least in July.

<HEADLINE> Henan Develops High-Efficiency Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Scores of high-efficiency
agricultural bases with a total area of 66,000 ha have been
established in Henan Province, central China.
</P>
<P>
At the bases, farmers have interplanted crops with
vegetables. The fields are covered with glass or plastic sheets.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the multiple crop index has increased from 174
percent to 250 percent.
</P>
<P>
In winter, farmers at the bases grow vegetables or fruit, which
could only be seen in summer or autumn before. They have also
imported quality vegetable species from the United States,
Israel and the Netherlands. The prices of these vegetables are a
dozen times higher than those for other species.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some service companies have been set up to collect
farm produce from individual growers and sell them in cities.
</P>
<P>
Provincial statistics show that 3,490 such companies had been
set up in Henan by the end of last year, which have connections
with 8.24 million farm households, accounting for 30 percent of
the province's total.
</P>
<P>
In this way, farmers no long worry about how to transport and
sell their products.

<HEADLINE> American Children Recognize bias on TV: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 6 (Xinhua) -- American children think it is
important to see their own race on television -- and
African-American, Asian and Latino children are more likely to
think so, according to a latest study.
</P>
<P>
The study, released Wednesday by Children Now, a national
children's advocacy group based in Okland, California, raises
questions about how the media's portrayal of different ethnic
groups effects children perceptions of reality and of themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to the organization, the most powerful finding of the
research is how clearly and how early children see inequity in the
portrayal of races in the media. The study on media images of race
and class focuses on the opinions of 1,200 children across the
country who were polled and others who were invited to participate
in focus groups in four cities earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
There are very different viewing patterns among kids of
different races. Talk shows, for instance, fall into the
top-viewing category for African-American and Latino children, but
listed as the least likely to be watched by white and Asian
children.
</P>
<P>
African-American children strongly feel that the entertainment
media represents their race more fairly than the news media, while
Asian children feel the opposite, slightly favoring the news media
with 36 percent to 28 percent. White and Latino children were
split between the two.
</P>
<P>
Minority children primarily chose African-Americans as those
they admire on TV and white children primarily chose white
television figures as their favorite. "Because they are funny" was
the primary reason for admiring the figures.
</P>
<P>
A 1995 survey also conducted by Children Now found that
American children were widely exposed to the media. Fifty-eight of
children watch two or more hours of television a day. Sixty-six of
them live in a household with three or more television sets and 54
percent have a TV set in their own room. According to that survey,
most children believe that kids their age are influenced by the
entertainment media. Although 73 percent of kids think television
is mostly entertainment, 82 percent say television shows should
help teach kids right from wrong.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province did 692
million US dollars-worth of foreign trade during the first quarter
of this year, a 2.9 percent rise compared to last year's same
period.
</P>
<P>
The amount included 413 million US dollars-worth of exports,
down 8.7 percent from the the same period of last year, due to the
influence of the ongoing Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In order to rein in the export slump, the province has been
restructuring its export mix by increasing exports to the EU, Russia,
Eastern Europe and Latin America, as well as by increasing its
exports of hi-tech and high-value-added products.
</P>
<P>
The province has 170 trading partners worldwide. One third of
its exports, most of which are primary products, are shipped to
Japan, the Republic of Korea and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, exports of machinery and
electronic products rose six percent over the same period of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Canada Asks U.S. to Refer Water Export to Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada asked the United States
Wednesday to agree to refer the issue of Great Lakes water export
to the International Joint Commission (IJC).
</P>
<P>
The referral of the issue to the commission was prompted by a
permit, granted to a Canadian company by the Ontario provincial
environment ministry, for the annual export of 600 million litres
of Lake Superior water to Asia until 2002.
</P>
<P>
Canada and the United State share the world's largest fresh
waterlake of Superior. The permit has angered both
environmentalists of the two countries and U.S. government
officials.
</P>
<P>
One U.S. Congressman in Michigan was reported to have asked
</P>
<P>
the U.S. State Department to investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
"I have written Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asking
that she agree to bring this issue to the IJC," Canadian Foreign
Affair Minister Lloyd Axworthy was quoted as saying by a
government news release.
</P>
<P>
The IJC is an independent binational organization set up under
the Canada-U.S. Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. Its central role
is to prevent and resolve disputes and to examine issues
concerning waters that cross or lie on the border.
</P>
<P>
The company that made a splash with lake water export plans has
said that it is willing to surrender the permit.

NEW YORK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street fell
Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 92.92

</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators also surrendered early gains amid some
indications that the Asian financial crisis is far from resolved.

In Indonesia, stocks tumbled 4.7 percent amid a third day.
Elsewhere in the region, stocks fell 2.3 percent in Tokyo and 3.9
percent in South Korea.

U.S. shares opened higher, however, amid news that Daimler-Benz
might acquire Chrysler in a deal that could be worth 35 billion
U.S. dollars. Share prices of both companies soared on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The advance in the broad market quickly faded, however, as
investors refocused on the rate increase issue.
</P>
<P>
There was little reaction to a Federal Reserve report saying
economic growth continued at a "moderate to strong" pace in March
and April.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 10.75 to 1,104.90. The

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Accuses Clinton of Pressuring Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- House Speaker Newt Gingrich
Wednesday accused the Clinton administration of pressuring Israel
on peace terms with "threats and ultimatums."
</P>
<P>
He said in a letter, to be sent to President Bill Clinton, that
Israel "should not be punished with threat and ultimatums."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has complained to
Israel's Army Radio that the United States was pressuring him into
agreeing to "certain conditions that are unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"I don't accept dictates. We're a sovereign country," he said.
"We must decide alone what is important for our future."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said earlier that he never wanted to dictate Israel to
accept terms set by Washington.
</P>
<P>
"There's no way in the world I could impose an agreement on
them or dictate... to them even if I wished to do that," he said
at a White House news conference.
</P>
<P>
But Gingrich said the Clinton administration was using
"strong-arm tactics" to force Israel to accept its proposals on
the redeployment of the Israeli troops on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said he was increasingly concerned that the Clinton policy
favored Palestinian positions at the expense of Israel's security
needs. He called on the administration to let the people of Israel,
not Washington, decide their fate.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe that genuine peace in Israel can only be
achieved through voluntary direct dialogue between the parties,
and not as a result of heavy-handed outside pressure by the United
States," he said. "Israel must be able to decide her own security
needs and set her own conditions for negotiations without facing
coercion from the U.S."

<HEADLINE> Italy, U.S. Try to Further Strengthen Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi Wednesday charted a
course to strengthen cooperation between their countries for
future.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Clinton and Prodi discussed issues
ranging from the European Monetary Union and the situation in
Kosovo to fighting against international crimes.
</P>
<P>
"For more than 50 years, Italy has been among our closest
allies," Clinton told a joint press conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"As we celebrate all the ties that bind us, we are looking
ahead to the next 50 years, to an even stronger and more vibrant
partnership, which will shape a brighter future for all our
people," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his regrets about the the Marine jet accident that
killed 20 skiers in the Italian Alps in February.
</P>
<P>
Prodi expressed his satisfaction at the Italy-U.S. relations.
"We have no points of disagreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is only to build up strong relations and to bring
them into the future in a moment that is very favorable to
that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prodi commended Clinton over the economic situation in the
U.S., saying "It's very rare to see eight years of continuous
growth without inflation, with decreasing unemployment."
</P>
<P>
Both Clinton and Prodi agreed that new negotiations should be
launched for a broader and stronger partnership between Europe
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Europe needs a new set of relations between Europe and the
United States, because these new events need a new organization
of our relations. So I'm very favorable to the proposal of a
trans-Atlantic new set of economic and political relations,"
Prodi affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "What I want is a strong, united Europe that is
our partner in dealing with the challenges and in seizing the
opportunities to the 21st century world."
</P>
<P>
Prodi said he wanted to pursue a "vast sphere of free trade"
between the U.S. and Europe "not only to best utilize our energy
and to strengthen as much as possible our political and economic
ties but also as a common contribution to the global trade
liberalization."
</P>
<P>
Prodi arrived here on Tuesday for his first official visit to
the U.S. as the prime minister of Italy.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Cuba does not pose threat any
longer to the United States or its neighbors, according to a new
Pentagon intelligence report issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the Defense Intelligence Agency in
cooperation with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other
intelligence branches, said Cuba's armed forces had been slashed
in half to fewer than 65,000 troops since 1989 when it was Latin
America's largest military force.
</P>
<P>
"Severe resource shortages have force the FAR (Cuban
Revolutionary Armed Forces) to reduce training significantly," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that significant numbers of Cuban troops were
now used in agricultural, business and other activities.
</P>
<P>
"At present, Cuba does not pose a significant military threat
to the U.S. or to other countries in the region. Cuba has little
motivation to engage in military activity beyond defense of its
territory and political system," it added.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that Cuba still had the capability to
make biological weapons, but finding no evidence that the
Caribbean Island had made such weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba's biotechnology industry is one of the most advanced in
emerging countries and would be capable of producing BW
(biological weapons) agents," the report said.

<HEADLINE> London, Paris Stocks End Slightly up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe ended
little changed Wednesday, with London and Paris slightly up while
Frankfurt moderately down.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index of leading shares finished the session
5.9 points or 0.10 percent higher at 5,992.4, as a combination of
uncertainty over the direction of global interest rates and
concerns over the health of Asian economies plagued the market.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believed sterling's recent pullback will give the
Bank of England leeway to push interest rates up at its latest
monetary policy meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hopes that news of merger talks between Daimler-Benz
and Chrysler would ignite a fresh rally on Wall Street came to
nothing.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended with small losses, down 2.23
points or 0.04 percent at 5,229.80 on the DAX-30 index, as strong
gains in Daimler-Benz cushioned the impact of negative factors.
</P>
<P>
Daimler soured after announcing it was in merger talks with
Chrysler Corp of the United States.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, the CAC-40 index closed at 3,947.45, up
2.54 points or 0.06 percent, as the market fell back from highs
following the Dow's retreating from its opening gains.

<HEADLINE> Auto Industry to Be Affected by Chrysler, Daimler Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The merger talks between Chrysler
Corp., the No. 3 auto maker of the United States, and Germany's
biggest industrial company, the maker of the Mercedes-Benz, will
reshape the auto industry, according to American auto experts.
</P>
<P>
The merger, if successful, will reportedly be the biggest U.S.
industrial merger ever.
</P>
<P>
Combining Daimler-Benz, the German luxury car maker, with the
pioneer of middle-class minivans would not only bring together
makers of two different classes of autos, but would also
significantly broaden the global reach of both companies, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler would get greater access to the European market, while
Daimler-Benz would gain a bigger foothold in the American market,
where it has been working to increase sales.
</P>
<P>
At present, the two automakers said that a deal is far from
certain.
</P>
<P>
Mercedes-Benz has increased U.S. sales 67 percent this year.
But the market share of the German automaker is just a little more
than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Chrysler sold only 17,713 vehicles outside North
America last month, more than half of that in Europe. Chrysler sold
nearly 221,000 vehicles in the United States last month.
</P>
<P>
Daimler's stock rose 6.50 U.S. dollars to 108.56 U.S. dollars
on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday. Chrysler surged 7.31
U.S. dollars to 48.75 U.S. dollars, giving the automaker a market
value of 31.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler has 94,300 employees and a 16 percent share of new
vehicle sales this year. Only General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co. sell more, with shares of 31 percent and 24 percent,
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Annan: UN Backs Mediation for Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
United Nations Kofi Annan said here Wednesday that the U.N.
supports the mediation by Tanzanian former president Julius
Nyerere over the Burundi crisis for national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the meeting between the U.N. chief and President
Benjamin Mkapa at the State House, a senior U.N. official
disclosed that Annan also discussed with Mkapa about other
important issues related to the Great Lakes region countries.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here on Wednesday afternoon from a visit to
the northern town of Arusha, is also deeply concerned about the
rapid inflow of the Rwanda refugees into Tanzania, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace talks were stalled last year after the
Burundian military junta led by Pierre Buyoya said it had no
faith in Nyerere, the international mediator in the Burundi
political conflict, who is an advocate of continuing to impose
economic sanctions on the central African nation.
</P>
<P>
East and central African nations, backed by the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), have imposed sanctions on Burundi since
August of 1996 after Major Buyoya toppled a civilian government
of President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in July of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In late March Nyerere sent his envoy Judge Mark Bomani to
Burundi for discussions with the warring parties before the
resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner after the talks at the State House,
President Mkapa expressed appreciation for Annan's recent report
to the U.N. Security Council which calls for more attention and
investment in the poorest continent of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is on his first official visit to Tanzania since he
came to office as the U.N. Secretary General, spoke highly of
Tanzania's role in the liberation of Southern Africa and in the
world affairs especially in its support to the U.N. affairs.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said Africa is at the turning point, with the
whole continent which has witnessed less conflicts and achieved
economic progress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He praised Tanzania's efforts in hosting hundreds of thousands
of refugees in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Tanzania owes a lot to the United Nations which has
lent great support to his country. He also said African countries
need to focus on the development of infrastructure, such as
telecommunications, railways and ports.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, for example, out of 1,000 people only three has
telephones, a density much lower than countries in other
continents.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Secretary General met foreign diplomats and the
U.N. staff in Dar es Salaam, urging them to contribute more to
the U.N. process.
</P>
<P>
Annan is scheduled to conclude his two-day visit to Tanzania
Thursday morning before leaving for Bujumbura, Burundi in central
Africa.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Arusha Tuesday, Annan was encouraged by
the progress made by the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda (ICTR), saying that the Tribunal has effected major
improvements in its operations and is moving ahead to fulfill its
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Annan's remarks were apparently to clear the air over mounting
criticism on the inefficiency of the ICTR in executing cases.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal opened its first trial only in January last year,
more than two years after its establishment in November, 1994
under a resolution by the U.N. Security Council. But only two
cases are approaching its final till now.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the former prime minister of Rwanda, Jean Kambanda,
pleaded guilty to all six charges of genocide while the first
accused, Paul Akayesu, is awaiting for judgement expected to be
delivered before the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived from Nairobi, Kenya, toured the ICTR
premises and attended a court session before departing for a game
view in the well-known Ngorongoro Crater National Park with his
wife Nane. He jokingly said he was received by elephants and a
rhinoceros of extraordinary size.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves 36 Million Dollars Loan for Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank announced here Wednesday the approval of a 36 million U.S.
dollar soft loan to Honduras to help improve the health system.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes Washington Meeting to Revive Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The State Department said
Wednesday that the United States hoped Israel and the Palestinians
could agree on terms for reviving the stalled Middle East peace
process when they hold talks in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that the parties will be able to come to
agreement on the basis of the U.S. ideas which would permit the
launching of permanent status negotiations," spokesman James Foley
said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has invited Israeli and Palestinian
leaders to Washington next week for more talks following London
meetings early this week on a final peace accord if Israel accepts
U.S. proposals on a further 13.1 percent of pullback from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House said the talks on the Middle East
peace process were at a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
"We're at a very critical moment where the parties have to make
a critical decision on how they want to proceed," White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the United States was trying to dictate terms to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who complained earlier
to Israel's Army Radio that he was ready to go to Washington but
did not want to be pressured into agreeing to "certain conditions
that are unacceptable" to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the prospects for the Washington talks, McCurry
said, "I think it's unknown at this point."
</P>
<P>
He said it was conceivable that Israel would not make a final
decision on whether to attend the meeting in Washington until
Netanyahu discussed it during his regular cabinet meeting Sunday.
