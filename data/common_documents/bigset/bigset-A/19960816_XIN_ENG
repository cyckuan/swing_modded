<HEADLINE> Nepali Ministers Inspects Disputed Border Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A team of Nepali ministers and
lawmakers today made an on-site inspection to the eastern border
area where a newly erected border pillar has triggered suspicions
of territorial encroachment by India recently.
</P>
<P>
The inspection team, led by Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra
Lohani, also included representatives of major political parties
and technical officers.
</P>
<P>
After the inspection, Foreign Minister Lohani told a gathering
of local people in the border town of Bhadrapur that the
government is committed not concede even one inch of the Nepalese
territory by sticking to available proofs and related treaties.
</P>
<P>
People in Bhadrapur have claimed that the new border pillar set
up last month was about one kilometer inside Nepal from an old
pillar erected 180 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Lohani said the government has taken seriously the voice of
protest from local people over the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the old pillar was erected in the Indian side
as a reference pillar by the then British Indian government after
the Nepal-India borderline was fixed in 1818.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nepal and India reached an agreement to erect
border pillars in 1988 on the basis of an 1874 border demarcation
map.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Leader Raps the Dalai Lama for Separatist Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the Tibet
Autonomous Region has condemned the Dalai Lama for instigating
social unrest and attempting to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
During an interview in Lhasa on Thursday with a reporter from
the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun, Gyaincain Norbu said the
Dalai Lama has been the cause of the turmoils that have taken
place in Tibet over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese reporter was accompanying a group from the
Japan-China Friendship Association on a visit to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Norbu said the Dalai Lama has never given up his
separatist attempts since the failure of the rebellion in 1959,
when the Dalai Lama fled abroad.
</P>
<P>
With the help of international anti-China forces, the Dalai
Lama has used his religious influence to plot for Tibet's
independence, which not only tarnished the Tibetan religion, but
also brought disaster to Tibet, he added.
</P>
<P>
He held the separatists responsible for the terrorist explosion
in Tibet last year.
</P>
<P>
But the separatist attempts have come to nothing, he said,
adding that the "referendum" which was masterminded by the Dalai
Lama and held outside China failed, and it is likely that the
so-called "Peace March" is now near an end.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Norbu said that in 1995, the Dalai Lama tried to
sabotage the search for the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama
by illegally naming a "soul boy" and defying religious rituals and
traditions.
</P>
<P>
He said the Tibet Autonomous Region, under the leadership of
the central government, strictly abided by the religious rituals
and consummated the search, verification and enthronement of the
reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, with the support of Tibetan
monks, nuns and religious people.
</P>
<P>
"The young Panchen Lama is devoting himself on the study of
Buddhism," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Dalai Lama's illegally appointed "soul boy" is
leading a free life, just like other Tibetan children.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Norbu said great changes have taken place in Tibet
since its peaceful liberation from the brutal feudal serf system.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetans are a member of the big family of the Chinese
nation, he said. "Although Tibet is comparatively backward
compared with other areas, the central government supports and
helps Tibet to develop its ethnic economy and culture toward the
goal of common prosperity," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the future relations between Japan and Tibet,
Gyaincain Norbu said there is great potential for the development
of relations between Tibet and Japan in various fields, especially
when Japanese friends gain a better understanding of the
advantages of Tibet's resources, and also the preferential
policies set by the central government.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Japanese investment in Tibet and closer cooperation
in scientific surveying, mountain-climbing and exploration. "We
hope exchange and cooperation between Tibet and Japan can be
further strengthened," he added.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President, Chinese NPC Leader Meet on Bilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
held talks here today with visiting Vice-Chairman of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) Wu Jieping on bilateral and
international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said the Yugoslav government was grateful to China for
its impartial and just policy concerning the settlement of the
crisis in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his country maintains its "one-China" policy,
and opposes foreign interference in Chinese domestic affairs,
particularly over the issues of Taiwan and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visit to China last December, the Yugoslav
president said he was deeply impressed by the rapid economic
development in China and was pleased to see the great achievements
made by the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Wu said his visit to Yugoslavia was aimed at
promoting friendly cooperation between the peoples and parliaments
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"China and Yugoslavia have a long history of bilateral
relations. Even in the past few years when Yugoslavia was in
turmoil, the traditional friendship and bilateral ties between
China and Yugoslavia were still progressing smoothly," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese parliamentary leader also said that China, as a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, favors a peaceful
solution to all conflicts and will continue to play its part to
bring about an early settlement to the crisis in the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Wu, heading a Chinese NPC delegation, arrived here Tuesday on
a five-day official and friendly visit to Yugoslavia. He has
already held talks with the parliamentary leaders of Yugoslavia
and the two republics which make up the federation -- Serbia and
Montenegro.

<HEADLINE> Former Chinese Leader of Agriculture Commended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijingers from all walks of
life today gathered in the Great Hall of the People to commemorate
the 100th birthday of the late Deng Zihui, a former Chinese leader
in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee presided over today's event, which was
attended by Vice-premier Zhu Rongji and other Party and state
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Jiang Chunyun, also a member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, spoke at the meeting, saying
he cherished the memory of Deng's brilliant life and his high
moral character.
</P>
<P>
Born in Longyan County of southeast China's coastal province of
Fujian in August, 1896, Deng became a Communist Party member in
1926 and worked as a key leader in departments of the Party and
government before and after the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Deng served as head of the department of rural work of the CPC
Central Committee, vice-premier of the State Council in 1954, and
vice-chairman of the fourth national committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference. He died in Beijing on
December 10, 1972.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of the great contributions Deng made to the
Chinese revolutionary cause.
</P>
<P>
In different historical periods and in different leading posts,
Deng always put the Party's interests in the first place, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"Even when he was treated unfairly, Deng was able to take the
interests of the whole into account, to safeguard the unity of the
Party and to be confident in the success of the Party's cause,"
Jiang added, referring to Deng's loyalty to the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on the whole nation and Party to learn from Deng
and to strengthen the work of carrying out the outstanding working
style of the Party and building a clean government.
</P>
<P>
Also attended the meeting were Deng's family, friends and
senior officials who had worked with him.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanma-Malaysian Relations Enter New Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The five-day state visit of
Myanmar leader Than Shwe to Malaysia, which ended today, has
brought Myanma-Malaysian relations to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Than Shwe, who is Chairman of Myanmar State Law
and Order Restoration Council, also reflected Myanmar's efforts to
keep its friendly ties with the seven-member Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) following its admittance as an
ASEAN observer at the 29th meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in
July.
</P>
<P>
In Kuala Lumpur, Than Shwe exchanged views with Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad on bilateral economic cooperation,
regional and international issues and matters on ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two countries signed an agreement on
economic, scientific and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Malaysia established the diplomatic relations in
early 1958 and since then the two countries have kept good
bilateral trade relations. However, the trade volume between the
two countries has been very small.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar official statistics indicate Malaysia's export to
Myanmar in the 1994-95 fiscal year amounted to about 102 million
kyats (17 million US dollars) and its import from Myanmar was
781.89 million kyats (130.3 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The latest exhibition of Malaysian products, the first ever
held in Yangon in May this year, was aimed at enhancing trade and
friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar opened its door to foreign investment in 1988,
Malaysia has brought in capital and has taken up the 6th position
in foreign investment in the country with 312.27 million US
dollars in 10 projects such as hotels, real estate and joint
ventures after the United kingdom, Singapore, France, Thailand and
the United States by the end of May 1996.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to Myanmar, Malaysian Transport
Minister Ling Liong Sik discussed with the Myanmar side a plan to
set up a railway linking 10 Southeast Asian countries and China.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the successful visit of the
Myanmar leader to Malaysia not only boosted the friendly relations
and economic cooperation between the two countries, but also
consolidated the relations between Myanmar and the ASEAN members.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Indonesian Armed
Forces Feisal Tanjung said here today that the military has taken
measures to handle a kidnapping incident, which occurred in the
country's easternmost province of Irian Jaya on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen workers belong to Pt. Kamundan Raya, a giant timber
company, were abducted by members of a local security disturbance
gang (GPK) Wednesday as they were having dinner at the Base Camp,
about 60 kilometers north of Timika, the operational center of a
US mining company.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung refused to elaborate whether troops had been sent to
rescue the 14 workers. "The important thing is we have taken some
measures," he noted.
</P>
<P>
There were reportedly a dozen armed kidnappers involved in the
incident. Originally 17 people were kidnapped, but three were
released later.
</P>
<P>
This is the second kidnapping case occurred in Irian Jaya. A
group of 26 Indonesian and foreign scientists were kidnapped on
January 8 in Maphnduma, a small and remote village in central
Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were released by the army rescue mission in May
after a military operation.

<HEADLINE> Timely Rain Predicted for Zimbabwe's Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Timely rain is predicted to help
boost agricultural production in the coming farming season, a
report from the Commercial Farmers Union said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The weather forecast looks promising," said the report,
adding that enough rain would be expected in the coming farming
season.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe received above-the-average rains during the last
season, which saw agricultural production recover from the
devastating drought of 1994/95 when grain output declined by over
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
National food security is also assured in the coming season
following a maize harvest of over two million tonnes, and the
southern African country is for the first time in three years
preparing to export up to 200,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Farmers, buoyed by last season's record production, have
already started to talk to banks to arrange seasonal finance for
the 1996/97 crop.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to a good season and farmers are
enthusiastic about the future. Obviously, we expect production
of such crops as maize, tobacco, soybeans and wheat to rise,"
said the report.

stood at 94.3 percent, 0.5 percent higher than the country's
average, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the export of mechanical and electrical products
steadily increased, with the growth rate falling sharply compared
with the corresponding period of last year, the report said,
adding that the prospects are expected to turn even more gloomy, due
to exports' rising costs and tax refunding delays.
</P>
<P>
China's machinery industrial sector exported mechanical and
electrical products worth 16.65 billion US dollars in the
January-May period, registering an increase of 6.6 percent from
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that many enterprises are plagued by poor
economic performance and chain debt, which threaten the healthy
development of the machinery industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, by the end of June, 44.1 percent of
the machinery industrial enterprises recorded losses, 7.3 percent
over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
And the net payment in arrears of the machinery industrial
sector skyrocketed to 114.68 billion yuan (about 12.6 billion US
dollars) in the January-June period, recording a 23.8 percent
year-on-year increase.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that the machinery industry will see a
staggering growth rate of about 10 percent, and production and
marketing ratios of 97 percent for all of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Stresses Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said here today that economic development which promotes social
well-being cannot be separated from the development of the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
"Food self-sufficiency has made Indonesia more self-supporting.
And this is the principal element of economic resilience," he said
in his parliament address on the eve of the 51st anniversary of
Indonesia's independence day, August 17.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the audience that the availability of food had and
will always be a major problem for Indonesia, the world's fourth
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
"By being self-sufficient in food we are at the same time
developing self-reliance and assuring the opportunity for farmers
to capitalize on such a huge food market at home," he said.
</P>
<P>
Through various programs and efforts, current rice production
has reached an average of 4.35 tons per hectare, as compared to
only 2.13 tons per hectare in 1968, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the prosperity of the Indonesian farmers has
also risen, although it is not yet spread evenly.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also said economic development requires huge
investment and, together with investment in human resources, it is
also extremely important to invest in infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy Manages Stable Sailing Through Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy showed
stable growth, despite severe flooding in the country since late
June, according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Its monthly report, issued today, indicates that China's
industry realized an added value of 152.4 billion yuan in July,
12.2 percent up in real terms on a yearly basis. This growth rate
is one percent slower than the average movement in the
January-June period.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown of the industrial sector was brought about by the
hot weather and floods, the report said.
</P>
<P>
China's state sector invested 586.1 billion yuan on fixed
assets during January-July period, 20.9 percent up on an annual
basis, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In July, the state sector's fixed investment was increased by
24.9 percent over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Investment in technical upgrading and renovation showed the
strongest rebound in July, compared with the previous six months.
</P>
<P>
The report said that although the southern part of the country
was hit by floods, and the majority of the Chinese provinces
showed a rise in the government's purchase price of grain, the
retail market and its prices were not negatively influenced.
</P>
<P>
The country's retail sales volume rose 16.1 percent, or 9.7
percent in real terms over the same month last year, to 188.9
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the market prices continued to dip in
July. The retail price index and the consumer price index dropped
one percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, from June.
</P>
<P>
July's grain prices rose 4.8 percent over June, but this
contributed to only a 0.6 percent rise of the national price level.
</P>
<P>
During the January-July period, the retail price index and the
consumer price index rose 6.9 percent and 9.1 percent,
respectively, over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Also during this period, China's exports stood at 76.47 billion
US dollars, 6.8 percent down from the same period last
year. Meanwhile, China's imports rose 9.9 percent to 74.48 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China enjoyed a trade surplus of two billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In July, China's trade surplus was 1.12 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the most critical issue in the Chinese
economic life is low economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The industrial enterprises' total profit dropped 36.3 percent
during the first half of the year from the same 1995
period. Money-losing firms registered a 50.5 percent rise in
losses.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Mao's Poems Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 domestic and overseas
scholars gathered at a symposium in China's capital today to
discuss poetry written by the late Chairman Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese revolutionary leader (1893-1976) published 56 poems
that depicted his life as a great statesman and revolutionary, and
his first poem was written in 1915 and his last, in 1965,
according to symposium speakers.
</P>
<P>
Mao's poems have been translated into many different foreign
languages, including English, Japanese and Russian, and published
in many countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
"Mao was the No. 1 man, who influenced Chinese and world poets
through his limited number of poems," said He Jinzhi, chairman of
the China Society of Mao Zedong's Poems, which co-sponsored the
symposium with the Literature Institute of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Mao's poems concentrate on the great Chinese spirit, and
reflect the pride and dignity of the nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the symposium were from Canada, Japan and the
United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan regions.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Condemns Japanese Ministers' Visit to War Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korean political parties
today attacked the visit by several Japanese cabinet ministers and
parliamentarians Thursday to the Yasukuni Shrine to mourn Japan's
military war dead.
</P>
<P>
The visit, on the 51st anniversary of the country's surrender
in World War II, was described as a sign of the revival of
militarism in Japan by a commentary by the ruling New Korea Party.
</P>
<P>
The politicians insulted the feelings of the peoples of Asian
countries invaded by Japan during World War Two, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party, the National Congress for New
Politics, also issued a statement saying the Japanese ministers'
visit to the war shrine indicated Japan has not shown remorse for
its war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Japan should make sincere apologies to all war victims, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Another statement jointly issued by some 20 lawmakers from both
the ruling and the opposition parties called on the South Korean
government to lodge a protest with the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency released a
commentary attacking the Japanese ministers' visit as an attempt
to glorify Japan's war of aggression in Asia in the 1930s and
1940s.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Retail Sales Market Shows Signs of Withering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China's retail sales market
showed signs of withering in July, with the growth rate of its
turnover dropping 3.4 percent from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The total retail sales volume stood at 188.87 billion yuan,
16.1 percent over the same period last year, according to the
State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Yang Hui, an expert with the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said that the growth rate of the retail sales volume
last month neared the the lowest in a span of five years, which
means that the current economic cycle has almost hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
She said that the catering sector was the only area in the
retail sales market that enjoyed a rise in sales volume last
month.
</P>
<P>
In July, the catering sector saw its sales volume rise 24.7
percent on a yearly basis to 15.66 billion yuan. The growth rate
is down 1.9 percent from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Although flooding that has ravaged China since late June has
directly affected industrial production, the floods do not seem to
be logically linked with the slumping of the consumption market,
as proved by statistics, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
She believes that signs of prosperity in the consumption market
this month are distant.
</P>
<P>
Non-commodities accounted for an even bigger ratio, which meant
that rent, health care, and education to become more expensive,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many people are anticipating reforms in the housing
allocation system.
</P>
<P>
"As the reform will bring an end to free housing, they save
money and wait," she said.
</P>
<P>
People's purses are not as fat as they were during the first
half of the year, compared to the same period last year, therefore
they are not likely to spend as much as they did last year, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The urban people's living expense income was 2,190 yuan during
the January-June period, 14 percent up over the same period last
year. The growth rate is 15 percent down from the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
For the same period, the rural people's cash income was 921
yuan, 21 percent more on an annual basis. The growth rate is 17
percent down from last year.
</P>
<P>
She called for measures that would ensure an ample supply of
meat and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
"With the flood waters already drying in some fields, a slack
season for vegetables is arriving," she said. "Therefore, the
price level is likely to rebound."
</P>
<P>
The government's raise of the grain purchase price can also
contribute to the rise of the prices, she said.

OTTAWA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers saw prices
increase by 1.2 percent in July over the same month last year, the
lowest year-on-year increase in the consumer price index since the
start of 1995, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Increased prices for new cars, meat (other than beef),
travel services, telephone services and rental accommodation were

BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today toured
disaster-stricken Hebei Province, calling for redoubled efforts to
fight the flooding there.
</P>
<P>
Following a report from local officials on the current flood
situation, Li said that the task of getting production back on
track and rebuilding homes will be difficult, and that the
anti-flood and disaster relief campaigns have been successful.
</P>
<P>
He urged local people to be victorious in the battle against
the floods.
</P>
<P>
Since the flooding began, many areas in the province have been
inundated, and in early August, the heaviest rains since 1963 hit
the central and south parts of the province. Property damage was
widespread and severe, and several casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
The premier also toured the construction site of the
Qinhuangdao Coal Wharf, one of the country's key projects. The
fourth phase of the project, which should go into operation in
July, 1997, can handle 30 million tons of coal annually.

<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior official in Beijing
today called for further implementation of anti-corruption
measures.
</P>
<P>
Hou Zongbin, deputy secretary of the Central Commission for
Disciplinary Inspection of the Communist Party of China, urged
various localities and government departments to promote the
systems that report to the Workers' Congress the income of
officials, register gifts, and list the cost of receptions and
social activities.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting jointly sponsored by the Central Commission
for Disciplinary Inspection, the Organization Department of the
CPC Central Committee, the State Economic and Trade Commission,
the Ministry of Supervision and the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions, Hou said that the three systems have been in effect in
most areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Following last year's mandate by the Central Commission for
Disciplinary Inspection that the three systems be set up across
the country, more than 170,000 Party and government officials have
registered gifts they received.
</P>
<P>
The income reporting system is underway in more than 80 percent
of the institutions at or above the county level. The reception
cost reporting system has been established in about 60 percent of
state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The institutions which have not formed the three systems are
ordered to do so within the year. Hou asked departments of
disciplinary inspection and supervision to be actively involved in
the work.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President, Chinese NPC Leader Meet on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic held
talks here today with visiting Vice-Chairman of the Chinese National
People's Congress (NPC) Wu Jieping on bilateral and international
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said the Yugoslav government was grateful to China for
its impartial and just policy concerning the settlement of the
crisis in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his country maintains its "one-China" policy,
and opposes foreign interference in Chinese domestic affairs,
particularly over the issues of Taiwan and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visit to China last December, the Yugoslav president
said he was deeply impressed by the rapid economic development in
China and was pleased to see the great achievements made by the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Wu said his visit to Yugoslavia was aimed at
promoting friendly cooperation between the peoples and parliaments of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"China and Yugoslavia have a long history of bilateral relations.
Even in the past few years when Yugoslavia was in turmoil, the
traditional friendship and bilateral ties between China and Yugoslavia
were still progressing smoothly," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese parliamentary leader also said that China, as a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council, favors a peaceful solution to all
conflicts and will continue to play its part to bring about an early
settlement to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Wu, heading a Chinese NPC delegation, arrived here Tuesday on
a five-day official and friendly visit to Yugoslavia. He has
already held talks with the parliamentary leaders of Yugoslavia
and the two republics which make up the federation -- Serbia and

HONG KONG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior officer of the United
States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in Honduras
was today sentenced in Hong Kong to an imprisonment of three years
and four months for possessing false travel documents.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Hong Kong Independent Commission
Against Corruption (ICAC) said that 45-year-old Jerry Wolf
Stuchiner was caught on July 15, 1996, in Hong Kong with five
blank Honduran passports, which were believed to be forged.
</P>
<P>
The ICAC began an investigation this April after receiving
corruption allegations involving the defendant, who was then the
officer-in-charge of INS at the US Embassy in Honduras, and the
Consul General of the Republic of Honduras in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The court heard that when Stuchiner arrived at Hong Kong
International Airport from Los Angeles on July 15, 1996, he was
seen using his diplomatic passport to enter the territory although
 he was not entitled to do so because he was on vacation leave at
the time.
</P>
<P>
As he approached the Customs channels, he was arrested by ICAC
officers and was found in possession of five Honduran passports
which contained no personal particulars of the holders.
</P>
<P>
The defendant admitted to ICAC officers that he had brought the
 passports from Honduras and wanted to deliver them to the
Honduran Consul General in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that he knew the passports were forged and
were to be traded.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Must Pass Chinese Test Before Studying in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Beginning this year, foreigners
who want to study in China must score at least a C on a
government-issued Chinese language proficiency test.
</P>
<P>
A new set of regulations issued by China's State Education
Commission stipulate that foreigners who want to study in Chinese
colleges and universities can register only after obtaining a
certificate that shows they passed the Chinese Proficiency Test,
or "Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi."
</P>
<P>
Previously, the certificate was the only proof that foreign
students had learned some Chinese, but it was not required for
entrance into Chinese schools.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulations, foreigners who apply to study
Chinese literature, history, philosophy, and traditional Chinese
medical science must score at least a C on the proficiency test,
and those apply to study other subjects, including Chinese
language, must receive a C minus. The certificates are valid for
two years.
</P>
<P>
In other words, Foreigners who study in China need to be
familiar with at least 3,000 commonly-used Chinese words, so that
they can read simple Chinese writings and communicate with Chinese
people in their daily lives, according to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Liu Lianli, deputy director of the Office of the State
Commission of the Chinese Proficiency Test, said that with the
rapidly-increasing number of foreign students in China, the
Chinese government must determine a standard level of Chinese
language proficiency.
</P>
<P>
Liu added that other countries require foreign students to pass
similar tests, such as TOEFL (Test of English as A Foreign
Language) in the United States.

<P>
Last year, China's colleges enrolled 37,000 foreign students,
two times the number reported in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners' interest in the Chinese language is said to be
related to the rapid economic growth resulting from the country's
reforms and opening-up that began in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Chinese is one of the world's oldest and most complex
languages. Archaeologists discovered sophisticated Chinese
characters inscribed on animal bones and tortoise shells in the
13th century B.C.
</P>
<P>
The square-shaped characters of the Chinese writing system have
been successfully input into computers and sent onto the
Internet. There are some 1,000 encoding models for the
computerization of Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
The modernization of the Chinese language also includes the
introduction of the phonetic alphabet and the simplified Chinese
characters. Experts agree that this has led to the widespread
interest in the study of Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Joel Bellassen, a Sinologist from France, told Xinhua that he
believes that that Chinese language, which is used by the world's
largest population, will become one of the most popular languages
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 1,000 colleges and universities in other
countries have offered Chinese courses.
</P>
<P>
Bellassen, who gave himself the Chinese name Bai Lesang, was
one of the first Western students to study Chinese in China in the
1970s. He speaks Chinese fluently, and says that it's easier to
learn Chinese than English.
</P>
<P>
Peter Kupfer, a professor of Chinese, said that Chinese might
be "the most difficult language on the earth, because its
pronunciation and characters are too complex."
</P>
<P>
But the professor, whose Chinese name is Ke Bide, said that
studying Chinese is still a pleasure.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Must Pass Chinese Test Before Studying in China (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese Proficiency Test, a state-level standardized test
launched in 1984 for non-native Chinese speakers, is now regarded
as the most authoritative of its kind.
</P>
<P>
"The test can help spread Chinese worldwide and increase
understanding between different cultures. This will benefit the
world peace," said Lu Bisong, chairman of the International
Society for Chinese Teaching.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies by Chinese and foreign scholars show that
misunderstandings, prejudice, and tensions between countries
sometimes occur because of miscommunications between foreigners
and Chinese who cannot speak each other's native language.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu pointed out that there is no scientific evidence to
support the allegation that "Chinese will in the near future
defeat other languages and become the world language."
</P>
<P>
Currently, 80 percent of written documents concerning science
and technology are written in English.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government demands that Chinese children must study
English from middle school through high school.
</P>
<P>
China has set up Chinese Proficiency Test offices in 15
countries and regions, including Singapore, Japan, Australia, the
United States, France, Hong Kong and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that more than 57,000 people in 114 countries
and regions have taken the test.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the 1,000 colleges and universities in China now
enroll foreign students. And China is creating a program to send
more teachers overseas to teach Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Runners of Counterfeit Bank Notes Severely Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Twelve people convicted of
selling counterfeit money were sentenced today in Beijing to
prison terms ranging from three to eight years.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court, along with
district and county People's Courts, turned in guilty verdicts for
Song Shengmin, Shi Dianliang, Yang Wangguo, and nine others
accused of using fake bank notes in nine separate criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
Song, a farmer from Taihe County in Anhui Province who was
sentenced to eight years in prison, was apprehended on the day he
sold phony 100-yuan bills amounting to 7,500 yuan to Anhui farmer
Shi Dianliang, according to the Beijing Higher People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Shi, who was also sentenced to an eight-year jail term, was
caught on the spot as he in turn passed on the counterfeit money
he bought from Song, the court said.
</P>
<P>
The court said Henan farmer Yang Wangguo and fellow villagers
Yang Daojin, Yang Yaoqian and Men Fanxiong, purchased 160 one
hundred yuan counterfeit bank notes. Police captured the men as
they were selling the bills.
</P>
<P>
Yang and his accomplices were given five to eight year prison
sentences, according to the court.
</P>
<P>
Officials working with the court said continuing efforts should
be made to severely punish crimes associated with buying, selling,
transporting and using counterfeit money.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's National Industry Continues to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said here today that the country's industry continues to grow with
a relatively high speed.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in his address at parliament on the eve of
the 51st anniversary of the independence day, August 17.
</P>
<P>
The president said, the contribution of industry to the gross
domestic product (GDP) was only 9.2 percent in 1969 and it has
gone far up to 24.3 percent in 1995. This figure has already
surpassed the target of 24.1 percent set for the final year of the
sixth five-year development plan (1994-1999), he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soeharto said, the contribution of agriculture to
the GDP has declined from 49.3 percent in 1969 to 17.2 percent in
1995. These developments show the shifting of the economic
structure from agriculture to industry.
</P>
<P>
The president also said small industry, which absorbs a great
number of workers, is playing an important role in export. Its
exports have reached 2.1 billion US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of small-and-medium-sized industries will be
continued, so that eventually there will be a strong and reliable
national industrial structure with medium-sized industry as its
backbone, said the president.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, industry's growth level has been slowed down
at present due to, among other things, the impacts of global
market development.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing an increasingly tough competition from other
developing countries which have just started its
industrialization. Meanwhile, the big demand at home impacted on
our export, both because of restricted availability of export
products and better prices at domestic market," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Photos Show Treasures Robbed By Westerners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Photos of treasures stolen by
Western "explorers" from world-famous Chinese grottos are now on
exhibit in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This is the first chance Chinese have had to view the
treasures, which were robbed from the Dunhuang Grottos in
northwest China's Gansu Province at the turn of the century. The
grottos are listed on the United Nations' World Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
Among those on display are photos of an astrological map,
traditional Chinese prescriptions, the world's earliest
block-printed book, a sanskrit book, books about Chinese minority
nationalities that are now included in the collection of the
Library of Great Britain in London, census registers of Dunhuang
and silk paintings that are in a Paris museum, Tang Dynasty
(618-907) Buddhist sculptures at Harvard University, and wall
paintings from the number 323 grotto that are now in the Museum of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yu Weichao, director of the National Museum of
Chinese History, the site of the exhibition, said that a British
explorer robbed many treasures from Dunhuang and stored them in
the Museum of Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Today the Chinese scholars have to buy micro-film from the
Westerners when they want to study the cultural relics that belong
to their own country," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, in the 1920s, an archaeological team from the
Harvard University stole from the grottos 12 wall paintings and a
Tang Buddhist sculpture. He was later followed by "explorers" from
France, Japan, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Many of China's treasures were relocated to museums and
libraries in 14 countries and regions, including four in Britain,
two in France, six in the United States, five in Germany, and 13
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The photos are part of the exhibit that focuses on Dunhuang
arts.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Surge As Stockpile Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices reversed
their poor performance of the past few months, surging 10
Australian cents (7.8 US cents) during sale this week in Sydney
and Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in market prices came as Wool International
(WI) announced the value of Australia's stockpile had been cut to
less than one billion Australian dollars (0.78 billion US dollars)
from the 1991 peak of 2.7 billion Australian dollars (about 2.1
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to WI sources here today, solid demand for the
majority of wool types was reported during this week's sale with
the eastern market indicator closing at 612 Australian cents (477
US cents) a kilogram, 10 cents higher than last week's close.
</P>
<P>
A total of 59,112 bales were offered with 7.8 percent passed
in. There were no auctions this week in Fremantle, with the
western market indicator remaining at 549 Australian cents (428 US
cents) a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The largest sales of the year are planned for next week in
Sydney, Adelaide and Fremantle with 95,084 bales to be offered.
</P>
<P>
The sources said, as the wool industry's stockpile debt passed
under the one billion Australian dollars mark this week, the debt
reduction might appear of little consolation to woolgrowers
struggling with their own debts. A speedy and efficient removal of
the stockpile debt is vital for returning the wool industry to
profitability.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, August 16 (Xinhua)-- Hungary's inflation rate fell to
a new low for the year in July, rising just 0.4 percent over the
previous month, according to reports here today.
</P>
<P>
The monthly inflation rate started slowing down after January's
4 percent increase on December 1995, rising by 1.6 percent in
April, 2.1 percent in May and less than one percent in June, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
If inflation continues to increase at such a low rate, the
year-on-year rate by December 1996 could be down slightly on
1995's 28.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said Hungary's consumer price index rose 23 percent
in this July over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Prices of food and daily necessities so far this year have
risen 17 and 15.2 percent respectively, lower than that for fuel,
tobacco, liquor and services, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Cold Shoulder Turned on Liberian Warlord Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Liberian warlord and leader of
Ulimo-J faction Major-general Roosevelt Johnson is said to be
receiving a cold treatment at the hands of Nigerian authorities
in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua learned that since his arrival on Tuesday for the
meeting of the Committee of Nine on Liberia of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), all Johnson could get
is accommodation for himself and his delegation at the Abuja
Sheraton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Other protocol arrangements have been found to be grossly
inadequate, compared to what his fellow faction leaders enjoy, a
source said through telephone.
</P>
<P>
Up to this morning, Johnson's aides were seen battling with
foreign affairs ministry officials for vehicles for use by the
warlord and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the luxurious limousine cars placed at the
disposal of delegations of other factions headed by Charles
Taylor, Alhaji Kromah and George Boley, an aide said that these
leaders could enjoy such facilities while Johnson cannot go out
of the hotel due to non-availability of even a single car.
</P>
<P>
But foreign affairs ministry officials said the protocol
department made adequate arrangement for enough vehicles but only
a few were released for now.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, it is still not certain whether
Charles Taylor, one of the principal warring faction leader in
Liberia, will be in Abuja for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Although all members of his delegation are present, including
the foreign minister and information, culture and tourism
minister, Taylor is conspicuously absent, the source said.

FREETOWN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A Sierra Leonean girl who has
survived a bullet lodged in her brain for two months in Freetown
was today flown to the Ghanaian capital of Accra for medical
operation.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons at a Freetown hospital said Kattie Sillah, a high
school student, was shot in a rebel ambush in June along the
strategic Mile 91 Highway linking the Sierra Leonean capital to
the southern province of Bo.
</P>
<P>
The girl was rescued by government soldiers in a counter
offensive, said the military. She was taken to Bo before being
rushed to Freetown by the Belgian medical aid workers who
discovered the bullet through an X-ray test.
</P>
<P>
The doctors advised sending the girl to neighboring Ghana for
lack of operational facilities in war-torn Freetown. However,
hospital sources put the cost of the operation at 10,000 U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, with the donation made by the Sierra Leonean
government and a number of local non-governmental organizations
in Freetown, Kattie's medical trip to Accra was made possible.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Review Pension System for Ex-Gurkhas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government will
make a thorough review of its service pension system in Nepal for
some 25,000 ex-Gurkha soldiers who had served in the British army,
a British spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman from the British embassy here told a press
briefing that the pensions for these former British Gurkhas would
be increased significantly after the review.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after the local press recently reported
that ex-Gurkha soldiers here have requested the government to take
up their welfare demands to the British government.
</P>
<P>
The ex-Gurkha soldiers who had served in the British army for
at least 15 years could get a monthly pension which is calculated
on the rate of pay on the last service day by considering the
general living expense in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
However, they have demanded the same pensions and facilities as
their British counterparts, arguing that a 1947 tripartite treaty
signed by Britain, India and Nepal has such provisions.
</P>
<P>
But the British spokesman said today that the 1947 treaty has
no clause on any comparison between pensions for ex-Gurkha
soldiers and that for British ex-servicemen.
</P>
<P>
According to him, about 25,000 ex-Gurkhas receive pensions
ranging from 30 to 130 US dollars, depending on their former ranks
in the British army, every month at present.
</P>
<P>
On the demand for the living right in Britain of ex-Gurkhas, the
spokesman said that ex-Gurkhas should adhere to Britain's current
immigration rules because they are citizens of Nepal, not the
united kingdom.
</P>
<P>
More than 230,000 Gurkha soldiers, most of them from Nepal's
northern hilly and mountainous areas, fought for Britain during
world war I and II with nearly 15,000 losing their lives.
</P>
<P>
There are some 4,000 Gurkha soldiers in the British army at
present who are stationed in Britain, Hong Kong and Brunei and the
number would be reduced to 2,000 by the end of the century, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Britain May Act Against Internet Pornography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government may be
forced to legislate to control pornographic and violent material
on the Internet if the industry doesn't regulate itself, a
government minister said today.
</P>
<P>
"Government will face calls for legislation to regulate all
aspects of the Internet, unless and until service providers are
seen wholeheartedly to embrace responsible self-regulation,"
British Science and Technology Minister Ian Taylor was quoted by
the Daily Telegraph newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Internet companies in France and Germany were temporarily
closed down or had their services curtailed by regulators last year
because they allowed access to offensive material on the Net.
</P>
<P>
Taylor challenged Britain's Internet industry to help
parents and schools control children's access to undesirable
material by using software compatible with the Platform for
Internet Content Selection (Pics) screening system.
</P>
<P>
Developed by a consortium of academics and computer companies,
Pics is a universal and free system for labeling Internet text
and images with ratings according to their sexual, violence,
nudity and language content.
</P>
<P>
Parents or teachers can set acceptable levels for each of the
four types of content on a sliding scale of one to five.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has previously asked the Internet industry to
exercise responsible self-regulation. This stronger call to
use the screening system came as the first software that
incorporates the Pics filtering system became available.
</P>
<P>
The three largest British Internet companies - Demon Internet,
UUnet Pipex and Compuserve - said that they will now offer the
free software, made by Microsoft, to new customers.

the independence of Indonesia, the president said the government
will continue its integrated policies in the monetary and fiscal
areas to cool the economic overheating.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Indonesia's economy has been overheated
which was reflected by the current account deficit in the balance
of payments and inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country's current account deficit has risen from
3.5 billion US dollars to 6.9 billion US dollars, about 3.3
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inflation rate continues to be high, above the
average revised target of around 5 percent. In 1995 the inflation
rate went down to 8.6 from 9.2 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The president also called for paying attention to the
management of foreign debts which has reached nearly 100 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and 1995, Indonesia serviced its debts four times,
amounting to almost 1.5 billion US dollars. This year, it have
serviced its debts of 579 million US dollars so far.
</P>
<P>
"We are busy mobilizing funds at home aimed at accelerating the
reimbursement of loans before they are due," noted the president.
</P>
<P>
Through the several steps that have been taken, the Indonesian
government hoped its economic engine would become normal again.

<HEADLINE> First Satellite-Debris Collision Detected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) - The first ever collision between a
satellite and space debris has been detected in low earth orbit,
British scientists announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A British-built French spy satellite was damaged when it was
hit by a fragment from one of the European Ariane rockets hurtling
through space at 31,000 mph. The fragment, the size of a
briefcase, was travelling 20 times faster than a rifle bullet and
caused part of the Cerise satellite to vaporize.
</P>
<P>
"There have been various suspicions of collisions before, but
it has never been as clear cut," said Prof. Martin Sweeting,
managing director of Surrey Satellite Technology, the company
which built the satellite. "This is the first time this has ever
been proved," he said.
</P>
<P>
On July 24, his team was alerted to the collision when Cerise
began rapidly tumbling end over end. Subsequent observations and
analysis confirmed Cerise was hit by debris from an
Ariane booster used in 1986 to launch France's Spot-1 satellite.
</P>
<P>
The six-yard long, rod-like "boom" that keeps the spacecraft
stable was vaporized. "The debris went straight through," Sweeting
said, "Had it hit the main part of the spacecraft, there
would have been nothing left."
</P>
<P>
"We are not very happy that it has happened to our spacecraft,"
the professor added, "But we may be able to recover the entire
mission with a bit of effort."
</P>
<P>
Four decades of space activity have left more than 23,000
observable space objects (larger than four inches), of which 7,500
are still in orbit.
</P>
<P>
The team was able to find out which piece of junk was
responsible for damaging Cerise thanks to tracking instruments and
radar run by the Americans and Russians

<HEADLINE> Second World Fujian Convention Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The second world Fujian
convention and Malaysia-Fujian investment and trade exhibition
opened in Langkawi, Malaysia, today.
</P>
<P>
The convention is to enable the Fujian clansmen throughout the
world to meet, promote relationship and create the basis of trust
for future business development and enhancement of trade and
investment opportunities in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the World Fujian Assembly would be formed
during the two-day convention inaugurated by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, according to Malaysian news agency
Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said on the occasion that Malaysia with a remarkable
8.7 percent economic growth rate on average over the last five
years is an attractive base for businessmen seeking to expand and
to take advantage of the potential that the Asia-Pacific region
offers.
</P>
<P>
"The factors that contribute to Malaysia's investment
environment include political stability, high economic growth,
efficient administration, adaptable and productive work force and
well developed infrastructure," he said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral trade between Malaysia and China, Mahathir said
the trade had almost a three-fold increase over the 1990-1995
period.
</P>
<P>
Investments from China in the Malaysian manufacturing sector
have generally been on the upward trend though the number of
projects was relatively small and insignificant, he said, adding
for the period from 1987 to April 1996, a total of 44 projects
involving capital investment of 615.5 million ringgit (about 246.2
million US dollars) from China were approved.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that there was good scope for industrial
cooperation between the Fujian province of China and Malaysia
since the former, together with other coastal areas and provinces
in China, have been the prime areas of destination for foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 representatives from some 20 Hokkien (Fujian)
associations worldwide, including those from China, Indonesia,
Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, the United States and
Malaysia, are attending the convention organized by the Federation
of Hokkien Associations of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The first convention was held in Los Angeles, United States, in
1994.

During the visit, Than Shwe met Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and they had discussions on bilateral relations

Lumpur.
</P>
<P>

and Penang.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Than Shwe visited an ASEAN country
after Myanmar's admittance as an observer of the ASEAN last month.
</P>

Some analysts believed that the visit not only contributed to
the promotion of bilateral relations and economic cooperation
between Myanmar and Malaysia, but also strengthened the relations
between Myanmar and the ASEAN members.

<HEADLINE> Israel Makes No Proposal on Hebron Issue: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has not
made any official proposal to the Palestinian National Authority
on amendment to the agreement on the redeployment of the Israeli
Army in Hebron, a local radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian radio "Sawt al Arab" (Voice of the Arabs) quoted
Mustafa al Natche, mayor of the West Bank city of Hebron, as
saying that Israeli media had revealed reluctance of the Israeli
government to withdraw from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
had submitted to the Israeli Mini Cabinet certain plans to alter
what had already been agreed upon with regard to Hebron, namely
that the Israeli Army would only withdraw from 20 percent of the
city.
</P>
<P>
Natche further said that the pretext of the Israeli government
is the protection of 200 Jewish settlers in Hebron who are living
in three settlement sites under the protection of 1,500 Israeli
soldiers, disregarding the fact that there are 200,000 Arab
citizens living in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron mayor pointed out that the Israeli government was
using Hebron as a "bargaining chip" with the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
He said that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was making
intensive contacts at the Arab and international levels,
particularly with the U.S. and Russia, the two peace process
co-sponsors, in a bid to persuade Israel to implement what had
been agreed upon, thus rescuing the peace process from the current
dangers.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Success in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIGATSE, Augest 16 (Xinhua) -- In bigger Tibetan cities such as
Lhasa and Shigatse, "Himalayan sacred water" has come to be a
popular drink with the awakening of a commercial sense here on
the plateau in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The bottled water comes from the "Holy Spring" of Chutannyma,
so to speak, in Gongba County, south of the Shigatse Region.
</P>
<P>
According to legend, the spring at the foot of the Himalayas
was dug by a great Buddhist monk using his staff more than a
thousand years ago, and the water is said to have curative powers
for many diseases and the power of longevity.
</P>
<P>
A kilometer from the the Holy Spring, there is a small Buddhist
convent with an old book of scriptures that says the water can
cure as many as 800 hundred different diseases. According to a nun
there, every year thousands of people from all parts of Tibet come
to the Holy Spring.
</P>
<P>
Even though the spring water is famous, nobody had thought of
making commercial use of it until very recently when the winds of
market reforms came blowing into this remote area. But soon, the
local government got mineral water processing equipment and a
factory was set up near the Buddhist convent.
</P>
<P>
The water was a great success as soon as it hit the market, and
now total yearly output of mineral water is reported to be 3
million bottles.
</P>
<P>
According to laboratory tests, the Himalayan sacred water
contains more than 17 elements that are good for human health, and
is in fact somewhat effective in treating various kinds of
ailments.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Not Allowed to Enter Liberia's Council of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Liberian Information, Culture and
Tourism Minister Victoria Reffel has condemned the demand by the
warring faction Ulimo-J that its leader Roosevelt Johnson be
included in the Council of State.
</P>
<P>
"He (Johnson) is crazy" for the proposal, Ms reffel said this
morning in a swift reaction to it, a source told Xinhua through
telephone from Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Major-general Johnson called Wednesday at a press conference
in Abuja for the removal and replacement of three prominent
members of the six-man council, including Chairman Wilton
Sankawulo and Vice-chairmen Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, two
of the most important warlords in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Johnson must be "out of his mind" for advancing such a
proposal, she said.
</P>
<P>
"He was a cabinet member who was dismissed for indiscipline
and ECOWAS asked that he be reinstated. If he does not appreciate
his reinstatement then he must not forget that the law still
prevails. He can be dismissed again. Johnson should probably be
asking for his own self-exile or resignation," the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
The minister criticized the United States for coming up with
another plan to destabilize the council. "It is an insult to the
government and people of Liberia for any to talk of admitting
General Johnson into the Council of State," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Plateau, famous for its
diverse species of wild plants and animals, is being studied by
the researchers of the Tibet Plateau Ecology Research Institute to
gain a better understanding of its ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The institute is located in southeast Tibet. By investigating
local resources and observing ecosystems on the Tibet Plateau, it
has helped to protect the plateau's ecological environment and
make rational use of resources.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1985, the institute has sent 840
researchers to survey 20 major forest areas in southeast Tibet and
set up 11 positioning stations.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Plateau is home to a variety of plants and animals,
some of which are very rare in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Yalu Tsangpo River Gorge in the southern part of the Tibet
Plateau is a major center for the institute's research projects.
The average depth of the gorge is over 5,000 meters. In the gorge,
many rare trees, like the manyseeded euptelea and the
tetracentron, can be found.
</P>
<P>
Snakes, tigers and monkeys are very common animal
residents. The first-hand materials obtained by the researchers in
1994 drew close attention from scientists across the world.
</P>
<P>
The institute currently has a collection of over 1,300 plant
specimens, 20 percent of the total in Tibet, as well as 350 soil
samples, according to Chen daodong, deputy director of the
institute.
</P>
<P>
This year the institute plans to provide a better service to
farming, forestry and animal husbandry on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
The new research to be completed later this year will further
lay bare the diversification and contributing factors of the
ecological environment on the plateau, thus improving protection
of the plants and animals.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Parliament Delegation Visits Montenegro of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to help remove
unfair sanctions against Yugoslavia to bring the Balkan country
back to the international community, a senior official of the
Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) said today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jieping, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, made
the remarks during talks with S. Bozovic, Assembly Vice President
of the Montenegro Republic and the republic's Deputy Prime
Minister Krunislav Vukcevic.
</P>
<P>
Wu who led an NPC delegation arrived in Montenegro earlier
today, a republic in the south of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Montenegro and the Serbia Republic, two of the six former
Yugoslav republics, comprise the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Bozovic expressed the hope that China would use its influence
in the world to help lift international embargo against Yugoslavia
to make the country an element of stability in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations decided to lift arms embargo against
Yugoslavia in November last year when the Dayton peace accords
ending the war in Bosnia was reached in New York. But complete
withdrawal of comprehensive sanctions against Yugoslavia depends
on implementation of the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Bozovic said Montenegro hopes to establish and develop close
ties with China in various sectors including politics, economy and
culture.
</P>
<P>
Vukcevic said Yugoslavia and Montenegro support China's
territorial integrity and oppose hegemonism of super powers and
the practice of imposing one's will upon others.
</P>
<P>
Wu spoke highly of the wisdom and braveness displayed by the
Montenegro people in their struggle for independence.
</P>
<P>
He called on the developing countries to unite in their fight
against hegemonism and power politics.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is accusing
neighbouring Swaziland of bringing the cheap sugar imports into
its domestic market.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's sugar industry would lose 275 billion Rand
(about 64 million US Dollars) during the current season in the
domestic market because of the inroads by Swaziland and
Zimbabwean, the South African Media reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a counter argument, Swaziland Sugar Association General
Manager Andy Colhoun said on Thursday in Mbabane that the South
African Sugar Association (SASA) had failed to renew contracts on
providing the small neighbouring kingdom with access to exports
facilities, research and training.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland ships most of its sugar exports through the
Mozambican capital Maputo, according to the Swazi official.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Swaziland exported about 145,000 tons of
finished and semi-finished sugar products to South Africa each
year.

<P>
PARIS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French people are not interested in a small and
environment-friendly car which consumes no more than three liters
of oil per 100 kilometers and caters for short distance
travels. The car is presented by the Greenpeace as technically
feasible. However, neither producers -- who are afraid of high
costs in its development -- nor users -- who like super-powerful
and modernly designed cars -- have shown any interest in it.
</P>
<P>
-- Forty-nine years after its independence, India torpedoed the
nuclear disarmament treaty on Thursday in Geneva. Indian Prime
Minister Deve Gowda defended India's rejection of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by describing the treaty as "being
discriminatory" and "jeopardizing the national security of India."
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The anger is rising among French cattle breeders who are
facing a 700,000-ton overproduction of beef, which is largely due
to a campaign by the government to better identify the origin of
beef to prevent the spreading of mad cow disease. The 20-40
percent drop of beef consumption in the past few weeks will have a
considerable impact on the cattle industry, said the heavily
indebted cattle producers, who have warned Prime Minister Alain
Juppe of "a revolt."
</P>
<P>
-- Former French President Giscard d'Estaing said in an
interview with Le Figaro that the European Monetary Union is a
trump for the French economy and is an essential way to achieve a
more stable growth. He said that since the U.S. dollar stopped to
be convertible with gold 25 years ago, the rise and fall of an
economy no longer depends on its competitiveness, but its monetary
elements.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Warlord Clears Towns for Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian warlord, Alhaji
Kromah, has announced 24 designated towns and villages under the
control of his faction ULIMO-K as safe havens for embattled
civilians beginning August 20.
</P>
<P>
In a statement obtained here today, Kromah reiterated his
earlier commitment made on July 27 in Abuja, capital of Nnigeria,
to disarm his troops whether soldiers of the west African
peacekeeping force were deployed or not.
</P>
<P>
''Early disarmament and democratic elections constitute the
two most important factors for a lasting resolution of the
Liberian war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
ULIMO-K intends to take the lead in a prompt and concrete
action for peace, that would stimulate other factions, including
members of the Liberian Council of State, to join him in ''strict
observance of cessation of hostilities on all fronts and in a
veritable adherence to an unconditional ceasefire and
implementation of the program of disarmament and elections,''
Kromah said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued in Abuja Thursday when the Committee
of Nine on Liberia of the Economic Community of West African
States was making another attempt aimed at resolving the

<HEADLINE> Chairman of Tibetan Regional Government Meets Japanese Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region will
strive to achieve an annual growth rate of 10 percent, as well as
an increase in the economic returns, according to a leader in the
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the Tibetan autonomous regional
government, told a group of Japanese visitors from the Japan-China
Friendship Association that the autonomous region has set its
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), and the long-term objectives for
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The plans aim at restructuring the economy while focusing on
major projects to keep in line with the whole nation, and to lay a
solid foundation for the economic growth of the next century,
Gyaincain Norbu noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the plans, 450,000 people will be lifted out of
poverty in Tibet and the majority of the regional population will
be living a relatively comfortable life, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy,
especially the central government's third meeting on Tibet in July
of 1994, Tibet has witnessed rapid economic development, and
achieved the objectives of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, said
Gyaincain Norbu.
</P>
<P>
He attributed all the success to the kind attention from the
central government, and support from other provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions, and joint efforts of 2.43
million Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
Since the peaceful liberation in 1951, Tibet has been enjoying
a unique policy set by the central government, human, financial
and material support, and regional national autonomy, Gyaincain
Norbu pointed out, when briefing the Japanese delegates on the
assistance to Tibet from the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The assistance has "resulted in considerable changes in Tibet,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Since July, 1994, a total investment of 3.36 billion yuan from
the whole nation has been invested in the construction of 62 major
projects, among which 42 have now completed. The projects covered
agriculture, industry, posts and telecommunications, health and
sanitation, and municipal works.
</P>
<P>
The construction has played an important role in infrastructure
improvement and economic development, Gyaincain Norbu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 14 provinces and cities around the country have
established links with seven localities in Tibet, offering aid and
assistance to them on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
In the period of 1994-1995, more than 500 trained personnel
were sent from outside Tibet, which promoted ethnic unity, and was
well received by the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
Muraoka Kyuhei, director-general of the Japan-China Friendship
Association, and head of the delegation, said he saw the great
changes in Tibet during his week-long trip to the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the international community, including
Japan, lacks knowledge of Tibet's present development, a fact that
demands even more extensive exchanges between Tibet and Japan,
such as those in the field of economy, trade and culture.
</P>
<P>
Muraoka expressed his hope that Japanese governmental funds
would be invested in such areas as Tibet's infrastructure,
electric power, and cultural relics preservation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Oil Prices to Change Filipinos' Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A new oil pricing system taking
effect in the Philippines this month is expected to lead to price
hikes in transport fares and power rates that are closely related
to people's daily life.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department and the Energy Regulatory Board announced
on Wednesday that the long-awaited automatic pricing mechanism
took effect at 6 AM on the same day, marking the start of the
partial deregulation of the oil industry after 20 years of tight
control by the government.
</P>
<P>
Under the new pricing scheme based on prices posted by
Singapore, prices of premium, unleaded and regular gasoline will
rise by 50 centavos (two U.S. cents) per liter and the price of
fuel oil by 0.14 centavo (0.006 U.S. cent) per liter.
</P>
<P>
Prices of socially sensitive petroleum products, such as
kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), will decline by an
average of 55 centavos (2.1 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
Two more waves of oil price hikes are expected in the next two
months' implementation of the new mechanism as dealers and haulers
of oil products will be allowed to immediately pass on to
consumers the rises in their operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Regulatory Board announced that oil prices in the
whole industry will be totally deregulated and adjusted by the
market demand after March 1997.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos said that the new pricing system will not
result in a higher inflation rate and lower living conditions of
the majority of the population.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new scheme will only raise the prices of
gasoline and other fuel products which are being used by the
affluent and will not affect LPG and kerosene that are widely used
by middle- and low-income households.
</P>
<P>
However, local analysts, appearing less optimistic, said that
while it is true that people will save money by consuming kerosene
and LPG, they will have to spend more on traffic and power because
operators in the two industries have complained about rising costs
under the new scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Jeepney Operators and Drivers of the
Philippines, which has a membership of 300,000, said it will file
a petition next week for a 50-centavos (two U.S. cents) fare rise
from the current minimum fare of 1.5 pesos (six U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
Jeepney operators and drivers are threatening to stage a strike
if their demand is rejected by the government, said the
federation.
</P>
<P>
Taxi operators and drivers are asking for more than doubling
the present flag-down rate from the prevailing 12.5 pesos (48 U.S.
cents) to 26.5 pesos (one U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
The Integrated Metro Bus Operators Association and the
Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines are
planning to demand a minimum 15-centavo (0.6 U.S. cent) rise in
fares for ordinary buses.
</P>
<P>
In the power sector, the state-owned National Power Corporation
(NAPOCOR) will raise its power charges by 6.22 centavos (0.25 U.S.
cent) per kilowatt hour in two rounds of price change by the end
of September. It has attributed the planned hike to higher prices
of fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these negative impacts, the analysts nevertheless
acknowledged that the new oil pricing mechanism would help the
country's oil industry become healthier and closer to the
international standard.

<HEADLINE> Used-Car Imports for Commercial Purposes Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) --The South African government
will not allow cheap used cars to be imported into the
country for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
In a national assembly debate on thursday, Trade and Industry
Minister Alex Erwin said importing cheap used cars would, though
reduce car prices, undermine the country's motor industry.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said permits to import used cars had been given to
private owners only, and in narrowly defined circumstances.
</P>
<P>
This meant that about 50 used cars a month entered South
Africa legally, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said these used car imports could not have any material
effect on the motor industry because they constituted only about
0.15 percent of the annual market for new cars in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Permits are not issued for the import of used cars for
commercial purposes," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a large number of used vehicles which were
imported from overseas by other countries in the Southern African
Customs Unions had entered South Africa illegally.
</P>
<P>
These illegal import of used cars through neighbouring
countries or directly into South Africa is of concern to the
Department of Trade and Industry, said Erwin.

<HEADLINE> Photos Now Giving Tibetans Less Of A Shock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, Augest 16 (Xinhua) -- A middle-aged Tibetan cadre says
he still remembers the past clearly when Tibetans believed that if
one's photo was taken one's soul would be taken by the machine.
</P>
<P>
Visitors with cameras around their necks encounter a different
situation today: Tibetans asking them to take a photo with their
camera.
</P>
<P>
These people are usually young men or children who express
their willingness by gesturing and very often posing and leaving
no time for a refusal. And how would anyone with film refuse their
plea?
</P>
<P>
Old hands might be astonished by this, because of the memory of
Tibetans being afraid of or shy around cameras. "If you walked
along the street and carried a camera with you in those days, you
could not expect to be very welcome and very possibly you might
get into trouble, even in Lhasa," the cadre says.
</P>
<P>
His colleague, a cadre of the Han nationality adds: "When I
first came to Tibet, an important principle we were told
repeatedly was not to take photos of the Tibetans whenever we
wanted."
</P>
<P>
According to the cadre, the opening-up policy and more visitors
coming to Tibet, as well as the raising of the region's education
level are the main reasons for this change.
</P>
<P>
Although cameras are still not popular among households in this
region, they are no longer strange to most Tibetans. There are
photo studios appearing in all cities like bamboo shoots after a
spring rain.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays taking a group photo has come to be one of the most
exciting things for a Tibetan family to do on holidays, and a
photo that is considered commonplace to visitors from the outside
may be a life-long joy for an older Tibetan," says a person who
has visited here repeatedly.

<HEADLINE> 15,000 Tanzanian Soldiers To Be Retrenched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen thousand soldiers
will be dropped out of the Tanzanian army in a trim-down exercise
this year.
</P>
<P>
The local paper "Business Times" today quoted Principal
Secretary in the Presidential Office, Joseph Rugumyamheto, as
saying that the retrenchment exercise will cost about 80 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Those who will be trimmed are mainly rank and file officers.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the retrenchment will however depend on
availability of the funds from donors, Rugumyamheto told a
meeting attended by representatives from the World Bank, The
European Union, the Swedish Development Agency (SIDA), British
Oversease Development Administration (ODA) and other donors who
had met to asses the country's progress on the civil service
reform.

"We have requested donor countries to assist and if they do,
We are prepared to act this financial year", Rugumyamheto said.
"Retrenchment in armed forces is aimed at retaining a small but
efficient army," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Prime Minister to Sue Okinawa Governor Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto instructed justice authorities today to sue Okinawa
Governor Masahide Ota to force him to renew land leases for the
U.S. military in the southernmost island prefecture, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third suit brought by the central government
against Ota over the U.S. bases issue in an attempt to get the
governor to carry out what it claims are his gubernatorial duties.
</P>
<P>
Ota has rejected Hashimoto's order that he take procedures
required to renew land leases for Kadena Air Base and 10 other
U.S. military facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Naha Branch of the Fukuoka High Court is expected to give a
ruling at year-end or afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto asked Ota to act as proxy for the mayors of nine
cities, towns and villages, where the 11 bases are located, after
the municipal governments refused to put on display public papers
required expropriating the land plots.
</P>
<P>
Ota defied the prime minister's order, saying an agreement
between the Japanese and U.S. governments to reduce the amount of
land occupied by the U.S. military by one-fifth does not go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
Ota's refusal to cooperate with the central government over the
bases issue followed a public outcry over the U.S. military
presence on the island after three U.S. servicemen raped a teenage
schoolgirl last September. The three American soldiers are now
serving prison terms.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of all Japanese land for U.S. military use is
concentrated in Okinawa, which accounts for only 0.6 percent of
Japan's total territory and is located about 1,600 kilometers
southwest of Tokyo. Some 30,000 of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan
are stationed in the prefecture.

<HEADLINE> Code of Ethics for Parliamentary Members Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A code of ethics for South
African Parliamentary Members (MPS) has been adopted by both
houses of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The code of ethics, which will compel MPS to record their
financial interests in a special parliamentary register, was
adopted by the senate on Thursday after it was approved by the
national assembly on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the code, the register, which will be monitored
by an all-party committee, will be conducted partly public and
partly confidential.
</P>
<P>
All parties in parliament supported the code's adoption,
except the abstention of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).
</P>
<P>
The IFP claimed that while it supported such a mechanism in
principle, it chosed to abstain because of strong reservations
about the specifics of the code.
</P>
<P>
Its objection, which shared by the National Party (NP), is
against the majority by the African National Congress (ANC) in
the monitoring committee.
</P>
<P>
The IFP argued that all parties should have equal
representation in the monitoring committee, while the NP said
there should at least be equality between the ANC and the
combined opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Replying to the debate in the senate on Thursday, Water
Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal, who chaired the joint
parliamentary rules sub-committee which drew up the code, said it
is not undemocratic or unethical that the ANC should have a
majority.
</P>
<P>
Following the adoption by parliament of its code of ethics,
the cabinet's already-accepted code of conduct for ministers was
"a matter for publication", he said.
</P>
<P>
When the code was adopted by the national assembly, Speaker
Frene Ginwala said: "We can truly congratulate ourselves today.
This is a major step in setting standards for democratic
representatives in south africa."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government has
created 120,000 new jobs since it came to power some four years
ago, the local daily Beirut Diyar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Fuad Sinyoura, minister of state for
financial affairs, as saying at a recent seminar organized in
Beirut by the Harvard Business Administration Club that 180,000
new subscribers for the National Fund for Social Security have
been registered over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the government, after it came to power
in October 1992, had been able to retrieve the world's confidence
in Lebanon and its economy, stablize the Lebanese currency and put
an end to security breaches, which hindered economic revival
plans.
</P>
<P>
"Economy does not leap forward," he said, "economy grows."
</P>
<P>
He added the government was contacting donor countries like
the United States, the European Union, Far Eastern countries and
Arab countries to raise the necessary funds to finance
reconstruction plans.
</P>
<P>
One of the priorities of the government was to find new
employments for the Lebanese, "especially when 40,000 new
applications for jobs are handed over annually to the labor
market," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Reactionary Views on History Must Be Reckoned with, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily today carried
a commentary titled "Japan's Reactionary Views on History Must Be
Reckoned With." The full text of the article reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
It surprised nobody that the annually-staged political farce
was put on again this year.
</P>
<P>
On August 15, the anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War
II, several cabinet ministers and scores of Diet (parliament)
members, one on another's heels, paid homage at the Yasukuni
Shrine where tablets of seven class-A war criminals, including
wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo, are enshrined.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing politicians' worshipping of the war criminals
came shortly after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's visit to the
shrine on July 29.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the right-wing politicians, a handful of
rightist civilians piped and drummed in the shrine to try to
revive the dying embers of militarism. They wore the uniform of
the Imperial Japanese Army, with saber on the belt, and waved
flags of aggression.
</P>
<P>
The antics on Thursday reminded the world again that Japan's
political orientation should be closely watched and the guard can
never be lowered.
</P>
<P>
As everyone knows, the Tokyo-based Yasukuni Shrine is a symbol
of aggression and expansion abroad and to visit the shrine has
become a test of the attitudes of Japanese political figures
toward Japan's war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
August 15 is the day marking the liberation of Asian nations
from Japanese imperialism and the defeat and surrender of Japanese
imperialists. But at the same time, it also serves as the
anniversary of the spiritual liberation of the Japanese from
militarist rule.
</P>
<P>
On the day, political figures of Japan should have, with a
guilty conscience, mourned the deaths of tens of millions of
victims in other Asian nations as well as in Japan, and should
have reflected in deep introspection of that period in history and
drawn lessons from it.
</P>
<P>
Only by doing so can they be responsible to history and for the
future of Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, a handful of rightist politicians have paid homage to
the Yasukuni Shrine every year, ignoring the feelings of the
people of other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
To put it bluntly, the act of these politicians represents no
less than a provocation against the Asian people and a challenge
to the international community. Their behavior can also be
interpreted as a complete exposure of their reactionary political
minds.
</P>
<P>
Half a century has passed since the end of World War II, and
there has long been a final conclusion to the following: it was
the Japanese imperialists, together with the German and Italian
fascists, that launched the war. It was Japan which invaded,
occupied and enslaved other Asian countries, and it was Japan that
brought unheard-of calamity to all Asian people, including the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
This is a historical fact borne by ironclad evidence, and no
one can reverse it.
</P>
<P>
Undisguised words to reverse the nature of the war of
aggression can hardly be heard anywhere in the world today, except
in Japan. There speeches to whitewash its history of aggression
run rampant, and farces to falsify its war of aggression can be
staged in the broad day light.
</P>
<P>
This is something shocking, infuriating, and worthy of deep
thought.
</P>
<P>
It is not accidental that such weird occurrences appear in
Japan. Actually, it is a conspicuous expression of the right-wing
political trend in the country and a natural result of the fact
that Japan's reactionary historical perspectives have not been
reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
After Japan surrendered in 1945, the United States, an
occupier, tried vigorously to turn Japan into an anti-Communist
"breakwater", or a "bridgehead", and propped up a right-wing
regime in the country, out of consideration of its own Cold War
policy.
</P>
<P>
Under such political circumstances, with the old state
machinery not smashed, the war crimes unsettled and the
perspectives of militarism untouched, many war criminals, who had
not been punished, entered the political arena and soared to
important government posts.
</P>
<P>
Japan has not reckoned with, nor is it able to reckon with its
historical and war perspectives preaching aggression and
expansion. As a result, a large number of war criminals still
remain at large and many right-wing groups have not been
investigated for openly trying to justify the war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Instead, many progressive forces upholding the eradication of
militarism in Japan have been threatened, persecuted, and even put
in prison.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, on the nature of the war of aggression, right and
wrong are still confused and there is no justice at all in the
Japanese society.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Reactionary Views on History Must Be Reckoned with,  Says China's The People's Daily (Part 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, with Japan rising as an economic power, quite
a few people, in order to whitewash the aggression, wantonly
spread lies to obscure the nature of the aggression and to cover
up war crimes
</P>
<P>
They distorted "aggression" as "entry" in textbooks, denied the
"Nanking (Nanjing) Massacre" and praised the aggression as
"liberating Asians." These are typical examples of their evil
motives to whitewash Japan's war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Flaunting the flag of "sequela of defeated nation", they
preached it as "self-maltreatment" for the Japanese to admit the
aggression and reflect on the wicked war.
</P>
<P>
With ulterior motives and under the pretext of victims of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs, they purposely obscured the
demarcation line between victims and criminals of the war,
resulting in ideological confusion among the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
As a result, all kinds of absurd formulations such as
"meritorious aggression", "justified revision" and "detrimental
apology" keep popping up.
</P>
<P>
Last year, on the eve of marking the 50th anniversary of the
victory of the anti-Fascist war, the Japanese Diet, under pressure
from the international community, passed a very indecent "no-war
resolution" after a half year of wrangling within itself.
</P>
<P>
It became an international laughing stock as the resolution ran
counter to the vicious purposes of those politicians who attempted
to cheat on world opinion.
</P>
<P>
Because such reactionary perspectives of history have not been
reckoned with, rightist thinking is increasingly rampant in the
Japanese political arena.
</P>
<P>
Narrow-minded nationalism gradually found its way back and a
few political parties have retrogressed in policy-making along
with breaking the taboo of sending troops overseas and
strengthening the Japanese-U.S. military alliance.
</P>
<P>
A few political parties brazenly challenged Clause 9 of the
Japanese Constitution. They foully tried to revise some more
important clauses such as "land, sea, and air forces, as well as
other war potential, will never be maintained," -- "The right of
belligerence of the state will not be recognized" and the phrase
-- "specialized defense".
</P>
<P>
A handful of bigoted politicians refused to acknowledge the
1945 trial by the international tribunal of the Japanese war
criminals, screaming that it was a trial by victors against the
defeated.
</P>
<P>
It is an obvious sign of rampant attempts to reverse the nature
of the war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
This shows that to date, there are still several politicians in
the country who want to revive the dream of building the so-called
"Great East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere."
</P>
<P>
The visit to Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese right-wing politicians
is just a tip of an iceberg.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Japanese society is at the turning period while
Japanese politics are at the crossroads.
</P>
<P>
It is very natural that Japan, a big economy, wants to play a
greater role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
But how can other peoples rest assured when Japan sticks to
that conception of history and meanwhile shows eagerness to play
the role of a big power in the world?
</P>
<P>
Serious self-examination of the history of invasion is the
basic prerequisite for Japan to win the trust of other Asian
nations and the international community.
</P>
<P>
If some Japanese politicians obstinately deliver those unwise
words time and again, they will only make fools of themselves
before others, damage the international image of Japan and
humiliate the Japanese people. Their act will definitely meet with
opposition and resistance from the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
Only by the exposure, criticism and the relinquishing of the
reactionary conception of history, as well as by taking the road
of peace and development, can the fundamental benefit and future
of Japan be built on.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Promoted In Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The central China province of
Hunan has vigorously promoted its travel industry by developing
special tourist programs and cultivating a travel souvenir
manufacturing and marketing system.
</P>
<P>
Hunan boasts many natural scenic sites and places of cultural
and historical interests, including Wulingyuan in Zhangjiajie,
which has been listed as a World Heritage site, unique folk
customs in western Hunan, Mount Hengshan which is one of the five
most famous mountains in China, the former residence of Mao
Zedong, and the Ancient tomb in Mawangdui.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen major tourist zones have been established, featuring
Hunan's famous mountains. And the province has also cooperated
with other regions to open trans-provincial travel routes.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Hunan has focused on improving basic
facilities for its tourism business. With airports in Changsha and
Zhangjiajie going into operation, new air routes to Hong Kong,
Bangkok and Macao have been initiated recently.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45 star-rated hotels have been built and opened for
service across the province, with a capacity of over 400,000
overseas visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
A tourist souvenir trading center in Nanyue city has become one
of the biggest in China, with more than 2,000 kinds of souvenirs
traded, 5,000 people employed, and an average annual business
volume over 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
To develop souvenir manufacturing and marketing, Hunan plans to
build six more bases and develop about 100 new kinds of souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hunan received 177,000 overseas tourists and 25
million domestic visitors, creating revenue surpassing 5.1 billion
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Local Plant Seed for Water Treatment Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The seed of moringa, a local
plant, has been discovered by Zambia's National Council for
Scientific Research (NCSR ) as a water coagulant in water
treatment that may save the country millions of us dollars.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by William Chishimba, Acting Head of the
NCSR tree improvement reseach center on Thursday when he met
Kabunda Kayongo, Minister of Science, Technology and Vocational
Training.
</P>
<P>
Chishimba said that the efficiency of moringa which had
already been demonstrated to Kitwe city council was found to be
very satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The moringa oleifera multi-purpose seed has the same
properties of aluminium sulphate as water coagulant and the oil
extracted from the seed can be used in soap making while its
leaves are ideal for relish, according to Chishimba.
</P>
<P>
Chishimba said that local authorities like Kitwe city council
which spended their fortunes on importing aluminium sulphate from
outside the country during these hard economic times will gain a
lot from the development of technology.
</P>
<P>
The NCSR tree improvement research center plans to establish a
1.5-hectare pilot plantation containing 3,750 moringa plants by
December to January. The project is very viable to the nation and
it does not require a lot of funding to take off.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Police on Alert, Prepared for Religious Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Highly-alert Jerusalem police
are stepping up preparations to prevent any possible disturbances
by ultra-orthodox Jews at the weekend as a result of an
unfavorable High Court ruling on the controversial Bar-Ilan Street
in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
Haredim is planning mass demonstrations at 30 Jerusalem
intersections Saturday to protest the decision.
</P>
<P>
The High Court of Justice decided Thursday that The Bar-Ilan
Street in Jerusalem will remain open to traffic on Shabbat for
the time bing, but a public commission will be set up to
study the whole issue of traffic arrangements in the city on
Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
A seven-justice panel issued the ruling after hearing four
petitions against the government's decision to close a portion
of the road during prayer times on Shabbat for a four-month
trial period.
</P>
<P>
Three of the petitions, representing the desire of secular
residents, demanded that the road not be closed at all while the
fourth wanted the road closed for all of Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, however, the court concluded that it
was impossible to decide on closing one street without examining
the entire picture of traffic flow in Jerusalem on Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the court decision, religious activist Yehuda
Meshi-Zahav declared that the only possible response to the
court's ruling was to escalate the battle by expanding it beyond
Bar-Ilan. Therefore, he said that they plan to bring "tens of
thousands" to demonstrate at 30 unspecified intersections in the
city this Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
"The court has proven that it is a branch of Meretz (leftwing
secular party). As long as (the Bar-Ilan Street) remains open, we
will not stay at home," Meshi-Zahav threatened.
</P>
<P>
The Haredim move is in open defiance of the court's call to let
the public commission "operate in a calm atmosphere, without
threats or violence."
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani called for "Jerusalem
residents to continue to obey the law, in light of the High
Court decision," according a statement released by his spokesman
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Police were on hand around Mea She'arim and other neighborhoods
in the city Thursday night for fear that unrest should erupt
immediately after the court decision. Jerusalem Police Chief Arye
Amit called a meeting of police brass to discuss plans to handle
any expected unrest.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Olmert, Likud Member of Knesset and Mayor of Jerusalem,
also joined the call for restraint.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
refuted opposition's call for the postponement of the next
general elections due to be held in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement yesterday, Kenya's ruling party KANU
described the call for the postonement of the election made by
the opposition and the self-appointed human rights groups as a
"theatrical move" by lovers of jungle laws and anarchy.
</P>
<P>
The party's Secretary-General Joseph Kamotho cautioned the
politicians against opposition's agitation on constitutional
review.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no merit in trying to apply jungle laws.
KANU will continue to uphold the sanctity of the constitution and
its provisions setting out how it can be amended and that nobody
would be allowed to meddle with it, he added.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has been insisting the constitutional reform so
that it can benefit from the items such as date of the election
and term of the presidency which it will propose to the
constitution during the forthcoming multi-party general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Kamotho, who is also Kenyan Minister for Education, said those
agitating for constitutional amendments are enemies of the
millions of Kenyans who cherished unity peace and freedom.
</P>
<P>
He urged Kenyans to treat the calls for constitutional
amendments as chap incitement tactics.
</P>
<P>
Kenya held the first multi-party general elections in 1992 one
year after the country adopted the pluralism.

<HEADLINE> Japan Plans to Destroy Chemical Weapons Abandoned in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan plans to start destruction
in 1998 of the chemical weapons left behind in China by the
Japanese Imperial Army at the end of its war of aggression against
its neighboring countries, a leading Japanese daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials will discuss the plan for dismantling the
poisonous gas shells with Chinese officials in consultations
between the two governments slated for this autumn, the Asahi
Shimbun said in a front-page story.
</P>
<P>
China said Japan had abandoned some 2 million toxic shells in
its territory, mostly in the northeastern region, before and after
Japan's surrender to the Allied troops on August 15, 1945.
</P>
<P>
During the 1937-45 war, the Japanese army used poisonous gas
for at least 2,900 times, killing some 80,000 Chinese, according
to historians.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Japan has dispatched officials to China to
assess soil contamination from decaying chemical weapons and has
been preparing for the disposal of gas shells under a chemical
weapon prohibition treaty ratified by 61 countries, including
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The treaty obliges signatory countries to dismantle within the
next decade any chemical weapons abandoned after January 1925
without consent in another country.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologist Discovers Stone Paintings in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Gai Shanlin, a famous Chinese
archaeologist, has discovered a natural gallery of stone paintings
extending to over one thousand kilometers in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Gai works for the Regional Research Institute for Archaeology
and Cultural Relics. His discovery was based on 20-year research
and study for the stone paintings.
</P>
<P>
There are at least 60,000 ancient pictures painted on the
stones along the grassland art corridor, according to Gai.
</P>
<P>
"I have made over 5,000 copies of them, which date from the
Neolithic Age to the feudal dynasties. The painters were hunters,
herdsmen and priests from a variety of ethnic groups in the area,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He spent five years in the Yinshan Mountain Area and discovered
over 10,000 pictures.
</P>
<P>
"The stone paintings here rank first in number and artistic
value," he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
The paintings illustrate the activities of people hunting,
farming, dancing and fighting, along with drawings of animals,
stars, religious signals and ancient characters.
</P>
<P>
His discovery of thumb print pictures on cave stones in the
area proved that China had its own art style 30,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The stone paintings also demonstrate ancient people's struggle
with nature, and their worship practices using traditional totems.
</P>
<P>
Gai has published many academic papers on the stone paintings
and a number of works about his legend. At the same time, he has
been invited to give lectures in dozens of universities in the
United States and Canada.

to launch promotion drives in Europe and Australia to attract more
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The province has worked out a detailed program for next year's
tourist events to mark '97 China Holiday, the theme designated by
the China National Tourism Administration for China's tourism
business in 1997 .
</P>
<P>
The eight cities of Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Weihai, Weifang,
Zibo, Tai'an and Jining will be focal points the events, according
to the program.
</P>
<P>
And major events will include: inaugurating ceremonies for 97'
China Holiday, held in Jinan and Qingdao, a travel fair in Jinan,
tours of the Taishan Mountain for foreign nationals of Chinese
origin, and recreational activities in the Shilaoren (Stone Old
Man) National Tourism and Holiday Zone in Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
Shandong will also launch promotion campaigns in Japan, the
Republic of Korea and Singapore to draw a growing number of
overseas travelers, and participate in major international travel
fairs.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Shandong received 450,000 overseas tourists and reaped
157 million US dollars in foreign-exchange earnings. The two
figures made the province rank among the top ten tourist markets
in China.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea was the biggest source country for the
province's tourism business, with one third of overseas travelers
coming from that country, followed by Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shandong will increase tourism promotion in western Europe and
Australia next year, in addition to endeavors to retain their
existing markets.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents in
Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh killed 49 people and seriously
wounded another 199 in the first half of this year, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial News said a total of 308 traffic accidents were
registered in the capital in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Police officials said the accidents were mainly attributed to
people's poor awareness of the importance of observing traffic
rules.
</P>
<P>
Traffic rules request drivers to drive along the right side of
the road but most of them ignored the rules in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The absence of traffic lights at crossings has also added to
traffic chaos, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Spend 3.85 Billion Dollars on Roads in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has planned to spend 3.85
billion dollars in building new highways and improving the
existing road networks in five years, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ali Harajli, Minister of Public Works, was quoted by Beirut's
An-Nahar daily as saying that 1.993 billion dollars were
appropriated by the cabinet according to Bill 246 for
building highway, improving Beirut's entrances and promoting
the services in the capital and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
"But this sum was not enough to complete the projects, so
we handed over to the Council of Ministers an application
for an additional 1,857 million dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Harajli noted that 1.25 billion dollars of the supplementary
budget would be used to expand the road networks, and the
remainder was for offsetting the deficit in expenditures.
</P>
<P>
He announced that this year his ministry would strive "to fill
up excavations on roads and I believe that the efforts have borne
fruits."
</P>
<P>
But he did not expect that this job would be finished in a
short period "It will need at least two years to level all the
excavations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He complained that municipalities excavated the roads from
time to time without referring to the ministry, so did the
water, electricity and telephone companies and even some
citizens digging the roads to lay water pipes.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Swan Spend Summer in Bayanbulak Grasslands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of swans which survived
the severe snowstorm hitting the area in April are spending the
summer in the Bayanbulak grasslands, in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Compared with previous years, the number of swans on the
grasslands has slight decreased, and the ratio of swans which are
breeding is also less, said an official with the wild animal
protection organization of the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
But the grasslands have lush pastures in the season, which
provide swans with plentiful food. The weight of the swans is now
back to the normal level, and they will be capable of migrating in
the autumn, he added.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow fell in the region of southwest Tianshan Mountains
in April, killing almost 500 swans. Five tons of foods were sent
to the animal-protected zones after the blizzard, and local
herdsmen bred injuried swans in their homes.
</P>
<P>
Scientific research results have shown that although the
disaster led to a decline in swan numbers, no destructive blow has
ever been struck upon the ecological protection system of the
swan. It is expected that the number of swans will resume to the
normal level in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
Summer is a breeding and moulting period for the swan, and
white plumes can be seen floating in every swamp at the
grasslands. Cygnets with grey feathers stick closely to their
parents all the time. They can not fly until mid September, then,
after a month of training, they will fly with their parents over
the Himalaya Mountains, the highest mountain in the world.
</P>
<P>
It is said that mountain climbers once saw the swans on their
migratory route at an elevation of about 9,000 meters above sea
level when they were on the top of the Himalaya Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Some swans spend the winter at the lakes of the Bayanbulak
grasslands, where they can withstand cold weathers with
temperatures of more than 40 degrees below zero centigrade.
</P>
<P>
The swan is the largest bird in China and the world's largest
swan egg, weighing 427 g, was also found in a nest of the
Bayanbulak grasslands.
</P>
<P>
There are seven species of swan in the world, three of them
live in China, which all can be seen in the Bayanbulak grasslands,
It is the first and largest wild swan natural protected zone in
China, with about 6,000 swans living in the zone every
year.

<HEADLINE> IFP Not To Make Submission to Truth Commission, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) of South Africa would not make a submission on its
involvement in past human rights violations to the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, IFP spokesman Ed Tillett has said.
</P>
<P>
A local daily "Sowetan" today quoted the IFP spokesman as
saying that the IFP declines to make an official submission
because the commission, chaired by the archbishop Desmond Tutu,
was "sufficiently loaded" with people who support the African
National Congress (ANC ).
</P>
<P>
But the party will encourage its members to testify on their
own behalf before the commission according to "individual
conscience", the paper said.
</P>
<P>
All major political parties of South Africa are expected to
make their submissions on their role in past human rights abuses
to the truth commission over four days next week. They include
the ruling ANC, the Pan Africanist Congress, the Freedom Front,
the African Christian Democratic Party and the National Party
(NP).
</P>
<P>
Tillet said that since IFP had reservations and concerns about
the activities and political profile of many of the
commissioners, it doesn't want to "legitimise the commission and
give official blessing to it by making an official submission".
</P>
<P>
The ANC is expected to make a submission that will apply for
amnesty for its members who were involved in human rights abuses
committed in its anti-apartheid struggle both inside and outside
the country, said the report.
</P>
<P>
While the NP will make an oral submission by the party leader
F. W. De Klerk next Wednesday to present an in-depth view as to
what happened before 1994.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto: Indonesia Makes High Economic Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has scored remarkable
economic achievements in the past 20 years or so, with the
country's per-capita income exceeding 1,000 U.S. dollars, 14 times
that in 1969, President Soeharto said today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to parliament on the occasion of the 51st
anniversary of the country's independence, Soeharto said the
per-capita income, in real terms, has increased by more than three
times.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the more than two decades that have passed, the
country's economy has been growing at an average annual rate of
6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the growth rate reached 7.5 percent in 1994 and 8.1
percent in 1995, he said Indonesia's economic prospects remained
encouraging for the current sixth Five-Year Development Plan
(1994-1999).
</P>
<P>
While at least 60 out of 100 Indonesians were living below the
poverty line in 1969, there are now fewer than 14 out of 100
Indonesians are classified as very poor, Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
"Through various programs, we are working hard together so that
at the latest in ten years, we will be able to eradicate this
poverty in absolute terms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1971 and 1995, almost 44 million new jobs were created,
cutting the unemployment rate by more than a half, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the productivity of Indonesian workers has also
gone up and it almost doubled between 1985 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said Indonesia's illiteracy declined from around 40
percent in 1971 to less than 14 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On public health service, he said there are around 7,000 public
health centers and 21,000 auxiliary centers across the country,
which are supported by thousands of doctors, paramedics and
mid-wives.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are 49,000 mid-wives in Indonesian villages
today and only 10 percent of the country's villages are left with
no mid-wives.

<HEADLINE>   Netanyahu, Levy to Meet for Healing Rift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister David Levy will meet
Sunday in a bid to solve their differences which have caused a
crisis within the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
In a reconciliatory gesture, Netanyahu had a phone
conversation with Levy late Thursday night as soon as the latter
had returned home from a five-day private visit to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Levy flew to New York last Sunday to attend the wedding
of a Likud supporter's daughter, after he complained about
being sidelined by the prime minister in conducting foreign
contacts.
</P>
<P>
The two long-time political rivals have halted working
contacts since early this month, and Levy has shunned all
cabinet meetings to voice his protest.
</P>
<P>
Levy returned from the U.S. Thursday evening just in time for
an inner security cabinet meeting on discussing the plans of
Israeli troops' redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, instead of attending the meeting, Levy traveled
directly from the airport to his home in Beit She'an. He
left the airport tight-lipped, refusing to say anything to
waiting reporters.
</P>
<P>
Levy was reported to be considering resignation early this
week, the third time in only two months since the Likud-led
coalition took power. In late June and early July, Levy
threatened twice to resign in order to pressure Netanyahu
to bring Ariel Sharon, the Likud veteran power-broker and
Levy's strong ally, into the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was defused only after Netanyahu on July 8
appointed Sharon as Minister of the newly-created National
Infrastructure Ministry. But the deep-rooted feud between
Netanyahu and Levy, which dates back to 1993 when they vied for
the Likud's leadership, has deepened ever since.
</P>
<P>
Levy has barely functioned as foreign minister since
taking office, as he was denied information of important
foreign contacts done by the Prime Minister Office, which has
acted as the de facto Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The central issue in the recent dispute is that Levy
wants to lead the crucial negotiations with the Palestinian
National Authority, while Netanyahu insists on his tight control
over the matter.

BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The central China province of
Hunan is expecting a record number of tourists this month, the
all-time peak season for the local tourism business, China Tourism
News reports.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the large-scale floods hitting the province last
month, many tour groups have delayed their travels until August,
while the number of groups due in August is roughly the same as
the same month of last year, according to Zhang Jimin, director of
the provincial tourism administration.
</P>
<P>
The paper says travel agencies and hotels across the province
have reported good reservations for this month.
</P>
<P>
Zhang revealed that none of Hunan's major scenic zones were
harmed by the floods, and no tourist were besieged or hurt by the
floods.
</P>
<P>
Road, railway and water transport cut down by the floods in
some areas have now all resumed, the paper quotes the director as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He assured visitors that they need not have any worry about
public hygiene in Hunan, as there have been no cases of epidemic
diseases detected in flood-affected areas thanks to good
prevention measures.

BANGKOK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's passenger car sales
expanded by only 1.2 percent and the overall vehicle market grew
by only 6.3 percent in the first half of this year compared with
the same period of last year, according to the Thai Automobile
Industry Club.
</P>
<P>
The inactive automobile market mainly stemmed from the sluggish
economy, forcing auto-leasing firms to consider loan applications
very carefully.
</P>
<P>
Two other restricting measures imposed by the central bank at
the end of last year -- down payment of at least 25 percent of the
price and maximum 48 monthly installments -- also adversely
affected the purchasing power of new car buyers, according to
Surapong Paisitpattanapong, spokesman for the Automobile Industry
Club.
</P>
<P>
Vehicle sales in July were down by 5.7 percent from the same
month last year to 43,000 units, and passenger car sales shrank by
1.8 percent to 12,700 units.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months, vehicles sales totaled 333,155
units, up by 4.6 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
Slumps for the second consecutive month in July in every
vehicle segment have made auto makers face an uphill battle to
meet the 600,000-unit overall sales goal predicted by the club.

<HEADLINE> German Airline May Stop Flights to Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany's national flag
carrier Lufthansa is considering stopping its flight operation to
Kathmandu by May 1997 due to the air transit problem, a local
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
A Lufthansa spokesman told a travel agency in Berlin earlier
this week that the German airline may stop flying to Nepal, The
Kathmandu Post reported.
</P>
<P>
So far Lufthansa has stopped bookings on its Kathmandu flights
beyond May 1997, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted German sources here as saying that the final
decision on Lufthansa's flights to Nepal is to be made within one
or two months.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa was forced to consider stopping its Kathmandu
operation as Pakistan announced earlier that it will not allow
Lufthansa to pick up passengers in Karachi for its
Frankfurt-Kathmandu flights from May 1996, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Lufthansa is the only European airline operating in
Nepal and it flies twice a week between Germany and Nepal via
Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's tourism industry was shocked by the Lufthansa
announcement because the possible cancellation would be a major
setback to the fledgling industry, which has become a top foreign
exchange earner for the country.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa is one of the two airlines linking Nepal to the
European market at present. The other one is Nepal's national
carrier, the Royal Nepal Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry sources here have suggested the Nepali
government should lobby Pakistan to lift the restrictions on
Lufthansa, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal plans to launch a grand tourism promotion program named
"Visit Nepal Year 1998," hoping to attract 500,000 foreign
tourists in 1998.
</P>
<P>
European countries, especially Germany, are Nepal's major
tourism markets.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Legislating to Protect Cultivated Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
worked out regulations to protect cultivated land, which will
become effective on September 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Anhui's population increases by up to
800,000 a year, while the amount of cultivated land reduced at the
rate of 13,000 hectares every year.
</P>
<P>
The situation of "more people, less land" is a limit for
 provincial economic development. The recently passed regulations
provide a legal basis for the purpose of protecting cultivated
land.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, it will be illegal to use
cultivated land for other purposes, such as mining or building
non-agricultural structures.
</P>
<P>
The regulations state that people not following the rule will
be fined or face disciplinary warnings. A supervisory system will
be set up to ensure the enforcement of the regulation.

<HEADLINE> Plant Kingdom Helping Make Fortunes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Biological resources are
expected to be worth a lot soon in southwest China's Yunnan
Province, the "kingdom of plants", after the central and
provincial authorities put four billion yuan into an ambitious
10-year program.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to make bio-resources a pillar industry and new
economic engine in the province, which has more than 18,000 higher
order plant species, nearly two-thirds of China's total, by
comprehensively developing 42 major plants in 18 categories.
</P>
<P>
Annual output value of the project, which was begun in 1995, is
expected to hit 10 billion yuan, or one-third of GDP in Yunnan, by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is at a low latitude and has favorable climate for
various plants and has earned big money from cultivating flowers,
coffee, plants for perfume, and mushrooms. The large market
potential and high-tech planting methods have helped the
industry's development.
</P>
<P>
The project has also drawn investors from Switzerland, France,
Japan, the United States, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao,
with overseas investment in the sector amounting to 10 million
yuan. Provincial authorities have adopted many incentives to woo
more investors.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng highly praised the project during a recent
visit to the province, saying that it makes good use of abundant
resources and raises farmers' incomes and will contribute a great
deal to economic development.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said that Yunnan has found an "ideal and
realistic" shortcut to improving its economy and narrowing the gap
with coastal areas.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Reactionary Views on History Must Be Reckoned with, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily today carried
a commentary titled "Japan's Reactionary Views on History Must Be
Reckoned With." The full text of the article reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
It surprised nobody that the annually-staged political farce
was put on again this year.
</P>
<P>
On August 15, the anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War
II, several cabinet ministers and scores of Diet (parliament)
members, one on another's heels, paid homage at the Yasukuni
Shrine where tablets of seven class-A war criminals, including
wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo, are enshrined.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing politicians' worshipping of the war criminals
came shortly after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's visit to the
shrine on July 29.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the right-wing politicians, a handful of
rightist civilians piped and drummed in the shrine to try to
revive the dying embers of militarism. They wore the uniform of
the Imperial Japanese Army, with saber on the belt, and waved
flags of aggression.
</P>
<P>
The antics on Thursday reminded the world again that Japan's
political orientation should be closely watched and the guard can
never be lowered.
</P>
<P>
As everyone knows, the Tokyo-based Yasukuni Shrine is a symbol
of aggression and expansion abroad and to visit the shrine has
become a test of the attitudes of Japanese political figures
toward Japan's war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
August 15 is the day marking the liberation of Asian nations
from Japanese imperialism and the defeat and surrender of Japanese
imperialists. But at the same time, it also serves as the
anniversary of the spiritual liberation of the Japanese from
militarist rule.
</P>
<P>
On the day, political figures of Japan should have, with a
guilty conscience, mourned the deaths of tens of millions of
victims in other Asian nations as well as in Japan, and should
have reflected in deep introspection of that period in history and
drawn lessons from it.
</P>
<P>
Only by doing so can they be responsible to history and for the
future of Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, a handful of rightist politicians have paid homage to
the Yasukuni Shrine every year, ignoring the feelings of the
people of other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
To put it bluntly, the act of these politicians represents no
less than a provocation against the Asian people and a challenge
to the international community. Their behavior can also be
interpreted as a complete exposure of their reactionary political
minds.
</P>
<P>
Half a century has passed since the end of World War II, and
there has long been a final conclusion to the following: it was
the Japanese imperialists, together with the German and Italian
fascists, that launched the war. It was Japan which invaded,
occupied and enslaved other Asian countries, and it was Japan that
brought unheard-of calamity to all Asian people, including the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
This is a historical fact borne by ironclad evidence, and no
one can reverse it.
</P>
<P>
Undisguised words to reverse the nature of the war of
aggression can hardly be heard anywhere in the world today, except
in Japan. There speeches to whitewash its history of aggression
run rampant, and farces to falsify its war of aggression can be
staged in the broad day light.
</P>
<P>
This is something shocking, infuriating, and worthy of deep
thought.
</P>
<P>
It is not accidental that such weird occurrences appear in
Japan. Actually, it is a conspicuous expression of the right-wing
political trend in the country and a natural result of the fact
that Japan's reactionary historical perspectives have not been
reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
After Japan surrendered in 1945, the United States, an
occupier, tried vigorously to turn Japan into an anti-Communist
"breakwater", or a "bridgehead", and propped up a right-wing
regime in the country, out of consideration of its own Cold War
policy.
</P>
<P>
Under such political circumstances, with the old state
machinery not smashed, the war crimes unsettled and the
perspectives of militarism untouched, many war criminals, who had
not been punished, entered the political arena and soared to
important government posts.
</P>
<P>
Japan has not reckoned with, nor is it able to reckon with its
historical and war perspectives preaching aggression and
expansion. As a result, a large number of war criminals still
remain at large and many right-wing groups have not been
investigated for openly trying to justify the war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Instead, many progressive forces upholding the eradication of
militarism in Japan have been threatened, persecuted, and even put
in prison.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, on the nature of the war of aggression, right and
wrong are still confused and there is no justice at all in the
Japanese society.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, with Japan rising as an economic power, quite
a few people, in order to whitewash the aggression, wantonly
spread lies to obscure the nature of the aggression and to cover
up war crimes
</P>
<P>
They distorted "aggression" as "entry" in textbooks, denied the
"Nanking (Nanjing) Massacre" and praised the aggression as
"liberating Asians." These are typical examples of their evil
motives to whitewash Japan's war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Flaunting the flag of "sequela of defeated nation", they
preached it as "self-maltreatment" for the Japanese to admit the
aggression and reflect on the wicked war.
</P>
<P>
With ulterior motives and under the pretext of victims of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs, they purposely obscured the
demarcation line between victims and criminals of the war,
resulting in ideological confusion among the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
As a result, all kinds of absurd formulations such as
"meritorious aggression", "justified revision" and "detrimental
apology" keep popping up.
</P>
<P>
Last year, on the eve of marking the 50th anniversary of the
victory of the anti-Fascist war, the Japanese Diet, under pressure
from the international community, passed a very indecent "no-war
resolution" after a half year of wrangling within itself.
</P>
<P>
It became an international laughing stock as the resolution ran
counter to the vicious purposes of those politicians who attempted
to cheat on world opinion.
</P>
<P>
Because such reactionary perspectives of history have not been
reckoned with, rightist thinking is increasingly rampant in the
Japanese political arena.
</P>
<P>
Narrow-minded nationalism gradually found its way back and a
few political parties have retrogressed in policy-making along
with breaking the taboo of sending troops overseas and
strengthening the Japanese-U.S. military alliance.
</P>
<P>
A few political parties brazenly challenged Clause 9 of the
Japanese Constitution. They foully tried to revise some more
important clauses such as "land, sea, and air forces, as well as
other war potential, will never be maintained," -- "The right of
belligerence of the state will not be recognized" and the phrase
-- "specialized defense".
</P>
<P>
A handful of bigoted politicians refused to acknowledge the
1945 trial by the international tribunal of the Japanese war
criminals, screaming that it was a trial by victors against the
defeated.
</P>
<P>
It is an obvious sign of rampant attempts to reverse the nature
of the war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
This shows that to date, there are still several politicians in
the country who want to revive the dream of building the so-called
"Great East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere."
</P>
<P>
The visit to Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese right-wing politicians
is just a tip of an iceberg.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Japanese society is at the turning period while
Japanese politics are at the crossroads.
</P>
<P>
It is very natural that Japan, a big economy, wants to play a
greater role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
But how can other peoples rest assured when Japan sticks to
that conception of history and meanwhile shows eagerness to play
the role of a big power in the world?
</P>
<P>
Serious self-examination of the history of invasion is the
basic prerequisite for Japan to win the trust of other Asian
nations and the international community.
</P>
<P>
If some Japanese politicians obstinately deliver those unwise
words time and again, they will only make fools of themselves
before others, damage the international image of Japan and
humiliate the Japanese people. Their act will definitely meet with
opposition and resistance from the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
Only by the exposure, criticism and the relinquishing of the
reactionary conception of history, as well as by taking the road
of peace and development, can the fundamental benefit and future
of Japan be built on.

The tournament announced Thursday that Agassi has agreed to
return to the event in 1997.

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Generate Power from Renewable Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- India's Ministry of
Non-Conventional Energy Source has drawn up an action plan to
generate grid quality power from renewable energy sources,
according to an annual report of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The target for the eighth Five-Year Plan (1992-93 to 1996-97)
has been raised to 2,000 megawatts of electricity, including that
from wind (500 megawatts), small hydro (600 megawatts), bio-energy
(800 megawatts), and solar (55 megawatts).
</P>
<P>
Facilities with a total capacity of about 800 megawatts have
already been installed, said the ministry's report for 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The report said a market orientation is being given to the
power generation programs using renewable energy sources to make
them commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
The programs are being implemented mainly through private
sector projects with resources from financial institutions in the
country as well as external assistance.
</P>
<P>
Under the wind energy program, a total capacity of 730
megawatts has been installed. The ministry also has plans to
raise the capacity to as high as 1,200 megawatts by the end of the
eighth Five-Year Plan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A total capacity of 121 megawatts of small hydro power has been
installed and projects with a capacity of 234 megawatts are under
construction, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Grid quality power generation from renewable sources is
expected to come largely from solar and wind energy projects,
which are mainly in India's Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh states.
</P>
<P>
The Rajasthan government has already awarded letters of intent
to three solar power projects aggregating 800 megawatts. Two such
projects, each with a capacity of 100 kilowatts, have been
completed in Uttar Pradesh.

<HEADLINE> "Dream Villages" In Yangtze River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- "The richness of farmers in
Huaxi Village is far out of my expectation," French businessman
Jean Pierie Vassaux said after he paid a visit to this model
village in Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Huaxi Village could be a dream for the majority of Chinese
farmers, with its residents' income equivalent to some 10,000 US
dollars a year, and their villa-style houses, and individual cars.
</P>
<P>
Rural Chinese have average per-capita annual income of about
500 yuan, and at least 70 million of them have to depend on
government subsidies or lack food and clothing. To find a way for
the country's rural population of 900 million to enter the modern
age has been a priority item for the government in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of villages in the Yangtze River Delta have
become "dream villages" like Huaxi. The delta of the country's
longest river includes Shanghai, the country's largest metropolis,
and parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that one-fourth of rural villages in the area
have more than one million yuan in pretax profits a year and have
made fortunes by developing industries and modern farming.
</P>
<P>
"Dream villagers" live in multi-story houses, each with an
average floor space of 150 sq.m., costing some 100,000 yuan, and
equipped with modern facilities such as comfortable bathrooms,
telephones, color television sets, refrigerators, and washing
machines.
</P>
<P>
Many elder farmers in these villages now receive a pension from
the village's collective fund after retirement and enjoy free or
almost free medical-care.
</P>
<P>
Even the villagers themselves can't help being surprised by
their good fortune. "I never dreamt that such a good life could
come true in such a short time," said Liu Pingnan, a 72-year old
woman from Qizhong Village, on the outskirts of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Qizhong has 1,320 residents, is as rich as Huaxi, and has
invested 14 million yuan in a community cultural center that has a
ball-room, cafe, cinema, library, exhibition hall, and shopping
mall.
</P>
<P>
Such villagers are changing their traditional way of living
from when they lived for nothing but farming and daily chores to
finding new hobbies just as urbanites do.
</P>
<P>
Ge Jincai, a 50-year old villager living in Zhangjiagang City,
Jiangsu Province, now spends much of his leisure time doing
Chinese painting, while his 20-year-old daughter travels a
lot. "I've been to many other cities - as a tourist not as a
job-seeker," she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The growth of "dream villages" in the delta area has caught the
attention of many sociologists, who say that these villages
provide a good model for Chinese villagers to follow and that more
and more, rural people will be better-off as rural reforms deepen
and the rural economy develops.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Parents Encourage Children To "Endure Hardships" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Many parents in China spoil
their single children as "little emperors".
</P>
<P>
But some parents in Shanghai want to bring their well-cared for
offspring down to earth, and are encouraging them to "endure
hardships" this summer.
</P>
<P>
A summer camp in the city, aimed at turning "little emperors"
into independent and helpful "little angels", has attracted
hundreds of parents. They all encouraged their children to join.
</P>
<P>
Huang Shanglei, a clerk with an electric appliance company,
said, "today's children live happy lives, without any experience
of hardship. I don't think this is good for them to grow up
healthily. Giving them opportunities to endure hardship is helpful
to their future development."
</P>
<P>
At the end of July, 61 pupils accepted by the camp paid a
nine-day visit to poor mountainous areas in east China's Jiangxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the young people, 90 percent of whom had
never done housework, took care of themselves, visited poor
families, even performed voluntary labor at local schools.
</P>
<P>
To help a primary school build a library, the pupils donated
their own books and one of them contributed 20 books.
</P>
<P>
Feng Yujun, a student of the Tieling Middle School, wrote in
her report, " At home, we are all 'little princesses' and 'little
emperors'. But children here have to do cooking themselves. Many
of them cannot go to school because their families are too
poor. Compared with them, we really lack the experience of
bearing hardship. During the visit, I learned how to take care of
myself and how to treasure my life."
</P>
<P>
In addition to encouraging children to join in the summer
camps, some parents took their children to the countryside where
they had settled down during the Culture Revolution (1966-1976) to
receive re-education from farmers.
</P>
<P>
Some parents took their offspring to old revolutionary bases
such as Jinggang Mountains in Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 95 percent of children in Shanghai are
only-children, according to psychologist Wei Qinan.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the reason the summer camps for "enduring
hardships" have become so popular is that parents have come to
realize that it is inadvisable for them to continue treating
their children as "little emperors."

<HEADLINE> 500 Indian Children Affected by Food Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 500 primary school
children were affected by food poisoning after eating stale sweets
at an independence day function in Bhiwandi Town of Mumbai
(Bombay) Thursday, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The students, all below 14 years of age, started vomiting soon
after eating the sweets before noon. Many of them also complained
of having loose motions and irritation in the eyes.
</P>
<P>
As the situation deteriorated in the afternoon, over 300
students were rushed to nearby hospitals in Bhiwandi town. The
poisoning was due to bacterial infection, said A. V. Biradari, a
resident medical officer of Thane Civil Hospital.
</P>
<P>
This is the second case of large-scale food poisoning in about
10 days in the town.
</P>
<P>
Last week, over 100 powerloom workers were affected by food
poisoning after having their meal at a local canteen. At least 50
people have died so far while the rest remain in critical
conditions. Doctors have yet to determine the kind of poison and
find the right antidote to it.

CANBERRA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Almost 1,700 athletes from 138
countries and regions will compete in the 6th IAAF World Junior
Championships in Athletics in Sydney next week, organisers said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Organizers hoped that the championhips would be used as a
trial run for the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Local Organising Committee Phil O'Hara said
the turnout, which had far exceeded expectations, would give
Sydney an opportunity to "test the facilities for the 2000 Games."
</P>
<P>
"It's important to have a trial run for the Olympics," he said,
particularly as international athletics events were held only
infrequently in Australia.
</P>
<P>
He said the organisers would be paying particular attention to
volunteer organisation and transport facilities -- two elements
which proved problematic at the recently closed Atlanta Games.

BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China will renovate and expand a

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: New Structure to Add Efficiency in New Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The new Russian cabinet, set up
and made public on Thursday, will function in a new structure with
its work emphasis in the social, finance and technology spheres.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the line-up of the cabinet, re-named Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin said that all 24 ministries and departments of
the new government will be divided into nine divisions, which will
coordinate the inter-related sectors of the economy and the social
spheres.
</P>
<P>
"This system was created by presidential decrees signed on
Wednesday," he explained, stressing that it was designed to deal
with the biggest tasks of the country -- to boost economic growth
and normalize the social sphere.
</P>
<P>
Under the decrees, Alexei Bolshako, Viktor Ilyushin and
Vladimir Potanin became first deputy prime ministers of the new
government headed by Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Bolshakov, former deputy prime minister in the old cabinet,
will oversee the sectors of industrial production, construction,
transport and communications and the use of natural resources. He
will act as prime minister whenever Chernomyrdin is absent.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Potanin, the youngest in the new cabinet, will
head the economic division. The former chief of Uneximbank, one
of Russia's leading private banks, will coordinate the Ministry of
Economics, the State Committee for the Anti-Monopoly Policy, the
State Property Managing Committee, the State Committee for
Statistics and other relevant departments.
</P>
<P>
Ilyukhin, President Boris Yeltsin's chief aid, will head a
social division set up for the first time in the history of the
Russian government.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor and Social Development formed on the
basis of the former Labour Ministry and the Ministry of Social
Insurance, as well as the Federal Employment Service, will play an
important part in the social sphere.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the division "must facilitate comprehensive
solutions to social issues" both at the central and local levels,
Chernomyrdin stressed.
</P>
<P>
The new government will have seven deputy prime
ministers: Vladimir Babichev, Oleg Davydov, Alexander Zaveryukha,
Vitaly Ignatenko, Alexander Livshits, Oleg Lobov and Valery Serov.
</P>
<P>
Livshits came to be one of the most important appointees as he
will be Yeltsin's economic aide.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister will head the finance ministry and
supervise a group of financial departments including the currency,
export and insurance activity control services. He will also
coordinate the activity of the tax service, the State Committee
for the Security Market, the Customs Committee and the service in
charge of ensuring state monopoly of alcoholic products.
</P>
<P>
A number of key ministers from the outgoing cabinet will remain
on their posts in the new government. They include Defense
Minister Igor Rodionov, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
A special division has been set apart to coordinate cooperation
with the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) member
countries, over national and regional policies. The division will
be led by Deputy Prime Minister Serov, who will coordinate between
the Ministry for Cooperation with the CIS Countries, the Ministry
of Nationalities and the State Committee for the North.
</P>
<P>
Zaveryukha, who was also deputy prime minister in the old
cabinet, will head the division of the agro-industrial complex and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Foreign economic activity will be coordinated by Deputy Prime
Minister Davydov, who is also the Foreign Economic Relations
Minister. He held the same posts in the outgoing cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Ignatenk, who was Chernomyrdin's deputy
in the old cabinet, will direct the activity of all state-run mass
media and the independent media. He will continue to head the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
A new Ministry of General and Vocational Education has been
established on the basis of the former Ministry of Education and
the State Committee for Higher Education. The ministry will be
under the division of science and education, which will be headed
by a deputy prime minister who will also head the State Committee
for Science and Technology. The post is still vacant.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's adviser Mikhail Delyagin said the new appointees will
add "efficiency" to the executive branch, adding that the line-up
"unequivocally shows that the work to normalize the social sphere,
stabilize finance and develop high technology will be high on the
government's economic agenda."

<HEADLINE> Enteritis Rife in Prague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Poor sanitary conditions in
Prague's restaurants have led to a dramatic increase in cases of
enteritis in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
A public health official says cases of enteritis increased
eight-fold in the seven years between 1989 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
To date, 17 in every 1,000 juveniles have been infected with
the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The public health authorities found in an investigation of 93
restaurants, bars and cafes in the city that 60 percent of the
food suppliers operated in dangerously low sanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
About half of the snacks and cookies and a quarter of the food
products on sale had serious hygienic problems, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating sanitary conditions in the city are mainly
due to poor government administration.
</P>
<P>
The country still lacks efficient sanitary regulations. The
current rules were established in the 1960s, when all food
supplying units were state-run.
</P>
<P>
After the privatization of the restaurants and bars, owners
were not inclined to pay much attention to sanitation. They even
sold bad food to make profit.
</P>
<P>
The Czech government has been called upon recently to
strengthen the administration of the food supply industry by
drawing up new sanitary rules as soon as possible.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will repatriate about
200 Vietnamese boat people on Saturday from the northeastern
province of Nakhon Ratchasima, Thai government sources said today.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second batch Thailand will have repatriated
since June 29, a day before the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) financial assistance halted.
</P>
<P>
A government source expected some resistance, as the boat
people do not want to go back to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
There are about 4,000 Vietnamese boat people in the province
and the Thai authorities want to repatriate them by September in
accordance with tripartite arrangements with Vietnam and the
UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese boat people are not recognized as refugees, but
economic migrants, and have been rejected resettlement in third
countries.
</P>
<P>
They are being sent back because they failed to volunteer to go
back by June 30.
</P>
<P>
In the first forced repatriation on June 29, 87 Vietnamese were
sent back amidst fierce protest and resistance. Seventeen boat
people cut themselves with knives in protest and in a bid to delay
their repatriation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's traffic police will
likely make their presence increasingly known in the next month,
after an official appeal for improved traffic management and law
enforcement to ease traffic bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
Increased police direction can speed safe, smooth traffic
flow, said Hu Cenglin, deputy-director of the Beijing Municipal
Public Security Traffic Management Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Hu also called upon the capital's 6,000 traffic police to
strictly enforce traffic regulations.
</P>
<P>
It is expected traffic police will concentrate on cutting
traffic violators out of the pack, and work on quick relief for
traffic jams, "China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest of a series of measures taken by the
municipal traffic management bureau, in a city-wide campaign that
began last month aimed at breaking up traffic gridlocks.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, to last two months, particularly targets 16
traffic violations and includes everybody on the road -- cars,
trucks, motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Signs reading, "Please keep traffic regulations in mind and
ensure traffic safety", have appeared on Beijing's streets.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are 1.05 million cars and motor vehicles in
Beijing, 70,000 of which hit the streets in the first half of this

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
started informal peace talks with the MORO Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), a splinter group of the MORO National Liberation
Front (MNLF) which is near the conclusion of its own peace
negotiations with the government, a senior official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Management Staff Chief Alexander Aguirre said the
government recognized the existence of the MILF which is pursuing
its secessionist armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
He said that backdoor negotiations began with provincial
governments and military commanders talking with MILF leaders and
would be elevated to the level of a cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said he was confident the talks would shift to formal
negotiations for a lasting peace in Mindanao in southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The MILF broke away from the MNLF in the 1970s after MNLF
Chairman Nur Misuari shifted the thrust of their struggle from
Muslim independence to autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The MILF had said earlier that it would wait for the final
outcome of the talks between the MNLF and the government before
taking a formal position on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said the government was also concerned about two other
groups -- the Abu Sayyaf and the Islamic Command Council -- but he
did not say if the government would reach out to these groups.

BANGKOK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will propose that Laos
enter into comprehensive negotiations to seek a quick settlement
to their border disputes, Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Thai
Foreign Ministry Saroj Chavanaviraj said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is to be raised next month at a meeting of senior
officials of the Joint Boundary Committee, he said, adding that
the sixth Thai-Lao Joint Commission meeting will be held at the
same time in Songkla province, southern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Saroj was responding to an earlier proposal made by former Thai
Foreign Minister Arsa Sarasin that Thailand and Laos must use
political will in settling the border issue and fix a timetable
for doing so, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
He said he agreed with Arsa that there should be give-and-take
in the process of negotiations, but he also stressed that this
does not imply that one side would lose any amount of territory to
the other.
</P>
<P>
Saroj said both countries need the political will to settle the
border problem, which is the only major stumbling block in their
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Using different sets of maps, both Thailand and Laos have laid
claims to three border villages and the hamlet of Ban Romklao,

<HEADLINE> hke - Bulgaria to Double Banks' Registered Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian central bank
announced today that all banks in the country will have to double
their registered capital by the end of next March.
</P>
<P>
Lyubomir Filipov, president of the National Bank, said the
measure is aimed at restricting the activities of small banks and
forcing those engaged in speculative banking business to go to
pieces.
</P>
<P>
He believed this will help straighten out the financial order
effectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank's decision, every bank must raise
its minimum registered capital from 800 million leva (about 10.12
million U.S. dollars) to 1.4 billion leva (17.72 million
U.S. dollars), and only those having a registered capital of 2.2
billion leva (27.84 million U.S. dollars) or more will be allowed
to do international banking business.
</P>
<P>
In addition, no bank is allowed to draw on its registered
capital in business operations.
</P>
<P>
Filipov said the central bank's measure was taken in order to
be consistent with the banking regulations of the European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
The EU banking regulations requires that a registered capital
of 5 million ECUs (6.41 million U.S. dollars) is needed for a bank
to participate in domestic banking business, and a registered
capital of 8 million ECUs (10.25 million U.S. dollars) for a bank
to enter the international banking market.

<HEADLINE> O-157 Bacteria Found in Cow Liver in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The E. coli O-157 bacteria, which
caused nine deaths and thousands of food poisoning victims in
Japan, was found in a cow liver here on Thursday, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted the Health and Welfare Ministry as saying
that it has found the deadly bacteria in one of the 10 cow liver
samples collected at the slaughterhouse in Majang-dong, eastern
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The beef liver products are among a list of 270 food items
collected last month for sanitary checks.
</P>
<P>
On the discovery of the strain in the cow's liver, the ministry
has ordered health offices across the country to beef up their
preventive maneuvers and advised people not to eat uncooked meat
offals such as beef liver, stomach and tripe, which some South
Koreans prefer to eat raw or not well cooked.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's instructions came one day before health experts
and government officials are to hold a meeting to discuss ways of
coping effectively with the bacteria and preventive measures
against a massive food poisoning outbreak to be caused by them.
</P>
<P>
However, ministry officials have denied press reports that the
government may be considering declaring the O-157 bacteria an
epidemic, as the Japanese government did on August 6.

<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is to
finance a development program for tourism in Jiuzhaigou, a tourist
site in southwest China's Sichuan province, China Tourism News
reported.
</P>
<P>
Jiuzhaigou, in a remote mountainous area, is renowned for its
clean natural environment, unique scenery and well-retained folk
customs as a result of little influence from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the program aims at building Jiuzhaigou into an
example of preservation and development of national parks in the
world.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Jiuzhaigou will set up cooperation
relations with a mountainous national park in west Europe. The two
partners will dispatch management and technical personnel at
different levels to each others' places for research and
investigation, and all the fees for the exchange will be paid by
the EU.
</P>
<P>
A detailed plan on implementation steps will be worked out at a
tourism conference in Jiuzhaigou this month, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Inspections Planned to Enforce Food Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public Health
will launch a three-month nationwide inspection of food Hygiene
practices to prevent outbreaks of food-related illnesses, reported
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A publicity campaign will be carried out in conjunction with
the inspection to remind food producers and sellers that they must
abide by the state law on food hygiene.
</P>
<P>
Consumers will be cautioned not to buy and eat unhygienic
foods, said Su Zhi, division chief in charge of food hygiene
inspection at Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
The ministry have received increasing numbers of reports of
food hygiene problems -- including some food poisoning cases this
summer, Su said.
</P>
<P>
The recent outbreak of the O-157 strain of colon bacillus
epidemic in Japan has heightened the Chinese health department's
concern to be on alert for cases of bacteria-contaminated foods.
</P>
<P>
In the past month, the ministry has issued circulars urging
local governments to strengthen controls over epidemic diseases,
especially those involving O-157 bacteria, with emphasis on
flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Sample testing will be conducted on foods that can easily go
bad during summer and autumn and could cause food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The so-called seasonally risky foods include prepared meat
products, cold foods, soft drinks, cakes and also various local
food products.
</P>
<P>
Unlicensed food production and marketing must be banned and
violators must be punished and their products confiscated, said Su.
</P>
<P>
Special attention will be given to schools, nurseries and
kindergartens and units which employ many non-native workers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. College Tuitions Tripled in 14 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- College students in the
United States now are spending three times more on tuitions than
their predecessors in the early 1980s, a congressional auditors
report said today.
</P>
<P>
The general accounting office said that college tuitions on
average jumped 234 percent between the 1980-1981 and 1994-1995
school years.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, median household income over the same period
increased by 82 percent while the Labor Department's consumer
price index rose by 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
The office attributed the tuition hike to rising expenditures
by schools and to an increasing dependence on tuition increases
because of decreasing state finance for colleges.
</P>
<P>
In the past 14 years, school spending increased by 121 percent
as a result of increases in faculty salaries and other
instructional costs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Administrative costs rose 131 percent.
</P>
<P>
State support, however, dropped 14 percent over 14 years. As a
result, tuition accounted for 23 percent of schools' total
revenues in 1994-1995, up from 16 percent in 1980-1981, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the general accounting office, tuition for the
1995-1996 school year will be 1,524 U.S. dollars to 5,521 dollars
for in-state students.
</P>
<P>
In general, the highest tuitions are in the northeast of the
country with the lowest in the south and west.

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Market Drops to Years' Lowest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China's automobile market has
plunged to its lowest for years, according to statistics by the
Automobile Department under Ministry of Machine-Building.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry say the output of vehicles rose by 2.42
percent, compared with the first half of 1995, to reach 757,900 in
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of vehicles declined for four successive months since
March this year, with total sales in the first half standing at
720,300, indicating a shrinking market demand nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The prices of sedans went down notably, with current prices 4.9
percent lower than the beginning of this year and 12.9 percent
less than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
No cars of any brands and types sell well in the country at
present, and only five percent of them are relatively marketable,
while the majority of the rest have difficulty in finding buyers.
</P>
<P>
The seven largest state-owned auto-makers accounted for 68.6
percent of the national output in the first six months, up 4.37
percent over the same period last year, but most of the domestic
vehicle manufacturers are experiencing a remarkable increase in
stock and a worsening performance.
</P>
<P>
Observers attribute the gloomy auto market to the effects of
the macro-economic environment in the country, as well as problems
created by related departments such as illegal or overcharged
levies on car sales.
</P>
<P>
The problems regarding the country's automobile industry should
be tackled in line with the requirements of a market economy, they
say.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Exporters Reject New Economic Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Argentine exporters
rejected the new economic measures announced recently by the
government, saying they may cause a loss of 580 million
U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The measures may raise obstacles to export and increase the
cost of investments, Argentine Republic Exporters Chamber (CERA)
President Enrique Mantilla said.
</P>
<P>
According to the measures announced Monday by Economy Minister
Roque Fernandez, export duties will be reduced but exporters will
have to pay taxes for their income.
</P>
<P>
Duties will be reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent for the
exports to the countries outside of the South American Common
Market (Mercosur) and be exempted for exports within the trade
bloc. But exporters of both categories will have to pay a tax of
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Argentine exports increased 4 percent during the first half of
this year compared to the same previous period. Exporters think
the new measures will make it difficult to reach the 15-percent
increase targeted for this year.

<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, formerly a backward inland area, has witnessed
an economic boom after opening wider to outside, today's "People's

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica could lose 80
million kilograms of coffee crop as the result of hurricane Cesar
which scoured the country late last month.
</P>
<P>
Coffee Institute (Icafe) Executive Director Guillermo Canet
said today that the losses included coffee consignments stranded
by blocked roads and over-ripe coffee that had dropped to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Icafe has asked the government to spend 250 million colons
(1.2 million U.S. dollars) on repairing roads so as to transport
the harvested coffee to processing plants.
</P>
<P>
Coto Brus and Perez Zeledon, two southern regions with the
highest rate of coffee production in this Central American
country, were affected the most. Coffee production there makes up
21 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the fourth primary crop in the country, behind
sugarcane, banana and rice.

<HEADLINE> New Agreement Signed on Muslim-Croat Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Senior Bosnian officials today
signed an agreement under which a Muslim-Croat federation will be
fully established by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed at a close-door ceremony by Prime
Minister Hasan Muratovic on behalf of the Bosnian government, and
on the Federation side by President Kresimir Zubak, a Croat, and
Vice-President Ejup Ganic, a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, called "agreed measures," was reached at the
Geneva summit on Wednesday by Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic
and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman under strong pressure from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for abolishing the Croats' mini-state
"Herceg-Bosna," while obliging the Muslim-led central government
to transfer much of its power to the federation.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1994, the Muslim-Croat federation
has been plagued by crises because of both sides' reluctance to
implement the agreements on the U.S.-brokered alliance.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Public Servants Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Public servants from four states
in northeastern Venezuela today called a 12-hour strike to press
the government to fulfill its commitments for raising workers' pay.
</P>
<P>
The stoppage, called by the National Unitary Federation of
Public Servants (Fednuep), was to start at 6:00 local time and end
at 18:00.
</P>
<P>
Fednuep President Carlos Borges said public servants'
activities would be suspended in central administration,
government departments and mayoralties in the states of Nueva
Esparta, Anzoategui, Monagas and Sucre.
</P>
<P>
The Fednuep said the government had not complied with an
agreement signed on April 29 calling for a 25-percent pay raise to
all public servants, from the central administration down to
mayoralities.
</P>
<P>
The federation and the government also agreed on a special
eight-month salary bonus for each worker, a 15-day salary payment
for all public servants with low salaries, and a 25-percent
increase in the pensions of all retired workers.
</P>
<P>
Borges said the workers had complied with the law. He
threatened to make the strike nationwide unless the government met
the workers' demands.
</P>
<P>
Authority representatives and Fednuep leaders will meet later
today to attempt to resolve the labor-management conflict.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Approves New Anti-rape Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate approved by
a 13-0 vote a new "Anti-rape law" on Thursday, making rape a
public crime against the people of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the law ended more than eight years of advocacy
by many women's groups and non-government organizations for
amendments to the existing law on rape.
</P>
<P>
The new law defines rape as a crime against persons and not as
a private crime or a crime against chastity as defined in the old
law. This means rapists will now be fighting the people of the
country before the court and any person can initiate the filing of
rape charges, not just the victim.
</P>
<P>
The bill imposes the death penalty on rapists in cases when the
victim is under 18 years old and is a relative of the offender by
consanguinity within the third civil degree, when the victim is a
religious or a child below seven years old, when the attacker
knows he carries HIV virus or any sexually-transmitted diseases
and when the rape is committed in full view of the victim's close
relatives.
</P>
<P>
The senate also expands the definition of rape to include the
offense conducted by a husband on his wife.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, a similar version of the proposed
law is now being deliberated on the committee level in the House
of the Representatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Imports of some major household
appliances have declined in the first half of this year, despite a
cut in tariff rates in April.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that imports of refrigerators and washing
machines both plunged to about 10,000 units during this period,
down more than 60 percent and 20 percent respectively in both
units and value from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports of air conditioners increased a moderate 4 percent to
reach more than 70,000 units in this period, but decreased 10
percent in import value.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lei, an official with the China Household Electrical
Appliances Association, attributed this declines to the
development of domestic industry which is strong enough to
compete with imported products in quality, prices and after-sales
services.
</P>
<P>
People are buying world famous brands produced in China, as
more and more well-known manufacturers value China's growing
market and set up joint ventures with Chinese parters, wang added.

<HEADLINE> OAS Observers Report Irregularities in Nicaragua Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of American
States (OAS) observers mission in Nicaragua said they had detected
serious irregularities in the country's pre-electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Some of the observed irregularities could lead to the
postponement of the elections or a delay in obtaining the results,
said the observers in a report to the OAS headquarters in
Washington, the "La Tribuna" daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The OAS mission questions in its document the development and
functions of the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
According to the observers, during the last extraordinary
voters registration in the north of the country the chain of
command of the CSE did not work and the continuity of the process
was broken.
</P>
<P>
"Demands of materials were not answered, in some cases they
were ... simply ignored," added the OAS observers.
</P>
<P>
The OAS mission said it had detected one-man vote reception
boards, or boards made up of several members of the same party, or
the absence of officials who were not paid.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the CSE failed to provide information to
the international electoral observers, preventing them from fully
performing their mission.
</P>
<P>
The OAS mission also criticized the political parties for their
poor performance in the supervision of the extraordinary voters
registration.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Santamaria, head of the OAS electoral observers, told the
press that more than 65 percent of the Nicaraguans registered to
vote in the October 20 elections have not received their voter
identification card.
</P>
<P>
Santamaria said it is necessary to "break the routine" with
which the identification cards are delivered and to adopt "urgent
measures" to prevent that a considerable number of voters will not
have the necessary documents to vote.

It says Yantai and the eastern part of the province have become
"one big garden", turning out veggies for east Asian countries and
reaping a bountiful harvest of profit in return.
</P>
<P>
In Laiyang, 90 kilometers south of Yantai and the most prolific
plot in the regional vegetable garden, more than 100,000 farmers
in 400 villages working 20,000 hectares of farm land are producing
vegetables for foreign tables, the paper reports.
</P>
<P>
They earned 100 million US dollars exporting 100,000 tons of
vegetables last year.
</P>
<P>
The farmers supplied not only Chinese traditional vegetables,
but also ones introduced from foreign countries to satisfy foreign
tastebuds.
</P>
<P>
Yantai has also experimented with advanced technology along
with new vegetable species. In particular, greenhouse technology
has ensured a year-long supply of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
With Shandong's success as a model, five provinces around
Shandong has now devoted 20,000 hectares of farm land to vegetable
production.
</P>
<P>
Yantai is also working on the next step along the food chain,
developing vegetable processing and packaging industries.

<HEADLINE> Electricity Generated in First Half of Year Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China generated 511 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first half of this year, a
7.8 percent rise from the same period last year, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The output means a daily output of 2.8 billion kilowatt-hours,
200 million more than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, supply is short of demand in all provinces and
autonomous regions except Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
Failures of supply are common, expecially in coastal and
economically booming provinces.
</P>
<P>
In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is China's second
largest coal producer after Shanxi province, 16.4 billion
kilowatt-hours were generated, a 22.5 percent rise, the highest
growth made by a province or autonomous region in the period.
</P>
<P>
The northeastern province of Jilin chalked up the
second-highest growth of 13 percent by generating 15.6 billion
kilowatt-hours.
</P>
<P>
The third-highest growth, 10 percent, was achieved by Jiangsu
province. More than 34.7 billion kilowatt-hours were produced.
</P>
<P>
Production of nuclear power saw a growth of 47 percent, higher
than that on the thermal and hydro power.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four power generators totalling 5.3 million kilowatts in
capacity had been installed for power plants under the Ministry of
Power Industry in the year's first half.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), China will
increase its installed power generating capacity to 300 million
kilowatts from last year's 214 million.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the capacity will increase to 600 million
kilowatts. Annual power production will increase to 3,000 billion
kilowatt-hours from last year's 1,000 billion.

</P>
<P>
Police forces cordoned off the park and left the handbag in the
spot indicated by Legarda. The extorter was caught when he came
to pick the handbag.
</P>
<P>
Legarda sent in July a blackmail letter together with an audio
tape cassette to Duran Ballen when he was still president.
</P>
<P>
The tape contained a message, allegedly from the rebel
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, demanding 20,000
U.S. dollars for the extorter to leave the Ecuadoran territory
without attempting to kill the president or his wife.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez served as Ecuadoran president from August 1992 to
August this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese UN Envoy on Demining in Peace-keeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
diplomat on Thursday called upon the international community to
provide necessary human, financial and material support for
demining in the context of U.N. peace-keeping operations and
accelerate training for local demining personnel.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations
Ambassador Qin Hua Sun made the appeal in an open debate of the
U.N. Security Council on the question of demining in the context of
U.N. peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
He said that demining is a time-consuming undertaking which
calls for first of all close cooperation by the parties concerned
as well as adequate expertise and funds.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the international community and Member States
should provide necessary human, financial and material support for
demining in the context of U.N. peace-keeping operations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, training for local demining personnel should
be accelerated."
</P>
<P>
Noting that demining in the theater of U.N. peace-keeping
personnel is an arduous task, Ambassador Qin said that China
welcome the open debate and believe that it will contribute to
more effective demining in the context of U.N. peace-keeping
operations.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out at the same time that the discussion should
not go beyond the question of demining in the context of U.N.
peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to point out that the discussion we ware having today
only deals with demining in the context of peace-keeping
operations. Other issues relating to landmines fall in the
category of disarmament and should therefore be discussed and
considered by other U.N. bodies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two countries participated and spoke at the open debate.
Many of them called for raising consciousness of demining,
strengthening financial support and improving demining technology.

<HEADLINE> TAZARA's Future Bright, Says Tanzanian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Minister Ms. Maua
Daftari predicted today that TAZARA's future is bright.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception to mark the 20th anniversary of
TAZARA's operations at the Kilimanjaro Hotel here this evening,
the deputy minister said, "as we celebrate the 20th anniversary
of TAZARA today, I am relieved by the fact that Tazara has now
started to show signs of improvements again."
</P>
<P>
Ms. Maua said in the past one year the TAZARA railway
increased the number of its passengers from 860,000 in 1994 to
2,220,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the increase to the efforts and determination
of all TAZARA workers, Management, the TAZARA board of Directors,
the Council of Ministers and "without, of course, forgetting our
evergreen Chinese friends".
</P>
<P>
The 1,860-kilometer TAZARA railway, built with the assistance
provided by the Chinese government, started operation in July
1976.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister recalled that over 20 years ago, the then
leaders of China, Tanzania and Zambia, in an act of great
friendship made a historic decision to build this "Uhuru
Railway".
</P>
<P>
She said through this railway, the friendship between the
peoples of the three countries had continued to flourish.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Maua said during the 20 years of its existence, this
railway had made outstanding contributions to the economic
development, not only of the two countries of Tanzania and
Zambia, but also of the other land-locked countries in the SADC
region such as Malawi and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
She recalled the achievement made by the railway during its 20
years of operations. However, the trend was reversed over past
few years, experiencing a decline in freight traffic performance,
she said.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for this decline, she said, were the changes
in trade patterns following the democratization of the Republic
of South Africa, the increase in competition from other routes,
as well as the general decline in the performance of the
hinterland economies of Tanzania and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
She thanked all the donors, including China for the support
which they had been giving TAZARA during the 20 years of its
operations.
</P>
<P>
Salim Msoma, Chairman of the TAZARA Board of Directors and the
Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Transport and communication
of Tanzania, Xie Youkun, Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania were
present at the occasion, and they also made speeches
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Leading members of the Management of TAZARA, representatives
of the Chinese Technical Team in TAZARA, high-ranking officials
from the government departments and the Chinese embassy in
Tanzania, and foreign diplomats accredited here, totalling at
about 200 people, were also present.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Stocks in New York turned
mostly higher in quiet trading today, struggling against a weak
bond market, where a stronger-than-expected economic reading
helped send interest rates higher.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped by 1.10 to 5,665.78.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 5-to-4
margin on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume totaled 322.83
million shares, down from 343.43 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.58 to 354.22, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.23 to 662.28.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.18 to 1,134.69, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 2.19 to 552.53.
</P>
<P>
Stocks opened lower, following bonds after the Federal Reserve
reported that industrial production edged up 0.1 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts had expected industrial production to slip in
July, based on signs of manufacturing weakness in the July
employment report.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production report offered the latest sign that
economic growth is slowing enough to avoid rapid inflation without
a move to higher interest rates by the Fed.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Parties Regret WWII Atrocities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's main political parties today
issued separate statements expressing remorse for the nation's
aggression in World War II and vowing to contribute to world peace.
</P>
<P>
In commemoration of 51st anniversary of the Japanese surrender,
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, said his Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) will always remember the historical fact that the war of
aggression launched by Japanese militarists caused immeasurable
pain to the people of Asia and will do it utmost to work for
global peace while doing soul-searching over Japan's wartime
actions.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is the main partner in the three-party ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Its partner, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) said it
will develop the spirit of remarks made by its chairman, former
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Murayama expressed remorse and made a clear-cut apology to
neighboring nations over Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
New Party Sakigake, the smallest partner in the tripartite
coalition, said it will never forget the fact that Japan inflicted
tremendous pain on Asian nations and the world and will sincerely
apologize for the past in order to help build relations of trust
with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Communist Party said Japan should clearly express
remorse for its war crimes. It also called for Japan to end its
military alliance with the United States and become a neutral
nation. That is the only way for Japan to draw lessons from
history, the party said.
</P>
<P>
However, the main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party),
and Japan's second largest party, only said it would work hard for
the global abolition of nuclear weapons and for the elimination of
famine, poverty and discrimination in the world.
</P>
<P>
The statement is regarded as a step backwards from the one
issued a year ago, in which the party expressed deep repentance
for Japan's aggression and colonialism.

<HEADLINE> US Industrial Production Up 0.1 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production
increased by 0.1 percent in July, the smallest advance since last
March, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said that it was the latest suggestion the
rebound of U.S. manufacturing may have stalled.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed said that the gain in output at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities was the smallest since production
fell 0.5 percent last March. Output rose 0.6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The report said that although production of motor vehicles and
parts shot up 4.3 percent in July, the increase was offset by a
1.8 percent decline in utility output resulting from cooler than
normal temperatures on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output rose 0.3 percent, less than half the 0.7
percent gain in June. Production of durable goods increased 0.6
percent, slower than the 1.4 percent advance a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
But output of nondurable goods fell 0.3 percent on top of a 0.2
percent decline in June. Production at the nation's mines slipped
0.3 percent after jumping 1.7 percent in the previous month.
Utility output plunged 1.8 percent in July after it had dropped
1.5 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
It said the nation's industries were operating at 83.2 percent
of capacity, down from 83.4 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Fed report confirmed findings in a membership survey by the
National Association of Purchasing Management that manufacturing
growth had slowed unexpectedly in July.
</P>
<P>
The report likely will be seen as new evidence that the U.S.
economy may be slowing without the raising of interest rates. Some
analysts believe that Fed policy makers will decide to hold rates
steady for now when they meet next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed also reported earlier this month that the U.S. was
slowing down on its own, a signal that raising the short-term
interest rates might not be imminent at present even though the
economy surged by 4.2 percent in the second quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not to Sign Chemical Weapons Non- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said today that it will not
sign the Chemical Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty unless Israel
signs the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian diplomatic source was quoted by the Egyptian Middle
East News Agency (MENA) as saying that Egypt supports the treaty
on chemical weapons but will not sign it because of the security
imbalance in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent reference to Israel, the source said that Egypt
"has reservations on the presence of a country in the region that
has a nuclear program not subject to international inspection,"
according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and other Arab states have urged Israel to join the
NPT. The Jewish state, which is believed to possess nuclear
weapons, has so far refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
Israel has not admitted nor denied that it has nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russia have not ratified the chemical
weapons treaty despite their possession of the world's largest
reserves of chemical weapons, the source said.

<HEADLINE> India Firmly Rejects Test Ban in Defiance of the West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- India today refused to bow to
Western pressure and reiterated its determination to block the
passage of a global nuclear test ban treaty to the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"We will oppose any treaty that is discriminatory and is
imposed on India," said Prime Minister Deve Gowda in his first
Indian independence day address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma also
stressed India's determination not to compromise its national
security.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders' remarks struck a defiant note in the face of
repeated appeals by the United States and its Western allies not
to block the passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Chief American negotiator Stephen Ledogar today appealed to
India and Iran not to veto the transfer of the text to the
U.N. General Assembly, which had hoped to vote on it at its next
session in September.
</P>
<P>
Gowda said in his speech: "I want to assure the people that the
security needs of this country will be our top priority and
the Agni and Prithvi (missiles) programs will continue."
</P>
<P>
There had been reports that proposals to undertake
test flights of "Agni", a 2500-kilometer intermediate range
ballistic missile, had been submitted to the government.
</P>
<P>
India on Wednesday told the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament
(CD) that it could not accept the draft treaty in its current
form.
</P>
<P>
The United States indicated it was considering ways of
bypassing the conference and sending the unapproved treaty text to
New York. One alternative would be to send it to the General
Assembly as a co-sponsored resolution.
</P>
<P>
But Indian ambassador to the Disarmament Conference Arundhati
Ghose told reporters she would block any procedural attempt to
have the document passed on to the U.N. General Assembly when the
conference meets again next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A group of countries outside this building can take the text
to the General Assembly, but it will not go from the CD. I will
not permit it," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
One of India's main objections to the treaty is that it fails
to commit the five declared nuclear powers -- Britain, China,
France, Russia and the United States -- to a timetable to
eliminate their nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
It also objects to a provision which would require New Delhi to
ratify the arms pact before it could become international law.
India claimed the clause would curb its sovereign right to decide
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
India's objections and refusal to forward the treaty to the
full Conference on Disarmament threatens to scupper more than two
years of talks to finalize the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Cease-fire Monitoring Committee Meets in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the five
member states of the cease-fire monitoring committee held a
meeting in a south Lebanese border town today to consider a
complaint lodged by Israel against Lebanese guerrilla operations.
</P>
<P>
The official Lebanese National News Agency said that the
committee "held a meeting at 11:15 a.m. (08:15 GMT) at Naqura in
the presence of all its members."
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for the committee comprising the
United States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel to meet to
discuss the complaint by one of the parties involved in the
military conflicts in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The committee was established to deal with violations of the
cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel on
April 26, which ended the 17-day Israeli blitz in south
Lebanon. It held a preparative meeting on August 8.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the Lebanese and Syrian delegates arrived
at the border town by a helicopter of the U.N. peacekeeping
forces in south Lebanon from inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It added that the American delegation arrived by a helicopter
"rented from a private Israeli company," while the French and
Israeli representatives came from the Israeli-occupied border
strip by road.
</P>
<P>
No other details were given by the state-run news agency.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman announced earlier that the cease-fire
monitoring committee would meet in Naqura, headquarters of the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), at a request of the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee would discuss the complaint filed by
Israel concerning an incident Tuesday in which a Lebanese
civilian was killed by Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government, as well as Hezbollah, insisted that
the man killed in an guerrilla ambush was a militia man of the
South Lebanon Army collaborating with the Israeli occupation
forces and it was inside the Israeli self-declared "security
zone."
</P>
<P>
The Shiite pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, spearheads a
guerrilla warfare against the Israeli occupation in the south of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered April 26 understanding banned both Israeli
forces and Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon from launching
attacks at civilian targets or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
But it does not deprive the Lebanese Moslem guerrillas of the
right to attack the military targets in Israel's
850-square-kilometer buffer zone in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Hits Five-Year Low in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain's unemployment rate fell
to 7.6 percent in July, its lowest level for five years, giving
the Tory government a much-needed boost and signaling
strengthening economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The number of people without work and claiming benefits fell by
a seasonally adjusted 24,100 last month, the fifth consecutive
monthly fall, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This cut the jobless total to 2,126,200, its lowest level since
March 1991.
</P>
<P>
July's fall in unemployment was twice as big as City economists
had expected, but the ONS warned that the drop might be overstated
by a few thousand because the wave of students leaving education for
the jobs market made the July figures hard to assess accurately.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the ONS estimated that the downward trend in
unemployment would accelerate to an average monthly decrease of
15,000.
</P>
<P>
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit in July
fell in all regions of the country for the first time since March,
though there were signs that the gap between north and south was
opening up again.
</P>
<P>
The biggest reduction was in the south-east, where the rate
stood at 7.1 percent. The lowest unemployment rate was in East
Anglia, at 5.8 percent, while in the north the jobless total stood
at 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that the number of long-term unemployed, who find
it most difficult to re-enter the labour market, also continued
to fall.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment among those out of work for more than a year fell
27,300 to 779,000 in the quarter to July, the 10th consecutive
quarterly fall, while those without a job for more than six months
fell 54,400 to 1,197,400 over the same period.
</P>
<P>
This was accompanied by an 11,500 rise in the number of vacancies
at job centers, taking the total to 230,300, the highest number since
January 1989.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that nearly all the jobs created over the past
few months have been in the service sector, a partial response to
the sharp increase in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
The government and City analysts welcomed the fall, saying it
kept Britain's predicted economic recovery on course for the
second half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM to Attend Funeral in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said today that he would attend the funeral for Greek
Cypriot Solomos Solomou in Cyprus Friday to show Greece's
solidarity with the Cypriot people.
</P>
<P>
Solomou, 26, was shot and killed Wednesday by a Turkish soldier
as he attempted to climb a flagpole near a Turkish guard post in
the buffer zone at Dherinia, southeastern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said given
Simitis' decision to visit the island republic, "his participation
in the Cyprus National Council which will convene Saturday in
Nicosia was considered necessary following consultations with
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides."
</P>
<P>
Before flying to Cyprus, Simitis will chair a cabinet meeting
to discuss the Cyprus issue following the recent incidents along
the green line on the island.
</P>
<P>
Major Greek opposition parties have also decided to send
representatives to attend the funeral in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an eastern Mediterranean island country, has remained
divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to take over one third
of its territory following an anti-Makarios coup engineered by the
then Greek junta.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan's Economy Shows First Signs of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's economy is
starting to climb out of depression, with sluggish growth of 0.1
percent in the first seven months of 1996, over the same period
last year, a government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The tiny figure reverses the downward trend of the last few
years, Deputy Director of the Government Office Trek Begakhmetov
told a conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's gross domestic product was estimated to have
declined by 0.3 percent per year during 1985-1993, and by a
massive 28.5 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Begakhmetov said food production rose 23 percent in the first
seven months of this year compared with the same period last year,
while oil and nonferrous metal production grew 14.5 and 10
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, production in some other economic sectors,
particularly chemicals and ferrous metals, is continuing to slide,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
And agricultural production, which contributes nearly half of
the country's output, is also down on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Begakhmetov blamed the reduction on people failing to pay their
bills and chaos in the transport sector.
</P>
<P>
Emergency measures, including stricter supervision over
departments and local governments, are being considered by the
government to solve the problems, Begakhmetov said.
</P>
<P>
But he was optimistic that the country's economy is on the
verge of experiencing strong growth.

<HEADLINE> Civic Groups Commemorate Japan's Surrender in WWII </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua)-- Japanese Civic groups urged the
government today to admit Japan's responsibility as an aggressor
in the World War II on the occasion of the 51st anniversary of the
nations' surrender in the War.
</P>
<P>
At a rally, led by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in
Chidorigafuchi cemetery in downtown Tokyo, the party speakers
called on the government to reflect deeply on Japan's wartime
atrocities and apologize to Asian neighbors, which had suffered
bitterly from its brutal aggression.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the rally, House of Representatives member Tsuruo
Yamaguchi, a former SDP leader, said Japan should never forget the
historical facts that "Japan's aggression and colonialism caused
tremendous damage and suffering to the people in Asia, including
the Japanese people."
</P>
<P>
He said it is regrettable that Japan is still being misled by a
wrong perception of history regarding the war, referring to
Japan's refusal to admit aggression in Asia. He also criticized
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's visit on July 29 to the
Tokyo-based Yasukuni Shrine where memorial services were held for
Japan's war dead including seven class-A war criminals executed at
the end of World War II,
</P>
<P>
Kanju Sato, secretary general of the SDP, told the gathering
that Japan should face up squarely to the past and sincerely
apologize to Asian nations for its war crimes so as to build a
trustful relationship and develop future-oriented ties with them.
</P>
<P>
The Japan War-Bereaved Association for Peace also held a rally
in downtown Tokyo, lashing at Hashimoto's visit to the
shrine which meant paying tribute to war criminals and pressing
for a revival of Japanese militarism.
</P>
<P>
Similar ceremonies were held throughout Japan, including
ceremonies at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Two Japanese cities that
were A-bombed in closing days of WWII.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, right-wing groups also held rallies in Tokyo on the
occasion, shouting slogans justifying Japan's wartime actions.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda Determined to Maintain Sanction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 15 (xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
and Rwandese President Pasteur Bizimungu haved reiterated their
determination to maintain sanction against Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of states announced their position at a state
dinner hosted here on Wednesday night by Museveni in honour of
Bizimungu, Radio Uganda reported today.
</P>
<P>
Uganda joined Tanzania and Kenya last week in imposing
economic sanctions against Burundi, where the military junta took
over power in late July. Rwanda later announced sanction too on
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Museveni said that Uganda was in cooperation
with the governments of Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Eritrea and
Ethiopia in taking a common stand against Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Africans fought colonialism in order to become sovereign
states where the will of the masses was respected and not to be
ruled by military adventurers of gangsters, he declared.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Bizimungu's visit, Museveni said it would promote
trade between the two neighbouring states and help strengthen
sanctions against Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu said he wanted to see economic developments taking
place in Uganda while seeking for better economic cooperation
between the two states.
</P>
<P>
He praised Uganda for its economic role in the lives of the
people of Rwanda, saying the people of Rwanda have since colonial
days looked at Uganda for source of employment and an outlet for
formal education.
</P>
<P>
He said his government was laying a foundation for
democratization. The country has rebuilt the judiciary system,
which is helping to deal with the 1994 genocide criminals to
ensure the stability of the country, according the Rwandese
president.
</P>
<P>
He said Rwanda is culturally, economically and historically
linked to east Africa and, therefore, wishes to join the East
African Cooperation recently revived by Uganda, Kenya and
Tanzania.

<P>
BELGRADE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The first commercial plane in
more than four years arrived at the Sarajevo airport today, local
press reported.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and visiting U.S. Secretary
of State Warren Christopher attended an opening ceremony at the
airport after the landing of the Air Bosnia plane from Istanbul in
Bosnia's capital.
</P>
<P>
"For us it is more than resumption of flights. For us it is yet
another big step to freedom and the world to which we belong,"
Izetbegovic said.
</P>
<P>
Croatian airlines are scheduled to begin regular service
between Sarajevo and Croatia's capital, Zagreb, later this week.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who flew into Sarajevo from Geneva earlier today,
said, "Step by step Sarajevo's isolation is coming to an end."
</P>
<P>
He called on all those involved to "do their utmost to create
the conditions for democratic elections, and to ensure that the
election results are respected."
</P>
<P>
In September, Bosnians will vote in the first general elections
of the country since the end of a 43-month bloodshed in last

<HEADLINE> Sweden Develops New Air Defense Radar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A new short-range air defense
surveillance radar called Pointer has been developed to the
prototype stage for export customers by Sweden's Ericsson
Microwave Systems, according to the latest issue of the Jane's
Defense Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The new radar system, which can be integrated into short-range
air defense missiles such as Mistral, Stinger and Starburst, is
designed to increase the overall effectiveness of short-range air
defense systems by reducing target acquisition time and enabling
more targets to be engaged.
</P>
<P>
The radar's range depends on various factors, but is typically
over 20 km in distance and nine to 10 km in altitude. Mounted in a
small container, it can be fitted on a single axle trailer and
towed by a Land Rover or similar vehicle.
</P>
<P>
According to Ericsson, Pointer can be brought into action in
one minute by a single operator and its antenna, in operation, is
swung through 90-degree into the vertical position.
</P>
<P>
Most functions of the new radar, including track initiation,
tracking, classification of fixed wing aircraft and helicopters,
threat evaluation and data distribution via radio or wire, are
fully automatic.
</P>
<P>
Target information can be sent to the firing unit two or three
seconds after the target is in line of sight to give the missile
system operator enough time to react.

<HEADLINE> Canada Approves Use of New Anti-HIV Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has
approved the use of a new anti-HIV drug, Norvir, developed by
Abbott Laboratories in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
The government permitted the use of Norvir in combination with
other types of anti-HIV drugs, not on its own, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Norvir, also known as ritonavir, is one of a new class of drugs
called protease inhibitors, which work differently from most
currently available treatments for the HIV virus which can lead to
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Protease inhibitors block the action of protease, an enzyme
involved in the final development of the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
Abbott Laboratories said the tests, carried out at 67 sites in
the United States, Canada and other countries, showed that
patients with advanced HIV taking Norvir reduced the chance of
disease progression or the risk of death by nearly half against
patients taking a placebo.
</P>
<P>
Research is continuing to determine the long-term clinical
effects of the drug, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Offers Apology to Wartime Sex Slaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today offered his "most sincere apologies and remorse"
to all Asian women forced into sexual slavery for the Japanese
military before and during World War II.
</P>
<P>
This was Japan's first written apology to women forced into
brothels by the Japanese army, but stopped short of saying the
state would pay compensation.
</P>
<P>
"As prime minister of Japan, I extend anew my most sincere
apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable
and painful experience and suffered incurable physical and
psychological wounds as comfort women," Hashimoto said in an
official letter of apology to "comfort women" in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan "should face up squarely to its past history and
accurately convey it to future generations."
</P>
<P>
"Comfort women", a phrase given by the wartime Japanese
military, refers to women forced at gunpoint to serve in
battlefront brothels for soldiers. The estimated 200,000 "comfort
women", came mainly from Korea, the Philippines and some other
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In the letter of apology, Hashimoto admitted Japan's moral
blame for disgracing Asian women, top government spokesman Seiroku
Kajiyama told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The letter was delivered to the Philippine women today together
with a lump sum payment from the Asian Women's Fund, a private
organization backed by the government set up to collect money to
compensate former sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also admitted the former Japanese Imperial Army's
involvement in the sexual slavery, while expressing his resolution
to restore the reputation and dignity of the women, Kajiyama said.
</P>
<P>
The contents of the letter will be sent to South Korea and
China's Taiwan, where former sex slaves are opposing the private
fund and demanding direct compensation from the Japanese
government. Payments to victims there are still pending.
</P>
<P>
Japan had long refused to acknowledge the army's involvement in
the notorious "comfort women" affair until. But the government
finally admitted the military's involvement in 1993 and issued a
vague apology.

<P>
ATHENS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Five ancient graves dating from
the early fourth century B.C. have been discovered near the
northern greek city of Salonika.
</P>

of Macedonia (413-399 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
It also contained a pair of golden earrings, three gold and
three bronze clasps, a gold ring, a gold bead and some fragmentary

<HEADLINE> EU Steps Up Program to Foster Links With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- European companies have until
October to sign up for a program to improve links with Japan, the
European Commission (EC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Vulcanus Program, launched in June last year by Japan and
the EC, invites European companies to employ a top Japanese
university student for eight months for just 7,500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of companies have taken advantage of the scheme since
its launch. Now, the EC wants to step up the program.
</P>
<P>
Any European Union-based company in the industrial sector can
apply to host junior or senior undergraduates or postgraduates
from top Japanese universities.
</P>
<P>
The 7,500-dollar fee is paid to the EU-Japan Center for
Industrial Cooperation, which is in charge of the program.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to foster closer relations between industrial
enterprises in EU countries and Japan, to improve mutual
understanding and encourage the globalization of the Japanese and
European economies.
</P>
<P>
The students are selected according to their academic record,
motivation and ability to adapt to new situations, and according

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Trains Demining Experts for Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of former Angolan
rebel soldiers are being trained in South Africa as demining
experts as part of the effort to speed up the removal of
landmines left underground after years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Brigadier General Solly Schreuder,
spokesman of the South African National Defense Force (SANDF), at
a press conference in Pretoria today.
</P>
<P>
The South African military spokesman said 12 demobilized
Angolan soldiers and two South Africans, who started their
training on June 24, would carry out an demining operation on a
regional level when they complete their course on September 13.
</P>
<P>
"The Emphasis of the training was placed on mine survey and
mapping as this was identified as the critical need," said the
officer.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations report recently said between 60 and 100
million landmines, as well as anti-tank and anti-personnel mines,
remained to be removed in 64 countries in the world. Everyday,
500 people were killed when they accidentally detonated the
mines.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Africa, the continent with the largest
share of planted landmines in its soil, has about 20 million
planted landmines.
</P>
<P>
Angola is believed to bear the heaviest demining burden, with
most of the landmines laid in the vicinity of settlements, towns,
airfields, water holes, cultivated fields, electrical
installations and near or on the roads and footpaths.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by the Angolan Consul in South Africa,
Antonio Lengue, who told the press conference that even the
Angolan government was wondering how long it would take to demine
the country.

<HEADLINE> Athens Bits to Host 2004 Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Greek capital Athens
Wednesday submitted it's bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games to the
International Olympic Committee at its headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Athens Olympic bid committee announced that an envelope
containing three separate volumes was handed to Jacqueline Baret,
the IOC's chief of candidacies for the 2004 games.
</P>
<P>
The first volume contained details and general information
about Athens and Greece; the second plans and photographs of the
venues for the 28 sports and the third, infrastructure of Athens
and the rest of the country, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Submitting the envelope was bid committee head Gianna
Angelopoulou-Daskalaki, a former conservative member of the Greek
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said Athens was the fourth city to submit it's
bid and that it was done one day before the deadline. Names of the
other three cities were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
A record 11 cities are expected to submit bids and all made
brief pitches to IOC officials at their meetings before the
Atlanta Olympics. Besides Athens, they were: Buenos Aires,
Argentina; Cape Town, South Africa; Istanbul, Turkey; Lille,
France; Rio de Janeiro; Rome; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Seville,
Spain; Stockholm, Sweden, and St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
It's the third time Athens has submitted a bid to organize the
Games. Bids made to hold the 1988 and 1996 Games were rejected at
the time because Athens lacked infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
But Athens officials felt the games rightfully and morally
belonged here and 90 percent of the infrastructure was already in
place now, Angelopoulou-Daskalaki said at a press conference in
Athens last month .
</P>
<P>
If Athens is selected to hold the 2004 Games, the IOC is
expected to take a close look at how the World athletics
championships scheduled for the capital next August are conducted.
</P>
<P>
Greek officials were bitter after losing out to Atlanta to hold
this year's centennial Olympic Games and criticized Atlanta-based
Coca Cola and other giant American corporations for allegedly
influencing the IOC.
</P>
<P>
The modern Olympic Games were first held in Athens in 1896.
Greece had started a campaign in the mid 1980s to hold the Games
to mark their 100th anniversary. But the IOC, at its meeting in
Tokyo in 1988 to decide the venue for the 1996 Games, was not
swayed by Greek sentimentality and awarded them to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Nominate Dole Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN DIEGO, United States, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Robert Dole,
former Senate Majority leader, today was nominated at the
Republican National Convention its presidential candidate for the
November election.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Kansan is one of the country's leading
political figures. Dole had been chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, member of the House of Representatives, chairman of the
Republican Party, a state legislator and a county attorney.
</P>
<P>
He was named chairman of the Republican National Committee in
1971.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Dole was elected Senate Majority leader and retired on
June 11, 1996, in order to campaign full-time. He was the
longest-serving Republican leader in Senate history.
</P>
<P>
Dole is noted for his ability in consensus-building and
attaching importance to deficit reduction and economic growth, as
well as his mastery of foreign affairs, according to Republican
National Convention sources.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Dole was a platoon leader in the 10th
Mountain Division in Italy. He was wounded on the battlefield in
1945 and twice decorated.
</P>
<P>
Dole has put forward his plan for tax-cuts and economic growth
as his campaign theme. The plan calls for, among other measures,
a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a balanced
budget by the year 2002, tax relief and fundamental tax reforms.
</P>
<P>
The plan says currently the economic growth is anemic, incomes
and wages are stagnant, and workers understandably feel more and
more anxious about the future.
</P>
<P>
It says growth must be the central goal of U.S. economic
policy. "Economic growth -- and the rising living standards and
prosperity it creates for all Americans -- should be the standard
by which all economic policies are judged."
</P>
<P>
Dole's plan has become the focus of the ongoing Republican
National Convention in southern California.
</P>
<P>
Dole is scheduled to make an acceptance speech for his
nomination Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jack Kemp was nominated Republican vice-president
candidate. Kemp, 61, was former secretary of Housing and Urban
Development.
</P>
<P>
Before his appointment to the Cabinet, Kemp had been a member
of the U.S. House of Representatives for 18 years. Kemp also
served for eight years in the Republican leadership as chairman of
the House Republican Leadership Conference.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Banks Face Mounting Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's commercial banks are
facing mounting debts from overdue credit loan payments, totaling
2,112 billion dong (about 20 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of
July, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The amount represents a 29 percent rise, or 480 billion dong
(about 4.57 billion dollars), over last year, the English-language
"Vietnam News" newspaper quoted a state bank report as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the overdue payments are short-term credit
loans, and 7 percent are medium or long-term loans.
</P>
<P>
While the emergence of the credit fund system is seen as a
positive development in the banking system in line with economic
renovation, it is faltering because credit fund regulations are
not being followed in the granting of loans.
</P>
<P>
Many borrowers, who have neither business licenses nor
sufficient legal mortgage documents to qualify themselves for the
loans, are granted the loans, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are no supporting laws, particularly laws
covering bankruptcy procedures, for the system to work
efficiently, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said if debtors cannot pay back their credit loans,
there's no legal office responsible to sell confiscated real
estate or assets so the bank can recover its money.
</P>
<P>
The report urged the government to create a compatible legal
environment for business, and credit operations in particular,
involving a sub-law for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
There is also a need to tighten the enforcement of accounting
procedures to ensure that auditing procedures are efficiently
followed, the Vietnam News noted.
</P>
<P>
The lack of adequate relevant ownership and commercial laws
means debtors can declare themselves insolvent and escape repaying
their mounting debts, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Start Pilot Project On Male Involvement </HEADLINE>

<P>
NAIROBI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The family planning association
of Kenya (FPAK) will spend 456 million Kenya Shillings (about
eight million U.S. Dollars) for a five-year pilot project on male
involvement, the Kenya News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Project Manager Peter Mwarogo said in Kisumu town today the
project's goal was to increase the involvement of men in family
planning, thereby, increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate
with the aim of reducing fertility and controlling HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He said the project, the first of its kind, will initially
cover three districts of Kakamega, Kisumu and Nakuru due to their
low contraceptive prevalence rates.
</P>
<P>
He said men in Kenya are apathetic when faced with the subject
of family planning which he attributed to lack of information of
the available contraceptives, fear of the effect and cultural
attitudes and practices.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Calls for Peaceful Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam has called for peaceful and practical means to settle
the pending issues on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Kim made the call in his speech delivered here today at a
meeting marking the 51st anniversary of national liberation from
the colonial rule of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 to its
World War II defeat in 1945. Following Japan's defeat, the
peninsula was divided into South Korea and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
President Kim said that "peace and cooperation" were the
cardinal factors for improving relations between South Korea and
the DPRK and for achieving "unification and prosperity".
</P>
<P>
As a basic stance toward achieving peace and inter-Korean
economic cooperation, Kim said that "first of all" was the need
for stability in North Korea (DPRK)." He said: "It would be
undesirable for the difficulties North Korea is now confronted
with to develop into a situation affecting the stability there.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to see North Korea isolated and we will not
seek a unilateral unification," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Peninsula issues should be "resolved through
peaceful and practical means in accordance with agreements reached
between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
On the food problem in the DPRK, Kim expressed readiness to
help the DPRK if Pyongyang accepted the proposal of four-party
peace talks on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, made by Kim and U.S. President Bill Clinton last
April, calls for a meeting involving South Korea, the DPRK, China
and the U.S. to establish a permanent peace regime on the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that the four-party talks agenda included the
establishment of a peace regime replacing the armistice agreement
that ended the 1950-1953 Korean War. Ways to establish military
trust and inter-Korean economic cooperation from the perspective
of easing tensions between the two sides on the Korean Peninsula
would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Turning to inter-Korean cooperation, Kim said that South Korea
was prepared to invest in the Rajin-Sonbong Free Economic and
Trade Zone in the DPRK, to supply needed materials to the DPRK
through expanded inter-Korean trade and to allow South Korean
tourists to visit the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Japan Marks 51st Anniversary of Defeat in Second World War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, Augest 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan today marked the 51st
anniversary of the nation's defeat in the World War II as Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto expressed "deep remorse" for its war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
"That war (of aggression staged by Japan) caused tremendous
pain and sorrow to people in many countries, particularly to those
in Asian nations," Hashimoto said in a speech at the
government-sponsored annual ceremony for commemorating the
memorial day at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan hall.
</P>
<P>
"I humbly admit to this fact and would like to offer heartfelt
condolences to them with deep remorse," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister attempted to defuse outrage among
Asian nations, which suffered bitterly under Japanese militarist
heels, by skipping a visit to a shrine glorifying Japanese war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto visited the Tokyo-based Yasukuni Shrine last month,
setting off widespread anger in its Asian neighboring countries
because he was the second incumbent post-war prime minister to pay
homage to war criminals, following Yasuhiro Nakasone who did so in
1985.
</P>
<P>
Emperor Akihito and empress Michiko led today's official
ceremony in the indoor arena where some 7,000 people observed a
minute of silence at noon and prayed for the souls of the 3.1
million Japanese who died during the war.
</P>
<P>
"Looking back at history here, I pray from the bottom of my
heart that the ravages of war will never be repeated," Akihito
said in a brief speech.
</P>
<P>
House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi also gave a
memorial address. He said, "We should strive for world peace and
must deepen trustful relationship with people of other nations
through further international cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"In particular," Doi said, "further efforts are needed to reach
real reconciliation with Asian people."
</P>
<P>
She made similar remarks at the ceremony last year, alluding to
the fact that Japan has not reached real reconciliation with the
rest of Asian nations because it has yet to apologize for Japanese
aggression against Asian countries in the second world war.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Netanyahu Treading on Minefield in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is stepping into a minefield as he tries to
formulate a new plan for redeploying troops from the volatile West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai will present this evening
to the inner security cabinet several options of the
redeployment, which are expected to propose a slower process for
the pullback, or maintaining wider security control.
</P>
<P>
However, besides the strong objection by the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), Netanyahu is also facing a crisis among
his ruling coalition as major partners threaten to quit to oppose
any redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, the flashpoint town for Israeli-Palestinian violence,
is the first stumbling obstacle in fully resuming the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The former Labor-led Israeli
government froze the redeployment, which should have been
completed by late March, in the wake of a series of Islamic
terrorist attacks from late February to early March.
</P>
<P>
Under the original plan as agreed upon in the Oslo accords
signed by the PNA and the Labor government, Israel should pull out
its troops from 80 percent of Hebron, while retaining security
control over the Jewish quarter.
</P>
<P>
While pledging to honor the redeployment promise, Netanyahu
favored revising the plan under the excuse of protecting the
safety of over 400 Jewish settlers who are living among 120,000
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today in an interview with Israel Television,
Netanyahu defended his action to revise the redeployment plan,
saying security arrangement was not only Israel's need, but also
the "urgent need" of the PNA.
</P>
<P>
"If we have a tragedy in Hebron, this will not only come at the
expense of the lives of Jews and Arabs alike, but it will also
endanger, or possibly scuff, the peace process between Israel and
the Palestinian Authority," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So in the arrangement in Hebron, security build-in is not
just our interest, it should be everyone's interest," Netanyahu
added.
</P>
<P>
However, PNA President Yasser Arafat has already denied any
revision to the original agreements. In an interview with Israel
Television early this week, Arafat vowed to resort to
international arbitration if Israel reneged on all or part of the
Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also sent on Wednesday a letter to U.S. President Bill
Clinton calling him to pressure on Netanyahu to honor the peace
accords in order to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the home front, Netanyahu is creating a crisis within the
ruling coalition, as two major partners -- the National Religious
Party (NRP) and Tsomet Party, have decided to join forces to foil
the implementation of Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The NRP criticized that the Mordechai plan sounded too much
like the one formulated by the Labor government. And Tsomet
leader Rafael Eitan reportedly threatened to quit the coalition
if the government implement the redeployment without giving him a
say.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, another potent opponent may be Foreign Minister
David Levy, Netanyahu's long-time rival who is grumbling about
being sidelined by the prime minister in the decision-making
process in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Levy has already considered, for the third time in only two
months, resigning to irk Netanyahu. The resignation of Levy, whose
Gesher party having five parliamentary seats, will deal a severe
blow to the coalition which now commands the majority of 66 seats
in the 120-member Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
So, Hebron redeployment is not only a test of Netanyahu's
campaign promise to continue the peace process, but also a
crucial test of the 46 year-old leader's ability of political
manoeuvring that may decide his political future in a long
term.

<HEADLINE> Lebed to Name Persons Guilty of Chechen Bloodshed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian national security chief
Alexander Lebed said today that he will make public every single
"hero" of the Chechen war at a news conference Friday, said
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who arrived in Chechnya earlier today, was responding to
a statement that someone wants him to "break his neck over the
Chechen problem."
</P>
<P>
He said that it is quite clear to him who initiated the August
6 events in the Chechen capital of Grozny, who let the rebels
enter the city and why.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 Chechen rebels stormed into Grozny on August 6,
seizing some key places in the city. Fighting between them and
Russian troops have resulted in large casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
"This operation," Lebed said, "was planned beforehand and the
Chechen war is a contracted and commercial war."
</P>
<P>
Lebed, secretary of the Russian Security Council and special
envoy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Chechnya, promised
that on his return to Moscow, probably Friday, he will stage a
news conference at which he will name "heroes" (in the negative
sense) of the Chechen war unit by unit, name by name.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Chechen war as commercial in character at a news
conference in Khakala, where the headquarters of the Russian
troops in Chechnya is located, Lebed said, "Someone finds it
profitable for the combat actions to continue."
</P>
<P>
He said that several parties are participating in the Chechen
war, "probably as many as four parties." He refused to name these
people, granting this right "to the investigation."
</P>
<P>
"The war in Chechnya has been a slugfest between the best
Russian soldiers, Russians and Chechens," he said. They "are
fighting against each other but nobody knows why."
</P>
<P>
As concerns his own mission, Lebed said that he has come to
Chechnya with peace. "No one needs war," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On his second trip to Chechnya within a week, Lebed met with
President of Russia's neighboring Ingushetia Ruslan Aushev, who
flew into Khankala immediately to talk with Lebed over the Chechen
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Before his return to Moscow, Lebed is also expected to meet
with Chechen rebel military chief Aslan Maskahdov at a place which
has not yet been disclosed.

<HEADLINE> SADC Leaders to Consider Anti-Drug Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Drug trafficking, trade,
energy, transport and communication issues will top the agenda of
a SADC summit in Maseru, Lesotho on August 24, the South African
Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Gaborone, the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) said ten of the 12 member states'
leaders are expected to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
SADC Information Officer K.G. Moesie in Botswana said draft
protocols on these five areas have already been concluded and
would be considered for approval.
</P>
<P>
Moesie said a protocol provided for a policy framework
allowing SADC countries to ensure member states do not become
producers, consumers, exporters and distributors of illicit
drugs.
</P>
<P>
+To achieve this, the protocol provides for cooperation among
law enforcement agencies and the judiciary systems of the
region,+ said Moesie.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation will cover information exchange on the movement of
known and suspected drug traffickers, joint training of law
enforcement officers on methods of detecting concealed drugs, and
harmonizing judiciary systems in respect of arrests, prosecution
and sentencing of drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Moesie said SADC countries recognized the importance of
transport and communication in strengthening relations among
them. Therefore, leaders would review at the lesotho summit
protocols on the two issues with a view to promoting efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Namibia, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Continue to Participate in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia is taking an active part
in the process of the Middle East settlement and intends to
continue this work on the basis of the available formula together
with the other co-sponsor, the United States, and other countries
concerned, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Demurin, spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry,
told a news briefing that at present it seems that the pause in
the peace making process in the Middle East has dragged on.
</P>
<P>
"At first we agreed that the new Israeli government would need
some time to analyze the situation so as to put forward new ideas
on this issue later," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "Now we are compelled to state that the delayed
period of inactivity is not productive from the viewpoint of the
further development of the process."
</P>
<P>
In this connection the Russian diplomat expressed the hope that
the available potential will be used and that the dynamics of the
process will be preserved.
</P>
<P>
In his view, to achieve this it is necessary first of all to
confirm the adherence to the earlier concluded agreements and act
on that basis.
</P>
<P>
Moscow expects that the sides in the region will give up the
actions aimed at undermining the process or running counter to the
efforts made before, Demurin said.
</P>
<P>
"We also expect that the international factors acting in the
Middle East settlement will contribute to active efforts in favor
of establishing final peace and conciliation in the Middle East,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Sale of ZCCM Expected to Bring About Zambia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The impending privatization of
the Zambia Consolidated Coper Mines (ZCCM) is expected to inject
1.3 billion US Dollars into the country's economy, a Zambian
stock exchange expert said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia newspaper Times today quoted Inter Africa Equities and
Securities Stock Exchange expert Zoran Zuze as saying that this
will help stabilize Zambia's exchange rate, which of late has
been the main cause of inflation, and interest rates will come
down.
</P>
<P>
He said "this scenario, however, will make fixed income
investments less attrative which will consequently encourage the
general public to make long-term investments in shares."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the sale of ZCCM will have adverse effects
on the southern African country's property market becuase the
lower interest rate will cause a sharp rise in the construction
sector, which will increase property stock and bring down the
prices of property.
</P>
<P>
The ZCCM privatization will complete in two stages within two
years. enditem

<HEADLINE> UN Council Urges Croatia to Adopt Amnesty Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today urged Croatia to adopt a comprehensive amnesty law
concerning all persons who served in the civil administration,
military or police forces in the former Serb-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
A statement read at a formal council meeting noted with concern
that the amnesty law and the action subsequently taken by the
government of Croatia "have been insufficient to create confidence
among the local Serb population in Eastern Slavonia."
</P>
<P>
It urged "the Government of Croatia to adopt a comprehensive
amnesty law concerning all persons who, voluntarily or by
coercion, served in the civil administration, military or police
forces of the local Serb authorities in the former U.N. Protected
Areas, with the exception of those who committed war crimes as
defined in international law."
</P>
<P>
On the funding of public services in territory administered by
the U.N. Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja
and Western Sirmium (UNTAES), the council said the amounts agreed
to recently by the government of Croatia will not cover all of
those services and it expected more funds to be made urgently and
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The council also reaffirmed its readiness to consider extending
the UNTAES' mandate beyond its current 12-month deadline of 15
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council recalls that the Basic Agreement provides
for a transitional period of 12 months which may be extended at
most to another period of the same duration if so requested by one
of the parties," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"It stresses the importance it attaches to UNTAES being able to
complete its mandated tasks, including the organization of
elections as provided for in the Basic Agreement, promptly and in
full," it said.
</P>
<P>
"To that end, the council affirms its readiness to consider, at
an appropriate time, extending the duration of the mandate of
UNTAES, on the basis of the Basic Agreement, its resolution 1037,
and a recommendation from the Secretary-General," it stressed.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Foreign Minister Calls for Peace in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller tonight appealed for peace on divided Cyprus after two
Greek Cypriots were killed by Turkish Cypriots during protests
along the U.N.-controlled buffer zone, according to a report
reaching here from northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"I propose an appeal for peace to the Greek Cypriot side. To
make peace needs as much courage as to make war," Ciller told a
joint press conference after holding talks with northern Cyprus
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, who is also acting prime minister, was on a lightning
visit to the Turkish Cypriot part of the island.
</P>
<P>
"I am openly appealing to the United Nations here to gather the
two leaders (of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots) immediately to
work out a solution and ensure peace " she said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ciller repeated an earlier tough warning that Turkey
would "break the hands of anyone who dares to bring down the
Turkish flag," referring to a Greek Cypriot protester fatally
shot by the Turkish troops Wednesday as he tried to tear down the
Turkish flag in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Another Greek Cypriot named Tassos Issac, 24, was beaten to
death Sunday in clashes between the Greek Cypriot demonstrators
and Turkish troops on the green line.
</P>
<P>
The violence was the worst of its kind in 22 years on the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish nation is always on the side of the Turkish
Cypriots through thick and thin," Ciller claimed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when the Turkish troops
intervened following a coup backed by Athens in the Mediterranean
island.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots declared their independence in the northern
part of the island in 1983. But their self-declared republic
is only recognized by Turkey, while the Greek Cypriot government
is internationally recognized.

</P>

He explained that some hope to leave the army to find jobs as
they have been soldiers for long years, and some others are
reluctant to leave their families as they do not know where they
will be sent once they join the national army.
</P>

UNITA generals have been trying hard to persuade their men to
join the national army so as to guarantee the peace process a

LAGOS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's federal government has
launched a rescue plan for the ''moribund'' federal survey
department so that the agency can meet its set goals in nation
building.
</P>
<P>
Surveyor-general of the federation Alhaji Muhammed Yahaya
today confirmed the deplorable state of the agency, saying the
surveying mapping equipment of it was produced more than 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the 52.8 million Naira (about 621,000 US Dollars)
budgetary allocation the establishment got this year is not
enough to even maintain its printing unit.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed the need for adequate funding, saying
the agency would require 3.56 billion Naira (about 42 million US
Dollars) to address its critical capacity needs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the resuscitation of the agency is imperative in
view of Nigeria's leading position in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said the new government initiative to revive the
agency might be connected with its renewed determination to
demarcate the country's interstate and international boundaries,
which was intensified this month.
</P>
<P>
The demarcation of Nigeria's boundaries with Benin Republic
has begun and talks on the same issue is expected to open next
week with the Chad republic.

LUANDA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Council of Ministers
today approved a program for the resettlement of extra soldiers
of the former two warring parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The program was aimed at resettling "as soon as possible" the
extra soldiers of the Angolan government forces and the former
anti-government National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, a press communique issued by the Council of Ministers
said.
</P>
<P>
The fund for the implementation of the program will come from

</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by the former two warring parties,
the resettlement of the extra soldiers is scheduled to start on
August 26.
</P>
<P>
However, the resettlement for extra soldiers could be deferred
due to UNITA's failure to encamp its men on schedule.
</P>
<P>
All of UNITA's 63,000 fighters should be encamped by August 15
under the agreement. But only 58,965 of them have so far been

<P>
NEW YORK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. passenger plane made an
emergency landing here Wednesday evening because of engine trouble
developed shortly after its takeoff from a local airport.
</P>
<P>
The Delta Airlines 727, with 132 passengers on board, sent a
sizzling hot piece of metal crashing into a man's driveway.
</P>
<P>
Bill Berry, a Delta spokesman, said Flight 801, which was
heading to Tampa, Florida, landed safely at Kennedy Airport, the
nearest airport, as one of its three engines lost power shortly
after takeoff from La Guardia Airport at about 7:20 p.m..
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a man called Conti who lives in Queens near the
airport, said a piece of metal fell from the sky with a strange
sound, landed in his driveway. "It was boiling hot," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has the errant part and
will return it to Atlanta, where Delta is based, for further
inspections, Berry said.
</P>
<P>
Just last month, a woman and her young daughter were killed
on board a Delta airliner when an engine failure sent pieces of
metal hurtling into the cabin as the MD-88 jet was taking off from
Pensacola, Florida. The two engines were made by the same company.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said in Istanbul today that peaceful solutions must be
sought and found in order to solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the statement after Turkish troops killed
Wednesday a Greek Cypriot demonstrator who climbed a flag pole and
tried to tear down the Turkish flag in a buffer zone splitting
Cyprus into Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north.
</P>
<P>
He described the latest developments in northern Cyprus as
provocative.
</P>
<P>
"These events are provocations that benefit nobody. They won't
solve the problems of Cyprus. This kind of provocations won't
destroy the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' and they are
wrong."
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot demonstrator was killed after the funeral of
another Greek Cypriot, Tassos Isaac, 24, who was beaten to death
Sunday in clashes between the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and the
Turkish troops along the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone controlled
by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether this shooting was necessary, Demirel replied: "
We don't know the conditions of the shooting. If there was a
provocation, we could not foretell the end of it. No one shoots
for fun. When masses are provoked, it is very difficult to say
anything when or how the events will end."
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus and the soldiers are under strict orders to fire at
anyone crossing the Green Line dividing Cyprus into two parts.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
intervened following a coup backed by Athens and took the northern
part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots declared their independence in their part of
the island in 1983. Their self-declared republic is recognized
only by Turkey. The Greek Cypriot government is internationally
recognized.

UNITED NATIONS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged Eritrea and Yemen to
calm the situation and facilitate the implementation of the
agreement of May 21, 1996, in letter and spirit.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the spokesman for the U.N. chief said
that Boutros-Ghali had been following the situation between
Eritrea and Yemen closely.
</P>
<P>
Ismat Kittani, a U.N. officer in charge of the Department of
Political Affairs, had held a series of meetings with
representatives of Eritrea and Yemen, as well as that of France
during the past three days, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general supported the diplomatic efforts that
France was currently undertaking at both capitals.
</P>
<P>
He also addressed letters yesterday to the presidents of
Eritrea and of Yemen, in which he appealed for maximum restraint
on both sides and appealed for their full cooperation in order to
calm the situation and to facilitate the implementation of the
agreement of 21 May, 1996, in letter and spirit.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Yemen both claimed sovereignty over the Greater
Hanish and other islands in the mouth of the Red Sea and fought a
brief battle over the islands of strategic importance last
December. Presidents of both countries expressed their wish
afterwards for peaceful settlement of the conflict through
dialogue and diplomatic efforts. U.N., France, Egypt and Ethiopia
began diplomatic mediation over the dispute from the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed an agreement in Paris on May 21 to bring
the territorial dispute before the International Court of Justice
at the Hague.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- An emergency was declared at
the St. Lucie nuclear power plant in southern Florida Wednesday
when suspected sabotage glue was found to be poured into three of
the plant's shutdown switches.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors found the glue in three locked switches in a backup
control room that were for emergency shut-down of the nuclear unit
in case the main control room could not do so. The glue left the
switches inoperable, an Associated Press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The plant authorities ordered a security alert at the plant and
notified the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission about the
accident, the Florida Power and Light spokesman Dale Thomas told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was investigating the
case and it was focusing on plant employees and contractors as it
believes the glue was poured by someone with access to the
sensitive area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inspectors were checking the entire plant to make
sure that there were no more damages in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The plant lost its top performance rating in February after
several mishaps and fines for violating safety rules, the report
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Airlines, the
leading airline company of the U.S., said it reached agreement
with Boeing Co. on a long-awaited 2.5 billion U.S. dollar order
for replacement aircraft, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The order consists of wide-bodied 747s and 777s and some
narrow-bodied 757s, it said. The airline said the specifics about
the order -- numbers of each type of plane, engine selection and
delivery schedules -- won't be released until it finalizes a
pending order for 600 million U.S. dollars of smaller planes.
</P>
<P>
Individuals familiar with the large order said it includes firm
orders for between 12 and 19 747-400s and 11 options for the jumbo
jet. The order also includes two 777 wide-bodied planes and six
757-200s. Nearly 500 million U.S. dollars of the order would go to
engine-maker Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a division of United Technologies
Corp., according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The planes would be delivered between next year and 2002,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Such an order would significantly update United's 747 fleet
without expanding it, the paper said.
