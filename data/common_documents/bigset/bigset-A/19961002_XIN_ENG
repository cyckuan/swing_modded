<HEADLINE> EU Takes U.S. to Word Trade Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
European Union (EU) agreed today to challenge Washington before
the World Trade Organization over the Helms-Burton law, escalating
its dispute with the United States over the trade legislation
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Union foreign ministers decided on the complaint, ending months
of speculation over how far the 15-nation bloc was prepared to go
to roll back the Helms-Burton Act.
</P>
<P>
An Irish presidency spokesman said the complaint would be filed
on October 16.
</P>
<P>
The EU had previously indicated that it would wait until after
the November U.S. presidential election to make the move, hoping
that negotiations in a post-election climate would be easier.
</P>
<P>
"The view is that this is something that cannot wait," an Irish
EU presidency spokesman said, "The EU interests need to be
protected and prevaricating on it would only send a weak and
indecisive signal."
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after the ministers held a closed-door meeting
to discuss opposition to the Helms-Burton Act.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the act allows American citizens or
companies to sue in U.S. courts foreign companies or individuals
deemed to have gained from investments in Cuban property
confiscated after the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been considering a raft of retaliatory measures
against the act and also the D'Amato Bill, which seeks to outlaw
trade with Iran and Libya. Escalating the dispute to the WTO was
considered a drastic, albeit dramatic, last resort.
</P>
<P>
However, it was learned that it would not be possible for a WTO
panel to meet until after the U.S. elections, despite the October
complaint.

<HEADLINE> France Freezes Bank Deposit of Ex-Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- France today decided to freeze
nearly 600 million U.S. dollars of banking deposits by the former
Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia in nine French banks.
</P>
<P>
Francine Levon-Guerin, vice-president of a Paris court, said
that a ban has been in force on any withdrawal of the fund until
an agreement has been reached among the former Yugoslav republics
or a decision is made by the international community to solve
definitely the dispute over the fund.
</P>
<P>
The French decision was made after Slovenia, Bosnia, Croatia
and Macedonia have jointly asked France to take measures to
prevent the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from withdrawing the
money.
</P>
<P>
The court also gave 15 days to the banks to provide the list of
the accounts opened by the former Yugoslav republics until
December 31, 1990, the statement on the movements of the funds
from that date, and the amount of the fund deposited and its
interest added from that date up to now.
</P>
<P>
If the banks cannot provide them in time, they will be imposed
1,000 francs in fine each day, said the court.
</P>
<P>
The decision is opposed by the central bank of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, the National Bank of Yugoslavia, which was
founded in 1993 and regards itself as the inheritor of the former
central bank of the ex-Yugoslav federation.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Begin Mop-up Operations In North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 1 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lankan government troops
involved in Operation Sathjaya (Certain Victory) began mopping-up
operations Monday after capturing the key Northern town of
Kilinochchi from the rebels, Military officials said today.
</P>
<P>
They said there were no civilians or Tamil rebels in the
deserted town. The civilians are believed to have fled in July
during Sathjaya I phase.
</P>
<P>
Main buildings in the town had been blown up by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels before they withdrew, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 269 government troops were killed and 311 others
injured during the third stage of Operation Sathjaya while the
LTTE rebels lost about 700 soldiers and at least 800 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE said they were still fighting the government troops in
Kilinochchi District. But other reports said the rebels had
retreated to the nearby jungles in Madhu, Mannar District and were
setting up camps there.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a 13-year guerrilla war for
a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, moves are afoot to bring back the civilians to
Kilinochchi. But they will be taken only after the completion of
the mopping-up operations, the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> EU Looks to Integrating Health in Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has recently adopted a report calling for the integration of
health requirements in European Union (EU) policies.
</P>
<P>
The report, stressing the need to integrate health requirements
at an early stage into the drafting of policies and action
programs, said almost all major policy areas in the EU
increasingly had an impact, directly or indirectly, on health.
</P>
<P>
For example, work on tobacco took place in the context of
preventive activities by the Europe Against Cancer Program.
Agricultural policy dealt with tobacco production, and indirect
taxation of tobacco products was being considered within taxation
policy.
</P>
<P>
There had been some progress in raising awareness of the
importance of health within other policies, both in member
countries and at EU level, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the report stressed that in many sectors the questions
of how to integrate health requirements in a given policy area, or
how and by which criteria to judge success or failure, were still
to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
In publishing this report, the EC was seeking to stimulate
debate on these questions.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Summit Starts in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The emergency Mideast Peace
Summit began this morning with U.S. President Bill Clinton
starting to hold separate talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
The Summit, to be joined later by King Hussein of Jordan, is
designed to defuse the new tensions in the Mideast and renew peace
negotiations to prevent a collapse of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein and Netanyahu arrived here on Monday and Arafat
arrived about 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT) after stops in Egypt and
Luxemburg for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak -- who
declined to attend the summit -- and European ministers on last
week's eruption of Arab-Israeli violence in the West Bank and Gaza
and the fraying of Israel-Palestinian peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was meeting privately in Washington with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa before the White House meetings.
Moussa was representing Mubarak in Washington during the summit
although he was not taking a direct part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Luxemburg, Arafat told reporters he would attend
the Washington summit with "no conditions or ultimatums."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. hoped the summit would revive Mideast peace process.
Netanyahu offered to hold continuous negotiations with the
Palestinians until they resolve all obstacles to implementing
their peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"I call on both sides immediately after the conference in
Washington to enter into continuous negotiations at an agreed-upon
location and to hold them until agreement is reached," Netanyahu
told reporters en route to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Follow-on talks were to occur later on Tuesday and Wednesday at
the White House and Blair House, a government guest house for
distinguished foreign visitors just across Pennsylvania Avenue.

<HEADLINE> 1.4 Billion Older People By 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The global population of people
aged 60 and older will reach about 1.4 billion by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of these elderly will be in developing
countries, United Nations figures released Tuesday show.
</P>
<P>
By 2050, people of this age group will total 1.5 billion, up by
nearly 550 million from today. Major growth of the older
population will occur in developing countries, particularly in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Due to declines in fertility and improvements in longevity, the
proportion of older people is expected to grow from the present
nearly one person in 10 worldwide to an estimated 1.5 in 10 by
2050.
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, it will reach one person in three in countries of
the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) by
2030.
</P>
<P>
Noticeably, the proportion of older women is steadily
growing. On average, women now live four years longer than men
worldwide. At present, 302 million of the global older population
are women and 247 million are men.

RIGA, Latvia, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Latvian Foreign Minister
Valdis Birkavs said today that Sino-Latvian relations have greatly
improved in the last two years and a new momentum of development
is on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the two countries could further enhance
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister told a Xinhua delegation that a string of
agreements signed after the normalization of relations between the
two sides in 1994 had yielded positive results.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid economic development deeply impressed him during
his trip to there, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Latvia's foreign policy, the priority was to return to
Europe and join the European Union (EU) and NATO, he said.
</P>
<P>
More work had to be done for his country to be a full member of
the EU.
</P>
<P>
The timing of Latvia's joining NATO would be determined by
internal reforms of the organization, its relations with Russia
and several other factors, said Birkavs.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his country also hoped for better relations
with Russia. The two sides were conducting negotiations on border
issues, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today proposed convening a summit of leaders of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS) to discuss the recent violence in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, in hospital preparing for heart surgery, instructed
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to contact the leaders of
interested CIS countries about the possible summit, said the
Itar-Tass new agency quoting a statement issued by the
presidential press service.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not make clear when the meeting could be held
or who would be invited.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in 1979 but withdrew 10
years later after failing to suppress guerrilla resistance.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the former Soviet Central Asian republics are
worried about the fast advance of Afghanistan's Taliban fighters
who seized the capital Kabul on Friday, and were advancing towards
the borders of CIS central Asian states.
</P>
<P>
Russia is especially worried about the Tajik-Afghan border
where it has stationed about 25,000 troops to help patrol the
frontier between CIS member Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The border has become the site of frequent clashes between the
pro-Moscow Tajik government in Dushanbe and Afghan-based Islamic
guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel Continues Reinforcement in W. Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel today continued to
reinforce its troops stationed in the West Bank with more tanks,
digging trenches and establishing sandy barricades, particularly
in the Nablus area.
</P>
<P>
According to a Jerusalem Media and Communication Center
report, despite the Israeli army's deployment and the siege on
the territories, the West Bank and Gaza Strip are generally
quiet.
</P>
<P>
However, there were still stone-throwing incidents in some
parts of the West Bank, including Hebron, Shu'fat refugee camp
and Al-Ram village near Ramallah, but no casualties were
reported.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) today claimed that the
Israel's deployment of heavy weapons in the West Bank is
"aimed at exerting pressure on the Palestinian leadership."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the PNA information ministry, the PNA
expressed concern over a possibility of the using those weapons to
"bombard and destroy Palestinian towns, villages and refugee
camps."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uzi Dayan, head of Israeli army's central command,
told Israel Radio that the situation in the Palestinian
self-ruled areas has calmed down for the past two days, but it is
still very tense.
</P>
<P>
Dayan said that the Israeli army is using this time "to
improve its readiness for eventualities," while the Palestinian
police are trying, in most places, to keep the situation
quiet.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols
in his sector will not be resumed, until the question of
cooperation between the Israeli army and the Palestinian police
is reviewed.
</P>
<P>
The joint patrols in the West Bank have halted following
last week's violent clashes between Israel and the Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which left over 60 dead
and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Israeli army today lifted the
ban on the entry of Israeli journalists into the Palestinian
autonomous areas in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
An army announcement said that after reexaming the situation
in the PNA controlled areas, the army decided to allow
Israeli journalists into the areas, but they will be required
to coordinate their entry with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after harsh criticism of the ban,
imposed by the army on Monday, which the army argued was
to protect the Israeli journalists.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Misuari Responsible for Bringing MILF to Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of a government
panel negotiating with the southern Philippines armed groups said
today that Nur Misuari should be responsible for bringing the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Fortunato Abat said that Misuari, who, now governor of the
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), is charged with
overseeing peace in his areas and should "initiate now a
reconciliation of all his people" the way President Fidel Ramos
did.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway group of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) led by Misuari, has become the largest rebel group in
the country after the MNLF signed a final peace agreement with the
government on September 2.
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of Misuari to reconcile his people as
chief executive of the ARMM and it is his responsibility to see to
it that there is peace and order in his areas because he is the
chief executive," Abat said.
</P>
<P>
He said Misuari should follow the reconciliatory path of Ramos
and go out to seek the support of those who did not vote for him.
He added that the government panel, which has yet to be formed,
will first see whether Misuari can prod the MILF into accepting a
peace offer within the framework of the constitution and the peace
agreement sealed between the MNLF and the government.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is still working out a comprehensive
ceasefire agreement with the MILF.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Calls for Private Sector's Role in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba today called on the country's private sector to help
the government attain its goal set in a nationwide tourism
promotion campaign to be launched in 1998.
</P>
<P>
As the country's target of tourist arrivals has not yet been
achieved, the government has decided to launch the Visit Nepal
Year 1998 program aimed at attracting 500,000 foreign tourists in
that year, Deuba said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a one-day seminar held here on the Visit Nepal Year
campaign, Deuba called for cooperation between the private sector
and the government in promoting international tourism market and
developing tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the program would help prepare
necessary groundwork for increasing tourist arrivals and provide a
basis for various tourism promotion events to be launched in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Nepal is rich in natural and cultural heritage
especially the world-famous snow-capped mountains, Deuba also
stressed the need to improve the environment in Kathmandu, capital
city of the country.
</P>
<P>
The worsening pollution in Kathmandu, the first stop for most
foreign visitors to Nepal, has become a major headache for the
Nepali government in recent years when the city has seen rapid
urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Nepal now attracts some 350,000 foreign tourists every year
with annual tourism earnings of nearly 90 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Irish Economy Expected to Grow by 6 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's economy is expected to
grow by about 6 percent this year and 5 percent in 1997, according
to Irish Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand in 1996 has expanded faster than in 1995 but
export growth is likely to be considerably slower than last year
due to the BSE, or mad cow disease, crisis and a slowdown in
exports in certain manufactured products, said ESRI in its
quarterly bulletin reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Though Ireland's economic growth rate was showing a slight
deceleration from 1994 and 1995, the institute said, it was still
well above the European Union average, which it forecast at less
than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Despite considerable uncertainty surrounding the economic
prospects for Europe as a whole in 1997, the Irish economy is
projected to grow by 5 percent," it added.
</P>
<P>
The state-sponsored research center suggested that new capacity
facilitate continued increase in manufactured exports while
domestic demand grow at a moderate rate, encouraged by relatively
low interest rates and significant reductions in effective average
tax rates.

<HEADLINE> Ministerial Meeting on Infrastructure In Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A ministerial conference on
infrastructure called by the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission in Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) will be held in New
Delhi late this month, according to an ESCAP press release today.
</P>
<P>
The immediate objectives of the conference are to agree to
specific actions to accelerate infrastructure development and
enhance the commitment of ESCAP members in that regard.
</P>
<P>
The conference will review recent developments in
infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region, discuss key issues
related to infrastructure. It will launch the New Delhi Action
Plan on infrastructure development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The sustained rapid growth in most of the region's economies
will continue to pose a myriad of difficulties and challenges.
Infrastructure deficiencies are one specific area which will
seriously hamper future growth opportunities in an increasing
integrated world economy, Bangkok-based ESCAP executive secretary
Adrianus Mooy said, according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP estimated that between 1993 and the year 2000, around
1,500 billion U.S. dollars would be required for infrastructure
development in the developing economies of the region.
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, 500 billion U.S. dollars has been identified as
available or already committed.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the financial gap for new infrastructure
development alone amounts to around 1,000 billion dollars without
taking into account massive sums required for rehabilitation
works.
</P>
<P>
Mooy believed that governments alone cannot satisfy the
large-scale efforts needed to upgrade the existing facilities and
promote further infrastructure development. They must enlist the
support of the private sector and tap into its inherent efficiency
and ability to respond rapidly to changing market conditions as
well as its access to financing.
</P>
<P>
The conference is divided into two segments: a meeting of
senior officials (October 23-26), and a ministerial conference
(October 28-29).
</P>
<P>
Ministers or vice ministers from the 51 members and nine
associate members of ESCAP are expected to adopt a declaration on
infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
A "World Infrastructure Forum, Asia 1996" will also be opened
on October 28, which will continue on October 30-31.

Suleiman al-Khalifa today reiterated his country's support for
Gulf solidarity and for strengthening security and stability

</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration of the 5th session of the Bahraini
Consultative Council in Manama today, the Amir said that his
country endeavors to strengthen the bonds of friendship and
cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members and
other Arab, Islamic and friendly countries on the basis of
mutual respect, non-interference with internal affairs and
settlement of differences through peaceful means within the
framework of fraternal and cordial ties.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Bahrain's decline to participate in the
upcoming 17th GCC summit conference, due to take place in Doha,
Qatar, is prompted by its conviction that the GCC member states
should be given the chance to resolve their differences through
the application of the GCC constitution.

Bahrain announced last month that it would not attend the GCC
summit conference on account of Qatar's refusal to withdraw the

<HEADLINE> Taliban Leader Urges Rivals to Lay Down Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The top leader of the Afghan
Taliban religious student militia, Mullah Omar, has urged his
rivals to lay down their arms, reports from Kabul said today.
</P>
<P>
Omar, who has just arrived in the Afghan capital to set up his
new administration, said, "The opposition should give up
confrontation with the state."
</P>
<P>
Omar's troops have started a tense stand-off with forces of his
new main rival, northern warlord Rashid Dostum, at the
strategically crucial Salang tunnel north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The standoff threatened to explode into renewed bloodshed with
both sides massing troops along the Salang highway to Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The opposition still have the chance to hand over government
property and to save the country from corruption and banditry," he
said, urging Dostum and the ousted government to give up their
territory and weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban took Kabul last Friday and have since been pushing
north toward territory held by Dostum and the forces of the ousted
government.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have given Dostum 24 hours to allow them through
the tunnel, which the warlord's forces have seized in a bid to
ward off an attack on his northern territory, and allow them to
completely wipe off the ousted government's troops, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
The 450-kilometer Salang highway is the only road north of
Kabul to Central Asia, and is vital for trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are squared off about five km apart at the
village of Olang, at the foot of the four-km-long Salang tunnel,
about 150 km north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Dostum had sent 40,000 troops to bolster his
front line against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban now hold more than two-thirds of the country while
the northern provinces controlled by Dostum remain out of the
Taliban's reach.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban vowed to impose their strict brand of Islamic law
across Afghanistan in their two-year campaign to capture the
entire country.
</P>
<P>
Since capturing Kabul last Friday, the Taliban have been
careful not to provoke Dostum, while pursuing the forces of ousted

<HEADLINE> Labor to Build Alliance to Succeed in Europe: Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Robin Cook, shadow
foreign secretary, promised today that Labor will make a fresh
start in Britain's relations with Europe when Britain takes up the
Presidency of the European Union (EU) at the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Opening the debate on Europe at the second day of the Labor
Party Annual Conference, Cook said Labor "will be able to build
the alliances needed to succeed in Europe".
</P>
<P>
"With a Labor government in Britain there will be a majority of
prime ministers from the Party of European Socialists in the EU,"
the shadow secretary said.
</P>
<P>
On the controversial problem of the Social Chapter, Cook said
"Labor will end the opt-out of the Social Chapter and give the
British people rights denied them by the Tories."
</P>
<P>
Cook said under the Tories more and more of British people have
had to go to find work in other countries of Europe, and whatever
country they go to Britain employees enjoy more rights at work
than if they had stayed here in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"That's the price of the Tory opt-out from the Social Chapter,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Within the first year after the general election, Britain will
become President of the EU, on January 1, 1998. Cook said: "The
next Labor government will end the Britain opt-out and sign up to
the Social Chapter before that date."
</P>
<P>
Concerning the new membership of the EU, Cook said: "Labor will
begin negotiations to admit new members of the European Union
under Britain's Presidency."
</P>
<P>
"Nations today are more interdependent than they are
independent. Labor is an internationalist party....We know that
nations, like people can achieve more by working together," Cook
added.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Single Market, Cook set himself a target
that "Britain will only benefit if we can compete on level terms".
But he said: "The single market would work better with a single
currency."
</P>
<P>
"That is why Labor believes that for Britain to join asingle
currency we need first to achieve convergence of economic
performance in the real world of output, of investment and of
jobs," the shadow secretary explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today warned that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will further
deteriorate if the Israeli government fails to restore the
confidence of the Palestinians and withdraw troops from the West
Bank town of Hebron in accordance with the signed agreement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israeli newspaper Maariv, President
Mubarak warned that Israel will lose its credibility, and acts of
violence will be renewed.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he had apologized for not taking part in
the Washington summit in response to Egyptian public opinion.
</P>
<P>
"How can I go while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
is announcing that he has re-opened the tunnel near the Al Aqsa
Mosque," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also said that Arafat feared that he might
return to his people from Washington empty-handed. Mubarak said
that Arafat is the only Palestinian leader capable of making
decisions. "Should anything happen to him, Israel will find itself
be forced to use tanks against the Palestinian people and will
have problems with the whole Arab and Islamic world," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflict on
the Egyptian-Israeli relations, President Mubarak said "such
situation will certainly affect these relations, whether we like

<HEADLINE> Irish Customs Police Discover More Cocaine on Trawler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Irish customs officials
announced today that they have discovered more cocaine aboard a
trawler seized in Cork harbor, southern Ireland over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The haul of about 600-kilo of cocaine is believed to be one of
the biggest ever drug shipments from South America to Europe,
according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Liam Hurley, Director of the Irish Customs National Drugs Team,
told the Irish Radio that more than half a ton of cocaine had now
been found in secret compartments inside the Sea Mist.
</P>
<P>
"It is huge and we have found 420 packets and two bales of
cocaine. The definitive weight and purity will be determined by
the police forensic laboratory, but we would estimate it as
somewhere between 500 and 600 kilos," he said.
</P>
<P>
The seized cocaine were found in a converted Norwegian trawler
docked in Cork harbor, southern Ireland, Irish police announced
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy gales had forced the ship, the Sea Mist, to deviate from
its original route between Venezuela and northern Europe and seek
shelter in the Irish dock.
</P>
<P>
Irish police said that five crew members, including two British
citizens, have been arrested under the new legislation which
allows suspected drug-traffickers to be detained for up to seven
days without charge.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their conviction that the shipment was destined
for France or Denmark, but they were investigating the possibility
of an Irish connection in the operation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Has Reneged on Commitments, Lebanon FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Fares Bouez, the foreign
minister of Lebanon, said on Tuesday Israel has reneged on its
commitments to the Middle East peace process, which began at
Madrid Peace Conference in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Assembly, Bouez listed four NO's taken
by the Israeli new government: no to the withdrawal from the
occupied Syrian Golan; no to the withdrawal from the occupied West
Bank; no to the settlement of the question of Jerusalem and no to
the realization of the Palestinian people's inalienable right to
establish their state.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to our expectations, the principle of land for peace
was replaced by the principle of peace for security, meaning
refraining from waging a new war," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that Israel does not have a policy for peace," he
said. "It only has a policy for changing formulas, a policy of
threats and challenges, and one that Israel can use to further
expansionist and settlement schemes."
</P>
<P>
In this situation, he said, the only way to revive the peace
process is to return to the basics of peace as agreed in Madrid,
resume the negotiations from where they were halted, and realize
that the opportunity for peace may not be repeated.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA,, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan traders strike against
Value Added tax (VAT) went on today in capital Kampala and other
major towns in the country.
</P>
<P>
Riot police patrolled major streets in Kampala as business
stalled following a traders' protest starting on Monday by traders
seeking either reduction of a 17 percent VAT rate or complete
suspension of the controversial tax passed by parliament and carried
out from July 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles are running on streets as before, but some customers
waited in front of shops in hope of reopening of shops.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shops in the city remained closed today despite
president yoweri museveni has appealed for the reopenning of shops
while he bakes consultations with cabinet members over the problem.
</P>
<P>
The president on Sunday met representatives of the Traders's
Association at Rwakitura in southwestern Uganda and promised to make
public his decision in two weeks time.
</P>
<P>
However, banks, pharmacies, clinics and eating houses in the
city center and suburbs still remain open for business. No violent
incidents occurred as riot police patrolled streets to check
possible violence.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from other parts of the country said all
shops in Iganga Town, 35 km east of Kampala closed today because of
the strike.
</P>
<P>
In Jinja, 80 km east of here, many shops remained closed on
Monday and Tuesday as owners of the shops were threatened by
unknown people to beat them and loot their shops if they continued
operating.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnia-Herzegovina
presidency "is now legal," the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje quoted
High Representative of the international community Carl Bildt as
saying Tuesday after its first session.
</P>
<P>
Sarajevo media said the preliminary meeting of the three-member
presidency on Monday was a good sign for the future.
</P>
<P>
Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic, Serb Momcilo Krajisnik and
Croat Kresimir Zubak held their first and historic meeting in a
Sarajevo motel Saraj Monday afternoon. The three were elected as
the joint presidency members by their ethnic voters.
</P>
<P>
"The future begins on October 5 this year," Yugoslav news
agency quoted some Sarajevo media as saying. October 5 is the date
when the Bosnian presidency and assembly's house of
representatives will be in constitutive session.
</P>
<P>
After the session, the official functioning of the main common
institutions will begin. The common bodies are to bind the
Muslim-Croat and Serb entities in Bosnia in a new way.
</P>
<P>
An important step in these new relations is the agreement on
establishing a new Bosnian government by October 30 this year.
This would pave the way for negotiations with international banks
on the reconstruction of the entire territory of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Media in Sarajevo gave coverage to the presidency's appeal that
all three languages be used -- Bosnian (the language of Bosnian
Muslims), Serbian and Croatian, and both scripts (Cyrillic and
Latin), and that the media war finally stop in the country.
</P>
<P>
An agreement between the presidency members on Monday that
mutual telephone and telecommunications should be established
immediately will also help toward a better start of the dialogue
between the two entities.

</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries' ties could serve as a
"successful pattern" for establishing bilateral and multi-lateral
ties with other countries, especially with Arab states.

Regional interests necessitate further upgrading of regional
cooperation through mutual understanding and exchange of views,
he was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying.

He also emphasized the need to implement the signed agreements
between the two countries in the fields of economy and culture.

Hassun termed the outcome of his talks with Iranian officials
as "positive" and said that Iran and Syria have acquired
valuable experiences in the areas of legislation and judiciary
and that exchange of the experiences could be effective in
preserving and strengthening bilateral and regional
interests.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM: Iraqi Pipeline to Open Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said today that the
Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline linking Turkey and Iraq would be
reopened in a few weeks in line with the U.N.'s oil-for-food
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the remarks at the Istanbul Ataturk Airport upon
her return from New York where she attended a U.N. General
Assembly meeting.
</P>
<P>
She said that U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had
told her that the pipeline, which was closed since the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, would be opened soon.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Resolution 986 allows Iraq to sell oil worth two
billion U.S. dollars over a period of six months to buy food
and medicine in order to allay the adverse humanitarian effects
of the international embargo on that country.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi troops push into northern Iraq to back the Kurdistan
Democratic Party against its rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
there had led to the suspension of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Ciller also said that the need to protect the rights of the
Turkomans in northern Iraq was generally acknowledged and became
an issue that was receiving acceptance in the U.N. and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
She added that she found the opportunity in New York to
clarify the situation concerning Turkey's declared intention to
set up a security zone on the Iraqi side of the border
with Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expects "Some Real Progress" in Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Monday convened an emergency Middle East summit by pulling two
antagonists of Israeli and Palestinian leaders together with King
Hussein of Jordan attendance at the White House in a desperate
effort to salvage the collapsing peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
In picture-taking sessions, Clinton told reporters: "Our role
is to try to help people get together and move forward", adding
"substantive decisions" have to be made by the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to turn back," said Clinton, who hastily arranged
the summit on Sunday after the situations in the Middle East were
deteriorating as a result of clashes between the Israelis and the
Palestinians and began to affecting his re-election with possible
bankruptcy of his Middle East peace policy.
</P>
<P>
There were no handshakings at the White House picture-taking
sessions. Clinton had King Hussein sitting to right. Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
were on opposite couches. Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of
State Warren Christopher also attended the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made some remarks such as he would "absolutely"
committed to the pursuit of peace. But Arafat and Hussein made no
statements.
</P>
<P>
Clinton first met King Hussein on Sunday evening during which
King Hussein proposed to appoint a commission to look into the
dispute over Netanyahu's decision last Tuesday to open an ancient
tunnel that led to Palestinians'' protests evolving into riots
with Israeli suppressions on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The
four consecutive days of clashes between the Israelis and the
Palestinians caused about 70 lives and several of hundreds
wounded.
</P>
<P>
This Morning, Clinton first met Netanyahu, then talked with
Arafat at the Oval Office, White House, with nothing revealed to
the press here.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. officials said the summit would take place under
"Dayton rules" -- a reference to the intensive closed-door
U.S.-sponsored negotiations in Dayton, Ohio, that led to last
year's Bosnian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
There will be a news blackout during the summit and no
statements would come out until the conclusion of the meetings,
said U.S. and Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he expected "some real progress" would be made
after the summit. "We are going to do our best," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the president was not intended to apply pressure on
Netanyahu and Arafat, saying: "What the United States has done
since I have been president is not to pressure anyone."
</P>
<P>
White House officials offered a gloomy assessment of the talks
</P>
<P>
The peace process in the Middle East is "in a very bad way
right now," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said. "it's not
possible at this moment to be encouraged, but it is necessary to
be determined."
</P>
<P>
The distrust between Netanyahu and Arafat is so intense that
they are barely on speaking terms, a senior administration
official said. "We can help them, but we can't make decisions for
them."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said it was even uncertain whether the two leaders
would shake hands and continue talks this afternoon at Blair
House, as had been anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said given the outcome of the talks
uncertain, it would be considered a diplomatic accomplishment if
President Clinton could get Netanyahu and Arafat to shake hands
ans start talking.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrange the emergency summit with some political risks,
they said. There is no guarantee that Netanyahu and Arafat will
find a formula to end violence on the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
If he tries to push Netanyahu into concessions to the
Palestinian Authority, he runs a political risk five weeks before
the presidential election. If he pressures Arafat he risks
alienating the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Already, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has refused his
invitation to assist in the Washington summit. And his European
allies have joined with the Arab world in criticizing Israel for
the clashes.

<P>
KAMPALA,, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan traders strike against
Value Added tax (VAT) went on today in capital Kampala and other
major towns in the country.
</P>
<P>
Riot police patrolled major streets in Kampala as business
stalled following a traders' protest starting on Monday by traders
seeking either reduction of a 17 percent VAT rate or complete
suspension of the controversial tax passed by parliament and carried
out from July 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles are running on streets as before, but some customers
waited in front of shops in hope of reopening of shops.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shops in the city remained closed today despite
president yoweri museveni has appealed for the reopenning of shops
while he bakes consultations with cabinet members over the problem.
</P>
<P>
The president on Sunday met representatives of the Traders's
Association at Rwakitura in southwestern Uganda and promised to make
public his decision in two weeks time.
</P>
<P>
However, banks, pharmacies, clinics and eating houses in the
city center and suburbs still remain open for business. No violent
incidents occurred as riot police patrolled streets to check
possible violence.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from other parts of the country said all
shops in Iganga Town, 35 km east of Kampala closed today because of
the strike.
</P>
<P>
In Jinja, 80 km east of here, many shops remained closed on
Monday and Tuesday as owners of the shops were threatened by
unknown people to beat them and loot their shops if they continued
operating.

<HEADLINE> Couple Ordered to Give Adopted Child Back to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A French couple were ordered
today to give back their two-year-old adopted child back to his
biological father by a court in Annecy, eastern France, which
threatened to put them in jail if they refuse.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Francois Buratti and Dominique Buratti today agreed to
make a rapprochement with the natural father of little Mathieu and
to give him back in 25 days, said their lawyer Gilbert Collard.
</P>
<P>
Collard said that the court today made "a precise threat of
imprisonment" on his clients.
</P>
<P>
The child was given to the couple when he was only four days
old by his mother as the Burattis were having a vacation in the
Polynesian islands of the South Pacific. The mother of the child,
a Polynesian woman who was already the single mother of other
three children, got pregnant with Mathieu's biological father when
the latter made a brief stay in Polynesia.
</P>
<P>
The father, a married man who is a school teacher in Troyes,
150 kilometers southeast of Paris, learned about the birth of the
child three months later, and officially recognized and claimed
the child.
</P>
<P>
A lower court in Chambery, which is near Annecy, ruled on March
19 that the child should be given back to his biological father,
but the couple refused and kept the child "in a safe place."
</P>
<P>
The child's father, who wishes to remain anonymous, sued the
couple for "non-presentation of the child" at a higher court in
Annecy, which made the ruling today after a two-day hearing.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav-Macedonian Tariff-Free Trade to Start Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Tariff-free trade between
Yugoslavia and Macedonia will begin Monday, it was announced here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with an interstate agreement on trade, goods made in
the territory of Yugoslavia and Macedonia will not be subject to
customs and non-customs duties, the Yugoslav Information
Secretariat said after a meeting between Yugoslav Prime Minister
Radoje Kontic and Macedonian Transport Minister Dimitar Buzlevski
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav parliament last Friday ratified a trade agreement
reached by the governments of Yugoslavia and Macedonia and signed
in September during Kontic's official visit to Skopje. The two
countries established diplomatic relations in April this year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the payment of only 1 percent for
customs evidencing, while the majority of imported and exported
goods will be on a free regime.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, most of these contingents will be lifted
by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kontic and Buzlevski underscored the need for returning
international traffic to the major European corridor on the
north-south route which passes through Yugoslavia and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
This corridor has over the past few years been forced to make a
detour due to the international sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Macedonia also agreed Tuesday to jointly affirm
their transport potentials in European institutions and
organizations, said an announcement of the Information Ministry
after Buzlevski's separate talks with his Yugoslav counterpart,
Zoran Vujovic, and Yugoslav Vice Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic.

<HEADLINE> GCC Chiefs of Staff to Hold Meeting in Riyadh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) Chiefs of Staff will hold a two-day meeting in Riyadh,
capital of Saudi Arabia, next Sunday to prepare for a GCC defense
ministers meeting due next month, Kuwait News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted diplomatic sources as saying that the Chiefs
of Staff would discuss in their 14th meeting developing the
Peninsula Shield in north Saudi Arabia, operating the early
warning system, connecting the GCC states and conducting joint
exercises.
</P>
<P>
It said the outcome of the proposed defense ministers meeting
would be raised in the GCC leaders' summit scheduled for December
in Doha, capital of Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain have been striving in
the past several years to expand the 10,000-man GCC Peninsula
Shield force to 25,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Upgrading that Saudi-dominated force, formed to counter
aggression against the alliance, has long been on the GCC's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
But so far, the Gulf states have been unable to overcome their
differences to agree on building up the joint force, which was
totally ineffective in countering the 1990 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Gulf War and the frequent afterwards crisis in the
region heightened the concerns about regional security which
still bother the six GCC states.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated conferences, they have failed to produce a
cohesive, intergrated defense structure and rely on the United
States and its allies for protection, which antagonized Islamic
fundamentalists in Iran, which is also a Gulf country in
confrontation with the U.S. in the region.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states view Iraq as potential threats, although it is
crippled by U.N. sanctions since 1990.
</P>
<P>
There have signs of growing differences between the GCC
partners, especially during the recent strikes launched by the
U.S. against Iraq and U.S. deployment of new military forces in
Kuwait territories. All the GCC partners but Kuwait, Saudi Arabia
failed to support the U.S. action in the region.

JERUSALEM, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians held peace
marches in the Gaza Strip and West Bank today to demonstrate
their support for the Arab-Israeli Washington summit, according to
a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
All public transport services observed a general five-minute
halt to show support for the peace process, which is in jeopardy
as a result of the bloody clashes between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian demonstrators last week.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the situation in the Palestinian territories is
tensely quiet and Palestinians are anxiously awaiting the results
of the summit, which is expected to conclude today.
</P>
<P>
In the Hebron area, few incidents were reported between
Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces when curfew was lifted
for four hours this morning. Several youngsters were arrested and
the curfew was reimposed on the city.
</P>
<P>
The harsh military siege is continuing for the fifth
consecutive day throughout the territories. Israeli tanks remain
in place. Food shortages are reported here and there.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah, the 88-member Palestinian Council met at noon
with abstention of some who were unable to attend due to the
general border closure.
</P>
<P>
International emergency aid is continuing to arrive in the
territories. The German government has decided to provide 291,060
U.S. dollars of humanitarian aid. According to the German
Representative Office in Jericho, 132,300 dollars will be used to
purchase two sanitation vehicles, while the rest of the money will
be used for purchasing emergency assistance kits to equip the
thirty ambulances of the Palestinian Red Crescent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nam Thai (Thai Leadership)
Party, led by former banker Amnuay Virawan, decided to disband
today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a party caucus, which believed that
the current political climate in the country was not suitable for
the party's growth, the local media quoted a statement of the
party as saying.
</P>
<P>
Apparently the statement was referring to vote-buying in
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay, leader of the party and also a deputy prime minister
and foreign minister in Banharn Silpa-Archa's government, today
also announced in the northeast that he was quitting politics and
would not contest the November 17 election.
</P>
<P>
The party, which Amnuay founded before the July 2, 1995,
general election, had 18 seats in the House of Representatives and
was one of the partners in Banharn's coalition government.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Amnuay and former MP Niphon Tarapoom, who
is to join the Democrat Party, the remaining 16 MPs are to run
under the New Aspiration Party, led by caretaker Deputy Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
</P>
<P>
With the main event likely to be between the Democrat Party and
the New Aspiration Party, small parties feel that they would have
difficulties in making independent achievements, Amnuay said.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay is the second party leader to have bowed out. Thaksin
Shinawatra of the Palang Dharma (Virtue Force) Party did so
earlier.

LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- English soccer club
Middlesbrough said Wednesday Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli
would not be signing for Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
There was a rumor on Ravanelli Tuesday after he broke off from
training with the Italian squad in Florence and expressed an
interest in playing for the English champion Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's English newspapers claimed United was poised to
make a 15.7 million U.S. dollars bid for the 27-year-old, top
scorer in the English premier league this season.
</P>
<P>
United immediately dismissed the rumor as "absolute nonsense",
and later Wednesday Middlesbrough followed suit.
</P>
<P>
"Middlesbrough Football Club wish to make it clear that
Fabrizio Ravanelli will not be joining Manchester United or any
other club," chief executive Keith Lamb was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ravanelli himself said he had been misrepresented in the
English press.
</P>
<P>
"I never said Manchester United had made a bid," he told BBC
Radio from Italy.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Hails End of U.N. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic has spoken highly of the complete removal of sanctions
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which is comprised of
Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the hardest times that have befallen our country in its
recent history are finally behind us. The sanctions have been
lifted," Milosevic said late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came soon after the U.N. Security Council passed
Resolution 1074 unanimously lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the sanctions is a historic act for Yugoslavia,
which had struggled under the economic embargo for four-and-half
years.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 10 months, since Dayton, we have begun a
successful economic recovery under the conditions of suspended
sanctions," the Tanjug news agency quoted the Serbian president as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the sanctions have been lifted, the recovery should
be much faster and much more successful. From now on, our future
depends on our work.
</P>
<P>
"Now successful economic development and the raising of living
standards are more at hand and easier to achieve."
</P>
<P>
"Our country, which has great potential for a speedy economic
development, will use that potential successfully and in the best
possible way, and that depends on all of us," Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia on
May 30, 1992, for its alleged involvement in the Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the U.N.'s recent decision was a
recognition of Belgrade's peace policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economic embargo against the Bosnian Serb
entity, Republika Srpska, was also lifted under the same
U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
So conditions for peaceful development and prosperity of all
states in the former Yugoslavia have been created.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Sanctions Committee was automatically dissolved at the
same time as resolution 1074 took effect on Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Health Service Bill Approved in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A health service bill was
approved today by Nepal's lower house with the objective of
ensuring basic medical service for the country's remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Arjun Narasingh K.C. told the lower house today
that the 1996 health service bill encourages Nepali doctors to go
to remote and hilly areas in the country and provide minimum
health services to people living there.
</P>
<P>
The government is offering incentives to physicians to
encourage medical practice in these often poverty-stricken areas,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The incentives include more facilities for physicians working
in remote hospitals and additional allowances between 125 and 150
percent of their basic salaries, health officials here said.
</P>
<P>
The government has also made other arrangements like
opportunities of training abroad and faster professional promotion
for those who have worked in remote areas for a certain period of
time, they added.
</P>
<P>
Lack of health service in Nepal's rural areas usually forces
local patients to seek medical treatment in urban hospitals,
making them pay much more for their medical care than those living
in urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Welcomes UAE Extension of Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today welcomed the extension of amnesty by the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) to illegal and overstaying foreign workers, which
allows them to leave the country without fine or penalty.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly press conference here this afternoon, Ramos said he
was pleased that the UAE government extended the amnesty deadline
from September 30 to October 31 to allow the estimated 200,000
illegal workers to legalize their stay or leave without penalty.
</P>
<P>
Under the UAE immigration law, which came to effect Tuesday,
overstaying foreign workers are fined 100 dirhams (27 U.S.
dollars) a day for overstaying or illegal stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 200,000 immigrant workers are from India, Pakistan,
Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the extension of the amnesty period, originally from
July 1 to September 30, has been a relief to these illegal migrant
workers and enabled them to have an orderly departure from the
Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
He added that some 4,070 Filipino migrant workers, mostly
domestic helpers, have already sought embassy assistance for the
amnesty and about 2,585 had left for the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, about 4 million Filipinos are
working in Asian and Middle East countries, most of them are
domestic helpers.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Red Cross Leaders Stress Disaster Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Red Cross and Red Crescent
leaders from Southeast Asian nations agreed here today that
natural disaster management is an important task facing their
societies.
</P>
<P>
A report issued at the end of the ninth conference of Red Cross
and Red Crescent leaders from members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) indicated that the region is
frequently hit by climate-related and other disasters.
</P>
<P>
It thus urged that due attention be given to pre-disaster,
disaster, and post-disaster management.
 The conference agreed that the establishment of an efficient
transportation and communications network is one of the key
components of effective and timely disaster management in the
region, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Such a network would allow more pre-disaster warning time for
people, facilitate assistance during the disaster phase and help
accelerate post-disaster rehabilitation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the three-day gathering discussed topics
such as disaster preparedness and relief, fund raising,
cooperation in blood transfusion service and HIV and aids
prevention and control, and promotion of community-based health
care.
</P>
<P>
The conference urged the Red Cross ad Red Crescent societies in
the ASEAN countries to launch new initiatives to raise funds and
set up a special division with a strong fund-raising orientation.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended that a working committee be created to
coordinate blood transfusion services.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were some 60 representatives from
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam and observers from international organizations, other
countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Urban Leaders Meet for Better Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of a dozen major
cities in the Asia-Pacific region today planted trees in a park in
Guangzhou, capital city of south China's Guangdong Province, as a
way of expressing the wish to seek a more comfortable environment
for urban residents.
</P>
<P>
They were in Guangzhou attending the Second Conference of Asian
and Pacific Urban Leaders, which ended today after reaching a
consensus that human needs, instead of economic growth, should be
the center of urban construction and development.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the conference came from 20 big cities in the
Asia-Pacific region, and included Japan's Fukuoka, Bangkok,
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Oakland in New Zealand, Hong Kong, and
China's Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
All the cities have achieved some economic success. Now their
major concerns are the same: using the limited resources to
beautify the living environments of residents.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Dalian, a seaside city in northeast China, said
that it is important to give people more chance to have
face-to-face contact, which can help avoid the isolation and
solitude urban residents often suffer.
</P>
<P>
The city is now launching a campaign to persuade all institutes
to dismantle their walls and share the limited space and greenland
with the general public.
</P>
<P>
Japanese delegates stressed the significance of public opinion
in city planning and construction.
</P>
<P>
All the urban leaders agreed that urban residents should be
encouraged to adopt healthy and positive life styles, and
traditional cultures and values should be cherished and emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Private funds are of critical importance in speeding up urban
construction, which often falls behind the rapid growth of urban
population, they said.
</P>
<P>
They shared the belief that 21st century will be an era in
which Asian and Pacific cities will catch the world's
attention. To turn this belief into reality, they pledged to
strengthen exchanges and cooperation between their cities.

TIANJIN, October 2 (Xinhua) -- North China's port city of
Tianjin will increase its telephone numbers by one digit from
March 8 next year, becoming the fourth Chinese city to introduce
eight-digit phone numbers.
</P>

paintings at the Mogao Grottos in Dunhuang, an historic town on
the legendary Silk Road in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Since they were first dug and painted about 1,500 years ago,
erosion, earthquakes, wars and desertification have damaged the

In an effort to permanently preserve on camera the cave
paintings, which have been listed by the United Nations

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Deputy Chief Statement Contradictory, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today expressed its
surprise at a statement on Baghdad's past weapons programs issued
by Charles Duelfer, deputy chairman of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq, calling it contradictory.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed, who is leading the
Iraqi talks with U.N. arms inspectors, said in a statement to the
Iraqi News Agency that Duelfer's statement completely conflicts
with what he said at Sunday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
"In our meeting on Sunday, September 29, Mr Duelfer stressed
that the UNSCOM has made important progress in the implementation
of its tasks under (U.N.) Resolutions 687 and 715," Rasheed said.
</P>
<P>
The statement by Duelfer, an American, was a reflection of
the U.S. administration's policy which aims to hinder the
finalization by the UNSCOM of its work in Iraq in a way that
enables the U.N. Security Council to consider the lifting of the
embargo against Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer, who arrived here on Sunday for a visit to Iraq, said
on Tuesday that Iraq still has problems in verifying its
declaration made to UNSCOM last summer on its past arms programs.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed asserted that the Iraqi declaration on its past weapons
programs was detailed and comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iraq has met all the requirements defined by
the UNSCOM under the relevant Security Council resolutions. Iraq is
keen to fully cooperate with the UNSCOM and is fully confident
that the UNSCOM and the Security Council would admit Iraq's full
cooperation despite all U.S. pressure, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed comprehensive economic sanctions on Iraq
including a ban on its oil export after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
August 1990. Before the sanctions are to be removed Iraq must
obtain confirmation from the UNSCOM that it no longer possesses
prohibited weapons of mass destruction.

TOKYO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The food poisoning bacteria that
killed 11 people earlier this summer has struck again in northern
Japan with 165 infected people being diagnosed on Tuesday alone.
</P>
<P>
The incidence has raised fears of a fresh outbreak spreading
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The 165 students and teachers at Midorigaoka Elementary School

</P>
<P>
He said contaminated school lunches were probably the cause of
the latest outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The O-157 bacterium occurs in the intestines of cows and is
commonly transmitted by undercooked beef, poultry or contaminated
water. It causes a severe, flu-like illness and diarrhea that can
lead to kidney damage in serious cases.

<HEADLINE> EC Approves Aid Package for Refugees in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has decided to provide 6.45 million ECU (about 8 million
U.S. dollars) to help refugees stranded in the Algerian desert.
</P>
<P>
The grant, to be channelled via the European Community
Humanitarian Office (ECHO), will provide aid for about 150,000
people living in refugees camps.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian professionals working with non-governmental
organizations based in Belgium, Italy, Spain, France and Germany
will implement in the field the programs which will last six
months.
</P>
<P>
The refugees stranded in Tindouf, Algeria, originally fled
fighting between the Polisario Front and Moroccan government
forces in the late 1970s. Continued instability in the region has
meant that they have been unable to return home.
</P>
<P>
Today, they find themselves living in a particularly arid area
of the Algerian desert, completely dependent on humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, ECHO spent 10.9 million ECU (13.5 million dollars) on
programs to help these refugees, including food aid worth 10.4
million ECU (12.9 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Creation of Special Zone in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
ordered the creation of a special Zone of Peace and Development
(ZOPAD) and a Southern Philippines Council for Peace and
Development (SPCPD) in Mindanao in the southern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the ZOPAD and the SPCPD is in
implementation of the government's peace agreement with the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF). However, they have been raising
widespread opposition from the Christian majority in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The ZOPAD will be the focus of the government's intensive peace
and development efforts in the next three years. Included in it
are 14 provinces and nine cities under the SPCPD, through which
investments will be channeled to spur economic activities and
improve the economic life of the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the SPCPD will also serve as a special and
transitory body to coordinate and promote the economic and social
development of the ZOPAD.
</P>
<P>
The SPCPD will be composed of one chairman, one vice-chairman
and three deputies. The chairman will be appointed by President
Ramos from among the governors in the ZOPAD, including Governor
Nur Misuari of the autonomous region in the Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace has said it was legal for Misuari to be
appointed as chairman of the SPCPD while serving as the governor
of the region.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ramos also ordered the installation of the
SPCPD Consultative Assembly, which will be headed by the SPCPD
chairman.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Clinton Key to Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that the success of a four-way summit currently
underway in Washington depends on U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. President Bill Clinton is the key to peace in the Middle
East," Mubarak told reporters in Egypt's southern resort city of
Aswan.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Clinton would pressure Israel to honor its
commitments to the Middle East peace process, Mubarak said that
the issue was not that of pressure but of maintaining peace in the
region, according to Egypt's news agency MENA.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot predict what Clinton will do with the Israelis," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope President Clinton can realize success in his talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed hope that the four-way summit grouping
Clinton, Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Jordan's
King Hussein, would yield positive results.
</P>
<P>
The summit, aimed at restarting Arab-Israeli peace talks
following an outbreak of violence in Palestinian territories,
opened Tuesday and is due to resume later today. There has been no
indication of a breakthrough on divisive issues.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also invited Mubarak to the summit. But Mubarak refused
to attend, saying that he was displeased with Israel's attitude
and actions against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that although he had a good meeting with Netanyahu
in July in Cairo, Netanyahu has done nothing to move toward
peace.

<HEADLINE> Compulsory Education for Tibetan Children Guaranteed by Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- At least four out of five school
age children in the Tibet Autonomous Region will be receiving
compulsory school education by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The target has been set in a set of regulations on the
development of fundamental education in Tibet, passed by the
Regional People's Congress, the local legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also state that before 2000, each county of
Tibet must have at least one middle school, and each Tibetan
township must have a complete primary school.
</P>
<P>
Due to different conditions and educational levels, the terms
of compulsory education in pastoral areas, farming areas, and
towns and cities are respectively three, six, and nine years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the fundamental education in Tibet has
enjoyed a fast development during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), the
autonomous region opened 24 new middle schools and 1,466 new
primary schools, while the number of school children rose by 24
percentage points over the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that Tibet now has 87 middle schools
with 33,000 students, and 3,950 primary schools with over 250,000
students.

BRUSSELS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today adopted an action plan aimed at speeding up the process of
making the resources of the "information society" available to
schools in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The Commission deemed it fundamental for young people to learn

<P>
"Increasingly, inequitable access to these new practices will
have serious consequences for the future of education and, in the
longer term, for jobs and the general cohesiveness of European
society," it said.
</P>
<P>
The action plan, under the title "Learning in the Information

<HEADLINE> HK Governor Delivers Last Policy Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Governor of Hong Kong
Christopher Patten delivered his fifth and last policy address to
the local Legislative Council here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In his annual address, which is titled "Hong Kong: Transition,"
Patten reviewed the development of Hong Kong from last century to
the present day, especially in the past decade. He said that
China's success is Hong Kong's opportunity and Hong Kong has
benefited from China's economic reforms and opening up.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that since the Sino-British Joint Declaration on
the Question of Hong Kong was signed in 1984, Hong Kong's GDP has
almost doubled in real terms. The fiscal reserves have increased
almost six-fold, exports by almost 330 percent in real terms, and
investment by over 120 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plenary sessions and many expert group
meetings held by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group this year
have resulted in agreement or consensus on a number of important
issues.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted, there remains a significant amount of work to be
completed, including the transfer of government, legal matters,
immigration issues and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Patten pledged that he and his government will give assistance
to the Chief Executive Designate of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), but claimed that he will not assist
the establishment and operation of the Provisional Legislative
Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British Hong Kong government today also
published a series of reports, including "Policy Commitments,"
"Progress Report" and "Legislative Program," which has listed more
than 40 proposed ordinances for the Legislative Council to approve
in the next nine months.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that many of the citizens are disappointed
with Patten's address.
</P>
<P>
Many people doubted about Hong Kong government's claimed
achievements in the past year, for they are far from people's
expectation.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers said that there is nothing new or
improvement in Patten's policy address.

<HEADLINE> No More "Slow Trains" Running Between Shanghai, Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The final whistle has been blown
for slow trains on a 303-km track between China's largest city,
Shanghai and Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The slow train service has been shunted into the sidings from
the start of October, following the successful launch of China's
fastest ever express service.
</P>
<P>
The 160-km-an-hour double deck express has cut the journey
time between the two key cities, and rail chiefs are confident
that they can bring the travel time down even further to two hours.
</P>
<P>
But it will mean that local rail passengers will no longer
have the chance to take the "slow train", which stops at all
stations on the route.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Shanghai Railways Administration,
the highest administration of rail transportation in east China,
following the successful raising of an express train speed running
between the two cities yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The double-deck train, which was introduced in April, raised
its maximum speed from the original 140 km per hour to 160 km per
hour, and established itself as China's fastest train since rail
transport was introduced to the country 126 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It has shortened the journey time between Shanghai and Nanjing
from five hours to less than three hours.
</P>
<P>
Deng Jinhua, head of the Shanghai Railways Administration, said
that the abolition of all "slow trains" aims at raising the speed
of passenger trains, and increasing the number of cargo trains.
</P>
<P>
"It took more than eight hours for a slow train to cover the
303-km distance between the two cities," he noted. "It's a huge
waste of rail transportation capacity."
</P>
<P>
Deng added that passengers heading for the over 40 small
stations along the Nanjing-Shanghai railway can rely on road
transportation, which has become "very convenient" with the
opening of an express highway between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, we will have five pairs of express trains running
between Nanjing and Shanghai at the speed of 160 km per hour," he
revealed. "We are still expecting to reduce the journey time to
two hours."

<HEADLINE> New Age For China's Stock Traders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Until a mere decade ago, when
China began to revive its long-forgotten stock system, the last
stock companies and markets anyone had seen had been before they
were closed in the 50s, when they were regarded something
capitalist.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it was very difficult to find people who knew
anything about the business. A few years on, and many Chinese have
found the business a promising, lucrative one, with a large number
of banks, insurance companies, and investment agencies opening
underwriting companies and stock trading offices. Now, securities
underwriters and dealers have entered a new period of development,
and are playing a bigger role in the domestic and international
stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Then the number of underwriters rose to 93 and the number of
secondary and tertiary dealers to more than 2,000, with most of
them relatively weak in capital and ability, and the business
rather difficult and risky. This in turn hampered the development
of the country's stock market.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, Chinese stock underwriters and dealers
have begun to merge or purchase other companies to gain strength,
and a number of large traders have come into being, such as
Guangdong's Guangfa Securities Company, with 200 million yuan in
capital and 30 offices, or Hainan's Haitong Securities Company,
with one billion yuan in capital, 70 offices, and seven billion
yuan in assets.
</P>
<P>
Then 1995 saw the merger of the country's two leading security
underwriters - Shenyin Securities Company and Shanghai
International Securities Company, both of Shanghai - who formed
the largest company of its kind in China, known as Shanghai
Shenyin International Securities Company. It has nearly 100
offices, a total of 1.32 billion yuan in registered capital, and
assets of over 18 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chinese underwriters and dealers have in the process matured,
becoming more sophisticated and aggressive both in the domestic
and in international stock markets.
</P>
<P>
In the past, local underwriters were rarely involved in issuing
B-shares, which are specially designed for overseas investors, and
are traded in foreign currencies. This year, when Tianjin Haiyun
and Gujing Gongjiu B-shares were issued, local firms underwrote
37.5 percent of the former and 60 percent of the latter.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 70 companies have B-shares listed on the
Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, while a number of H-shares and
N-shares issued by Chinese firms are listed in Hong Kong and New
York.
</P>
<P>
Local securities dealers have more opportunities to compete on
the international stock market as a result of all this, and
Shenyin International, which is the leader, has been joined by
other Chinese underwriters such as Huaxia and Nanfang, which are
active in overseas business.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ready to Face Japan Over Car Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia today reiterated its
readiness to face Japan at the World Trade Organization (WTO)
regarding its national car policy.
</P>
<P>
"If there is an official complaint (at the WTO), we are ready.
We have our own arguments," Minister of Industry and Trade Tungky
Ariwibowo said at the Bina Graha Presidential Office here.
</P>
<P>
An official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said in Tokyo today that his country plans to take action
on Indonesia's national car policy.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to bring the complaint to the WTO," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Tungky said Indonesia has launched the national car program to
strengthen its industrial structure, particularly its automotive
industry.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the Indonesian government issued a
presidential decree under which producers of national cars are
exempted from import duties and luxury-goods sales taxes, which
add about 60 percent to the price of cars sold in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Pt. Timor, controlled by Hutomo Mandala Putra, the youngest son
of President Soeharto, has been chosen as the first national car
supplier and asked to meet the 60-percent local content
requirement over three years.
</P>
<P>
The company is allowed to import cars from South Korea until
its own factory starts operation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which holds a 90-percent share of the Indonesian auto
market, has joined the United States and the European Union in
criticizing Indonesia's auto policy.

Beijing, October 2 (Xinhua) -- China is to join forces with the

</P>
<P>
Chinese-made sophisticated magnets, capable of capturing
elusive particles in space are to be installed in the space
shuttle Discovery when it blasts off from earth for a two-week
test flight in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
And in 2001 the permanent magnets will be put on aboard the
"Alpha" space station for a three-year voyage.
</P>
<P>
It heralds a scientific breakthrough for Chinese space
scientists, who have joined their American and Russian
counterparts in the building a magnetic spectrometer. The
instrument will be sent to space to capture such elusive particles
as anti-matters and dark matters.
</P>
<P>
Scientists hold that one of the biggest challenges today in
astrophysics, particle physics and cosmology is looking for
anti-matters and dark matters in space.
</P>

"As the first magnetic spectrometer sent by man to space in
search for dark matters and anti-matters, surprising results could

<HEADLINE> Red Locusts Invade Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's 1996/97 summer crops
are being threatened by a massive outbreak of red locusts never
seen for years, a crop scientist said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commercial farmers union's entomologist Di Taylo said the
locusts had invaded Zimbabwse from Mozambique where they had bred
in huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe years of prolonged drought followed by
heavy rains could have provided ideal breeding conditions for
locusts.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the small locusts had been reported in the eastern
part of Zimbabwe and were by Tuesday said to have reached farming
areas near Harare.
</P>
<P>
She said although not much damage had been reported, there was
concern they could destroy the summer crops, particularly maize,
because of their high hatching rate.
</P>
<P>
The government plant protection unit is giving farmers
chemicals to spray. In the worst affected areas, particularly in
the east, farmers are forming action groups to coordinate
spraying.

<HEADLINE> Izetbegovic, Milosevic Meet in Paris on Normalizing Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic are to meet
today in Paris to discuss normalization of the two countries'
relations.
</P>
<P>
The main problems existing between the two countries include
how to settle a 300 billion U.S. dollar international debt
accumulated by the former Yugoslav federation, and an
international lawsuit launched by Sarajevo in 1993 against
Belgrade for "genocide."
</P>
<P>
Bosnia and Serbia recognized each other last December.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic and Milosevic are also expected to discuss a
two-year international plan on consolidating peace in Bosnia, said
French foreign ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
The plan's exact contents are to be decided by an international
meeting next month in Paris. It is aimed at fixing a series of
peace objectives to be realized in a fixed period of time, first
of all the repatriation of refugees, resettlement of the displaced
and the re-establishment public institutions in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to agree to the exchange of
ambassadors and the re-opening of air and ground transport for the
first time since war broke out five years ago in former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting comes with a good timing of the certification of
the Bosnian election by the Organization of Security and
Cooperation for Europe (OSCE) and the lifting of international
embargo on Belgrade," said French officials.
</P>
<P>
France will host an international meeting in Paris on November
14 to decide the contents and calendar of the peace consolidation
plan for Bosnia, before its formal adoption by the international
community expected in December in London.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the peace plan will coincide with the ending of
the presidential election in the United States, in which U.S.
President Bill Clinton is greatly expected to be reelected.
</P>
<P>
Washington has agreed to prolong the presence of U.S. troops in
former Yugoslavia for three months after the Implementation Force
(IFOR) ends its mission in December.

<HEADLINE> Better Family Planning System Being Improved In China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Wang Qin, an 89-year-old retired
plumber, was sent to a hospital by local family planning workers,
ten years ago, because he has no children, and since then people
have helped him bathe, cook, wash his clothes, and do whatever he
likes.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy even though I do not have a son or daughter,"
Wang tells everyone he meets.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing's Dongcheng (Eastern City) District Real Estate
Bureau there are more than 300 elderly and disabled who are
receiving similar care from family planning workers.
</P>
<P>
On family planning, Lin Ximeng, director of the bureau, noted
that it involves many things, including providing contraceptives
for women of child-bearing age, helping employees deal with
difficult problems, creating a better environment for children,
and taking care of retired persons, the elderly, and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Lin, 52, who used to be an electrician, is well acquainted with
the living conditions of his 3,000 employees and of the 1,032
female workers who are of child-bearing age.
</P>
<P>
"The question of the elderly, especially those who have no
children, is a social one," Lin went on to explain on Wednesday at
a meeting held to mark the 16th anniversary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China's open letter on family
planning to Party and Youth League members.
</P>
<P>
The letter was the first time the Chinese government put forth
its "one child, one family" policy.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that China has begun to face a threat from an aging
society, and his employees in charge of family planning work have
become gradually aware of the negative effect of a one-child
family, which means that in the near future a couple is going to
have to look after four parents.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it is of special significance to do the work
concerning the elderly in China's family planning work, Lin said.

<P>
In 23 of the bureau's offices, there are full-time family
planning workers, forming a network providing various kinds of
services.
</P>
<P>
Every family planning worker is assigned one or two of the
elderly or disabled and makes regular visits to assess the needs
and difficulties.
</P>
<P>
They also donate money and clothing for employees whose rural
families suffer from natural adversities, help laid off people
find jobs and make a living, and distribute medicines and
contraceptives to every woman of child-bearing age.
</P>
<P>
In the district where the real estate bureau is located, all
work units and neighborhood committees have family planning
networks to provide services for local residents.
</P>
<P>
The director of the Beijing Dongcheng District Family Planning
Commission, Zhang Ruiying, said that her district has recorded
negative population growth since 1993 and attributes it to the
work of the local family planning officials and staff members.
</P>
<P>
She added that control of the natural population growth in her
district is no longer the sole purpose of family planning, since
it is essential to provide service and better family-planning with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
From the early 1980s, China has been building a nationwide
family-planning service network. In 24 of its provinces and 272
cities or prefectures there is a service center for family
planning technology. About 80 percent of its counties and 70
percent of its townships have their own service centers.
</P>
<P>
China's population growth rate has gone to 10.55 per thousand
in 1995 from 25 per thousand in 1970. According to international
standards, China is one of the countries with a low birth rate.
</P>
<P>
Based on the country's family planning experience, the State
Family Planning Commission has developed a principle of
integrating family planning with economic growth, helping the
poorer people to become better-off and to develop a happy and
modern family.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission's Yang Kuifu, a vice-minister, the
principle has gotten a great deal of support from ordinary people
since family planning officials and staff members put it into
practice two years ago.

BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Red Cross and Red Crescent
leaders from Southeast Asian nations agreed here today that
natural disaster management is an important task facing their
societies.
</P>
<P>
A report issued at the end of the ninth conference of Red Cross
and Red Crescent leaders from members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) indicated that the region is
frequently hit by climate-related and other disasters.
</P>
<P>
It thus urged that due attention be given to pre-disaster,
disaster, and post-disaster management.
 The conference agreed that the establishment of an efficient
transportation and communications network is one of the key
components of effective and timely disaster management in the
region, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Such a network would allow more pre-disaster warning time for
people, facilitate assistance during the disaster phase and help
accelerate post-disaster rehabilitation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the three-day gathering discussed topics
such as disaster preparedness and relief, fund raising,
cooperation in blood transfusion service and HIV and aids
prevention and control, and promotion of community-based health
care.
</P>
<P>
The conference urged the Red Cross ad Red Crescent societies in
the ASEAN countries to launch new initiatives to raise funds and
set up a special division with a strong fund-raising orientation.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended that a working committee be created to
coordinate blood transfusion services.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were some 60 representatives from
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam and observers from international organizations, other
countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> France Denies End to Army Conscription </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The French defense ministry today
denied a report that President Jacques Chirac will suddenly banish
army conscription in 1998 as "a gift to French youth."
</P>
<P>
The report, in the daily Liberation, said the intention was to
win youth support in the legislative elections that year.
</P>
<P>
Describing the report as "devoid of foundation," a defense
ministry spokesman said such a measure was "technically
impossible" and would be "socially unjust."
</P>
<P>
Liberation quoted an official source as saying that "boys now
aged 17 and 18, as well as some of the students benefiting from a
provisionally exemption from military service, will never do their
military service."
</P>
<P>
Chirac decided late last year to stop the 200 year practice of
army conscription in France by 2002, as part of a
professionalization drive in the French armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry said professionalization of the army could
not be achieved except by a gradual decrease of conscripts and
provisionally exempted conscripts, who served as potential
reinforcements for the army.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry did not rule out the possibility of amendments
to the army restructuring plan, while stressing that "the
essential objective is to keep the army going."

NEW DELHI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Shankar Dayal
Sharma will leave here tomorrow on a five-nation tour to
strengthen bilateral ties in a new economic environment, the Press
Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The countries the president is to visit are Oman, Poland,
Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Italy.
</P>
<P>
In his first visit since assumption of office by a new
government in New Delhi in June, the president is likely to stress
that there is continuity in his country's foreign policy and the
new government.
</P>
<P>
India and Oman are scheduled to sign two memorandums of
understanding on combating crimes and cooperation in agriculture
besides initialing an agreement on cooperation in science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
The president's visit to Poland, Slovakia and the Czech
Republic would aim to cement India's traditional ties with east
European countries.
</P>
<P>
After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the three
countries have emerged as India's biggest trading partner in
eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Italy is fast moving to the center-stage of India's foreign
trade and if the trend continues, it might well become India's
biggest trading partner in Europe, displacing Germany and the
United Kingdom in about five years.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela went to the Angolan capital of Luanda today to help
bring that country's peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is expected to attend a meeting of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), a regional group that brings
together the countries in southern Africa. The meeting, to be
chaired by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and attended by
heads of state of all member states, will focus on how to carry
forward the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in Mandela's delegation told the press that
South Africa will maintain an even-handed approach to the
conflicting parties in Angola and encourage them to fulfil their
obligations specified in the Lusaka Agreement.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy Foreign Minister Azziz Pahad said, "The
heads of state want to help with the demobilization process and
the mobilization of the support of the international community,"
said Pahad.
</P>
<P>
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi is likely to attend the meeting
because some of the issues discussed at the gathering will
directly affect his organization and his expected position in the
Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi's special status, the creation of a government of
national unity and the extension of government rule over the
entire Angola, are some of the problems which the participants
will seek to resolve.
</P>
<P>
South African officials said the SADC leaders had asked
Mandela, who has close ties with Savimbi, to attend today's
meeting.

CAIRO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid today urged the United States to shoulder its
responsibilities regarding the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Sawt Al Arab (Voice of Arabs)
Radio, Abdul-Meguid said that the Arabs hope the Middle East
summit, which began in Washington Tuesday, would be rendered
successful to salvage the peace march.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has hosted the four-way summit
attended by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also invited Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to the
summit in a bid to restart the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
following the outbreak of violence in the occupied Palestinian
territories last week. But Mubarak refused to attend, saying that
he was displeased with Israel's attitude and actions against the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League is calling for an end to Israel's "oppressive
practices" against the Palestinians, Abdul-Meguid said in the
interview.
</P>
<P>
The Washington summit resumes today with no sign of
breakthrough in sight on divisive issues.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the co-sponsor of the Mideast peace process,
has been urged to pressurize Israel to honor its peace agreements
signed with the Palestinians and resume peace talks with Syria,
Lebanon as well as the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, however, said that he would not pressurize anyone at the
four-way summit, describing pressure tactics as impractical.
</P>
<P>
"What the United States has done since I have been president is
not to pressure anyone, but to get the parties together," he said.

French government spokeswoman said today.
</P>
<P>
Catherine Colonna said that France considers as positive the
"evolutions of lire" within one year's period.
</P>
<P>
But she said that France still has "a margin of comments" for
the lire and that the return of the lire to the European Monetary
System (EMS) should come after the Italian currency has attained
"an appropriate level."
</P>
<P>
The Italian government Tuesday summoned the French ambassador
to Rome protest Chirac's repeated criticism of Italy's monetary
policy and said that the lire is stabilizing and will meet the EU
criteria for joining the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
In his telephone conversation with Prodi, Chirac said that
France "appreciates the efforts made by the Italian government for
meeting the criteria of the unified money."
</P>
<P>
Chirac said on Tuesday that the "competitive devaluation" of
lire had cost France more damages in its textile industry than
exports of Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his doubt over the capability of the lire to
join the EMU "in the first wave" on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Colonna said that France wishes that the lire can return to the
EMS fairly soon, "within a few months, if not by the end of the
year."

<HEADLINE> WHO/UNICEF Appeal for Help to Halt Balkan Polio Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) and the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) appealed today for 1.3
million U.S. dollars to help fund an emergency mass immunization
campaign to halt the spread of an Albanian polio outbreak in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, the outbreak of polio in Albania since
April has killed 12 people and infected 78 others so far.
</P>
<P>
With 27 cases reported in August and another 33 in September,
the outbreak has not yet peaked in the country, and is now showing
signs of spreading to other Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
Three polio cases were reported during July and August in
Greece, and last week six other suspected cases were reported in
the Kosovo region of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of which
two have already been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Two immunization campaigns were conducted in Albania during
April and May this year, in which more than 350,000 children under
five years of age received two doses of the vaccine and have been
protected from the current outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said preliminary results of an immunization campaign
held on September 29 in Kosovo and Metohija indicate that more
than 95 percent of the 230,000 children received polio vaccines
there.
</P>
<P>
A second campaign to immunize all children up to 15 years of
age in Kosovo is underway.
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern to public health officials is the
potential for large numbers of seasonal migrants to spread the
polio virus, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 700,000 Albanians live in neighboring countries in
the region, mainly Italy and Greece, and many of them migrate back
and forth to Albania each year.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong stock market is
generally perceived to be liquid, fair and orderly, according to
the findings of the Secondary Market Survey 1996 released here
today.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) in June this
year, the survey found that most of the respondents held that the
HKSE is professionally managed.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the survey was to measure the market users'
satisfaction with the securities secondary market in Hong Kong,
and to obtain their opinions on current market development issues.
</P>
<P>
User group surveyed included trading members of the HKSE, Hong
Kong-based fund managers and non-Exchange members participants in
Hong Kong's Central Clearing and Settlement System. The overall
response rate was 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that transaction costs were generally regarded
as reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Most respondents believed Hong Kong had a competitive edge in
the listing and trading of securities in the Chinese mainland and
they were very positive about the potential for investors from
China to participate in the Hong Kong stock market.

<HEADLINE> Bohai Bay Becoming Busiest North China Sea Lane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Bohai Bay, which lies to the east
of Beijing and Tianjin municipalities and is regarted as a
strategic sea link to the capital, is rapidly becoming the busiest
sea channel in north China.
</P>
<P>
This is largely because of its position between two of the most
economically-developed areas in the country: the Shandong
Peninsula in east China and the Liaodong Peninsula to the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
As port cities on the bay rim opened up to overseas investment
in the 1980s it became an area with the most economic vitality in
northern China, and the second best passage between the two
peninsulas, after air routes.
</P>
<P>
Regular shipping lines between the two peninsulas include eight
passenger and cargo lines between the ports of Yantai and
Dalian. There are more than 200 berths in ports around the Bay,
from Dalian in the north to Yantai in the south. In 1995, their
total handling capacity exceeded 100 million tons.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate more traffic between the two peninsulas, local
authorities have proposed building a train-ferry service, a move
that has been studied by the reputable China International
Engineering Consulting Corp. Co-operation with overseas will be
sought for the project.
</P>
<P>
The ferry is expected to provide a connection for railway
networks in the east and northeast, providing a railway artery
along the eastern coast of China.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Weapons Ban Goes Countrywide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The ban on carrying
dangerous weapons at public gatherings in South Africa has been
extended to the whole country, a government gazette said today.
</P>
<P>
The ban previously applied to 68 magisterial districts in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said in a
statement on Tuesday that the original government notice, which
was announced in March banning the carrying of weapons such as
spears, pangas and axes, was published at a time when crowds in
different parts of the country were brandishing dangerous weapons
in public processions with a general display of lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
He said the threat to public safety and the serious potential
for violence has made it necessary to issue the government notice
to ban the possession of such weapons during marches.
</P>
<P>
The minister also appealed to the South African people to
cooperate with the government in implementing the prohibition
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
But the senior police officials admitted that the ban is
difficult to enforce.

<HEADLINE> Israel Refuses U.S. Request on Hebron Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel has rejected an U.S.
request for a specific date for its troops to pull out of the West
Bank city of Hebron at the Washington summit, an Israeli cabinet
official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely it was clear the American side wants ... to set a
final date. We were saying it is impossible," natan Sharansky,
Israel's trade minister and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's delegation, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The status of israeli troops in Hebron, where there live 450
jews in their settlements, is a key part of current
Israeli-Palestinian frictions as Netanyahu has refused to
implement an accord of withdrawal of Israeli troops agreed upon by
former Labour government.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky said Netanyahu has also refused to hold non-stop
negotiations on a Hebron redeployment right away in Washington,
and insisted that such talks should begin later.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet minister made a further disclosure that
Israel would not reverse its decision of opening the entrance of
an ancient tunnel that was the main cause of recent violent
clashes between the Palestinians and the Israelis on the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Netanyahu held three-hour
talks during the first day of the Washington summit, which was
arranged by President Bill Clinton in an effort to rescue the
peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
But Israel's obstinate position foretells that the summit might
solve nothing and differences between the two parties will still
exist.

<HEADLINE> Some 20,000 Israelis Attend Anti-Government Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 people flocked to
the Hamedina Square area in Tel Aviv, Israel's largest city,
Tuesday night for an anti-government demonstration organized by
the left-wing Peace Now.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators waved banners reading as "Netanyahu is bad
for the country," "Peace now," and "East Jerusalem equals
Vietnam," chanting peace anthems sung by famous Israeli singers.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Beilin, Labor Party's MK (member of the Knesset, Israel's
parliament), called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
launch immediate negotiations with the Palestinians and Arab
neighbors following the summit being held in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Beilin, one of the architects of the Oslo peace accords
between Israel and the Palestinians, demanded Netanyahu make
Israel and the Israeli people his first priority, and not the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
"Bibi (Netanyahu) should come down from his high horse,"
Beilin said, "he cannot throw this whole country into a whirlpool
because of his inexperience and superfluous stubbornness."
</P>
<P>
He added that the Hasmonean Tunnel in Jerusalem, the opening
of which triggered last week violent confrontations between
Israel and the Palestinians, was "just one step to far, and it
has exploded right in our faces."
</P>
<P>
The confrontations over the tunnel in the West Bank, Gaza and
Jerusalem resulted in a death toll of 70 and about 1,000 injuries.
</P>
<P>
"If Bibi implements the peace process, we will support and
help him," Beilin, a minister in the previous government,
shouted. "If not, he will see us in every square and at every
junction around the country."
</P>
<P>
Beilin, Meretz MKs Yossi Sarid, Naomi Chazan and Anat Maor as
well as other politicians at the rally vowed to continue mass
demonstrations for the next four years (during Netanyahu's term
of office) if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Singer Miri Aloni closed the demonstration with "a song for
peace," the same song which she sang just minutes before late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated at a massive peace
rally in Tel Aviv last November.

<HEADLINE> Traders' Strike Agaisnt VAT Goes on in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA,, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan traders strike against
Value Added tax (VAT) went on today in capital Kampala and other
major towns in the country.
</P>
<P>
Riot police patrolled major streets in Kampala as business
stalled following a traders' protest starting on Monday by traders
seeking either reduction of a 17 percent VAT rate or complete
suspension of the controversial tax passed by parliament and carried
out from July 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles are running on streets as before, but some customers
waited in front of shops in hope of reopening of shops.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shops in the city remained closed today despite
president yoweri museveni has appealed for the reopenning of shops
while he bakes consultations with cabinet members over the problem.
</P>
<P>
The president on Sunday met representatives of the Traders's
Association at Rwakitura in southwestern Uganda and promised to make
public his decision in two weeks time.
</P>
<P>
However, banks, pharmacies, clinics and eating houses in the
city center and suburbs still remain open for business. No violent
incidents occurred as riot police patrolled streets to check
possible violence.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from other parts of the country said all
shops in Iganga Town, 35 km east of Kampala closed today because of
the strike.
</P>
<P>
In Jinja, 80 km east of here, many shops remained closed on
Monday and Tuesday as owners of the shops were threatened by
unknown people to beat them and loot their shops if they continued
operating.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Human Rights Groups Call For lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Eight Palestinian human rights
groups and non-governmental organizations called on the Israeli
government to lift its total military siege on the occupied
territories, according to a report from the JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in East Jerusalem, today.
</P>
<P>
The call came in a statement issued at a joint press conference
Tuesday in Ramallah, West Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the human rights situation in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip are deteriorating daily. In addition to
the use of excessive force in the last week, resulting in the
deaths of 60 Palestinians and at least 1,600 injuries, the Israeli
authorities have imposed a military siege on the towns and
villages in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities have isolated Palestinian towns and
villages in the West Bank by declaring Area C to be a closed
military area. Area C is about 70 percent of the total area of the
West Bank and its closure consequently isolates all Palestinian
population centers, whether in Areas A, B, Or C.
</P>
<P>
This action places Palestinian residents in a situation similar
to town arrest, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on movement have also been imposed within the
Gaza Strip. Some areas are completely isolated as a result of the
siege. In addition, the complete closure of East Jerusalem,
imposed in January 1991 and intensified in March 1993, continues
to prohibit Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the rest of the
West Bank from entering Israel and Jerusalem, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that the military siege has had
detrimental effects on the life of Palestinians in the fields of
health and medical treatment, the economy and agriculture,
education and so on. It added that curfews and heavy deployment
of Israeli military personnel and tanks outside the main towns
increase tension. Military helicopters are still roaming over the
areas.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the eight groups call on the
international community and on international and local
non-governmental organizations to intervene immediately and
demand:
</P>
<P>
The immediate lifting of measures restricting Palestinian
movements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including the lifting
of the current siege and general closure;
</P>
<P>
Refraining from any unilateral measures such as house
demolition, settlement expansion, land confiscation, detention and
torture, which are illegal attempts to change the status and
character of the West Bank, particularly Jerusalem, and the Gaza
Strip;
</P>
<P>
Israeli immediate closing of the Western Wall Tunnel in Jerusalem;
</P>
<P>
Full respect by Israel for its obligations under the
Israeli-Palestinian agreements;
</P>
<P>
The immediate cancellation of all Israeli policies and measures
designed to prejudice and pre-empty the outcome of the
Israeli-Palestinian final status negotiations.

PARIS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Minister of Justice Jacques Toubon Tuesday presented
a draft law on amendment of the code of penal precedure of
France. The law, prepared by Michele-Laure Rassat, a law
professor, calls for a change of ways of provisional detention,
tougher punishment for violation of secret of preliminary
investigations by judicial departments, and obligation to justify
judicial decisions. If the draft law is adopted by the parliament,
it could be a fatal blow to the freedom of the press in
investigative reports.
</P>
<P>
-- The Middle East summit opened Tuesday in Washington under
the rule of Dayton peace talks among forme Yugoslav states, which
banned any participant from talking to the press until the meeting
ended. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who had dinner Tuesday
evening together with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
the White House, said that there should be ``neither conditions
nor ultimatum'' in their talks. Netanyahu said he intended to
launch non-stop negotiations with Palestinians on the application
of the agreements already signed between them, especially that on
the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- On the eve of the opening of the world automobile exhibition
in Paris today, the Renault anounced that it would lower the
prices of its automobiles while the Peugeot and Citroen also
decided to decrease their charges. The explosion of car sale in
September, which registers a 85.7 percent increase with the sale
of 216,500 cars in France, is no surprise considering the
atonement of the premium of quality cars made by automobile
producers on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Australia Disappointed At US Super 301 Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia today expressed its
great disappointment at the United States' decision to include
Australia's textile clothing and footwear (TCF) and passenger
motor vehicles (PMV) industry schemes in its Super 301 report.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement released by the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for Trade, Tim Fischer and the Minister for Industry,
John Moore said "we are very disappointed in this step by the
United States and will vigorously defend the TCF and PMV schemes
and Australian industry interests against challenges under US
domestic law or as necessary in the WTO."
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Australia had a substantial trade imbalance with
the U.S., and that more than one billion Australian dollars (790
million US dollars) of this was due to US market access
restrictions. Also, the U.S. continued to damage world
agricultural markets by its use of export subsidy programs.
</P>
<P>
He said he found it difficult to understand how the U.S. could
have determined these schemes were a "priority foreign country
practice" given the dispute involves a minor amount (only three
percent) of the US auto and leather trade.
</P>
<P>
"This suggests to me that there is a serious flaw in the
methods used in setting US trade policy priorities," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"When you consider the rigid quotas and complex rules-of-origin
requirements that the US retains for its textiles sector, and the
trade liberalizing nature of our schemes, the US action is all the
more incongruous," the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers said that Australia would welcome
bilateral consultations with the U.S. on this matter, but
reaffirmed their commitment to defending the interests of
Australian industry through and beyond the course of any
challenge.

<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- China has announced a decision
to establish a complete and technically sophisticated
telecommunications network by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Construction of optical cable trunks will be accelerated
across the country, adding optical cables of 100,000 kilometers to
the national telecom network in the coming five years, said the
journal Telecom World.
</P>
<P>
The SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) equipment, one the most
advanced optical transmission methods in term of speed and
operation capacity, will be installed to all optical cables
to be laid, or expanded during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
This year China will continue to work on three inter-provincial
optical cables, including a Beijing-Jiujian-Guangzhou line and an
Wuhan-Nanjing-Shanghai line, and will complete three other trunk
projects: Jinan-Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan-Yinchuan,
Tianjin-Shijiazhuang, and Xuzhou-Lianyungang.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, China will have a switching capacity
in long-distance telephone networks of 6 million lines, and the
telephone density rate will reach 10 per cent or higher, the
journal said.

<P>
URUMQI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- China has finished laying a
294-km gas pipeline capable of moving three million cubic meters
of gas daily, in its northwestern Junggar Basin.
</P>
<P>
The 426-mm-diameter pipeline starts in the Cainan Oilfield in
the eastern part of the basin and runs across the Shixi Oilfield
in the heart of the Gurbantunggut Desert to Karamay, a major oil
production base in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration discovered
a group of oil and gas fields, of which, the Cainan, Caidong,
Lunan, Shixi, and Mabei have reserves of more than 50 million tons
of oil.
</P>
<P>
The Cainan, China's first desert oilfield, has an annual output
of 1.5 million tons, but was discarding more than 100 million yuan
(about 12 million US dollars) worth of gas every year. The
pipeline will help transport all of Cainan's gas to Karamay.

<HEADLINE> India Imposes Control on Wheat Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
imposed a quantitative ceiling on the export of wheat products in
view of the spurt in prices of wheat and wheat products on the
domestic market, the Hindustan times said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the exporting ceiling for the
period of October 1996-March 1997 would be 150,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling will be mandatory for clearance of shipments of
wheat products. The government will also keep a close watch on
this.
</P>
<P>
No quantitative ceiling on export of wheat products was imposed
before because these items were considered to be value-added and
their export was not in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation changed in the recent months with the
global demand for wheat products picking up. Official estimates
indicate that about 500,000 tons of wheat products have been
exported during the current financial year (April 1996-March
1997).
</P>
<P>
The buoying export market has led to diversion of wheat meant
for public distribution to private trade for manufacturing wheat
products to cater to the export and resulted in a significant
increase in the prices of wheat and wheat products on the domestic
market, all worrying the Indian government.

<HEADLINE> 70 Percent of Japanese Favor Euthanasia: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 70 percent of the Japanese
approve of euthanasia, but most of them said mercy killings should
have patients' consent, the Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo said a poll by the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun revealed
that 67 percent supported euthanasia and 63 percent favored "death
with dignity", or death of terminally-ill patients who request the
withdrawal of medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
In both cases more than 70 percent said doctors should get
patient consent, while only five percent in the first category and
six percent in the second said doctors can make the decisions
alone.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in late August and early September
among 4,236 adults across Japan, of whom 67 percent responded,
Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed 34 percent against "death with dignity" and 29
percent opposed to euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
Japan has involved in a heated debate on euthanasia after the
mercy killing of a terminally-ill cancer patient by a doctor at a
hospital in Kyoto last April.
</P>
<P>
Yoshihiro Yamanaka last June said he had injected an overdose
of a muscle relaxant into a 48-year-old cancer patient in April to
give him "a smooth transition to death". He said he had obtained
the patient's consent.
</P>
<P>
The Keihoku town office in the Kyoto Prefecture last month
dismissed Yamanaka as director of a local public hospital.

<HEADLINE> Wolfensohn Vows to Help Fight "Cancer of Corruption" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn today attacked wide-spread corruption in industrial and
developing countries and vowed not to tolerate it in the projects
the World Bank finances.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption is a problem that all countries have to confront,"
he told the opening session of the 1996 Annual Meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"We need to deal with the cancer of corruption," he told the
economic and financial policy-makers from the bank's 181 member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank head argued that corruption diverts resources
from the poor to the rich and is a major barrier to economic
progress in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
It also threatens to rob the bank of support in industrial
countries as governments wonder if the money they have contributed
is being squandered.
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate corruption in the programs that we
support," Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus also took aim at
corruption in his speech to the plenary session. He said,
"Governments must demonstrate that they have no tolerance for
corruption in any form."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's board recently set new procurement guidelines
for projects financed by its loans, under which the bank can
cancel part of a loan if it finds out that corrupt or fraudulent
practices were involved in procurement contracts.
</P>
<P>
It can also bar guilty companies from bidding on future
bank-financed projects.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn reiterated four major themes of the bank's new
strategic agenda -- a new compact between donors, investors and
recipients to ensure that resources are sufficient to meet the
needs of the world's poorest people; a broader, more integrated
approach to development; strengthening and expanding partnerships,
both globally and locally; continuing to pursue change in the
bank's culture to focus on excellence and results.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the common goal and share the dream of a
better world, "we have to work together," the World Bank chief
concluded.

BRASILIA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazil today condemned as
laughable a U.S. offer of 600,000 U.S.dollars for its anti-drug
program.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Sebastiao Barros said, "The U.S. aid
looks trivial and even ridiculous compared with what Brazil spends
on anti-drug activities."
</P>
<P>
The United States is offering Brazil 600,000 U.S. dollars for
its 1997 campaign against drug plantations and trafficking whereas
Brazil will have spent 350 million dollars this year to fight
drug-related activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and the United States have cooperated over the last 22
years in fighting drug plantations and trafficking. The United
States has so far provided the South American country with a total
of 16 million dollars for training and equipping Brazilian drug

PANAMA CITY, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
reverted the Fuerte Amador military base, located in the southern
entrance of the Panama Canal, to Panama.
</P>
<P>
The base is under Panamanian jurisdiction beginning today in
accordance with the Torrijos-Carter Canal treaties signed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares said today that
Panamanians have fought for the return of the bases and "now they
will turn it into a source of employment and wealth for all
Panamanians".
</P>
<P>
He said: "There must not be any doubt about our ability to
convert these structures into new sources of employment and
prosperity for the country."
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian president said, "It is not about reclaiming the
canal, but about preparing ourselves to operate, administer and
defend it under the protection of our laws."
</P>
<P>
The 176-hectare military base was set up in July, 1911, and had
served as the headquarters of the U.S. Army Southern Command.

The Panamanian Interoceanic Region Authority plans to develop
the military base into a tourist center with hotels, a commercial

<HEADLINE> Inkatha Party Returns to Constitution-Making Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Zulu-based
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) today ended its 18-month boycott of
the writing of the country's new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Its senior negotiator Peter Smith took part in today's
constitutional assembly sub-committee on redrafting South Africa's
new constitution which was referred back to the assembly for
amendments by the constitutional court in early September.
</P>
<P>
Smith said Inkatha wanted to broaden the scope of the
constitution's revision beyond the issues referred back by the
court.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Pravin Gordhan of the ruling African
National Congress (ANC) welcomed Smith and his party back to the
constitution-making process and said Inkatha should feel free to
put its case.
</P>
<P>
But Gordhan then asked the assembly's technical experts whether
Inkatha's demand for a broader debate on the constitution fell
within the issues referred back by the court.
</P>
<P>
Inkatha, the second largest black political party after the ANC
in the country, withdrew from the constitution-writing assembly in
February last year in protest at the ANC failure to honor its
pre-election promise to submit major differences on the
constitution to international mediation.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's final constitution was adopted by the 490-member
constitutional assembly on May 8 this year. But it was sent back
by the constitutional court on September 6 for more work on eight
issues.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators spent most of Tuesday's meeting in closed-door
discussions to refine their positions on provincial and municipal
powers and constitutional amendments.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Women bus drivers are a
common sight in the capital of south China's Guangdong Province,
thanks to the city's new professional training program that helps
laid-off bus conductors.
</P>
<P>
When the city began its conductorless public transportation
system in the past few years, it put thousands of women out of a
job.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, rapid growth in public transportation also
meant a greater need for drivers. So, labor service departments
and bus companies got together to offer driving training courses
for the women.
</P>
<P>
Bus companies pay 50 percent of the training cost, the city's
unemployment fund pays 30 percent, and the individuals pays the
rest. When they complete the training course and pass an exam, the
women qualify as bus drivers.
</P>
<P>
Bus company sources say that the women all work very hard and
have rather good records in their training, because of the value
they place on the opportunity to work.
</P>
<P>
Training courses are now being offered in other sectors of the
economy in Guangzhou.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The senior women leaders' network
from member economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) opened a meeting here today and called on the APEC to
regard women as key players in the economic development of the
region.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is expected to discuss how free trade
and development in the Asia-Pacific region will affect women in
areas such as labor market and their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
According to the network, women's work is still unpaid, less
paid or unrecognized in some economies of the APEC.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also seek a gender equitable development in
the region and try to ensure that women could present
recommendations to the APEC as it set policies and made decisions
that would govern the region's economic directions.
</P>
<P>
"By giving birth to this network, we have taken on the task of
seeing to it that the women of the region would, from now on, be
key players within the APEC, that there is an opening for them to
influence how decisions are made, that the kind of development
envisioned by the APEC is not in conflict with the kind of
development that is meaningful for women," Leticia Ramos-Shahani,
chairman of the meeting, said in her opening speech.
</P>
<P>
The conference will work out a Manila Declaration that put
gender as a crosscutting theme and a priority consideration in
discussions and deliberations within the APEC.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Police Detains Kidnapping Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican police confirmed
today the detention of Esteban Paiz Lanza, charged with complicity
in the kidnapping of a Dutch couple in August.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan national, who with priest Eduardo Bolanos worked
as go-betweens for the release of the kidnapped couple, was
detained on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Police sources claimed that Paiz Lanza is an accomplice of the
group that kidnapped Huite Sierd Ziljstra and Jetty Cuors, both
50, and released them 23 days after the payment of a ransom of
between 200,000 and 500,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch couple are biologists working in a lumber
exploitation enterprise in the north of Costa Rica, close to the
border with Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers had first asked for a 1.5-million-dollar ransom.
</P>
<P>
Press reports had estimated the ransom at 600,000 dollars, but
a lawyer working for the enterprise said the paid sum was 200,000.
</P>
<P>
Clues from Apolinar Requenes, who was detained in connection
with the kidnapping, led to the detain of Paiz Lanza.
</P>
<P>
Requenes is a worker at Altamira Hacienda, where the lumber
exploitation project is being developed with Dutch investment.
</P>
<P>
Priest Bolanos said Paiz Lanza never did anything that could
make him a suspect member of the kidnapping band during the two
days they spent negotiating the release of the couple.
</P>
<P>
Ziljstra and Cuors were captured in their house at Altamira
Hacienda by a band of seven men, all of them Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers have succeeded in dodging the police by using
their knowledge about the region and survival techniques in the
mountains though Costa Rican police said that it has identified
all the kidnappers.

NEW DELHI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress Party
President Sitaram Kesri Tuesday warned the United Front government
not to take the party's support for granted because it would be
withdrawn if the government did not mend its ways, the National
Herald said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an election meeting in India's Uttar Pradesh, Kesri
blamed the government for coming in the way of the unity of
secular votes in the ongoing assembly elections in the state.
</P>
<P>
He said opposing the Congress Party and its ally in the Uttar
Pradesh state assembly elections, the United Front government was
indirectly helping the communal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
</P>
<P>
Kesri criticized the campaigning of the United Front in the
state led by Defense Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav whose party, the
Samajwadi Party, has been a major rival of the Congress Party in
the most-populated Indian state.
</P>
<P>
The minority government of the 13-party United Front including
the Samajwadi Party now enjoys outside support of the Congress
Party in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The United Front parties and the Congress Party claim
themselves to be secular forces while treat the radical BJP as
communal.
</P>
<P>
As Uttar Pradesh is the most populated state in India, the
results of the assembly elections in the state will be of
wide-ranging political ramifications in the country.

KATHMANDU, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali minister Tuesday
became the first member of the present cabinet to face corruption
charges after the government launched an anti-corruption campaign
earlier this year, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA),
Nepal's governmental anti-corruption body, Tuesday issued a letter
to Agriculture Minister Padma Sundar Lawati accusing him of being
involved in a fertilizer deal scandal, the Kathmandu Post daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Secretary of the Agriculture Ministry
Dan Bahadur Shahi on June 9 went on the record before the
commission to charge the minister of Canceling an earlier
fertilizer deal and awarding the contract to another supplier at
a higher price.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not reveal the size of the deal and the
names of supplier companies involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
Minister Lawati allegedly received heavy kickbacks for
intervening in the deal while sources said the commission involved
in the deal was around 41.5 million rupees (730,000 US dollars),
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Profitable fertilizer imports have always been sensitive issues
in Nepal with corruption charges often heard against officials
and businessmen in these deals.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has repeatedly
reiterated his commitment to control the widespread corruption in
the country's bureaucracy since his three-party coalition
government was formed in September last year.

BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Brunei is expected to become an
ideal market for the Thai marine product processing industry as
the sultanate has moved to open the sector, a report reaching here
said today.
</P>
<P>
Brunei's fishermen are throwing about 60 percent of their daily
fish and shrimp catch back into the sea because the island lacks
processing and storage facilities and its domestic demand is low,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Usable marine resources would be worth about 100 million US
dollars in the sultanate per year and Thailand, with its strong
seafood and fish processing industry, should make a rapid approach
to Brunei's marine product processing market, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Brunei has taken its first step toward opening up the market
when it approved a Brunei-Singapore joint venture for seafood
processing last week.
</P>
<P>
Brunei's fishermen used traditional harvesting methods and
their marine products would not be subject to the US embargo on
imports of shrimps caught by trawlers not equipped with
turtle-excluder devices, the report said.

parliament (MPs) to join the New Aspiration Party (NAP) led by
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sanoh Thienthong, former CTP secretary-general, said he had no
choice but to leave the CTP after being treated unfairly by party
leader Banharn Silpa-archa.
</P>
<P>
Sanoh said he was leaving with regret as the CTP had changed so
much and he could not stay.
</P>
<P>
After weighing a number of factors, Sanoh said that the NAP was
his only choice.
</P>
<P>
Sanoh will serve as secretary-general of the NAP, which had 57
seats in the Lower House that was dissolved by Banharn last
weekend, to replace Sukavich Rangsitpol who will become the
advisory chairman of the party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the newspaper, 16 former MPs from the
Nam Thai (Thai Leadership) Party (NTP) led by Amnuay Virawan were
also admitted into the NAP Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Amnuay and another NTP former MP, the newspaper said,
are expected to join the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
NAP leader Chavalit's prospect for the election was
significantly enhanced with the recruitment of these potential

<HEADLINE> Great Success Achieved in Nigeria: State Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state General
Sani Abacha said today that his country is moving along the path
of success and progress in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to mark the 36th anniversary of Nigeria's
independence, Abacha called on the Nigerian people to rededicate
themselves to the cause of the nation and attain "greater heights
in all fields".
</P>
<P>
He said since he announced the three-year transition program
for a democratic election a year ago, various transition
institutions have been established and begun working.
</P>
<P>
Five political associations have been registered as parties to
pave the way for electing local government councils. Six new
states and 183 local governments have been created to share the
nation's political power and natural resources on a wider and more
reasonable basis.
</P>
<P>
Abacha also pledged reform of the country's education system
and try to resolve the six-month strike by university lecturers.
</P>
<P>
On economy, the Nigerian leader said growth this year is
expected to be higher than last year and the government will enjoy
a budget surplus again.
</P>
<P>
With macro-economic stability, inflation is under control and
the government will carry out appropriate policies to bring down
the prices of food, goods and services, Abacha said.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show consumer prices rose 28.8 percent in the 12
months to June 1996, although that is down 31 percent on the
year-on-year figure for May.
</P>
<P>
Abacha said that since the former British colony gained
independence on October 1, 1960, Nigeria has pursued a consistent
policy of friendly relations with all countries, especially
African countries.

<HEADLINE> Life Expectancy to Be Raised by 9 Years in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The average life expectancy
of Ethiopians will go up by nearly 20 percent and the child and
maternity death rate will be cut by half by 2016, Ethiopian Health
Minister Adem Ibrahim said today.
</P>
<P>
The average life expectancy of Ethiopians is now 51, but should
go up by nine years to 60 over the next 20 years, Adem told a
five-day health workshop, according to the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
A report presented in 1996 by the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) showed that over the past 35 years, life expectancy
has risen in Ethiopia by 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the infant mortality rate in
Ethiopia will fall from 10.5 percent to 5 percent and the
maternity death rate will be reduced from 0.7 percent to 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
He added that the vaccination program, which currently covers
only 45 percent of the country, will be doubled and family
planning services will increase to 40 percent from 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's health policy, expansion of health
institutions and health services as well as strengthening health
research is to be a priority over the next 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Funds for More Water in Arid Gansu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Gansu province in northwest
China will have to spend at least 600 million yuan a year in
1996-2000 to develop new water sources and build water
distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the central government has
promised the arid province money to help meet its water
requirements.
</P>
<P>
It quoted vice governor Yun Xiaosu as saying Gansu will receive
410 million yuan in annual grants from the central government and
another 150 million yuan a year in subsidized loans from state
banks for the province's poverty alleviation program.
</P>
<P>
Gansu will use the money to help its four million poor farmers
wring water and food from its rocky loess and deserts, Yun said.
</P>
<P>
For its more than one million rural families, whose per capita
income falls below the state-set poverty line of 530 yuan a year,
the Gansu government is planning a colossal irrigation project to
channel the Taohe River, a tributary of the Yellow River, to
Dingxi in the northwestern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated investment of 10 billion yuan, construction
is expected to receive a World Bank loan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
To turn the barren homeland of the province's 19.38 million
farmers into a granary, the province will invest at least 36
million yuan a year to develop 320,000 ha of terraced lands
in the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
It will also spend 72 million yuan a year on the development of
plastic mulch for preserving water and upgrading agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
The province's one million destitute families will be given 300
million yuan annually to develop irrigated farmland in the
1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The province will also allocate 67 million yuan a year to speed
development of a rural service industry and collectively owned
agricultural produce processing.
</P>
<P>
The training of agricultural technical personnel is considered
a "must" for Gansu's poverty alleviation program. The province
will disburse more than 10 million yuan a year to provide
technical training in the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Gansu, comprising 6,700 poor villages, has a tougher job than
any other province, Yun said, to ease poverty within its
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
But, the vice governor said, he is confident that the
province's rural per capita income can be raised from 1,100 yuan
in 1996 to 1,800 yuan by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
This year, the grain output of the province is estimated to
reach 7.65 million tons. It is expected to hit nine million tons
by 2000, according to Yun.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Government Achievements Highlighted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Shiekh
Hasina has highlighted her government's activities and
achievements during its first 100 days in power.
</P>
<P>
In a live TV question-and-answer session making the completion
of the first 100 days of the government last night, Hasina listed
in detail 37 major activities and achievements.
</P>
<P>
Among them were restoration of voting rights, enhancement of
rationing for the police to 40 percent from 20 percent, legal
action against corrupt people and bank defaulters, subsidy in the
agriculture sector, commitment and signing of memorandums of
understanding (MOUs) involving 1 billion US dollars foreign
investment and short- and long-term plan to solve problems of
waterlogging and traffic jam in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
She also answered a host of questions ranging from issues like
sharing of the Ganges water with India to power shortage and
off-loading of shares of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We shall certainly get our due share of the Ganges. We are
trying to get it before the next dry season," she said on the
progress of the talks on the sharing of water with India.
</P>
<P>
"There should be transparency in the state decisions" and
public interest suffers in the absence of transparency in the
process of taking and implementing decisions, Hasina said, seeking
cooperation and joint endeavors from all in the nation's march
towards the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Troops May Expose to Chemicals in Gulf: Pentagon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon admitted today
that more than 15,000 troops could have been exposed to chemical
weapons during the 1991 Gulf War, a far greater number than
previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials are contacting some 5,000 troops whom they
believe may have been exposed to gases during the first of two
explosions at an Iraqi chemical weapons dump in southern Iraq in
March 1991.
</P>
<P>
A simulated computer study by the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA), taking into account wind conditions, the potential number
of the chemical rockets destroyed and other issues involving a
second explosion on March 10, 1991, indicates far greater numbers
of troops than the Pentagon estimated could have been exposed.
</P>
<P>
"My expectation is that, based on the amount of chemical
weapons in the pit and what we've been told, there could be a very
large number of troops included in a possible cloud area,"
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. "We have to think in terms
of big numbers, bigger than 15,000 certainly."
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 veterans returned home suffering from ailments
such as aching joints, fatigue and memory loss. They suspected
exposing to Iraqi chemical or biological agents had contributed to
their chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announced on September 18 that at least 5,000 Gulf
War veterans may have been exposed to nerve agents at that time.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the Pentagon has asked the National Academy of
Sciences and its institute of medicine to undertake a study of the
military's approach to Gulf War illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Women Urged to be More Devoted to Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Women professors at Beijing's
universities have urged their female students not to return to the
traditional woman's role but to make themselves more competent in
their professions and more competitive in modern society.
</P>
<P>
In a special report carried on the National page, today's China
Daily reported that a sample survey of 500 women students in four
well-known Beijing universities, including the renowned Beijing
and Qinghua universities showed as if few have listened to that
advice.
</P>
<P>
The professors said they were alarmed to see the results of the
survey, which showed that the students chose health to be most
important for them, and then love, family, money and professional
achievements.
</P>
<P>
A report on this sample was released at a forum held in the
capital last week, by the he Beijing Women Professors' Association.
</P>
<P>
The association started a program entitled "hand-in-hand" after
the Fourth World Conference on Women which was held in Beijing
in September of last year.
</P>
<P>
The program was designed to help women students become more
competitive in modern society and to make more contributions to
the country's socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Pan Fumin, an associate professor in psychology supervised the
survey. She said that some female college students responded that
a good marriage was far more important than anything else for a
woman.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the percentage of women students in colleges
and universities has increased. This year's College Entrance
Examination found far more women students with high scores.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ning, a professor at Beijing Normal University, said she
felt that after female college students entered society, they did
not achieve as much at work as they had in their studies.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for that were varied but the women students' views
on life, society and work, and how much effort they put into their
work affected their responses to the survey, according to
Professor Wang.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Women Professors' Association was set up two years
ago and has a membership of more than 5,000 female professors,
associate professors and senior research fellows at some 68
universities and colleges in the Chinese capital.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Leather Industry Faces Sluggish Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's leather industry is
facing sluggish exports to some of its major markets, according to
the Thai Leather Products Association president.
</P>
<P>
Boonchuay Pukchomngam blamed the high cost of raw materials for
the slow leather products exports to the European Union, the US
and Japan, making Thai products less competitive than those from
other Asian competitors.
</P>
<P>
Although the Finance Ministry reduced the import tariff for
leather raw materials from 10 percent to 5 percent two months ago,
he said the tariff reduction had not yet led to an increase in
exports.
</P>
<P>
The association wants import tariffs on raw materials used by
the sector dropped completely.
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainty has been another factor which has
adversely affected leather products exports, according to
Boonchuay.
</P>
<P>
The association called on the government to help the industry
by putting forth a strong and consistent export policy.
</P>
<P>
A press release of the association said export marketing
strategy alone will not be sufficient if the government does not
put adequate efforts into promoting a buy-Thai policy for the
leather goods industry.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand has been gaining additional contracts to
produce recognized brand names from major competitors such as
Italy, France and Switzerland due to their high cost of
production.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's leather goods industry has a workforce of more than
100,000 and generates over 14 billion baht (560 million US
dollars) in foreign exchange earnings annually, with major
importers being the US, the EU, Japan and the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Better Health for Transient Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Local family-planning officials
have been urged to tighten their management of the transient
population and to provide high-quality health and reproductive
services for these people.
</P>
<P>
The central government plans to revise the "national
regulations on administration of the transient population",
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
New items will be added to safeguard reproductive rights and to
ensure safer and better health services for the population, the
paper quoted Wang Guoqiang, director in charge of policy for the
State Family Planning Commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 80 to 100 million transients in the country are
surplus rural laborers working in cities.
</P>
<P>
After relocating to cities, some farmers give up the
traditional reproductive concepts which favor more children and
more boys. Instead they want a family that is smaller but
better-off.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the transient population in cities keeps growing because
most members in this group are of reproductive age, and many stay
away from their hometowns for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
Supervision of the transient population has become a problem in
urban areas, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
With approval from the State Council, the State Family Planning
Commission promulgated "national regulations for the transient
population" in 1991. Since then, many local governments have
issued similar regulations in accordance with local conditions.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that the transient's home town and
the present place of residence must share the responsibility for
implementing family planning. All related departments must also
help manage temporary residents and provide them with health and
reproductive services.
</P>
<P>
The governments of both the home towns and the temporary
residence places must have regular contact to understand the
marriage and reproductive status of transient people.
</P>
<P>
Each transient person must carry a certificate stating marriage
and reproductive conditions to show to the appropriate family
planning department.
</P>
<P>
Eligible couples may have their children born where they
currently reside and receive the same one-child award and
maternity and child health care services as permanent residents.

<P>
BONN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf, making her first
appearance on a tennis court in Germany since her father's tax
evasion trial began last month, easily won her first match in the
Leipzig tournament on Tuesday in Leipzig, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The world number one crushed American Kimberly Po, ranked

Graf's father, Peter, is accused of evading taxes on 19
million marks (12.47 million dollars) of his multimillionaire
daughter's earnings between 1989 and 1993. He has been in
detention since August last year and his trial began in Mannheim
in September.
</P>
<P>
Graf could face fellow German and titleholder Anke Huber in

<HEADLINE> Israel Refuses U.S. Request on Hebron Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel has rejected at the
Washington summit a U.S. request for a specific date to pull its
troops out of the West Bank city of Hebron, an Israeli cabinet
minister said today.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely it was clear the American side wants to set a final
date," Natan Sharansky, Israel's trade minister and a member on
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's delegation to the summit, told
reporters. "We were saying it is impossible."
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the Israeli troops in Hebron, where there are
450 Jews living in the new settlement, is a key part of the
current Israeli-Palestinian friction as Netanyahu has refused to
implement an accord of withdrawal agreed upon by the former Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky said Netanyahu has also refused to hold non-stop
negotiations on a Hebron redeployment right away in Washington,
and insisted that such talks should begin on a later date.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed further that Israel would not reverse its decision
of opening the entrance of an ancient tunnel that was the main
cause of recent violent clashes between the Palestinians and
Israelis on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Netanyahu held a
three-hour talk during the first day of the Washington summit,
which was arranged by U.S. President Bill Clinton in an effort to
rescue the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
But Israel's position foretells that the summit might solve
nothing and the differences between the two parties will remain.

<HEADLINE> Dream Comes True for Chinese Girl with Hearing Disability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Just like many other recent
college graduates, 23-year-old Yang Yang got recommendations, went
to job interviews, and finally found a job as an intern with the
Zhejiang International Exhibition Company.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang, who graduated from the math department at Hangzhou
University in east China's Zhejiang Province is not like other
Chinese grads - she is the first deaf student to graduate.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who is good at English, was assigned to do financial work
in the company's newly-opened foreign trade department.
</P>
<P>
"Yang is very diligent and honest," said Duanmu Qunfan, a
vice-manager who showed confidence in Yang's capability to do her
job well.
</P>
<P>
Yang lost her hearing at the age of five in an allergic
reaction to some medicine, leaving the child's parents in a state
of shock when they discovered that their only child was deaf. The
future for a deaf child was usually a world without speech.
</P>
<P>
Yang's father, however, did not surrender and would not accept
the usual fate for his deaf child. Sitting face-to-face with his
daughter, he began to teach her how to pronounce words by reading
his lips.
</P>
<P>
A normal child can usually pronounce Chinese phonetic symbols
in a couple of days, but it took Yang 10 years to learn sounds
correctly. But, those 10 years played a very important role in
developing her language ability.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other children with a disability, Yang did not go to a
special school for children like her, but was given a chance to
study with other children at the Wulinqiao Primary School in
Hangzhou for half a year.
</P>
<P>
Her diligence and good record convinced school officials that
they should formally accept her, and in similar fashion, a high
school was convinced that it should enroll her.
</P>
<P>
Yang passed the college entrance exam in 1992 and qualified for
enrollment as a four-year student, but failed the medical exam -
there simply was no precedent for a deaf person being educated at
an ordinary college in China.
</P>
<P>
Then Deng Pufang, the chairman of the China Disabled Persons'
Federation, learned about Yang's misfortune and sent
representatives to Hangzhou to help her, with the result that Yang
ultimately was accepted at Hangzhou University.
</P>
<P>
During her four years of study, Yang devoted herself to
self-improvement. She practiced 48 more English words than were
required every day and practised oral English with foreign
students. Even with her having to miss the listening test, Yang
still passed the English Proficiency Test when she was just a
sophomore.
</P>
<P>
She tried repeatedly to get herself hired by trading companies,
but was refused repeatedly because she couldn't take phone calls.
</P>
<P>
But, Duanmu says, "Yang is very persistent," and her
persistence greatly encourages other staff members in the company
where she is working.
</P>
<P>
Yang now attends night school every day to study accounting and
computers. "I am unfortunate in being deaf, but I am fortunate as
well because there are so many people who have given me a hand and
cared about me," she concludes.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) was scheduled to meet in the Angolan
capital Luanda Wednesday to speed up the implementation of the
peace process in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Johannesburg by Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe, who is chairman of the newly-formed SADC defense
and security commission, said the Angolan peace process will top
the agenda of the Luanda summit.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of
Angola's main opposition party UNITA (National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola) have been invited to attend.
</P>
<P>
According to an SADC source, the conclusion of the Angolan
peace process would allow the country to participate in the
security programs of the 12-member bloc, with a view to ensuring
development within the region.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's 9-Month Inflation at 6.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's average inflation for
the first three quarters of the year was 6.2 percent, higher than
the government targeted 5.5 percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Although inflation for the month of September rose only 4.6
percent, compared with the 5.5 percent for August, the general
election set for mid-November and flooding threaten to undermine
the government's drive to cap inflation at 5.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have warned a spending spree during the election
campaign, floods in many provinces, the higher minimum wage and
rising oil prices could send inflation well above the target.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Farmers Research Center has predicted that a total of
20 billion baht (800 million US dollars) would be spent on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
At best, inflation for the year would be 5.8 percent because of
pre-election spending, according to Pisal Manoleehagul, managing
director of the center.
</P>
<P>
He added that the election would induce demand while there
would be no change on the supply side.
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Finance Minister Bodi Chunnananda said the center's
forecast might be correct and he was also worried that
inflationary pressure would increase during the last quarter of
the year.

<HEADLINE> Party Secretary of Zhuhai on SEZ Construction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- As a national special economic
zone (SEZ), Zhuhai must take into consideration not only its own
needs but also the interests of the region, Liang Guangda, Party
Secretary of Zhuhai SEZ, wrote in an article in the latest issue
of "Seeking Truth," the fortnightly theoretical journal of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Set up 16 years ago, Zhuhai SEZ, in south China's Guangdong
Province, has developed from a under-developed and desolate small
frontier county into a modernized coastal city and special
economic zone, the article says.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the city reported a per capita gross domestic product
3.5 times that of the national average level, ranking fourth among
19 cities with a per capita GDP of over 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Under the new circumstances, the article says, the SEZ must
transfer from its reliance on preferential policies to dependence
on its own quality and strength in order to promote the long-term
development.
</P>
<P>
"To assure the long-term development for the SEZ, several pairs
of relations must be well handled," Liang writes in the article.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the economic development and politics
must be dealt with well, Liang states.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the SEZ is both an important economic task
and an important political task, he writes, because it is a
"showcase" that will demonstrate the superiorities of the
socialist system and expand China's influence overseas.
</P>
<P>
"We started the third-phase construction of Zhuhai in the
1990s, aiming to basically realize the modernization in some 13
years," Liang writes in the article.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, a strategy of reinvigorating Zhuhai by
relying on science and technology has been carred out. On one
hand, emphasis was put on hi-tech industry in introducing foreign
investment. On the other hand, efforts were made to pool talents
from all channels.
</P>
<P>
The hi-tech industry presently accounts for 19.26 percent of
the city's total industrial output value, and the contribution
rate of science and technology in the economic growth surpasses 40
percent.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Concerned With Taliban Maneuver in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Foreign Minister Lena
Hjelm-Wallen today said that she was concerned with the
"intolerance and repression displayed by the Taliban after
capturing Kabul".
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that she was disappointed
particularly by the negative treatment of women introduced by the
new leaders.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to all the parties involved to respond to the
request of the United Nations Security Council to find a solution
to their antagonism through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that Sweden's humanitarian aid for
war-weary Afghanistan will continue.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban took the Afghan capital last Friday and have since
been pushing northward toward territories held by northern warlord
Rashid Dostum and by the forces of the ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani and his military commander, Ahmed Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
It gave Dostum 24 hours to allow the student militia to pass
through the four-kilometer-long Salang tunnel north of Kabul in
order to wipe out the government troops.
</P>
<P>
The 450-kilometer Salang highway is the only road north of
Kabul leading to Central Asia, and is vital for trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Dostum had sent 40,000 troops to bolster his
front line against the Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Urged to Support Older People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopians were today urged
to support and care for the country's three million elderly people.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Abdella, Ethiopian minister of labor and social affairs,
told a meeting to mark the United Nations' International Day for
the Elderly that older people are an important element in the
country's socio-economic and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Caring for them is a commendable tradition of the country and
governmental and non-governmental organizations are expected to
contribute.
</P>
<P>
But many older people are suffering from pressing social
problems due to dwindling support from society, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Policies and programs initiated by the government will play a
significant role in improving their living conditions, said
Hassan. But implementation requires the participation of the
society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The number of people over 60 in the African country is
estimated at about 5 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
In December 1990, the United Nations declared October 1
International Day for the Elderly. Ethiopia began marking the
day in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Former State Leader to Head Nigerian Economic Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former head of state
Ernest Shonekan was today named head of a high-powered economic
committee to guide the country's strategic economic plan "Vision
2010" and the national industrialization drive.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was announced by Head of State Sani Abacha in a
nationwide address this morning on the country's 36th independence
anniversary,
</P>
<P>
"Vision 2010", a long-term plan for achieving national
self-reliance, economic strength and political stability, was
unveiled by Abacha two weeks ago during the third national
economic summit held in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Shonekan, who was head of state in 1993, will lead the
committee composed of representatives from both the government and
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Abacha said the committee "will specifically examine those
aspects of our economy which should be developed and strengthened".
</P>
<P>
"It will set goals and targets for our economic growth and
social stability," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Abacha, the committee will "focus on such
important indices as gross domestic product, literacy, employment,
inflation, health care, agriculture, industry and science and
technology".
</P>
<P>
Abacha noted that since independence in 1960 Nigeria had
"missed the opportunities to harness its resources properly, to
control areas of wastage and utilize such resources for
development projects and programs".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the first step was "to identify where we went
wrong and to consolidate our gains as a nation".

The relationships between economic development and the
investment environment must also be handled well, the article
says.
</P>
<P>
As a special economic zone of the country, Zhuhai must base its
city planning on the idea of being competitive in the world, in
particular Southeast Asia, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a national SEZ must be carried out in the
light of the overall situation and facing the future, the article
says, adding that not only the needs of Zhuhai but also the
regional economic development must be taken into consideration in
the SEZ construction.
</P>
<P>
"The construction should serve not only the incumbent
government," Liang writes, "but, more important, lay a foundation
for several terms of governments in the future and even in the
next century."
</P>
<P>
The relations between economic development and environmental
protection must also be handled carefully, the article says.
</P>
<P>
"We must carry out city planning, economic planning and
environment planning simultaneously," it says.
</P>
<P>
Liang points out that the relationships between a lax
environment and the legislative construction must be
well-coordinated.
</P>
<P>
The market economy is based on the legal system, it points out,
and the safeguarding of the market order, the coordinating of
various sorts of economic relations, the assuring of the
government control over the market and fair competition all
depends on the construction and perfection of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
Only after the legal system and norms are set up for all work,
can the people's democratic rights be guaranteed and the reform
and opening-up drive progress in a healthy manner, the article
says.
</P>
<P>
"A good investment environment is impossible without a stable
social environment," the article says. "We have always treated the
stabilization of society as an important factor in improving the
social environment and guaranteeing the cause of reform and
opening up to the outside world."
</P>
<P>
The article states that to create a stable social environment
in the SEZ, the Party-building must be earnestly strengthened, the
anti-corruption drive must be deepened and the comprehensive
treatment of social order must be further enhanced.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Grain Market
Enterprise today announced that it is selling part of its white
teff reserves to stabilize the grain market.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise, a governmental organization set up to stabilize
the country's grain market, is to sell top quality white teff at
215 birr (about 33.6 U.S. dollars) a quintal for bulk buyers and
provide transportation.
</P>
<P>
The organization decided to intervene when teff prices at the
Addis Ababa market rose to between 260 birr and 280 birr (40.7 and
43.8 dollars).
</P>
<P>
With grain reserves in various parts of the country, the
enterprise also expressed confidence in keeping the grain market
under control and denied that there would be grain shortages and
price hikes.
</P>
<P>
Teff is a cereal grass grown Ethiopia and is part of the staple
diet. The country saw a good harvest of 9.6 million tons of grain
last year and is expected to have another good harvest this year
due to adequate rainfall.

But representatives from developing countries said that
environmental policies and measures should not become new forms of
trade barrier to limit their development.

<HEADLINE> New Analysis: Lineup of Future NZ Government Won't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The picture of a
post-election government in New Zealand is still unclear although
the election scheduled for October 12 is already around the
corner.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that a coalition is the most likely
possibility because no party will be able to win a majority in
parliament seats, if opinion polls prove to be right. However, the
prospect of a minority government cannot be totally ruled out.
</P>
<P>
Bargains among political parties are expected to start as soon
as voting is completed. No one now seems to be sure what kind of a
government is to be formed after the polls. All the jigsaw
patterns now envisaged are nothing more than speculations.
</P>
<P>
The National Party, now the ruling party and expected to remain
the largest party in the country's political game, is still keen
to hang on to power. Its leader Jim Bolger has indicated that he
could talk with anyone.
</P>
<P>
The National has a number of choices. It can work with the
United Party, its present coalition partner which has seven MPs.
But opinion polls suggest the United Party may perform poorly in
the election, and cannot maintain its present seats in the next
parliament. Anyway, two or three United MPs could be useful for
the National.
</P>
<P>
The National can come into allies with the Christian Coalition,
which is very hopeful to pass the five-percent threshold in party
vote and have a number of MPs.
</P>
<P>
A marriage between the National and ACT NZ is another option.
But ACT NZ, preferring more drastic reform of the economy, could
prod the National toward further asset sales, tax cuts and
privatization of state services such as health and education.
</P>
<P>
Although the National's policies have more similarities with
those of New Zealand First than with Labor and Alliance, their
leaders Jim Bolger and Winston Peters loath each other. However,
they can still strike a deal, which might come as a loose
agreement under which the National could draw some support from
New Zealand First rather than form a coalition between the two.
</P>
<P>
The official stand of the Labor Party rejects coalition with
the National Party under any circumstances. But there exists the
possibility that some Labor MPs would support a National
government instead of agreeing to a deal between the Labor and
Alliance or NZ First.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party harbors the hope of forming a government with
Alliance. Its leader Helen Clark has expressed her willingness to
talk with Alliance leader Jim Anderton after the election.
However, Anderton insists any talk on forming a coalition take
place before the election, and he has made no explicit commitment
to working with the Labor. Even if the two can become coalition
partners, that will be a minority government and will depend
heavily on the support of New Zealand First.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, who now holds the sway
in the future government lineup, has said more than once that his
party is the only one which can beat the National in the election.
But he has not ruled out a coalition between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
He has also indicated repeatedly that coalition deals will be
up to the NZ First caucus to decide after the election.

"In this sense, we should carry on the fine traditions of
various ethnic groups, inherit outstanding cultural heritage, and
get rid of outdated ideas which hinder ethnic prosperity and
progress," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the officials to make great efforts to promote
scientific, educational and cultural undertakings, so that
economic development can be achieved through the dependence on
scientific progress and a better-qualified labor force.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the officials should deal well with the
relationships between local and overall interest, between
stability and rapid development, and between personal interest and
the interest of the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
Under any circumstances, the officials must safeguard the
absolute authority of the Communist Party Central Committee and
support the overall control of the central government over
economic development.
</P>
<P>
That is a requirement to ensure the sustainable, coordinated
and sound development of the national economy and the stepping up
of development in ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic unity is an important condition for political
stability, and political stability in turn is a reliable guarantee
for economic development," Liu said, adding that local officials
must play exemplary roles in consolidating ethnic unity and
safeguarding the unification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Although working and living in harsh natural environments, the
officials must nurture a correct outlook on the world, life and
values, and do everything in accordance with the interests of the
Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
Like other exemplary figures, local officials should work hard
and share comforts and hardships with the masses, the article
said.

<HEADLINE> More Party Leaders to Join New Zealand TV Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Television New Zealand has
decided to increase the number of political party leaders to
participate in its next election debate scheduled next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the leaders of the four main parties -- the National
Party, the Labor Party, Alliance and New Zealand First, the debate
will be joined by the leaders of ACT NZ, the Christian Coalition
and the United Party.
</P>
<P>
After the debate last week during which Prime Minister and
National Party leader Jim Bolger performed poorly, he said the
format of the debate should be changed as he had to stand against
three opponents from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Labor, Alliance and New Zealand First have all accused the
National Party of placing undue pressure on TVNZ to achieve the
change, a charge the National has vigorously denied.
</P>
<P>
The three new comers are all considered as potential coalition
partners with the National Party.

MEXICO CITY, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Financial groups Bilbao Vizcaya-Probursa, Ixe,
Invermexico, Santander and the Center of Economic Analysis and
Projections for Mexico dismissed the possibility of a new peso
devaluation during the third quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the exchange market will close this year at
the level of eight Mexican pesos for a U.S. dollar, stressing that
during the recent months the peso has maintained its stability
before the high volatility of the U.S. stock markets.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- Costa Rican industry had a 5.38-percent contraction
over the second quarter of this year compared to the same period
of 1995, according to a study conducted by the Institute of
Research on Economic Sciences of the University of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
The industrial contraction in that quarter highlights a
2.19-percent drop registered in the first three months of the year
and shows that from January to June there were no signs of
reactivation in the industrial sector of this Central American
country.
</P>
<P>
The sector most affected by the drop was that of garment which
went down 23.58 percent in April, May and June, compared with a
5.32-percent growth in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- The condonation of 98 percent of the Nicaraguan debt
with the former Soviet Union was made official last week at the
end of the negotiations with Russia started in April of this year.

Nicaraguan Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger said that
after the condonation the debt contracted with the Soviet Union,
3.6 billion U.S. dollars, was reduced to 340 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Uruguayan Economy Minister Luis Mosca requested a
World Bank credit for 150 million dollars to finance reforms
concerning social security and the state.

country has undertaken with the world financing institution.
</P>
<P>
CARACAS -- The Venezuelan government relieved the
administration from the export quota of 430,000 quintales (25,800
tons) of coffee established for the country by the Association of
Coffee Producing Countries.
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Coffee Fund and the Agriculture and
Livestock Ministry agreed that the quota should be administered in
a free way according to a quarterly regulation and cutting plan.
It is foreseen that by December 31 this year, 195,652 quintales
will have been exported, more than 45 percent of the Venezuelan
quota.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Chile's gross domestic product will grow 5.75
percent in 1997, while growth in current spending foreseen in the

rate will be 6.5 percent, according to official figures.
Inflation will be 5.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat explained that the 1997 budget
will be affected by the drop in international prices of the main
Chilean exporting products, such as copper, considering that the
average price of the metal in 1997 would be 94 cents of a dollar
per pound, or four cents of a dollar per pound less than this year.
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- The private sector will invest 400 million
dollars for the tourism development of "Fuerte Amador", the former

said the tourism projects include five hotels with a total
expansion of 18.8 hectares and three tourist villas with 6.5
hectares. The base now covers an area of 176.5 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The amount of national and international investments was
revealed after a bidding for the assessment and selection of
consulting firms interested in conducting the study, design and
planning for the basic infrastructure needed to turn Amador into a
tourist resort.

<HEADLINE> Officials of Ethnic Areas Must Stress Politics: Article (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The officials working in ethnic areas must pay attention to
politics, which means they must safeguard the unity of all peoples
and safeguard the unification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The officials must spare no efforts to boost local economy,
which is the basis for promoting economic and social development
locally, consolidating national defense, stabilizing the borders, and
safeguarding the unification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Only a strong economy and an improved material and cultural
living standard of the people can show the advantages of socialism
and the correctness of the autonomy in ethnic areas, and promote
the unification of all peoples toward the Communist Party and
socialism, the article said.
</P>
<P>
China's ethnic issues are presently concentrated on the urgent
need of ethnic peoples to step up their economic and social
progress. However, for natural, historical and cultural reasons,
the gap between the areas and the country's coastal areas is
widening.
</P>
<P>
But taking the overall situation of the national economy into
consideration, there is great potential for sparsely-populated
ethnic areas which cover vast land, together with abundant
resources.
</P>
<P>
The officials must be fully aware of their historical duty to
invigorate local economies, bearing in mind their advantages and
disadvantages and seizing opportunities for future development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the officials must stress the building of socialist
ideology and culture, and help raise the quality of all peoples.
</P>
<P>
"We should see that whether in the past, present or future,
economic and social development mainly depends on the level of
people's political awareness and the number of those mastering
modern knowledge and skills," Liu Mingzu said in his article.

elections.

<HEADLINE> Officials of Ethnic Areas Must Stress Politics: Article (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Officials in areas inhabited
by ethnic minorities must pay more attention to politics to raise
their political quality, according to a senior Communist official
from Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Liu Mingzu, secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's
Committee of the Communist Party of China, made the remark in an
article carried in the Magazine "Seeking Truth" which was issued
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as there appeared classes and parties in human
society, politics became inseparable from economy. Politics is the
maximum reflection of economy," Liu said in his article.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on politics is significant while China is carrying
out its reform, opening-up and the establishment of a socialist
market economy, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The specific conditions in ethnic areas determine that
officials working there must pay great attention to politics, for
most of the areas are located in the country's border regions with
harsh natural conditions, weak economic foundation, less-developed
culture and poor living standards.
</P>
<P>
China is a large nation consisting of 56 ethnic groups. The
Communist Party holds the view that all ethnic groups have
contributed to the country's civilization. All ethnic groups
should unite and help each other on an equal footing, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Party has been practicing the policy of autonomy in ethnic
areas, and Inner Mongolia became China's first autonomous region in
1947. The natural combination of state administration and autonomy
in ethnic areas proves to be an effective way to solve ethnic
issues.
</P>
<P>
Such a political view must be heeded by officials in ethnic
areas, the article said.
</P>
<P>
At present, some hostile western forces have been engaged in
splitting China under the pretext of human rights and ethnic and
religious problems.
</P>
<P>
"We must have high political awareness of this," Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Misuari's Bid on Philippine Charter Change Busted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine presidential
palace and minority congressmen turned down a proposal by newly
installed Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao to amend the Constitution and give Mindanao more
"representation" in the Senate, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres said Tuesday that the palace
has not changed its position against amending the charter "at this
time" when the administration was preoccupied with more important
affairs of the state.
</P>
<P>
He said Misuari's proposal on constitutional amendments could
be undertaken after the expiration of President Ramos' term in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The same day, minority senators also voiced their opposition to
Misuari's proposal. Senate minority leader Edgardo Angara
described Misuari's recommendation as "political pandering",
saying Misuari is obviously "paying his political debts for the
plum positions he got from the government".
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, House minority leader Ronaldo Zamora said
that Misuari's proposal for an expanded senate would cost
taxpayers an additional 2 billion pesos (76.3 billion US dollars)
a year.
</P>
<P>
He also said increasing the number of senators from the present
24 to 72 would not necessarily bring about a better senate. He
stressed that "quantity does not mean quality".
</P>
<P>
Misuari asked to amend the Constitution on the day he took oath
of office as the ARMM governor in order to pave the way for an
expanded senate whose members would be elected by regions. He
wants 24 of the 72 projected senators to come from Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Urges Collective Efforts to Confront Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus today called
for redoubled collective efforts to face new challenges ahead and
strive for more sustained and stable development.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the opening plenary session of the 1996 annual
meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, Camdessus said the world
economy is on the upswing and some of the worst crises of recent
times, including staggering problems in Russia and financial
crisis in Mexico, have been tackled by prompt international action.
</P>
<P>
"World economic and financial conditions are generally
satisfactory and the outlook is favorable," Camdessus said. "Among
the more positive developments, I would cite the reduction in
world inflation."
</P>
<P>
"Who would have dared hope that as early as this year, Russia
would have strengthened its macroeconomic policy stance to such an
extent that it would even achieve one month of zero inflation; or
that economic recovery would be sufficiently underway in Mexico
that it would begin early repayment to the IMF; or indeed, that
Africa would be in its third year of per capita growth, thanks to
the rigor of the programs that many countries follow!" the IMF
chief noted.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus also said that developing countries continue their
solid 6 percent economic growth and that this growth is now
becoming more widespread. The pace of economic activity in Asia
continues to moderate to a more sustainable, but still remarkable
rate of about 7.5 percent. China and India, the two huge countries
which together account for more than one third of the world's
population, have been striking improvements in average per capital
incomes, even though poverty is far from being conquered, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief said Africa's growth performance also deserves
special mention. Last year, there were 25 countries with annual
growth of 4 percent or more -- nearly twice the average number in
1990-1993. Africa as a whole is expected to grow by 5 percent this
year and next, the highest rates of growth in two decades.
"Africa, for which so many seemed to have lost hope, appears now
to be stirring and on the move," Camdessus stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, Camdessus also made it clear that there is still a lot
of work to do which includes further fiscal consolidation,
structural reforms, reforms of the state, better management and a
more stable global banking system.
</P>
<P>
Calling it the Achilles heel of the global economy, Camdessus
warned "a banking crisis is an accident waiting to happen."
</P>
<P>
World Bank President James Wolfensohn said about one in five
developing nations faces a banking crisis. "That is why the Bank
group -- working with the IMF -- is strengthening our capacity to
help our clients strengthen their financial sectors."
</P>
<P>
Both Camdessus and Wolfensohn lashed out at corruption in many
countries, saying the entrenched practice is weakening the entire
system.
</P>
<P>
"We need to deal with the cancer of corruption," Wolfensohn
said, adding, "The Bank group will not tolerate corruption in the
program that we support."
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said that many of the challenges in today's global
economy are "much greater than any single or group of countries
can cope with alone."
</P>
<P>
He called for redoubled collective efforts to reach the common
goals: greater stability in the world and stronger, more
sustained, more broadly shared and higher quality growth.

<P>
UNITED, NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 civilians
were killed in a cold-blooded massacre at Sinje, Grand Cape Mount
of Liberia, during the early hours of Saturday, according to a
United Nations statement here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency and relief workers visited Sinje Monday and

also forced about 1,000 others to flee their hometown.
</P>
<P>
Other reports put the figure of the dead at between 25 and 42.
The majority of the victims were innocent women, children and
elderly men.
</P>

The United Nations condemns this massacre which constitutes a
"most serious violation of human rights and the rights of
children," said the statement.

and to begin the process of voluntary disarmament to which they
have committed themselves.

<HEADLINE> Private Contractor to Manage NASA Space Shuttle Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- NASA began a new era today by
turning over much of the ground processing and in-flight
operations of the space shuttle program to a private contractor,
United Space Alliance (USA).
</P>
<P>
The six-year, 7 billion dollar contract, which goes into effect
today, was signed last Thursday and announced Monday. It has two
two-year extension options that could bring the total estimated
contract value to about 12 billion dollars over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining safety as the top priority and keeping the
current annual flight rate intact, the contract is intended to
reduce the government's role in overseeing routine, day-to-day
operation of the four space shuttles.
</P>
<P>
The contract consolidates 12 earlier individual contracts
involving several companies, giving greater responsibility to USA.
The new contract is part of the first stage in gradually moving
NASA out of standard shuttle operations.
</P>
<P>
The contract will divide any cost savings between USA and the
federal government. USA is a joint venture formed in 1995 between
the Lockheed Martin Corporation and Rockwell Aerospace Company.
</P>
<P>
Following a transitional period, NASA will retain ultimate
responsibility for safe space shuttle operations and will continue
to direct high-level management of the space shuttle program and
flight operations.
</P>
<P>
NASA will evaluate the overall performance of the contractor
each six months. The safety grade will be one of the factors used
to determine the amount of profits that are awarded.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the U.S. space shuttle fleet has four members --
Columbia, Atlantis, Discovery and Challenge's replacement,
Endeavor.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Netanyahu Hold Discussions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Middle East leaders were at
last gathered together this afternoon by U.S. President Bill
Clinton who is trying his best to rescue the collapsing Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
this process has been derailed by recent Israeli actions that
touched off violent clashes between the Palestinians and the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
After their separate meetings with Clinton this morning,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu met face-to-face at the gathering with Clinton
and King Hussein of Jordan's attendance at the White House Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
The group meeting lasted about one hour and the four leaders
strolled then to the White House library for lunch.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Arafat and Netanyahu also shook hands and
exchanged pleasantries in the White House Roosevelt Room before a
session with Clinton in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
Reporting on the summit, White House spokesman Mike McCurry
said, "It was clear they could work together and have the kind of
dialogue that could resolve their differences."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Arafat and Netanyahu plan to spend the
rest of the day in direct negotiations at the White House to
find a way to defuse the recent crises, touched off by Israel's
opening of a disputed ancient tunnel near Islam's holy site in
Jerusalem, evolving into violent confrontations between the
Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and King Hussein later left the room so that Arafat
and Netanyahu could have their discussions in private, McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Warren Christopher met across
Pennsylvania Avenue in the Blair House with senior Israeli and
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
McCurry was cautious in his briefing, saying they were still at
a very difficult moment. "We have not passed through the crisis,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said their handshaking and small chatting might
be cosmetic gestures to break ice before their talks. "While it is
nice that it happened, we are looking for a lot more, obviously,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry emphasized that Clinton was not applying pressure to
either Netanyahu or Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"What we have to do is to create understanding between the
parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton's conversation with Netanyahu was very
warm. "It was clear from the body language of the two they enjoyed
their conversations."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also spoke warmly of Arafat, saying that "the
president has a great deal of respect for the chairman."
</P>
<P>
McCurry gave very little of details of the negotiations among
the four leaders, in particular between Arafat and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
But he indicated Clinton agreed to Netanyahu's proposal for
open-ended Israeli-Palestinian negotiations after the summit.
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of ideas advanced by all of the parties,"
he said. "There are substantive discussions of that nature."
</P>
<P>
The heavy backdrop of U.S. election-year politics was apparent
when Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Republican presidential
nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
Dole, in an attempt to mar Clinton's image by criticizing his
Middle East peace policy in the last five weeks of election
campaign, issued a statement Monday, which said, "Our friend
Israel must not be asked to make concessions as a means of
restoring order."
</P>
<P>
The White House dismissed his comment as "unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
"This president has provided extraordinary leadership in this
region in the peace process precisely because we have fulfilled
our commitment to our longtime ally Israel," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is now walking a diplomatic and political tightrope in
hosting this summit, balancing neutrality among the contending
Middle East parties with sensitivity for the outlook of American
Jews, a potent U.S. voting bloc, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The summit is expected to end Wednesday with a statement. Until
then there would be a news blackout as the parties need
closed-door discussions over the outstanding issues.

<HEADLINE> UN Terminates Sanctions Against Former Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations adopted unanimously a resolution here this
evening to terminate the sanctions against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, which was imposed on May 30, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, which lasted more than four years and were aimed
at settling the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, also slowed
down the economic development in the affected region.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the elections called for in the Peace
Agreement signed on November 22, 1995 took place on September 14
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their holding represented an essential
step towards achieving the objectives of the Peace Agreement, and
the sanctions could be lifted immediately.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached in Dayton, Ohio, the
measures imposed by the United Nations will be terminated on the
10th day following the occurrence of the first free and fair
elections provided that the Bosnian Serb forces have withdrawn
from, and have continued to respect, the zones of separation.
</P>
<P>
All funds and assets previously frozen or impounded pursuant
may be released by countries in accordance with law, according to
the Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Still, the Security Council resolution called upon all parties
to comply strictly with all their commitments under the Peace
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that the U.N. will "consider the imposition of
measures if any party fails significantly to meet its
obligations" under the agreement.

<HEADLINE> US Settles Disputes With Japan, Germany, Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
today that it has settled its trade disputes with Japan on the
insurance market, Germany on the heavy electrical equipment
market, and Taiwan on the medical equipment market recently.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Acting U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR) Charlene Barshefsky said that the United
States and Japan reached an interim agreement regarding the
conditions under which the new subsidiaries of the major Japanese
life and non-life companies may offer products in the third sector
upon the start-up of their business on October 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
She said the two governments are still working to reach, before
the end of the year, an overall agreement on "avoiding radical
change" in the third sector and substantial deregulation of the
primary sectors.
</P>
<P>
She said that as Germany has agreed to take steps that will
effectively ensure open competition in the German heavy
electrical equipment market, she decided to further delay
imposition of sanctions, and has set a number of milestones for
reviewing her decision.
</P>
<P>
As for Taiwan, she said that it has agreed to ensure that its
medical insurance authorities do not discriminate against U.S.
exports of medical devices. The commitments made by Taiwan
avoided the inclusion of this practice in the Super 301 report
this year, she added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade representative also announced on the occasion
that the USTR will initiate four new investigations of foreign
trade barriers under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974,
invoking World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement in
three of them.
</P>
<P>
The investigations involve Indonesia' national auto policy,
Brazil's auto program, Australia's export subsidies and
Argentina's import duties.

<HEADLINE> UNABOM Suspect Indicted in New Jersey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A federal grand jury in
Newark, New Jersey, has indicted UNBOM suspect Theodore Kaczynski
on charges of mailing the bomb that killed advertising executive
Thomas Mosser in December 1994, the Justice Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski was being held in Sacramento, California, where he
was indicted in June on 10 separate counts in the killing of two
other men and wounding two others.
</P>
<P>
"As with the earlier charges filed against Mr. Kaczynski in
Sacramento, California, these charges are the result of a
multi-agency investigation by the (San Francisco-based) UNABOM
Task Force into a series of bombings that occurred across the
United States beginning in 1978," Attorney General Janet Reno said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The department intends to prosecute Kaczynski in New Jersey
after the trial in Sacramento, officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to today's indictment, Kaczynski allegedly
transported the bomb that killed Mosser from Montana to San
Francisco, then mailed it to Mosser's home in North Caldwell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
When Mosser opened the package, it exploded and killed him.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is the only suspect in 16 bombings that killed three
people and injured 23.
</P>
<P>
A major break in the decades-long investigation came when
Kaczynski's brother, David, a social worker from Schenectady,
N.Y., contacted authorities last year.
</P>
<P>
Theodore Kaczynski was subsequently arrested in a remote cabin
near Lincoln, Montana.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique highly appreciated
the Chinese people's support for its struggle for national
independence, a Mozambican minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
This was said by Eneas Da Conceicao Comiche, Minister of
Economic and Social affairs in the Presidency at a reception
given here by Chinese Ambassador Mi Shiheng to mark the Chinese
National Day today.
</P>
<P>
China has once again rendered support to Mozambique in many
fields after she gained independence, Comiche said, hoping that
the friendship and cooperation between the two countries would be
strengthened and consolidated in the future.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the economic development of China in recent
years and said he welcomed Chinese entrepreneurs to come and
invest in his country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the reception in the Chinese embassy this evening,
Ambassador Mi said 1996 saw new development on the ties between
the two governments of Mozambique and China and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Mozamican friendship has stood the test of struggle and
"China is an all-weathered friend of the Mozmbican people", said

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) today urged Israel to honor its commitments to the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 51st General Assembly session, UAE Foreign
Minister Rashid Abdullah Al-Noaimi said his country was
disappointed by the position of the Israeli government which did
not honor the commitments entered into by its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab parties are determined to pursue the peace process as
an objective and a strategic option to which there is no
alternative," said Al-Noaimi. "This calls for a reciprocal
commitment by the Israeli side, without any further delay or
procrastination."
</P>
<P>
He said this commitment must be proven by the actual and
unconditional implementation of all the relevant agreements
concluded so far, to enable the Palestinian people to exercise
their legitimate rights, including their right to
self-determination and to the establishment of their independent
state, with its capital Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel must also complete its withdrawal from the
Syrian Golan to the line of June 4, 1967, and from the occupied
southern Lebanon and the western Beqaa.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Suggests Peace Force Remain in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Bosnia peace
negotiator Richard Holbrooke warned here today that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should maintain a peacekeeping
force in Bosnia next year; otherwise, there would be a risk of new
warfare there.
</P>
<P>
"You can't go from 60,000 (present NATO peacekeepers) to zero
without an implosion," Holbrooke said at a U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee hearing. "The war could even resume."
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord, which was reached after
intensive closed-door U.S.-sponsored negotiations in Dayton, Ohio,
last year, peace was restored in Bosnia and general elections were
held on September 14. The newly elected members of the presidency
of Bosnia held their first post-election meeting Monday.
</P>
<P>
NATO peacekeepers have enforced the peace accord, but have been
scheduled to leave there in December.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said that he was confident that another group of
peacekeepers would be sent to the region to ensure that peace in
Bosnia will be maintained, but the new force need not be as large
as the present one.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, after a meeting of NATO
defense ministers in Bergen, Norway, last week, said the United
States would strongly consider contributing U.S. troops to a new
force if NATO decided one was needed.
</P>
<P>
According to Holbrooke, the European allies were willing to
send more troops. But they insisted the United States participate
in the troop deployment.

<HEADLINE> Judge Turns Down Perot's Debate Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge today
rejected Reform Party nominee Ross Perot's bid to be included in
Sunday's presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan rejected efforts by the
Reform Party and the Natural Law Party for injunctions to force
the Presidential Debate Commission to include their candidates in
the two presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
Hogan said the complaints belong with the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Although Perot's attorneys said they would appeal, Hogan's
dismissal of the complaint dealt a serious blow to Perot's hopes
of being included in Sunday's debate in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
Perot had been seeking a preliminary injunction in which Hogan
would either order the debate commission to invite him to Sunday's
proceedings, or, barring that, a ruling ordering that the debate
be canceled.
</P>
<P>
Hogan also dismissed a similar case filed by Natural Law Party
candidate John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member Presidential Debate Commission, formed equally of
Democrats and Republicans, voted last month to exclude Perot,
saying he had no realistic chance of winning the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Hogan ruled he was bound by legal precedents that clearly
establish that the FEC hears, and resolves campaign disputes of
this nature.
</P>
<P>
Perot and Hagelin had complained that since the FEC is not
required to resolve complaints during the election cycle in which
they are filed, the courts offered their only potential measure of
relief.
</P>
<P>
But Hogan ruled that courts can intervene in such election
matters only under extraordinary circumstances, and ruled that
neither Perot nor Hagelin would be irreparably harmed by being
excluded from the debates, since they each have nearly five weeks
in which to reach voters through personal appearances and
television ads.
</P>
<P>
Hogan also ruled that neither Perot nor Hagelin's Natural Law
Party had met the daunting legal standards that would have allowed
him to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Perot's attorneys had argued that excluding him would
violate his constitutionally-protected free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
However, attorneys for the Commission on Presidential Debates
and the FEC argued that there are no free-speech guarantees in the
law governing the structure of presidential debates.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor Party Sets Deadline for Joining Single Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Tony Blair, leader of
the Labor Party, pledged here today that a Labor government would
set a deadline of June 1998 for the completion of the European
Union (EU) single market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Labor Party Annual Conference, the opposition
leader said Britain had the Presidency of the EU in the first half
of 1998, "one of Labor's key priorities in that presidency will be
the completion of the single market."
</P>
<P>
On the question of a single currency, Blair said that Labor's
options on it "should remain open," to be determined according to
Britain's national interest. "Any change will only come with the
full consent of the people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to domestic affairs, Blair said, his three key
priorities were "education, education, education." Labor must make
Britain "the skills superpower of the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader said, "I want a state education system in
Britain so good, so attractive, that the parents choose to put
behind us the educational apartheid of the past, private and state."
</P>
<P>
Cutting class sizes, cutting waiting lists, curbing crime,
putting the young unemployed back to work and building a strong
economy are his other main targets, Blair said. All these targets
"are tangible benefits of our policy," he said.

<HEADLINE> US to Send Diplomat to Kabul </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States will send a
diplomat to Kabul to contact the Taliban militia which has seized
most of Afghanistan and assess prospects for re-staffing the U.S.
embassy there, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be sending an American diplomat into Kabul in
the next couple of days to make contact with the Taliban," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat's mission would be "to essentially investigate
the situation in Kabul, see if a government is being formed" and
pass on U.S. concerns about the Taliban's actions so far, Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
The aim was also "to see if at some point in the future it's
wise to at least have embassy officials go back in and
re-establish an American embassy presence in Kabul," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's acting Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammed
Stanakzai said in Kabul that the movement wanted good relations
with neighboring countries and with the United States and invited
them to reopen their embassies in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Burns did not say who would be sent to Kabul or where he would
be traveling from. It was out of security concerns, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jamaica Urges Int'l Community to Eliminate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Jamaican Foreign Minister
Seymour Mullings today urged the United Nations to address the
root cause of instability and tension -- poverty, deprivation,
hunger and disease.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the current session of the
U.N. General Assembly, Mullings said that it is in the depth of
misery that the swords of anger and division were most quickly
unsheathed.
</P>
<P>
"A commitment to the goals of peace and security is meaningless
without a commitment to fostering sustained economic growth and
sustainable development, and to wage war on poverty and human
misery," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the global economic development, he said the phenomenal
economic growth in a few countries is contrasted with decline and
stagnation in the majority. An increasingly more affluent world
co-exists with a huge and marginalized underclass, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This polarization is reflected both internally and
externally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Failure to address inequities could and would inevitably lead
to "a world gargantuan in its excesses and grotesque in its human
and economic equalities" as described by the 1996 Human
Development Report, he said.
</P>
<P>
For many low-income countries which lack adequate access to
development capital and other resources, official development
assistance remains a critical but diminishing source of support,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the problem of external debt is also a
burden for many of these countries. Agreed arrangements have
proved inadequate to alleviate debt burdens, and alternate
strategies still have to be found, he said.

<HEADLINE> US Announces New Trade Enforcement Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Acting U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR) Charlene Barshefsky announced today that
Indonesia, Brazil, Australia and Argentina are the four targets of
new investigations of trade barriers under Section 301 of the U.S.
Trade Act of 1974.
</P>
<P>
Three of them invoke World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute
settlement, Barshefsky said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
She listed the four new investigations of unfair foreign trade
barriers as Indonesia's national auto policy, Brazil's auto
program, Australia's export subsidies and Argentina's import
duties.
</P>
<P>
She said that Indonesia has recently expanded a domestic auto
policy that offers tax and tariff incentives to increase the local
ownership of automotive companies in Indonesia and the local
content of the automobiles they manufacture.
</P>
<P>
As this policy adversely affects U.S. exports of autos and auto
parts to Indonesia, she said, the USTR will invoke WTO dispute
settlement in the context of an investigation under Section 301.
</P>
<P>
She said that Brazil offers auto manufacturers reduced duties
on imports of assembled cars and other benefits if they export
sufficient quantities of parts and vehicles and promise to meet
local content targets in their Brazilian plants. This program
adversely affects U.S. exports of autos and auto parts to Brazil,
she said.
</P>
<P>
After consultation with Brazil in last August, she said, Brazil
has agreed to enter into intensive talks with the United States.
If no measures are taken by Brazil after 90 days of talks, she
said, the USTR will take further steps to settle the problem under
WTO dispute settlement procedures.
</P>
<P>
She said that as Australia provides significant export
subsidies contrary to its obligations under the WTO Agreement, the
USTR will invoke WTO dispute settlement in the context of an
investigation under Section 301.
</P>
<P>
She said that as Argentina maintains specific import duties on
textiles, apparel and footwear that exceed the rate of 35 percent
ad valorem, and also maintains other WTO-inconsistent import
barriers, the USTR will invoke WTO dispute settlement in context
of an investigation under Section 301 to challenge these Argentine
practices.
</P>
<P>
She said that the United States has secured significant
agreements providing increased market access for autos in Japan
and Korea over the last year and is carefully monitoring those
agreements to ensure full compliance.
</P>
<P>
The national car program in China is also being addressed
bilaterally and in the context of negotiations on China's
accession to the WTO, she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that the United States has accelerated its use of the
dispute settlement provisions of the WTO to address significant
foreign trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
Since the WTO began operation 21 months ago, she said, the
United States has invoked the new WTO dispute settlement
procedures in 20 cases to enforce the WTO agreements, including
the three new WTO disputes as a result of the 1996 Super 301
annual review.
</P>
<P>
Citing the disputes with Japan on taxes on liquor imports and
with the European Union on its imports of grains as examples, she
said the WTO dispute settlement procedures have already yield
positive results.

<HEADLINE> US to Remove Carrier From Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States is planning
to remove the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson from the Gulf next
week, leaving only the carrier Enterprise in the waterway near
Iraq, a defense official said today.
</P>
<P>
"Barring unforeseen circumstances, the tentative plan is to
take it (the Carl Vinson) out next week," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry said last week when he was
traveling on a Europe trip that Iraq was "back off" from a recent
confrontation with Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I do truly believe that Iraq is backing off the threatening
actions they were taking a week ago, but we will watch it very
carefully, very carefully, every day, every hour," he told
reporters traveling with him.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is expected to announce the move this week,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The carrier Carl Vinson is scheduled to return to its home
port in Bremerton, Washington, after six months at sea.
</P>
<P>
The Enterprise was recently moved to the Gulf from the Adriatic
to join the Carl Vinson for a recent U.S. military buildup in the
Gulf to deal with Iraq's possible firing at its patroling aircraft
over northern Iraq.
