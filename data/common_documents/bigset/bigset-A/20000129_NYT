SURPRISE! IT'S TIME TO PAY UP

<P>
   (PHOENIX) - It isn't that Jack Dyer can't afford the $131.60 the
federal government wants him to fork over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the point of how ludicrous this is,'' the 45-year-old
Glendale resident said.
</P>
<P>
   What has Dyer scratching his head is the Social Security
Administration and its insistence that he repay $131.60 in survivor
benefits paid to his mother on his behalf 28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer wants the federal agency to leave him alone, but a Social
Security spokesman says it doesn't forgive a debt simply because it
occurred a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of this dispute go back to 1957, when Dyer was 3
years old. That year, his father died of a heart attack. As a
surviving child, Dyer became eligible for benefits from the Social
Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The checks went to his mother, who used the money to help care
for her son until he was 18.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer had little reason to give any thought to the money until
November when a letter arrived from Social Security. It stated that
his current disability payments, which he began receiving in April
1998 after osteoarthritis forced him from his auto mechanic job,
would be reduced by $131.60 because of Social Security benefits
paid in error.
</P>
<P>
   Baffled, Dyer contacted the agency, which told him the
overpayment was made to his mother, who has since died, on his
behalf in 1972. Apparently, Dyer was working that year and he made
too much money to qualify for the full benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Confidentiality laws prevented Bill Payne, spokesman for the
Phoenix office of Social Security, from talking specifically about
Dyer's case.
</P>
<P>
   He explained, however, that the administration likely knew about
the overpayment back in 1972 and that a letter was probably sent to
Dyer's mother requesting that it be paid back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like we just discovered this thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If an overpayment isn't returned, Payne said, the agency
typically collects the money when the beneficiary begins receiving
Social Security benefits. That's why it took 28 years for Dyer to
hear about the overpayment.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer was told that if he doesn't pay up, the $131.60 will be
deducted from a future check. He receives $800 in monthly
disability payments.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security has procedures in place allowing citizens to
have overpayments reconsidered or waived. Dyer is planning to ask
that the overpayment be waived.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, everything in the newspaper was saying that they
didn't know what they were going to do with the surplus in Social
Security, and here they're looking to beat me up for $131.60,''
Dyer said. ``It just rubbed me totally the wrong way.'' &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ A U.S.-based scholar detained in China for more than
five months on vague charges of ``providing confidential materials
to foreigners'' was released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The scholar, Song Yongyi, a research librarian at Dickinson
College in Carlisle, Pa., was detained in August while collecting
documents concerning the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution that are
widely available in markets and curio shops.
</P>
<P>
   He was formally charged last month with ``the purchase and
illegal provision of intelligence to foreigners,'' a move that
alarmed academics overseas, who saw a threat to research activities
in China, as well as American politicians. Together, the two groups
waged a vigorous campaign to gain the release of Song, a Chinese
citizen who had been scheduled to become an American citizen weeks
after he had been detained.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 p.m. Friday, Song, still in a police office, used his
brother's cellular telephone to call his wife in Pennsylvania to
say that he was being freed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited, but it was so strange I couldn't believe
it,'' said his wife, Helen Yao. She said she had been given no
reason for the release of Song, who was expected to arrive in the
United States Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued Friday by the Chinese Embassy in Washington
said Song had been shown ``leniency'' and not prosecuted because he
had admitted his ``criminal activities'' and had volunteered
information about the ``illegal activities of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yao said that in their phone conversation Song had insisted
that he had ``never confessed to a crime _ no, never.''
</P>
<P>
   Song's lawyers have said all along that he was in China
collecting materials about the Cultural Revolution as part of his
job. They denied that involved anything criminal.
</P>
<P>
   The ``leniency'' release is a bittersweet victory for many of
Song's dogged supporters, who saw his predicament as a test case
not only for academic freedom, but also for legal reform in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the state of the process of Chinese judicial reform,''
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said, ``I think it would be too much to
expect that they'd admit to having made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter had sponsored a congressional resolution to demand that
Song be freed, and he received the first official news of the
release at a scheduled meeting with the Chinese ambassador to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has frequently released political
dissidents on medical grounds to rid itself of prisoners whose
cases had become public relations problems. Although Song, 50, has
bladder cancer, the authorities did not choose that.
</P>
<P>
   Specter and others said the mounting pressure had been extremely
effective. China is working to join the World Trade Organization,
action that indirectly requires congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the government of China thought that his
detention caused more problems than it was worth,'' Specter said.
``If China wants to come into the community of trade, it has to pay
attention to things like the norms of criminal practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal advisers on the case said China's leaders probably also
wanted to avoid a trial that would have been embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``His detention was basically unfair, and the Chinese
appreciated that once it was brought to the attention of people at
a sufficiently high level,'' said Jerome Cohen, an adviser who is
an expert on Chinese law. ``They were responding to immediate
pressure. But they were also responding to the weakness of their
case against Song and the light this case would shed on the
problems and weaknesses of China's criminal procedure code.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Song have complained that he was denied rights
guaranteed under Chinese criminal laws while he was detained. He
was not allowed to see a lawyer, for example, despite repeated
requests.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when his 37 days of legally sanctioned detention ended
without formal charges, he should have been released, Cohen said.
Instead, he was held for months in the basement of a State Security
Bureau in what the police called ``supervised residence.''
</P>
<P>
   Song's lawyers said that they had collected evidence that some
of the documents used to charge him had been planted and that there
were plans to present them at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Song became the object of a huge petition drive by scholars on
four continents. They said their ability to conduct research in
China would be severely compromised if Song's case stood as a
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department as well as congressional delegations
traveling here pressed for his freedom. Saturday, the American
ambassador, Joseph Prueher, said he hoped the release was ``a
harbinger of continued open academic research in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter introduced a bill this week to give Song American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yao said her husband had not been aware of the campaign on
his behalf.

TYSON REPORTEDLY TRIES TO LEAVE BRITAIN ON EVE OF BOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, England _ For 10 days Mike Tyson, America's bad-boy
boxer, has captured the attention of this nation. An outpouring of
fan support has squashed political opposition to his arrival. He
has stimulated the national economy by buying more than $2 million
in watches and jewelry. And though he is not even running for mayor
of London, he has kissed his share of babies.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Tyson had been on his best behavior. But Friday, one day
before his heavyweight bout against Julius Francis, Tyson became
upset and agitated. Jay Larkin, the senior vice president of
programming for Showtime, which is televising the bout, said Tyson
went to the Manchester airport instead of staying at his hotel for
the weigh-in for his fight Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun of London and SkyTV, which has pay-per-view broadcast
rights in Europe for the fight, reported that Tyson tried to leave
Britain and return to the United States. Larkin said: ``Tyson was
upset. He went to the airport. I don't know what he was upset
about. His bodyguard, James Anderson, was with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin said he was unsure whether Tyson wanted to leave the
country and believed that Anderson talked him into coming back. The
Sun reported that members of Tyson's entourage went to the airport,
calmed him down and talked him into returning.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's wife, Monica, and their children did not travel here for
the fight, and Tyson was reportedly upset about their absence.
</P>
<P>
   He made the weigh-in an hour late. Reporters who had been told
Tyson went to the airport to meet a relative saw Tyson arrive about
4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson was upset, Francis may have added more heat to the fire
by keeping Tyson waiting for 10 minutes at the weigh-in. Francis
was still in his room when Tyson took a seat on the stage where the
scale was and began twirling the small braids on his head. Ten
minutes later, Francis arrived. He kept on his black sunglasses for
the weigh-in and came in at 244 1/2 pounds. Tyson weighed in at 222
3/4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson (46-3) and Francis (21-7), the British heavyweight
champion, will meet in the ring at MEN Arena on Saturday night. The
10-round bout will be broadcast on tape delay on Showtime at 10
p.m. ET. On the undercard, Joe Calzaghe (27-0) of Wales will defend
his World Boxing Organization supermiddleweight championship
against David Starie (22-1) of St. Edmunds, England.
</P>
<P>
   Francis is a heavy underdog in this fight and there isn't much
on his resume to suggest that he can beat Tyson. Some reporters
here are comparing Francis' situation with that of Buster Douglas,
who knocked Tyson out in 1990 and stunned the world of boxing. But
Francis is 35 years old, and the speed of his punches can be timed
with an hourglass. Plus, he is slow of foot, which means it won't
take the 33-year-old Tyson long to track him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that Mike has been working in the gym, I can't see any
way that Julius Francis can beat him,'' Tommy Brooks, Tyson's
trainer, said.
</P>
<P>
   A short fight is not what Tyson needs at this point, but it is
probably what he will get. Since Tyson was released from prison in
1995, he has had eight fights and has fought only 28 rounds. Take
out the 11 rounds he went against Evander Holyfield in their first
bout on Nov. 9, 1996, and Tyson has gone 17 rounds in seven fights.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, particularly with the two losses to
Holyfield (the second fight ended in a disqualification in the
third round when Tyson bit Holyfield's ears), Tyson's confidence
has eroded. There is a split among those around Tyson. Some feel he
needs to step up in competition and get away from the likes of
Orlin Norris and Julius Francis. Others believe he needs a couple
of more nonthreatening opponents to build up his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mike needs is to be in top condition for his fights, and
he needs to fight regularly,'' Brooks said. ``That will build his
confidence faster than anything will. When a fighter is in
condition he believes he can do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson looks very fit for this fight. By all accounts he has been
diligent about training. So, his mind should be clearly focused on
Francis.
</P>
<P>
   In his last bout, against Norris, on Oct. 23 in Las Vegas, Tyson
was fit and looked sharper than he had in his bout on Jan. 16
against Francois Botha. But then disaster struck when Tyson clipped
Norris on the chin after the bell to end the first round. It was
ruled an accidental foul. But the bout was ruled a no contest,
because Norris said he couldn't continue fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Norris contended that he injured his knee when he fell from the
blow after the bell. And yet another Tyson bout had ended in
controversy. Nevada told him to fight elsewhere. So, Tyson crossed
the Atlantic Ocean looking for acceptance. He has found it. Now, he
has to work to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson wants to stay on the track toward a heavyweight
championship, he will have to avoid any type of misdeeds in his
bout against Francis. Another bizarre ending will undo all the good
will he has been able to build in England and derail plans for him
to make a European tour, making him a tough sell on two continents.

<P>
   LONDON _ Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams ruled out the
possibility Thursday night that the Irish Republican Army will meet
a Monday deadline for the beginning of guerrilla disarmament,
throwing the future of the fragile Northern Ireland peace
settlement into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Dashing widespread expectations that the guerrilla force his
party represents politically was ready to make a long awaited move
on weapons, Adams said, ``It is not easy to get the IRA, or indeed
any of the armed groups, to do this speedily. This is the
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure to make progress on the issue of disarmament by Monday
could bring the eight-week-old power-sharing government in Belfast
to a halt and lead to Britain's reimposing direct rule of the
conflicted province from London.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson issued a plea for
people to keep ``cool heads'' in the crisis atmosphere that was
quickly replacing the optimism that emerged in December with the
start-up of the new political institutions in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams found himself on the defensive Friday when among those
expressing alarm was Seamus Mallon, a senior official of the
largest Catholic party in Northern Ireland, the Social Democratic
and Labor Party, and a past political ally of Sinn Fein's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time of choice for the republican movement,'' Mallon
said. ``It cannot continue to claim to act on behalf of the people
of Ireland while defying their clearly expressed will that
decommissioning happen now.'' Decommissioning is the term used for
disarmament in the April 1998 peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The comment brought a rebuke Friday night from Adams, who said
it ``just flies totally in the face of what Mallon knows our party
and our party leadership have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday is the day that Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, head of
the independent international panel on decommissioning, is to issue
a progress report, and there had been growing anticipation that he
would be able to offer evidence of IRA cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin dismissed these
hopes as ``over-hyped expectations,'' and the Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency, said security sources confirmed
that the IRA had told the general that no move on weapons was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists, a Protestant party that is the province's
largest and most powerful, has indicated it will consider a report
of no progress as cause to withdraw from its leadership positions
in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the new cross border bodies
with the Republic of Ireland. That threat would put pressure on the
British government to intervene first and dismantle the fledging
government itself.
</P>
<P>
   In November, David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists and
first minister of the new Legislature, was able to persuade his
quarrelsome party to enter government with Sinn Fein only by
pledging that he and the other party members in the Assembly
leadership would step down if there was not sufficient evidence by
February of IRA willingness to put its arms beyond use.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that safety catch, he obtained only 58 percent backing
from his 860-member party council for entering the government with
Sinn Fein before any disarmament began. Many members of his party
harshly criticized his decision to abandon the long-held Unionist
``no guns, no government'' disarmament demand, and he would have
little chance of gaining support for continued Ulster Unionist
participation now in the absence of any matching IRA move on arms.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists draw support from the Protestant majority who want to
keep the province part of Britain, while republicans, most of whom
are Catholic, represent those wanting to see Ulster establish
stronger links with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists are in no mood to be conciliatory after the
British government announced last week that it planned to
reconstitute the Northern Ireland police force and retire its Royal
Ulster Constabulary name that is cherished by Protestants.
``Unionists have been stretched to and beyond limit after limit
after limit,'' Sir Reg Empey, a senior party official noted for his
moderate views, said Friday. ``Our patience is completely exhausted
in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the continual seesawing of power and favor in the politics of
Northern Ireland, it is the Unionists who are now perceived as
having made significant concessions without corresponding responses
from republicans. Since Trimble's bold gamble in November,
Unionists' frustrations have been given a more sympathetic hearing
in places like Dublin, Washington, London and Belfast, where their
resistance in the past was more often characterized as obdurate
nay-saying.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has scheduled a vote of his party in Belfast on Feb. 12,
but the British government would likely suspend the home rule
government before then, rather than see him put his leadership at
obvious risk. Trimble has been a calming and progressive force in
the Unionist camp, keeping his party engaged in the crisis-ridden
peace settlement process in the face of strong opposition from
associates who are against the accord and covet his leadership
position.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he would base his own actions on Monday's report.
``If it reveals that decommissioning is still on track, I will be
guided by that,'' he said. ``If we are going backwards in the
process, I will draw the obvious conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson has said he would suspend the assembly if the terms of
the review of the peace accord conducted last fall by former Sen.
George Mitchell are not being met. The Unionists believe the
Mitchell terms call for a start to disarmament by now, and Mallon
said Friday that he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans claim that the only deadline for disarming is the
May 2000 date in the original peace settlement, and they argue that
the IRA cease-fire, now in its third year, is proof that the
clandestine organization is committed to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Adams made his remarks Thursday night at the opening of a new
party branch in Newry on the Irish border. He told his audience
that it was ``a fundamental mistake in strategy to try and force
decommissioning,'' and he urged Unionists to show more patience.
Seeking to shift blame for a possible new failure onto them, he
said, ``The achievement of this objective has been set back by the
way it is being used as a political football by unionists at this
time.''

DAVENPORT OVERPOWERS HINGIS TO WIN OPEN, 6-1, 7-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ The women's final was 19 minutes old, and
if you were sitting near the court and leaned back, you could hear
the Australian fans who had paid their money and made their plans
telling one another what they had just witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a match; it's a beating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be against the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought?''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport was already leading by 6-1 against Martina
Hingis, ripping the ball past her and at her as if she were wearing
a target on her tennis clothes instead of patches sold to the
highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport would soon be leading by 5-1 in the second set, too,
but while Hingis would do her best to change the flow of this
lopsided match and keep her four-year winning streak in Melbourne
alive, it was ultimately akin to standing at the edge of a
waterfall with a bucket.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss phenom might still be No. 1 on the computer and
Davenport No. 2, but there is no question after Davenport's 6-1,
7-5 victory Saturday that Davenport is a better player now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost made it look easy today,'' Davenport said, shaking
her head. ``You don't play that well often in your career. It only
happens a handful of times, but you've just got to cherish it.''
</P>
<P>
   The tall and powerful Californian required only 1 hour 5 minutes
to beat Hingis for the fourth time in a row and to win her third
Grand Slam title. ``I kept looking at the time and just tried to
keep it over an hour; at least I made that,'' said Hingis, who
evened the second set at 5-5 before falling back for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too hard to play you mentally,'' Hingis said to
Davenport, her voice quavering, during the awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   That is quite an admission from the player acknowledged as the
sport's leading tactician, but it is understandable considering
that Davenport has not lost a set against Hingis (or even been
pushed to a tiebreaker) in their last four matches. The American
simply generates too much consistent pace and depth for Hingis to
put her fine tennis mind to good use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely had a lot of confidence going out there,''
Davenport said. ``You know a player doesn't like to play you when
you have that kind of record against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport has now won the U.S. Open, Wimbledon and the
Australian Open, and if she ever learns how to slide on clay, she
just might make a run at the French Open, too. ``I always thought
this was one I could win, because it was on hardcourts, and that's
what I'm most comfortable on,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis is still chasing the title at Roland Garros, too, but the
last person to defeat Hingis in singles here was Amanda Coetzer in
January 1996. Since then, she had won 27 straight matches and the
last three titles on the same Rebound Ace surface she plays on at
home in Switzerland and Florida. Hingis also had won the doubles
the last three years here, with three different partners. But her
doubles winning streak came to an end on Friday when she and Mary
Pierce were beaten in three sets in the final by the Australian
Rennae Stubbs and the American Lisa Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   And it was certainly an ominous sign for Hingis that when she
took the court under overcast skies Saturday, Stubbs and Raymond,
both friends of Davenport's, were sitting in the front row of the
players' box, just in front of Davenport's coach, Robert Van't Hof.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make this crazy job easier,'' Davenport said of Stubbs
and Raymond in her victory speech. ``We're going to have to
celebrate now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davenport saved her most emotional words for Van't Hof, the
fellow Californian who has coached her for the last four years and
helped guide her rise from a gifted and slightly ungainly contender
to a champion. ``He's been with me through everything and made all
my dreams come true,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Van't Hof, a laid-back Californian, is a generally impassive
sort on the sideline, but even he had to crack a smile or two as he
watched Davenport's overwhelming play in the first 13 games of the
match, as she cracked big ground strokes and serves and forced
Hingis to lunge too far left and right for her own good.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had ever seen her play that well, Van't Hof
responded, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been concerns about the state of Davenport's fitness
because of a strained left groin that she sustained earlier in the
tournament. The injury had caused her occasional pain in her
semifinal victory over Jennifer Capriati and caused her to retire
from the semifinals of the doubles when Hingis and Pierce jumped
out to a 5-0 lead against her and her partner, Corina Morariu.
</P>
<P>
   But Van't Hof made it clear that Davenport had retired only
because she wanted to avoid aggravating the injury, not because it
was severely restricting her movement. And though she played
Saturday with her upper left leg wrapped, it certainly did not
affect her ground strokes, serve or confidence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After decades of denials, the government is
conceding that workers who helped make nuclear weapons beginning at
the dawn of the atomic age were exposed to radiation and chemicals
that produced cancer and early death.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding _ that radiation exposure led to
higher-than-normal rates of a wide range of cancers among workers
at 14 nuclear weapons plants _ raises the prospect of compensation
to them. Although officials cautioned that any decision on that was
a long way off, they said a package could total tens of millions of
dollars for a group that might well include hundreds of families.
</P>
<P>
   The new conclusion comes from the government's most
comprehensive review of studies of worker health and raw health
data. The review accepts the conclusion of many of those studies,
some of them done under contract for the government, that workers
were made sick by their exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The finding goes far beyond an acknowledgment by the government
last July that one substance handled by weapons workers, beryllium,
had caused some of them to become ill from breathing beryllium
dust.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new conclusion, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in
an interview, ``This is the first time that the government is
acknowledging that people got cancer from radiation exposure in the
plants.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding is detailed in a draft report prepared by officials
of the Energy Department and the White House with the cooperation
of a dozen government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered the study in July, when the Energy
Department concluded that some of the workers at plants that had
supplied beryllium to the government for bomb-making had developed
beryllium disease, an incurable lung ailment. The president asked
for a broad study that would include the effects of radiation and
chemical hazards from uranium, plutonium and other substances.
</P>
<P>
   He also asked the group to develop a policy on compensation, but
that work has not been completed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Legislation proposed by Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., whose
constituents include some of the beryllium disease patients, calls
for payments to an estimated 500 to 1,000 former workers who either
have the illness or are at high risk of developing it. Total
payments in the beryllium cases could range from $15 million to $30
million a year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One question that Congress would have to resolve in the
beryllium compensation, and that would have to be addressed in any
compensation plan developed as a result of the cancer finding, is
whether to make payments to survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 57 years since the Manhattan Project began processing
radioactive materials to produce bombs, the government has until
now minimized the hazards of radiation and chemicals, criticized
epidemiological studies that raised related questions and spent
tens of millions of dollars in defending itself against lawsuits
charging that the bomb plants had made workers sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the role of government was to take a hike,''
Richardson said, ``and I think that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   One expert on nuclear weapons manufacturing, Robert Alvarez, a
former Energy Department official, welcomed the government's
conclusion that many of its critics had been correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``A review of the studies by a body impaneled by the president
is official recognition,'' Alvarez said. ``That's what makes this a
big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel J. Guttman, a lawyer for the Paper, Allied-Industrial
Chemical and Energy Workers Union, which represents workers at 11
weapons factories, said of the draft conclusions, ``That's
stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The prior story line is, `What's the big deal, the risks were
marginal,' '' said Guttman, former executive director of a
commission formed by the Clinton administration to look into
improper radiation experiments using human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Richard D. Miller, a policy analyst with the union, said the
change was remarkable because the Energy Department and its
predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, had ``spared no
resources in seeking to defeat claims'' by employees who said they
had been made sick by radiation or chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson addressed a related issue last July, describing the
problem of workers employed by private companies that had processed
beryllium for weapons use. They could rarely collect worker's
compensation, a program geared to injury rather than illness, and
in any event their symptoms or diseases frequently did not emerge
until years after their employment ended. Also, he said, the
contractors who ran the factories for the government argued that
the link to the workplace could not be demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said then that the government should pay for workers
made sick by beryllium, a toxic metal, and that radiation and
chemical exposures should be studied. That statement led to
President Clinton's request for the task force report.
</P>
<P>
   At one site that figured in the report's draft, K-25, a
now-shuttered Tennessee factory for enriching uranium, Mike Church,
the president of the Energy Workers' local, said, ``It would be a
start in the right direction, trying to get help for these people,
that the government is finally stepping forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The industrial process used at the plant exposed workers to
radiation and chemical hazards from uranium, plutonium and
fluorine. The union says workers at the plant have higher than
expected rates of leukemia, cancer of the lung and bladder, vision
problems and chronic fatigue syndrome, among other health problems.
The draft report, though, says only that workers there show more
lung cancer than the population at large. The study does not list
another plant that used the same industrial process, at Paducah,
Ky., where workers recently learned that their exposure included
plutonium as well as uranium.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The government has the names of workers and former employees who
died from cancer or other causes. Researchers using government
records have calculated the expected rates of various fatal cancers
from such groups. In some cases these rates are drawn from
epidemiological studies of general populations, in other cases they
are drawn from studies of workers in the weapons complex who have
been exposed to lower amounts of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Among 14 plants, according to the draft report, a total of 22
categories of cancer, ranging from bone to bladder to leukemia,
occurred more often than expected. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The cancers listed in the report, most of them fatal, are
presumed to be caused by radiation and chemicals, although the
report does not address the precise scientific mechanisms and does
not clearly divide between chemicals and radiation in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   It also leaves open the question of how to compensate people who
worked in the complex and suffered illnesses now found at elevated
levels among their co-workers but which may not all be
occupationally related. It also raises the prospect that workers
will get sick in years to come from past exposures. Among the other
problems, acknowledged by officials at the Energy Department, is
that records of radiation doses and other exposures are poor at
many sites.
</P>
<P>
   The cancers were found among nearly 600,000 people who have
worked in nuclear weapons production since the start of World War
II. They range from leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma to cancer of
the prostate, kidney, salivary gland and lung.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to several other operations at Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
where K-25 operated, the draft also says that elevated cancer
levels were found at Savannah River in South Carolina and Hanford,
in eastern Washington state, where plutonium was manufactured;
Rocky Flats, near Denver, where the plutonium was shaped into
weapons components, the Fernald Feed Materials Center, near
Cincinnati, where uranium was processed, and at the Lawrence
Livermore and Los Alamos national laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the findings are drawn from epidemiological studies
performed from the mid-1960s onward, some of them disavowed by the
government at the time they were published. Others are from data
gathered by the Energy Department, which now owns the plants, its
predecessor the Atomic Energy Commission, or their contractors.
None of the research was done specifically for this study, which is
due to be finished in March.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not sum up the cancers, but a senior government
official familiar with its contents and preparation, said in an
interview that ``my guess, we could be talking about hundreds of
cases, in a population of hundreds of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alvarez said that the number of victims would depend on how
many diseases are linked to radiation; if, as some epidemiologists
believe, radiation damages the human immune system and thus leaves
people vulnerable to a wide variety of diseases beyond those
cancers usually associated with radiation, then the number could
rise to the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The draft, however, explicitly states that the scientific
questions of causation were outside the task force's mandate.

SEVEN STRAIGHT FOR PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The tools of winning aren't always a paint
brush and canvas. Sometimes a hard hat and hammer are required.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Pepperdine needed the heavy-duty stuff. The result
might not have been a thing of beauty, but the Waves' 69-58 West
Coast Conference victory over visiting San Francisco sure looks
pretty in the win-loss column.
</P>
<P>
   These days, that's all that matters for surging Pepperdine
(15-5, 5-0), now in the midst of a season-high seven-game winning
streak after starting WCC play with five straight victories for the
first time since 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (13-5, 1-4), a preseason favorite to challenge for
the conference crown, is fading fast after losing four of five
games. At one point this year, the Dons won 12 straight and
threatened to crack the top-25 national rankings.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Armstrong and Tezale Archie each had 14 points to lead
Pepperdine. Tommie Prince added 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Dons got 10 points each from Darrell Tucker, Kenyon Jones
and Russell Hinder, but turned the ball over 24 times. They were
particularly careless in the second half, turning it over 14 times
while wilting under Pepperdine's fullcourt press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach told us at halftime we weren't pressuring like we
were supposed to,'' Prince said. ``So what we tried to do was bring
out the pressure on their guards, then things started to fall into
place. They got the turnover and we started to get the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco led 30-29 after a sloppy first half and the Waves
were fortunate to be that close after finishing on a 6-0 run.
Armstrong, who had 12 points in the half, capped the run off with a
3-pointer in the final seconds. Kelvin Gibbs also had a big
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to close the gap and try not to go into the half down
too much,'' Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff said. ``Then we
hit the back-to-back 3s to cut it to one. I thought that was a key
part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams combined for 20 turnovers in the first half, and
neither club shot particularly well. Pepperdine made 11 of 26 shots
and misfired on 9 of 15 3-pointers. The Waves were even worse at
the free throw line, making just 3 of 8.
</P>
<P>
   The Dons were slightly better, connecting on 12 of 28 from the
field, including 2 of 6 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Hinder had seven points to lead San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The erratic play wasn't surprising. San Francisco and Pepperdine
are the top two defensive teams in the conference, giving up 63.5
and 63.9 points per game, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was Pepperdine's ability to settle down
offensively in the second half, especially over the first 10
minutes, when it outscored the Dons 18-5 to take a 47-37 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By cutting down the turnovers and increasing their shooting
percentage, the Waves defense, always a strength, became even more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were giving them a lot of respect (in the first half),''
Prince said. ``We weren't playing like we practiced the whole week,
the way we were supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   That clearly changed in the second half for Pepperdine, which
hosts Santa Clara today at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have never been (down) in the first place,'' Prince
said. ``We should have come out playing hard from the get go.''

 FORBES PUSHES IMAGE AS CONSERVATIVE ALTERNATIVE TO BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (REORGANIZES last 7 grafs to ADD quotes)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ As Steve Forbes plies the narrow, snowy roads
here selling his conservative message, a second campaign is going
on behind the scenes, led by a formidable grass-roots organization
that is aiming especially at three crucial New Hampshire groups:
Catholics, anti-tax activists and gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Forbes is meeting with Cardinal Bernard Law, the
archbishop of Boston, to discuss abortion; telling the Gun Owners
of New Hampshire of his love of skeet shooting, or gaining the
support of top officials of the 10,000-member Granite State
Taxpayers Association, the state's largest anti-tax group, the
Forbes organization is hitting all the buttons on issues critical
to New Hampshire conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   This tripartite group, which the Forbes campaign began
organizing as far back as last March, is made up of people like
Emile Beaulieu of Goffstown, a conservative activist who
unsuccessfully ran for governor of New Hampshire in 1998 and is now
promoting Forbes to his vast network of conservative friends.
</P>
<P>
   Beaulieu has been making phone calls, putting up signs and
speaking on behalf of Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes believes in God, family and morality, and he
doesn't owe lobbyists anything,'' Beaulieu said. ``That's what I'm
telling people, and people around here know and trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up Forbes as the conservative alternative to
front-runner George W. Bush is the cornerstone of the Forbes
strategy, both in New Hampshire and throughout the country. The
campaign's task is to build on Forbes' strong second-place showing
in Iowa and establish him as someone who can not only dent Bush,
but also be considered a viable presidential candidate, even though
he has never held public office.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign is less concerned about Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who they feel will drop from the pack, a victim of a lack
of financing and his decision to enter only a handful of primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not our target,'' William Dal Col, the Forbes campaign
manager, said of McCain. ``We're going after the front-runner. If
he has a significant falloff, people are going to question whether
he's up to the task.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, a grass-roots effort brought in many new conservative
supporters, and Forbes is trying to re-create that success in New
Hampshire, but with adaptations to account for the state's
different political and social culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the potential for Steve to do well with the
disenfranchised,'' said Paul Young, the Forbes campaign's senior
political adviser for New Hampshire. ``Many of these people are
independent. Many of them are Democrats who have become
Republicans. Many are cynical. We have the potential to give a
different message to these independent voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Iowa Republicans are dominated by Christian conservatives
_ more than 40 percent of Iowa Republicans called themselves born
again _ New Hampshire is more than 40 percent Catholic. Of course,
many Catholics do not adhere to the church's anti-abortion stand,
and the state is about equally divided between abortion-rights
advocates and anti-abortion campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Forbes has taken a more subtle approach on
abortion. Gone are surprise visits from anti-abortion activists
like Phyllis Schlafly. In their place are more muted statements
about the sanctity of life and a ``New Birth of Freedom'' message
that includes the ``freedom to be born'' refrain Forbes repeats at
every stop.
</P>
<P>
   The state's formidable anti-tax organizations are the second
part of the equation. This is a state with no income tax and no
sales tax _ a place where every candidate signs an anti-tax pledge.
</P>
<P>
   To anti-tax activists here, Forbes' call for a flat income tax
is a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes has the best tax plan in place, he's been the
most consistent of all candidates,'' said George Lovejoy, president
of the Granite State Taxpayers Association and a former state
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other candidate like him,'' Lovejoy said. ``He's
been steady and hasn't vacillated. This is something we knew about
him in advance. He's not one to switch back and forth. We are using
our influence wherever we can.''
</P>
<P>
   That means providing membership lists to the Forbes campaign,
inviting Forbes volunteers to speak at meetings of anti-tax
activists, helping with a direct-mail campaign directed at anti-tax
voters and taking out ads in local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do whatever he asks us to do,'' Lovejoy said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 people belong to the Gun Owners of New
Hampshire, and, while the organization does not make endorsements,
Forbes has the backing of many of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Gun owners are a significant part of our base,'' said Dal Col,
the Forbes campaign manager. ``They are strong activists, they vote
and they turn out the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Forbes has been a frequent speaker at meetings of
gun owners groups.
</P>
<P>
   At a group's recent forum, Forbes told a story about how when he
was young, ``I desperately wanted a shotgun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was skeptical,'' he con- tinued, but after
persisting he got one. His father told him having the gun was a
lesson in responsibility, and, Forbes said, ``It's a lesson that
children in the future should have a chance to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes has gone out of his way to talk to us,'' said
Craig Peter- son, president of the gun group. &QL;

THEY'RE NO. 2, BUT READY IN A SNAP 
</HEADLINE>

 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Neil O'Donnell was heading to the Newark, N.J.,
airport for a trip to Nashville, Tenn., last summer. He told his
friends in Madison, N.J., that he was going to play for the
Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People back home in New Jersey didn't even know who they
were,'' O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh, they knew. New York, they knew. Cincinnati, they
knew. The soft-spoken O'Donnell had played in those hard-edged
cities, even advancing to a Super Bowl once.
</P>
<P>
   And while O'Donnell was thinking about his next career move,
quarterback Paul Justin was being asked to join the St. Louis Rams.
At least Justin knew the team's quarterback, Kurt Warner, who was a
star in the Arena Football League and NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``His background was my background,'' Justin said.
</P>
<P>
   So here are the backup quarterbacks for the Super Bowl teams:
two players winding up as unlikely endnotes. O'Donnell and Justin
got to know each other in 1998 when they played in Cincinnati,
where quarterbacks go to learn how to deal with defeat.
</P>
<P>
   What are the odds of two backup quarterbacks for the Bengals
winding up in the Super Bowl a year later?
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell plays behind the chronically aching Steve McNair,
whose turf toe injury is so painful that in training camp O'Donnell
took almost every snap. Even this week _ as he did last week and
the week before _ O'Donnell took half of the snaps in practice to
help him get ready in case McNair can't stand the pain any longer.
O'Donnell posted a 4-1 record this season as a starter when a back
injury sidelined McNair.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Justin watches in wonder at Warner's performance.
Warner threw 41 touchdown passes this season, a number only Dan
Marino has surpassed, and was named the National Football League's
most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done mostly mop-up,'' Justin said, ``but I ran the team
when I was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he took no snaps this week, just like last week and the
week before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get any snaps,'' he said. ``I know the position from
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, O'Donnell's career had been going downhill since he
joined the Jets in 1996, presumably in his prime. He was fresh off
leading the Steelers to a Super Bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Donnell saw the Jets crash to a 1-15 record in 1996 and
suffered a hamstring injury when he was backpedaling during a
pregame warmup. Then he went through a demeaning season in 1997
under Bill Parcells, who never demonstrated unwavering confidence
in O'Donnell, a former Pro Bowl player.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, O'Donnell was in Cincinnati, and then this season he
became a Titan. He was actually familiar with the Titans, who were
the Houston Oilers when he played against them twice a year as the
Steelers' quarterback in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a new start,'' O'Donnell said. ``Sometimes in this
business you have to put things behind you. Football became fun
again. That's what it's all about: working hard every day, and then
winning Sunday. I once told myself if I don't have fun week in and
week out, get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, four years after a loss to the Dallas Cowboys in the Super
Bowl, the 33-year-old O'Donnell returns to the title game. He is so
happy in Nashville that he talks of moving to Music City, of ending
his career playing for coach Jeff Fisher, of living in a city that
he knew little about.
</P>
<P>
   So is he becoming a country and western music fan, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow, real slow,'' O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to a solid NFL career enjoyed by O'Donnell, Justin,
who was undrafted out of Arizona State, has started only 10 NFL
games going back to a season on the sideline with Chicago in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the gap in 1992 and 1993 when he sat out. If one
wanted to see him play over the next few years one went indoors to
see the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena League, or to Frankfurt,
Germany, and what was then the World League.
</P>
<P>
   The Arena League, Justin said, taught him to recognize defenses
quickly and move smartly across a 50-yard-long field that has only
eight players a side. When he made it to Europe, Justin was
starting on a big playing field. His experiences as starter gave
him the confidence to believe he can get things done if the
unthinkable happens to Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand I can go in at any time,'' the 31-year-old Justin
said. ``That's my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   That career included four seasons with the Colts, two seasons in
Frankfurt and a chance to throw 14 passes this season. But you
cannot take that away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love football,'' Justin said. ``It's kept me going. And if
you try to take it away, I'll knock your head off.''

NFL COMMISSIONER TRIES TO CAST PLAYERS IN A BETTER LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The National Football League has found itself in an
unwelcome spotlight at various times this season because of violent
incidents that led to criminal charges against its players. In the
case that drew the most attention, Rae Carruth, a wide receiver for
the Carolina Panthers, was charged with murder, accused of
orchestrating the drive-by shooting of a woman who had become
pregnant while they were dating.
</P>
<P>
   So the subject of violence seemed unavoidable when commissioner
Paul Tagliabue delivered his annual status report to the news media
Friday, and indeed, Tagliabue did not try to steer clear of it.
While acknowledging that he would prefer to preside over a league
in which no players had been accused of violent crimes, he said
professional football players, despite public perception, had
behaved better than society at large.
</P>
<P>
   The behavior of NFL players was one of several subjects the
commissioner discussed. Other topics included the continued
scarcity of black head coaches, a perceived decline in
sportsmanship and the status of the instant replay, which Tagliabue
said he liked this season while admitting that it might need some
tweaking.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue's address took place against a backdrop of remarkable
prosperity for the league. Buyers are lining up to pay hundreds of
millions of dollars for franchises, cities are clamoring to bring
football to their back yards and players are making more money than
ever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet one thing that continues to dog the NFL is the perception
that its players, because they play a violent sport, are prone to
rage off the field. That notion, Tagliabue said, is false.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track record of our players is far better than society at
large,'' Tagliabue said, ``and any number of studies have shown
that clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   APBnews.com, a Web site that focuses on crime news, recently did
a criminal background check of all players on the teams playing in
Super Bowl XXXIV, the St. Louis Rams and the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   According to APBnews.com, the Titans have six players who have
been charged in the past with criminal offenses, and the Rams have
seven. The Web site said players with criminal records include the
Rams' Tony Horne, who pleaded guilty in 1992 to a misdemeanor drug
charge; the Rams' Justin Watson, who pleaded guilty in 1994 to
theft and paid a $100 fine; and the Titans' Lorenzo Neal, who
pleaded no contest in 1995 to a drug charge.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent conviction involves the Rams' Leonard Little,
who pleaded guilty in 1998 to involuntary manslaughter in a
drunken-driving case in which a woman was killed. He was sentenced
to 90 days in jail, and Tagliabue suspended him for eight games.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the league has had to deal with _ a perception that
its players commit lots of crimes. Yet the reality may be
different. For instance, an article last year by Alfred Blumstein
and Jeff Benedict in Chance magazine, which is published by the
American Statistical Association, reported that the crime rate
among professional football players was much lower than that among
other people of the same age and racial background overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tolerate and we don't condone misconduct,'' said
Tagliabue. ``We do strike a balance with giving people a second
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue also commented on the recent trend in which a head
coach retires and handpicks a friend on the staff as his successor.
It happened in Miami with Jimmy Johnson and Dave Wannstedt, in New
York with Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick, and it will probably
happen in St. Louis when Dick Vermeil retires and hands over the
reigns to his offensive coordinator, Mike Martz.
</P>
<P>
   None of those situations include a black coach. In addition,
such highly qualified black assistants as Atlanta's offensive line
coach, Art Shell, have received little interest from teams with
head coaching vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue countered, ``The reality is one-third of all coaches
are African-American and a growing number of coordinators are
African-American.''
</P>
<P>
   On the decline of sportsmanship, both during games and after
them, Tagliabue and others in the league office have grown
concerned. After St. Louis beat Tampa Bay in the National Football
Conference title game, Rams cornerback Devin Bush and Buccaneers
lineman Frank Middleton got into a scuffle that has led to an
investigation by the St. Louis police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned with what seems to be deteriorating
conduct,'' Tagliabue said, asserting that such actions were
juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   This season the league banned the controversial throat-slashing
gesture. In the off-season, the competition committee may look for
ways to further penalize players who go too far.

SHAQ GETS REST IN EASY WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ A three-day break gave the Los Angeles Lakers
the rest they needed. A third-quarter knockout earned them a rare
break during the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was all about fresh starts and fresh legs Friday night at
Staples Center, as the Lakers _ off for three days after a
devastating overtime loss at Utah _ bullied the Milwaukee Bucks
into early submission, then cruised to a 117-89 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal staked them to an early lead with a 26-point
first half and, for the first time in a long time, got a long ride
on the bench, sitting the last nine minutes of the game. O'Neal's
33 minutes were his lowest in weeks, but he finished with a
game-high 30 points, eight rebounds, four assists and four blocked
shots. His efficient evening included 13-for-18 shooting and a
4-for-5 night at the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant (23 points) and Glen Rice (19 points) also took most
of the fourth quarter off, as coach Phil Jackson turned the game
over to seldom-used Devean George, Travis Knight and John Salley.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper finished with a season-high 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the Lakers' brief losing skid (two games) was
over. They never seemed in danger of suffering their first
three-game losing streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They shot 52.9 percent, the double-digit lead was established by
halftime and the Bucks only once cut it to single digits, early in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's 26-point first half propelled the Lakers to a 67-55
halftime lead, but he had ample assistance. Harper dished out nine
assists _ a Lakers season high for one half, and his personal high
this season _ as the offense hummed to a 65.9 percent shooting
clip.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal made 11 of 13 shots from the field and was 4 of 5 from
the foul line to go with five rebounds and three blocked shots
before the break.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Rice also clicked early, scoring 16 and 10 points
respectively in the half.
</P>
<P>
   But it took a late charge in the second quarter for the Lakers
to get that double-digit breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the Bucks matched the Lakers basket for basket and
briefly took a one-point lead 48-47 midway through the second
quarter. Then O'Neal exploded for 11 points in less than three
minutes to fuel a 16-5 Laker run to close out the half.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was 6 for 7 in the second quarter and got four of his
buckets on passes from Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lakers had lost four of their last six games, they've
maintained their confidence throughout and it was only a matter of
time before their precision returned to previous levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all know that we played good enough to win in three
of those four losses,'' Jackson said, explaining the Lakers' good
spirits this week. ``Those things happen in the course of a season,
and you take those things, you don't let them multiply, you don't
let it break down your will or your ability to believe in
yourselves as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was prevalent throughout the ranks, even after
back-to-back losses to Western Conference rivals Portland and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've been through enough wars that they know this
is part of things that happen in the course of a season,'' Jackson
said. ``We feel confident that we've been in places to win
ballgames, and how do you throw out the baby with the bath water
when you lose ballgames that are close? That's part of
basketball.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 29:
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans? The St. Louis Rams? Who are these guys?
There is something atonal, and vaguely counterfeit, about the names
of the two teams that on Sunday evening will play each other in
Super Bowl XXXIV for the National Football League championship.
After all, weren't the Titans the Houston Oilers for 37 years,
until they migrated to Tennessee two years ago? Weren't the St.
Louis Rams for 50 years the Los Angeles Rams?
</P>
<P>
   All true. But what is equally true is that these teams, wherever
they came from, deserve to be where they are now. Both lost only
three games all season, both have quality players and good coaches.
Both also represent a new generation of upstarts in the NFL, a
group that includes teams like the Jacksonville Jaguars, the
Carolina Panthers and the Indianapolis Colts. The traditional
powers _ teams like the Green Bay Packers, the Dallas Cowboys, the
San Francisco 49ers, the Buffalo Bills, the Denver Broncos _ made
little impact in the playoffs this year or did not get there at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Some people put the blame for this state of affairs on
``parity,'' another word for league-wide mediocrity, and nobody has
yet confused these two teams with, say, the 49er dynasty of the
1980s. Even so, it's nice to see some new faces at playoff time. We
already know what the Packers' Brett Favre looks like, and what the
49ers' Jerry Rice can do. It is time now to bring on the Titans'
Steve McNair, only the second black quarterback in the 34-year
history of the Super Bowl, or the Rams' Kurt Warner, who knocked
around in football's equivalent of the bush leagues before making
it to the big time. It is time to watch what Orlando Pace, the
Rams' massive young offensive tackle, and Jevon Kearse, the Titans'
overpowering pass rusher, as fast as he is big, can do. And who
knows? We might have a genuinely exciting Super Bowl.

A FRESH(MAN) START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Matthew Kredell  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was one out in the bottom of the eighth
inning and the Cal State Northridge baseball team needed something
to salvage its season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Down by four runs to Nevada with the bases empty, coach Mike
Batesole removed senior Adrian Mendoza, deciding to give freshman
Aaron McKenzie his first NCAA at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get in there and get me a double,`` Batesole said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that a freshman's job is to do what the coach says,
McKenzie did just that, launching a drive high off the right-field
wall to ignite a six-run inning as the Matadors won 8-6 in front of
537 fans at Matador Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, I'm going to tell him to hit a home run,`` Batesole
joked.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bold move to go with the freshman at one of the game's
crucial moments, especially considering Mendoza was 2 for 2. But
Batesole has no reservations about going with underclassmen (three
freshmen and four sophomores started the opener). Nor does he have
much of a choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors are recovering from the three-month elimination of
the baseball program in the summer of 1997. The recruiting class
from that year, who would now be juniors, suffered from the
program's uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him do it in batting practice a lot,`` Batesole said
of McKenzie. ``He had two strikes on him and worked it to a full
count those weren't freshman at-bats.``
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie finished off what he started, singling in second
basemen Eric Horvat to complete CSUN's rally. He wasn't the only
underclassmen to get into the act.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore third baseman Jason Gorman followed McKenzie's double
with one of his own, scoring McKenzie. One out later, three
consecutive walks issued by losing pitcher George Moran (0-1) added
another run. Horvat, who homered in the fifth inning, lined a
single into right to bring the Matadors within one.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Stotts, a sophomore shortstop, then gave CSUN its first
lead since the fourth inning, nearly taking the pitcher's head off
with a hard liner up the middle, scoring two.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed starter Mike Frick, CSUN's ace, sailed into the
fourth inning but was then rocked for six runs on seven consecutive
hits, including back-to-back home runs by Nevada first baseman Don
Price and third baseman Alex Rangel. He allowed six runs, five
earned, in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Dunn (1-0) picked up the win with 2 innings of scoreless
ball. Left-hander Andy Davidson pitched the ninth and picked up the
save, striking out the final two batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a good statement,`` McKenzie said. ``Nevada was
a ranked team (No. 30 in Baseball America). It was an awesome way
to start the season.''

EDITORIAL: SOVIET-STYLE POLITICS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 29:
</P>
<P>
   New York's Republican presidential primary March 7 has not been
attracting the kind of national attention that state party leaders
had hoped. Instead of becoming a key early vote in the presidential
nominating process, New York's Republican primary now makes news as
a national embarrassment. The reason is that Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and his New York henchmen _ Gov. George Pataki and the
Republican Party chairman, William Powers _ have indulged in a
shameful display of Soviet-style politics. In the name of
protecting New York's voters from extraneous candidates, they are
now battling in a variety of federal and state courts to force out
candidates who are challenging their own favorite _ Bush.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing in federal court Friday, Bush's competitors are
encouraged about the possibility that District Court Judge Edward
Korman of Brooklyn will declare the state's Republican primary
system unconstitutional, given the tangle of rules concocted by
party leaders to limit competition by invalidating ballot petitions
from candidates. Without such judicial relief from a Bush-rigged
election, only about a dozen of the 31 congressional districts in
the state are currently certain to give voters a full choice among
the three Republican candidates who tried to get their names on the
state's ballots. Besides Bush, they are S. John McCain and Steve
Forbes. Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer took one look at New York's
despotic rules and gave the state a pass, although Keyes, who did
surprisingly well in the Iowa caucuses, is hoping the federal court
will order his name on the state's ballots.
</P>
<P>
   So far Forbes has spent more than $750,000 to get the necessary
signatures in all the state's districts, or about $15 per
signature. McCain, the main target of Bush's New York bouncers, has
managed to stay on ballots in only about half the state's
congressional districts. Forbes, miffed that Bush supporters on
Long Island have tried to block his name from ballots there, has
retaliated by asking a state court to determine whether the Bush
team committed fraud while gathering signatures in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   A whole string of Bush supporters in the Bronx, whose
handwriting seemed astonishingly similar, apparently signed
petitions using their last names first, much in the same manner as
the official voter registration list. A system like California's,
which requires no signatures for well-known candidates, would
eliminate such nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the recipient of New York's electoral largess, Bush,
has come up with a lame justification of the machinations that
benefit him _ states' rights. Just as he has ceded the tough
questions about use of the Confederate flag in South Carolina to
South Carolinians, Bush has said New York's ballot controversy is
best handled by New York's Republican leaders. This is not
leadership, it is ducking the issue.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for Bush to call off his ballot gladiators. It is
also time for Pataki to stop pandering to Bush and to start
lobbying the state Legislature to clear up this undemocratic mess
by March 7. If he will not do so, there is no reason the
Legislature cannot take action on its own.

EDITORIAL: AUSTRIA'S EXTREMIST TEMPTATION 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Governments across Europe and beyond are rightly alarmed that
the far-right, xenophobic Freedom Party is about to be invited to
take part in Austria's next government. Austria's two other main
parties, the Socialists and the conservative People's Party, could
have kept Freedom out of power, either by continuing their
13-year-old power-sharing arrangement or by permitting the largest
party, the Socialists, to form a minority government. But agreement
could not be reached on either approach and now the conservatives
appear close to sealing a coalition deal with the Freedom Party and
its demagogic leader, Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Party has risen to the cusp of power by calling for
the expulsion of immigrants in language that deliberately echoes
Nazi phraseology. Haider has also praised Hitler's labor policies,
described Nazi concentration camps as legitimate punishment camps
and glorified veterans of the murderous SS. Haider has since
apologized for some of his remarks and insisted on his party's
democratic credentials. But he has not been convincing. The Freedom
Party's rhetoric, and the racist thinking behind it, has no place
in the government of a European democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The party's rise to power in Austria is particularly disturbing
because of that country's long history of anti-Semitism and its
wartime collaboration with Hitler. Austrian voters seem remarkably
indifferent to world opinion. They elected Kurt Waldheim as their
president in 1986, even after it was clear that he had lied to
cover up his activities as a German army officer in the Balkans
during World War II. Waldheim's election to the largely figurehead
post of president was regrettable. Allowing Haider's party to play
a decisive role in government would be far worse.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by Haider's energetic and reckless populism, the
Freedom Party has become a growing political force in Austria. It
finished in second place in October elections with 27 percent of
the vote, slightly more than the mainstream conservatives. That
performance entitles it to a strong voice in parliament. But no
principle of democracy obliges other parties to invite Haider's
hate-mongering into government. &QL;

WITHOUT DOME, SEATTLE'S SUPER BOWL AMBITIONS ALL WET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue held his annual Super
Bowl state-of-the-league address Friday. Here are the things I
learned:
</P>
<P>
   1. Seattle will never host a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   No one is exactly blaming Atlanta. This city has more
hotel/motel rooms than any other place in America, including Aurora
Avenue North. It also has the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   So Atlanta fits almost all the important criteria for hosting a
Super Bowl, even if we were all miserably misled about the
opportunity for a little sunshine and warm breezes, to go along
with all the Lite beer being swilled down here.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to weather.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, sporting a zippy sense of humor, talked at
length about weather, since frosty Atlanta has made the issue as
big, probably bigger, than whether the Titans can shut down the
Rams' warp-speed offense.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, the pick here is the Titans, 27-24. Steve McNair is
tough. Jevon Kearse is a freak. Eddie George can rumble. Jeff
Fisher has turned these vagabonds into a tight team.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of the Weather Channel,'' Tagliabue said. ``It
enjoys high ratings thanks to people like me who have to travel.
And there is always a lot of talk about La Nina and El Nino and
rotating cold water in the gulf that spawns storm systems and,
really, what it comes down to is that you really can't predict the
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   He then concluded, with great insight, that wintery conditions
across the Eastern seaboard have all but debunked wishful-thinking
theories that ``global warming will make for sunny Sundays in
January.''
</P>
<P>
   Ergo, Seattle, with a new outdoor football stadium about to be
built, will continue to have trouble convincing the NFL that a
Super Bowl experience should include driving sheets of rain or an
out-and-out monsoon.
</P>
<P>
   I've been to a few Super Bowls; Seattle should be very proud for
taking itself out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   2. The NFL has replaced the NBA as the darling of corporate
success and continues to shame baseball into stepping up its
efforts toward parity.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the NFL's ``same chance, serious hope'' campaign for
Super Bowl potential. That's what Tagliabue did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a system that works for all teams, no matter what size
the city or how big the television market. To win a Super Bowl,
it's not about who has the most money or who's playing in what
city,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is in a position to compete, to put a team together
and have a coach lead you to the Super Bowl. The quality of our
system is demonstrated this year with these two talented teams,
whose combined record is 31-6.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Rams and Titans are proof that the old dynasty days
of the NFL are all but dead and gone. And the system is not going
to change.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue called Denver coach Mike Shanahan's proposal for a
Larry Bird-type salary cap exemption for NFL teams, ``for the
birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Though NBA teams can go over their salary cap by signing their
own free agents to big-money deals, the NFL has no intention of
softening its cap to let teams keep free agents.
</P>
<P>
   3. The NFL understands Internet madness.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue promised the NFL will keep on top of revenue
opportunities, especially with the promise of broadband capability
and the convergence of TV, cable, phone and Internet services,
which will change the way the NFL distributes games to its fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates talks about the Internet as the new neighborhood
front stoop. We'll have to take advantage of that,'' Tagliabue
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in quoting the computer guru, Tagliabue failed to
mention that no one ever charged you money to sit on your own front
stoop.
</P>
<P>
   4. Wall Street isn't alone in dissing overvalued Internet
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the potential for offering stock shares of the
NFL, Tagliabue took a crack at the likes of start-up companies
whose stock values are, basically, a house of cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some revenues associated with our league, so we don't
have an attractive business. You have higher multiples if you don't
have any revenues,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an Amazon.com stockholder, that was a big, fat
``Ouch.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Bad boys won't be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL was hardly immune to bad behavior this season, what with
the throat-slashing gestures, the Rae Carruth murder charges and
the Rams-Bucs postgame altercations.
</P>
<P>
   But there was time for praise Friday. The NFL now honors its
player of the year with the Walter Payton Award, and yesterday,
Vikings receiver Cris Carter was the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue praised Carter for his work on the field and off,
where No. 80 serves willingly as a role model in the community and
among his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing about it? Soon after Payton's death on Nov. 1 at
age 45 from liver failure, Carter watched his young teammate, Randy
Moss, write Payton's No. 34 on his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the NFL would fine him $5,000, but he did what he felt was
right,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, dictatorial on patches, logos, shirt tails and sock
length, said it only fined Moss once, for writing Payton's number
on a rally towel during a Monday Night Football game.
</P>
<P>
   There's a time and place for remembering fallen stars. And in
the league of absolute authority, the commissioner's office will
let you know when you're out of bounds.

TWO COACHES BEAT ODDS TO REACH ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jeff Fisher had played five seasons with the Chicago
Bears when an ankle injury ensured he would not make it six.
</P>
<P>
   Only 27, his life had reached a premature crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   Then Buddy Ryan called. The new coach of the Philadelphia
Eagles, who had been Fisher's defensive coordinator with the Bears,
was offering him a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned him down over the period of a week after the Super
Bowl was over,'' Fisher, now coach of the Tennessee Titans, said of
that fateful phone call in 1986 after the Bears had won the
championship. ``I re-thought it and took the job.''
</P>
<P>
   It took, however, a hefty dose of the kind of prodding only the
cantankerous Ryan could provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not certain at that point that I was finished playing,
and I said that in so many words to Buddy,'' Fisher said. ``He
said, `You and Julie getting married yet?' I said, `Yeah, this
spring. Why?' He said, `Why don't you tell your fiancee to throw
you a retirement party? You're done. You can't play anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil had won a Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles
in 1981, but also coined a phrase in doing so: Coaching burnout.
</P>
<P>
   Weary and wrung out after seven seasons as an NFL head coach, he
left the sideline after the 1982 season and moved into the TV booth
as an analyst _ a gig that lasted 14 years. Vermeil thought he had
discovered post-coaching Nirvana. He was living in a log cabin on a
110-acre ranch and, as he puts it, ``Stealing for a living by
broadcasting games.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, something was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a time within those 14 years that I didn't think
about coming back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil had ample opportunity. As each season passed, the number
of coaches fired increased. In most cases, his name would pop up on
the short list of possible replacements.
</P>
<P>
   But he was able to resist until 1997, when St. Louis general
manager John Shaw called about the Rams' vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I said no,'' Vermeil said. ``Then I recognized that
there was still a fire burning to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Two coaches who, at the start of the season, were given next to
no chance of standing on opposite sidelines at Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly where Fisher and Vermeil will be Sunday _ if
not for the exact same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between 63-year-old Vermeil and 41-year-old
Fisher is perhaps most evident in the way they treat players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe players have changed,'' Fisher said this week. ``Ten
years ago, you could tell a team to line up on the goal line after
practice and run 10 100-yard dashes and they'd do it. Now you tell
them to do it and they ask, `Why?' That's the difference in the
athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson Vermeil had to learn.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in St. Louis, he brought with him an old-school
philosophy that had worked so well during his first tour of duty in
the NFL. Vermeil worked his players hard _ too hard, by the
standards of the modern-day player. The Rams came close to a mutiny
last season before Vermeil backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things stand out in my mind,'' Rams cornerback Todd Lyght
said of the change in his coach. ``We don't have the 3{-hour
practices we had before. We don't continually bang on each other
like we did. We used to wear pads all the way up to Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wore us down. Before games, guys would be in the locker
room sleeping, totally exhausted from a week's preparation. We
don't have that problem anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is how Fisher and Vermeil perceive their
players.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was an NFL player and never coached at any level other
than the NFL. He still looks young enough to play, and if you doubt
that for a instant, just remember this: Fisher and Titans guard
Bruce Matthews played together at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just an unbelievable player's coach,'' Titans tight end
Frank Wycheck said of Fisher. ``He's played the game, so obviously
he knows what we go through on a day-to-day basis. Right off the
bat, you have to respect the guy, just for the mere fact that he
knows what he's talking about. He's just a great leader and a great
player's coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil takes a grandfatherly approach, which is understandable
since he and his wife, Carol, have children older than any of his
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This football team is my wife's and my family, really,''
Vermeil said yesterday. ``We sort of feel like they are our young
kids, and we really make an effort of coaching them in every thing
they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think even in the National Football League you have to coach
the total person,'' added Vermeil, who developed this philosophy
while coaching his way from high school, to junior college, to
major college to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another difference is who Fisher and Vermeil are coaching.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are basically a home-grown group, which might sound
strange, considering they have had four different home fields in
each of the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher and general manager Floyd Reese have done a good job
of not only drafting players, but keeping them and developing them.
</P>
<P>
   Their vagabond existence has only served to bond a team that
enters the game Sunday just as it has each game this season _ with
a very large we-get-no-respect chip on their shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has been the primary adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coached in the league for 17 years, and I probably coached
with 10 or 12 guys who would have had nervous breakdowns going
through what we went through,'' Reese said. ``Had Jeff not been
young and laid-back like he is, he probably would have reached for
the gun at some point, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was brutal. There were so many issues and things you had to
deal that didn't have to do with winning, yet you had to deal with
them. Had Jeff not dealt with them so well, the whole thing
probably would have imploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil, meanwhile, has rebuilt the Rams. Only five players
remain from the team that moved from Los Angeles to St. Louis in
1995, and just nine are still around from the roster Vermeil
inherited.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely the closest team that I've been around,''
said Rams defensive tackle Ray Agnew, one of those new players
Vermeil has used to piece together this Super Bowl team. ``That was
Vermeil's plan, to get guys that love one another and want to be
around one another. He got the people he wanted, just like the
people he had in Philadelphia when they went to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all their differences, this unlikely pair has reached
the same destination with the same goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one thing that is important in the National
Football League now _ winning,'' Vermeil said. ``If you don't win,
it doesn't matter what happened or how great a coach you are, the
perception is you're an idiot.''

DOMAIN SALE FETCHES $3 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jason Z. Cohen  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Marcelo Siero's investment of a few minutes' time
-- and no money -- became a huge payday when he sold the Internet
address loans.com for $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley computer consultant so far is the big winner
in Universal City-based GreatDomains.com's online auction of three
names expected to fetch at least six-figure prices.
</P>
<P>
   Bids for the other two names, taxes.com and cinema.com came in
at $400,000 and $530,000, respectively. Those deals were still
being negotiated late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains representatives declined to release the name of the
winning bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Siero, who registered loans.com for free in 1993, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   His payout falls short of the highest price paid to date for a
single domain name. The record is held by Santa Monica-based
eCompanies, which paid $7.5 million for business.com last November.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tinsley, chief executive officer of GreatDomains.com, said
the winning bidder stands to bring in great revenue with such a
strong online identity. Tinsley said the bidder is a large public
company, but he declined to go into greater detail.
</P>
<P>
   Siero of San Jose registered the domain name, the Internet
equivalent of an address, before the Internet Network Information
Center began charging people for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the process is managed by Network Solutions, which
charges users $35 per year to register domain names. Registrants
pay for the first two years initially.
</P>
<P>
   That small investment can pay huge dividends, as Friday's sale
illustrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making millionaires of people who spend $70 at the right
time,'' Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   While some domain names sell for a combination of cash and
equity or a promise of future profits, the sale of loans.com was an
all-cash deal, Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is $3 million right now,'' Tinsley said. ``That's a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   As the auction wound down, about 20 people gathered in the
company's office, five of them working the phones to try to squeeze
as much out of the sale as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The end result was somewhat deflating since the selling price of
loans.com was forecast to be in the range of the fee for
business.com.
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains gets a cut of between 7 percent and 20 percent of
Siero's money for marketing and administering the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Paying more than $1 million for what amounts to an address is
increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price paid is either absurd or it's not -- depending on
your point of view,'' Clay Rider, vice president and chief analyst
for Zona Research in Redwood City, said last week. ``What they
spend on advertising them far outstrips the amount of money paid
for the name.''

the winning bidder stands to bring in great revenue with such a
strong online identity. Tinsley said the bidder is a large public
company, but he declined to go into greater detail.
</P>
<P>
   Siero of San Jose registered the domain name, the Internet
equivalent of an address, before the Internet Network Information
Center began charging people for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the process is managed by Network Solutions, which
charges users $35 per year to register domain names. Registrants
pay for the first two years initially.
</P>
<P>
   That small investment can pay huge dividends, as Friday's sale
illustrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making millionaires of people who spend $70 at the right
time,'' Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   While some domain names sell for a combination of cash and
equity or a promise of future profits, the sale of loans.com was an
all-cash deal, Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is $3 million right now,'' Tinsley said. ``That's a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   As the auction wound down, about 20 people gathered in the
company's office, five of them working the phones to try to squeeze
as much out of the sale as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The end result was somewhat deflating since the selling price of
loans.com was forecast to be in the range of the fee for
business.com.
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains gets a cut of between 7 percent and 20 percent of
Siero's money for marketing and administering the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Paying more than $1 million for what amounts to an address is
increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price paid is either absurd or it's not -- depending on
your point of view,'' Clay Rider, vice president and chief analyst
for Zona Research in Redwood City, said last week. ``What they
spend on advertising them far outstrips the amount of money paid
for the name.''

HALLS OF CONGRESS EMPTY MORE OFTEN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Need some time off? Consider running for the House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's 90-minute State of the Union address marked
the longest amount of time that representatives have spent in their
chamber since before Thanksgiving, a winter slumber, er, break of
about two months.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to some planned retreats and extended vacations
throughout the year, it doesn't look like it gets much harder for
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   True, serving in Congress isn't a typical five-day-a-week,
eight-hour-a-day job. But this election year, the days that
politicians will spend outside the Beltway will outnumber the days
they spend at their desks nearly 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   The House eased back into business Monday with a five-minute
opening session that featured a prayer, a flag salute and a motion
to adjourn. That was followed by snow shutdowns Tuesday and
Wednesday, then Thursday's late-night speech from President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was a day off.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' truncated election-year schedule, announced this week
by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., also includes lengthy breaks for
holidays that usually result in a single day off or a three-day
weekend for most workers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will adjourn Feb. 21-28 to mark Presidents Day. They
will also be out of full session April 17-28 for Easter and
Passover. Representatives and senators will also get an extended
weekend for Memorial Day (May 29-June 2) and a week (July 3-7) for
Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will recess from July 31 to Sept. 5 more than five
weeks so members can attend the weeklong Democratic and Republican
national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   And campaign at home.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders hope to complete their legislative
business and shut down for the year Oct. 6, leaving a full month
for campaigning prior to Election Day on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   All told, this year's congressional schedule calls for the House
and Senate to meet in full on 125 days, down slightly from the 128
days they met in 1996, the previous presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, a nonelection year, Congress was officially in session
for 139 days. Days in session are officially known as Legislative
Days. Except for rare exceptions, all scheduled Legislative Days
are weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   But even those numbers don't tell the full story of Congress'
meeting schedule. The House and Senate, whose members are each paid
$141,300 per year, rarely meet for full sessions Mondays or
Fridays, allowing extended weekends for official and personal
business and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress' schedule definitely looks skimpy,'' said Sarah
Binder, a specialist in governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make an argument that Congress might get more done if
it put in more time. But there are many other obstacles, including
partisanship, to passing legislation like health care reform.
Meeting for more days would not change that fact,'' Binder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small number of Legislative Days is a symptom of gridlock
in Congress, not a cause of gridlock,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   House members have their own take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see Congress meet more often and I have voted in
the past against several motions to adjourn,'' said Rep. Brad
Sherman, D-Woodland Hills. ``More days don't ensure we'll get more
done, but meeting fewer days ensures that we won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Lakewood, said Congress has scheduled
enough time to get its work done, adding that he and other
colleagues recently met with House Speaker Dennis Hastert to set a
week-by-week schedule for considering and voting on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, hundreds of House members will break away from
Washington's breakneck pace by leaving town for party retreats at a
pair of resorts.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, House Republicans, including Reps. Howard P.
``Buck'' McKeon, R-Santa Clarita, and David Dreier, R-Covina, will
travel to the Nemacolin Woodlands Resort and Spa in Western
Pennsylvania to attend a GOP retreat. The session, featuring a pep
talk by Penn State University football coach Joe Paterno, will run
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican getaway is being organized by the Congressional
Institute, a nonprofit, privately funded organization that has also
organized bipartisan retreats for House members.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Climer, president of the Washington-based institute, said
the retreat will allow members to exchange ideas and plot
strategies, all the while insulated from the distractions of
staffers, constituents, lobbyists and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Should time permit, GOP members can also ski Nemacolin's slopes
or rejuvenate at its spa, where fees range from $125 for a basic
rubdown to $450 for a head-to-toe treatment.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 5, House Democrats will depart for the Homestead Resort
in Hot Springs, Va., for a three-day retreat organized by the House
Democratic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech applications to society and politics will be the major
theme, with presentations by Steve Case, chairman of America
Online, and Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner. AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney will also address the retreat, which will
culminate Feb. 7 with an appearance by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic retreaters will also have access to the Homestead's
ski slopes and world-class spa, where a half-day array of
treatments runs $240.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said he had made tentative plans to join the retreat
which, like the GOP getaway, has been factored into Congress'
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing this once a year is not a bad use of my time,'' Sherman
said. ``A retreat is a good part of the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic retreat organizers stressed that
their events are not junkets and that no taxpayer funds will be
expended. Members will pay all of their own costs for
transportation, lodging, food and other goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Room rates at the GOP's site range from $190 per night to $2,000
for a ``Presidential Suite.'' Nightly room charges for the
Democrats' Homestead retreat range from $208 to $554.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to paying their own way, House retreaters have
an option not available to the general public. Under Federal
Election Commission rules, members can use campaign funds to settle
their resort bills.
</P>
<P>
   Retreats are also among the first order of business this year
for the Senate, although members' arrangements are spartan compared
with those of the House. GOP senators held their one-day planning
getaway Thursday at the Library of Congress, steps from their
Capitol Hill offices. Senate Democrats retreated to the library
Friday. But both Senate groups have booked themselves into
Nemacolin for retreats later in the year.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a missile failed to hit a mock warhead high
over the Pacific Ocean two weeks ago, the Clinton administration
rushed to slough off this setback to its plans to protect the
country against missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to the development of a limited national
missile defense system designed to counter emerging threats from
rogue states,'' said David Leavy, spokesman for the National
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, many administration officials were relieved.
The near-miss might give President Clinton reason to delay his
decision on whether to break ground on the system. ``The case is
now easier to make that the decision is not ripe,'' said one
Defense Department official.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that in an election year, politics
_ both domestic and international _ are driving the
administration's divergent public-private views on missile
defenses. At stake are not only America's defenses against new
21st-century menaces, but also the nation's relationship with a
host of other countries, all of whom are alarmed by Washington's
push to build a system that would violate the landmark 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bars national defenses. The
prospect of such a system has made Russia jittery, China suspicious
and America's staunchest European allies resentful.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has always been ambivalent about such
a system, arguing for years that the threat did not warrant
spending billions of dollars on unproven technology, which had its
origins in the vaunted Star Wars proposal of the Reagan years. But
the White House did an abrupt about-face in mid-1998 after two
things happened. First, a bipartisan commission headed by Donald
Rumsfeld, a Republican and former defense secretary, warned that
within five years North Korea and Iran could conceivably reach the
United States with long-range missiles. Then, six weeks later, as
if on cue, North Korea took U.S. intelligence analysts by surprise
by testing a three-stage missile with perhaps enough range to hit
North America.
</P>
<P>
   By early last year, the White House was pledging its conditional
support and $10.5 billion over six years to a limited system. Last
summer Clinton signed into law the National Missile Defense Act,
which requires the United States to field a defense against a
limited missile strike when such a response is technologically
feasible. By year's end, the administration added another $2.2
billion over five years to the program, and promised that Clinton
would decide sometime this summer whether it was feasible to deploy
a system that would be ready by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   No one is talking about a return to the space-based,
rocket-zapping shield that President Reagan proposed 17 years ago
during the Cold War. Today's threat comes not from a barrage of
Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles but from rogue states
like Iran and North Korea, which could lob a warhead or two into
San Francisco or Anchorage. To combat that, the administration is
considering a scaled-down system of ground-based radars,
space-based sensors and 100 interceptors that could destroy a
handful of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents and supporters of missile defenses are watching the
calendar closely. The Pentagon has one more chance, in late April
or early May, to prove that the technology works before a formal
military review of the system begins in June. To protect the
political flank of Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
front-runner in the presidential race, the administration is
sticking to Clinton's schedule to decide this summer, based on that
review.
</P>
<P>
   But the missile-defense issue is causing an uproar overseas,
including in Russia, America's main nuclear rival, whose nuclear
stockpile is declining. Moscow has threatened to stop reducing its
7,000-warhead arsenal if Washington breaks out of the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright begins talks Monday in
Moscow in part to convince the Russians to make modest change as in
the treaty to allow national missile defenses against limited
attacks. But Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said U.S.
negotiators face ``an uphill slog'' in persuading the Russians that
even that limited goal will not undercut Russia's nuclear
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   European allies are worried about their own security as well as
the fate of the landmark pact. ``The ABM Treaty is a cornerstone of
the international order in arms control,'' said K. Erik Tygesen,
Denmark's ambassador to Washington. To field an integrated system,
Washington would need Danish approval to use a ground radar station
in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   And China says tinkering with the treaty could have disastrous
consequences. ``Amending it in search of national missile defense
will tip the global balance, trigger a new arms race and jeopardize
world and regional stability,'' Sha Zukang, director of arms
control and disarmament in China's foreign ministry, wrote recently
in the official newspaper China Daily.
</P>
<P>
   With so many questions, many Democrats and even Republicans who
support missile defenses are urging Clinton to let the next
administration decide. ``I think a new president and his team
should make the call on this,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who
supports missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, of course, has been hedging its bets all
along. Clinton will base his decision on four factors: the threat
to the United States, the cost of the technology, whether the
technology works and the impact on arms-control agreements. Each
factor is essentially an escape hatch, though two of them already
appear closed. Intelligence analysts say the threat is real; the
cost has become less of an issue now with large federal budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Which means this spring's test of the technology and the impact
on strategic relations are pivotal. Conservatives argue that this
month's test was not a failure at all, and follows a successful one
last October. ``We test because we expect to find problems and try
to solve them,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., a staunch
missile-defense supporter. ``This technology is not just within our
reach but is actually in our grasp now.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there's enough doubt the technology will not work, Moscow
is likely to agree to only the most modest changes to the treaty.
And barring some new unforeseen threat, no one expects Clinton to
make withdrawal from the treaty part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians don't want a deal until they think we're really,
no kidding, going to go ahead with this,'' said one senior Pentagon
official. ``The failed test is one more indication that we're not
ready.''

no kidding, going to go ahead with this,'' said one senior Pentagon

   When he arrived at the shop of a specialist in old Islamic
scripts in Tehran, the mullah, about 40, was neatly bearded in the
way of the college-educated Shiite clerics. But he was dressed in a
business suit, not his cleric's attire, and he was flustered.
</P>
<P>
   Late for his appointment, he explained that he had waited in the
street in his white turban, black cloak and collarless white shirt,
and had seen a dozen empty taxis pass. So he returned home and
changed to a suit, and the next taxi picked him up. But the driver,
eyeing his fare's salt-and-pepper beard in the mirror, asked,
``You're a mullah, aren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well yes, I must confess that I am,'' the mullah said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd realized that when I first saw you,'' the driver said,
``I wouldn't have stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the unhappy man tell his story a couple of months ago,
it seemed like an apt metaphor for the troubled times confronting
Iran's 180,000 Muslim clerics. Having wrested power from Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979 and created an intolerant, often
vengeful theocratic state that has ruined Iran's economy, sponsored
terrorist groups abroad and left the country profoundly isolated,
the clerics are now widely unpopular among Iran's 65 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it is not uncommon to hear Iranians whisper the
shah's name with shades of nostalgia, even reverence. ``God bless
the shah!'' they will tell a foreigner, glancing about nervously as
they tour the preserved magnificence inside Neyavaran Palace in
Tehran, just below the field from which the shah boarded a
helicopter on his way into his final exile. This is not to say that
Iranians have forgotten, much less forgiven, the brutality of the
shah's secret police, his modernizer's insensitivity to Iran's
1,350-year embrace of Islam or the corruption he tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it is a measure of how anguished Iranians have become
after nearly a generation under ``the government of God,'' and of
their desperate yearning for change. On Feb. 18, they will have an
opportunity to register their sentiments in a parliamentary
election, the sixth since 1979 but the first in which the
alienation engendered by the mullahs has resolved into a coalition
capable of winning the legislature. Reformers already claim the
Iranian presidency, which Mohammed Khatami won in the 1997 election
with 69 percent of the 29 million votes cast. That success was
repeated in a sweep of municipal elections last February.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, 53, was not always a challenger of the regime's
orthodoxies. Son of a leading ayatollah, and a senior cleric
himself, he was a close aide to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader
of the Islamic revolution. But like Mikhail Gorbachev, the
reform-oriented Soviet leader with whom he is sometimes compared,
his experiences persuaded him that the system could survive only if
it responded to the people's democratic yearnings. To hard-line
clerics, remembering Gorbachev's fate, only oblivion beckons in the
attempt to graft the political ideals of democratic liberalism onto
the ancient beliefs of Islam. But many thousands of mullahs,
alarmed by what might happen if the popular discontent is not
assuaged, have joined Khatami's crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the president, since his election, has had a
difficult two and a half years. His powers under the Islamic
constitution are nominal compared with those of the ``supreme
leader,'' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who inherited the mantle but not
the charisma or religious authority of Khomeini. And Khamenei has
shown less flexibility, in some ways, than Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was an absolute ruler, and approved much of the
cruel repression that accompanied the Islamic takeover, Khomeini
repeatedly warned his fellow clerics not to lose touch with popular
opinion. But under Khamenei, the hierarchy has been archly
selective in ignoring the parts of the Khomeini legacy that might
embarrass them, especially warnings about clerical dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Since he inherited the supreme leader's position in 1989,
Khamenei has rested his authority on a rigid interpretation of a
concept written into the constitution, velayat-i-faqih, the
guardianship of the religious jurist.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the faqih was a cleric learned enough to render
binding interpretations on religious matters. But Khamenei and
conservative clerics have taken the concept as endowing the
clerical hierarchy, through the supreme leader, with the Islamic
equivalent of the divine right of kings. Last week, responding to
reformers who say that the people are sovereign and that the
supreme leader is bound by the constitution and the laws, Khamenei
said the true meaning of velayat-i-faqih is that ``the person in
charge of the Islamic government does not make mistakes and if he
does he will not be the supreme leader from that moment.''

   Many scholars specializing in Iran find in the opposing views an
illuminating echo of the arguments that flowed in 17th- and
18th-century Europe, when Western concepts of democracy were forged
on the anvil of the Reformation and the Enlightenment. In England,
when Charles I insisted on his divine right to rule and Oliver
Cromwell declared the sovereign rights of the people, as
represented by Parliament, it took a civil war to settle the
matter, and the king's severed head was part of the price paid for
parliamentary democracy. The ideas born then were central, later,
in America's revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But where Iran scholars find the European and American
experience most instructive is in the theological debate that
underlay the political evolution _ the way in which men like Thomas
Hobbes and John Locke found sanction for their ideas in a
reinterpretation of the Bible. Today, it is tempting for Westerners
to think that Iran could emerge from its bitter experience of the
past 20 years as a secular republic _ a Turkey, perhaps. But most
people who know Iran well say that however the immediate political
struggle comes out, what lies ahead will be an Islamic republic _
albeit, perhaps, a more civil and gentle one than the mullahs have
built so far.
</P>
<P>
   Many Iranians would have it otherwise. But most accept that
political change, to be stable in a country where faith is a
pervasive fact of life, will have to come from a redefinition
within Islam of the relationship between state and religion. It
will not, they say, come from a separation of church and state that
leaves the mullahs as voiceless in temporal matters as they were
under the shah. Pressed, many Iranians will cite Turkey as proof.
However secular its system, it still has had sharp challenges in
recent years from resurgent Islamism.
</P>
<P>
   This, in fact, is the message of Khatami. Although he is the
author of a best-selling book that discusses the merits of Locke,
Hobbes and Montesquieu, he has never disguised that his democratic,
pluralist, tolerant principles would find expression within a body
politic that had Islam at its core. Addressing the throngs who mob
him everywhere, he invariably returns to the Koran and his belief
that the prophet's teachings rested, at base, on the need for
dialogue and consent among the governed.
</P>
<P>
   In the parliamentary election, Khamenei and his allies, having
used their powers to disqualify scores of reformist candidates, may
yet hold the reformers at bay. But whatever the vote's outcome,
Iran's political struggle will still hold the attention of all who
care about the world's 1 billion Muslims. For if Iran, the fount of
modern Islamic militancy, can find a way to reconcile the ancient
beliefs of Islam and its people's yearnings for freedom, the lesson
will not stop at Iran's borders. It can be expected to ripple
outward across the 53 Muslim nations that have been notable
absentees, so far, from the rise of democracy that followed the
collapse of the Berlin Wall.

`DON KOHLEONE' AND GERMANY FACE OFF

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Helmut Kohl has a new nickname: ``Don Kohleone.'' And
no wonder. First the former German chancellor said he had always
regarded ``close personal trust'' as the most important thing in
political life. Then he placed his ``honor'' above the law. Finally
he resorted to ``omerta,'' the Sicilian word for silence, refusing
to reveal the names of people who secretly gave large sums of money
to his Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just Kohl's behavior that has summoned Italy into
the midst of Germany's political crisis. The difficulties of German
Christian Democracy inevitably invite comparison with those of
Italy's Democrazia Cristiana, a party whose utter dominance of
postwar Italian politics was matched only by the unutterable speed
of its disintegration in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities are intriguing. Both parties were founded in
the immediate postwar years with strong American support to
represent the center-right and act as a bulwark against communism.
Italy's Communists were within, the strongest such party in Western
Europe; Germany's Communists were without, across the border in
East Germany. Neither could be allowed to defeat Washington's
efforts to forge a Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties presided over postwar economic miracles,
underwritten by the Marshall Plan, which were intended to ensure
political and social stability. ``No Experiments'' and ``Affluence
for Everybody'' were the famous slogans with which Germany's
Christian Democrats marched to victory after victory. Italy's
Christian Democratic Party, octopuslike, famously dragged every
non-Communist political grouping toward its amorphous heart in
order to make itself the unavoidable epicenter of power.
</P>
<P>
   Then, abruptly, the two parties triumphed in their central
missions. The Cold War was won. Italian communism, long since
westernized, ceased to be a threat and Kohl's party presided over
the disappearance of Germany's communist state and its absorption
into a unified nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reunification was the ultimate raison d'etre of the Christian
Democratic Union,'' said Claus Leggewie, a political analyst. ``So
it is legitimate to ask why the party should have any more reason
for survival after unity than Italian Christian Democracy after the
taming of Italian communism.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Kohl's party has been doing a fair job of trying to
put itself out of business. Article 21 of the German constitution,
to which Kohl swore allegiance, is clear on the subject of
political parties: ``Their internal organization must conform to
democratic principles. They must publicly account for the sources
of their funds.'' But Kohl continues to refuse to identify large
donors to whom he says he promised anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt that the discovery of a system of secret
funding for Kohl's party involving tens of millions of dollars has
shaken Germany, but not to the degree that the wave of scandals
known as ``Tangentopoli'' rocked Italy and led to the downfall of
Italy's Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our historic merit was to keep Italy within Western democracy
and face down the largest Communist party in Europe,'' said Mino
Martinazzoli, a former Christian Democratic defense minister in
Italy and the man who ultimately dissolved the party in 1994. ``But
our merit was also our failing, because once our historic role was
over, it became apparent how absolutely our stranglehold on power
had corrupted us. There could be no political change, and so we
became a party above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not been the case in Germany, where the Christian
Democrats have governed for most of the postwar years, but by no
means all of them. The Social Democrats also governed, notably from
1969 to 1982. Moreover, the corruption thus far uncovered in
Germany is scarcely comparable to the system put in place by
Democrazia Cristiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian system involved huge bribes or kickbacks on every
public contract in northern Italy, and the purchase of votes in the
south through the delivery of money to well-placed ``friends,''
some of them with evident ties to the Mafia. In this way,
corruption was raised to a method of government as standard as
tax-collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italian Christian Democracy was not just corrupt in the sense
that corruption was a by-product of power,'' said Patrick McCarthy,
dean of the Johns Hopkins Center for European Studies in Bologna.
``Their corruption was power. They put in place a highly organized
method of corruption that was systemic. I do not see that in
Germany, at least not at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Another basic difference is that the U.S. interest in sustaining
the Italian party once the Cold War was won was limited, whereas
U.S. concern over a possible disintegration of German Christian
Democracy is intense. ``Germany absolutely needs Christian
Democracy,'' said one senior official here.
</P>
<P>
   The party has played an essential role in reining in more
nationalist or extremist right-wing German tendencies, and that
role is by no means exhausted. The rise of Joerg Haider and his
Freedom Party in Austria, offering a simmering brew of
anti-immigrant rhetoric, has illustrated that Europe's combination
of aging populations and high unemployment may offer plenty of
opportunity for rightward drift.
</P>
<P>
   All of Germany's political parties _ including Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats _ are aware of this. The rise
of Gianfranco Fini's post-Fascist party in Italy after the collapse
of Christian Democracy there was one thing; it would be altogether
another in a German guise. It is certain that a great deal of
energy, within Germany and in Washington, will be focused on
ensuring that the party weathers the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, its success will depend on its ability to change
faster than Italian Christian Democracy. A new generation of
leaders is certainly needed, as well as a recognition that
stability is not the only political virtue in a post-Cold War
world. New party laws are needed to bring greater transparency to
financing and ensure that nobody can remain party chairman, as Kohl
did, for a quarter-century. Germany's restive mood may in the end
demand that the office of chancellor _ held by Kohl for 16 years _
also be limited, perhaps to two four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis of German Christian Democracy has become a crisis of
Germany's ability to modernize itself. Few wish to envisage that
modernization without Kohl's party, and so it will almost certainly
survive.

political and social stability. ``No Experiments'' and ``Affluence
for Everybody'' were the famous slogans with which Germany's
Christian Democrats marched to victory after victory. Italy's
Christian Democratic Party, octopuslike, famously dragged every
non-Communist political grouping toward its amorphous heart in
order to make itself the unavoidable epicenter of power.
</P>
<P>
   Then, abruptly, the two parties triumphed in their central
missions. The Cold War was won. Italian communism, long since
westernized, ceased to be a threat and Kohl's party presided over
the disappearance of Germany's communist state and its absorption
into a unified nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reunification was the ultimate raison d'etre of the Christian
Democratic Union,'' said Claus Leggewie, a political analyst. ``So
it is legitimate to ask why the party should have any more reason
for survival after unity than Italian Christian Democracy after the
taming of Italian communism.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Kohl's party has been doing a fair job of trying to
put itself out of business. Article 21 of the German constitution,
to which Kohl swore allegiance, is clear on the subject of
political parties: ``Their internal organization must conform to
democratic principles. They must publicly account for the sources
of their funds.'' But Kohl continues to refuse to identify large
donors to whom he says he promised anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt that the discovery of a system of secret
funding for Kohl's party involving tens of millions of dollars has
shaken Germany, but not to the degree that the wave of scandals
known as ``Tangentopoli'' rocked Italy and led to the downfall of
Italy's Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our historic merit was to keep Italy within Western democracy
and face down the largest Communist party in Europe,'' said Mino
Martinazzoli, a former Christian Democratic defense minister in
Italy and the man who ultimately dissolved the party in 1994. ``But
our merit was also our failing, because once our historic role was
over, it became apparent how absolutely our stranglehold on power
had corrupted us. There could be no political change, and so we
became a party above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not been the case in Germany, where the Christian
Democrats have governed for most of the postwar years, but by no
means all of them. The Social Democrats also governed, notably from
1969 to 1982. Moreover, the corruption thus far uncovered in
Germany is scarcely comparable to the system put in place by
Democrazia Cristiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian system involved huge bribes or kickbacks on every
public contract in northern Italy, and the purchase of votes in the
south through the delivery of money to well-placed ``friends,''
some of them with evident ties to the Mafia. In this way,
corruption was raised to a method of government as standard as
tax-collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italian Christian Democracy was not just corrupt in the sense
that corruption was a by-product of power,'' said Patrick McCarthy,
dean of the Johns Hopkins Center for European Studies in Bologna.
``Their corruption was power. They put in place a highly organized
method of corruption that was systemic. I do not see that in
Germany, at least not at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Another basic difference is that the U.S. interest in sustaining
the Italian party once the Cold War was won was limited, whereas
U.S. concern over a possible disintegration of German Christian
Democracy is intense. ``Germany absolutely needs Christian
Democracy,'' said one senior official here.
</P>
<P>
   The party has played an essential role in reining in more
nationalist or extremist right-wing German tendencies, and that
role is by no means exhausted. The rise of Joerg Haider and his
Freedom Party in Austria, offering a simmering brew of
anti-immigrant rhetoric, has illustrated that Europe's combination
of aging populations and high unemployment may offer plenty of
opportunity for rightward drift.
</P>
<P>
   All of Germany's political parties _ including Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats _ are aware of this. The rise
of Gianfranco Fini's post-Fascist party in Italy after the collapse
of Christian Democracy there was one thing; it would be altogether
another in a German guise. It is certain that a great deal of
energy, within Germany and in Washington, will be focused on
ensuring that the party weathers the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, its success will depend on its ability to change
faster than Italian Christian Democracy. A new generation of
leaders is certainly needed, as well as a recognition that
stability is not the only political virtue in a post-Cold War
world. New party laws are needed to bring greater transparency to
financing and ensure that nobody can remain party chairman, as Kohl
did, for a quarter-century. Germany's restive mood may in the end
demand that the office of chancellor _ held by Kohl for 16 years _
also be limited, perhaps to two four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis of German Christian Democracy has become a crisis of
Germany's ability to modernize itself. Few wish to envisage that
modernization without Kohl's party, and so it will almost certainly
survive.

<P>
   Each June for at least the last four centuries, farmers in 12
mountain villages in Peru and Bolivia follow a ritual that
Westerners might think odd, if not crazy. Late each night for about
a week, the farmers observe the stars in the Pleiades
constellation, which is low on the horizon to the northeast. If
they appear big and bright, the farmers know to plant their potato
crop at the usual time four months later. But if the stars are dim,
the usual planting will be delayed for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now Western researchers have applied the scientific method to
this seeming madness. Poring over reams of satellite data on cloud
cover and water vapor, Professor Benjamin Orlove, an anthropologist
at the University of California at Davis, and colleagues have
discovered that these star-gazing farmers are accurate long-range
weather forecasters. High wisps of cirrus clouds dim the stars in
El Nino years, which brings reduced rainfall to that part of the
Andes. In such drought conditions, it makes sense to plant potatoes
as late as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Orlove's work, which was reported in January in the British
journal Nature, is just the latest example of indigenous or
traditional knowledge that has been found to have a sound
scientific basis. In agriculture, nutrition, medicine and other
fields, modern research is showing why people maintain their
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Masai of East Africa, who are famous for the kind of
high-fat diet, rich in meat and milk, that would make a
cardiologist swoon. Timothy Johns, a professor at McGill University
in Montreal and director of the Center for Indigenous Peoples'
Nutrition and Environment, has long studied the Masai to determine
how they stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Masai add the roots and barks of certain plants, including a
species of acacia high in antioxidants, Johns said. They also chew
a natural gum, related to myrrh, that helps to break down fats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a magic bullet protecting the Masai against heart
disease,'' he said. ``But there is a benefit from what they are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 study, two Cornell University researchers analyzed the
spices used in 36 countries and found a correlation between average
temperature and cooking with spices like cumin, turmeric, ginger
and chili peppers, all of which have antimicrobial properties. The
hotter the climate, the hotter the food _ in part, at least, to
keep it from spoiling.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the benefits of traditional knowledge are
not so obvious to those outside the culture. In Bali in the 1970s,
the Indonesian government, persuaded by international advocates of
the ``green revolution,'' forced rice farmers adopt new growing
schemes. Among other things, the farmers were made to stop their
centuries-old ritual of meeting in small groups at a series of
water temples set at the forks of rivers, to negotiate seasonal
schedules for flooding their paddies.
</P>
<P>
   The new techniques resulted in disaster. Farmers were pressured
to plant as often as possible. With little coordination of
irrigation, water shortages and pest infestation were the norm.
</P>
<P>
   At about this time, J. Stephen Lansing, an American
anthropologist, began to study the water temples. What he found,
which was supported later by computer modeling, was that the old
system was quite sophisticated and efficient, encouraging
cooperation among thousands of farmers. Water was shared and
controlled through a process involving reciprocal altruism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets more rice and variation in harvest disappears,
so there's no reason to be envious of your neighbors,'' said
Lansing, who now teaches at the University of Arizona. ``It's a
bottom-up system of management that's worked very well.'' The green
revolution, he added, ``was very much top down.'' The traditional
system has been re-established.
</P>
<P>
   Orlove has studied similar traditional resource management
around Lake Titicaca, on the border between Bolivia and Peru. A
distinctive feature of the lake is the reeds growing in its
shallows. The people around the lake use them for rafts and
livestock feed, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a major component of the household economy,'' said
Orlove. The residents replant the reeds, which also serve as a
spawning ground for some of the 22 species of fish that are unique
to the lake.
</P>
<P>
   But indigenous knowledge can be faulty. ``Traditional people
sometimes get things right, and sometimes get them wrong,'' said
Alan Fiske, a psychological anthropologist at the University of
California at Los Angeles. ``Some things people do are bad for
them.'' Other anthropologists have challenged the notion that all
indigenous groups have somehow developed a blissful oneness with
their world.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Fiske noted, is that verifying traditional
knowledge is not easy. The scientific method can be expensive, and
data can be difficult to obtain. Orlove's research on the potato
farmers would have been impossible even 10 years ago, because the
type of satellite data he needed did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a shortage of data, but there's no shortage of
traditional knowledge that awaits possible confirmation by science.
James Lynch, an American scientist who has spent the past two
decades helping Costa Rican farmers, said he has learned from them
the importance of timing. A tree cut down during a new moon, he
said, will quickly be ravaged by the insects, while one felled
several days before a full moon will stay free of termites for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch now follows the practice. ``But I've never seen any
scientific study to back it up,'' he said.

   There's junk science, and then there's junk-food science.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the Super Bowl, not to mention National Snack
Food Month in February, the Snack Food Association and the National
Potato Promotion Board have commissioned a study linking people's
snack preferences with their personality types.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise: People who inhale potato chips aren't necessarily
porcine gluttons but ``ambitious, successful, high achievers.'' And
Cheez Doodle lovers aren't slobs with orange fingers but ``formal,
always proper, conscientious, principled.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Let's have a look at this study. It was conducted by Dr.
Alan Hirsch, a neurologist and psychiatrist who runs the Smell and
Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago. His curriculum
vitae notes that ``he has served as an expert on smell and taste on
CNN, `Good Morning America' and `The Oprah Winfrey Show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from Hirsch's research follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The paper, ``Snack Food Hedonics and
Personality,'' begins, ``Why do we choose to eat certain
foods?''(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Our food choices, like our choices of clothing, movies,
automobiles, vacation spots and mates and lovers, can provide
insight into our personality and character structure. Through our
food preferences and choices we reveal inner thoughts, feelings,
wishes and desires. It's no exaggeration to say that, in many
respects, the foods we choose provide a window to the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) One way to open that window, Hirsch
maintains, is through hedonics, the field of psychology that
measures feelings: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A food's hedonic value is determined by . . . factors including
the inherent gustatory and olfactory properties, cognitive
perceptions including the perceived nutritional value, associated
conditioned response characteristics, olfactory evoked nostalgia
and craving.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) You say you like some foods and not others?
It's not that simple, the study says: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Pavlovian conditioned response effects also impact the hedonic
nature of the food. Caffeine wakes, alcohol removes inhibitions,
sugar energizes. Alternatively, food aversions also are created if
illness occurs coincident with ingestion. Unconditioned stimuli may
also become associated with the affective view of the food.
Romantic interludes after eating dessert may change the effective
valence of the pumpkin pie. Alternatively, ingestion of chipped
beef prior to a forced 10-mile march in full gear may endow a
negative valence to the chipped beef.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The paper hypothesizes that your food
preferences can be a gustatory Rorschach test: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Since eating or smelling of food may reduce psychologic tension,
craving or the desire for food may then be representative of the
underlying conflict. And longstanding preferences may indicate the
conflicts associated with inherent personality structure. Thus,
food preference could theoretically be used as a projective
personality test.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) So how to gauge the correlation between
snack scarfing and personality? Here's how: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Eight hundred volunteers, 73 percent female, 27 percent male,
with a median age of 45 (range 17-77) underwent a series of
psychological tests including the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory-II, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II, Beck
Depression Inventory and the Zung Depression Scale. They were then
queried regarding the hedonic preferences of six different snack
foods: potato chips tortilla chips, pretzels, snack crackers,
cheese curls and meat snacks. . . . Spouses or mates of these
subjects also underwent the same hedonic preference assessments.
After these were obtained, analysis was performed correlating snack
food hedonics and personality types. These characteristics were
then expanded and interpreted for lay person understanding. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)And the results are: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   POTATO CHIPS: Those who love potato chips are ambitious,
successful, high achievers. They enjoy rewards and trimmings of
their success _ both in business and family life. They feel pride
and happiness when their spouse and children are also successful.
They seek nothing less than the best in those around them. Potato
chip lovers are easily frustrated and indignant at life's
inconveniences. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Note: Whether in business, sports or a social situation, expect
to lose if you enter into competition with a potato chip lover;
they are worthy and prepared adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   TORTILLA CHIPS : Tortilla chip lovers aren't satisfied with
getting a grade of A, it must be an A plus. Their concern extends
beyond their own actions, and also to the community at large _ they
are distressed by the inequities and injustices of society. This
concern for how others feel would make them an ideal house guest.
</P>
<P>
   Always prim and proper at social gatherings, the tortilla chip
lover is conservative.

   Since eating or smelling of food may reduce psychologic tension,
craving or the desire for food may then be representative of the
underlying conflict. And longstanding preferences may indicate the
conflicts associated with inherent personality structure. Thus,
food preference could theoretically be used as a projective
personality test.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Eight hundred volunteers, 73 percent female, 27 percent male,
with a median age of 45 (range 17-77) underwent a series of
psychological tests including the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory-II, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II, Beck
Depression Inventory and the Zung Depression Scale. They were then
queried regarding the hedonic preferences of six different snack
foods: potato chips tortilla chips, pretzels, snack crackers,
cheese curls and meat snacks. . . . Spouses or mates of these
subjects also underwent the same hedonic preference assessments.
After these were obtained, analysis was performed correlating snack
food hedonics and personality types. These characteristics were
then expanded and interpreted for lay person understanding. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)And the results are: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   POTATO CHIPS: Those who love potato chips are ambitious,
successful, high achievers. They enjoy rewards and trimmings of
their success _ both in business and family life. They feel pride
and happiness when their spouse and children are also successful.
They seek nothing less than the best in those around them. Potato
chip lovers are easily frustrated and indignant at life's
inconveniences. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Note: Whether in business, sports or a social situation, expect
to lose if you enter into competition with a potato chip lover;
they are worthy and prepared adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   TORTILLA CHIPS : Tortilla chip lovers aren't satisfied with
getting a grade of A, it must be an A plus. Their concern extends
beyond their own actions, and also to the community at large _ they
are distressed by the inequities and injustices of society. This
concern for how others feel would make them an ideal house guest.
</P>
<P>
   Always prim and proper at social gatherings, the tortilla chip
lover is conservative.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   PRETZELS : Lively and energetic, those who prefer pretzels crave
novelty and easily become bored by the usual routine. They are
excited by the challenge _ whether it be at work, sports or home.
They thrive in the world of abstract concepts and tend to lose
interest in the mundane day-to-day world. There is a tendency to
initiate new projects without having completed the last, and to
overcommit to work or family chores.
</P>
<P>
   Happy in the role as a ``flirt,'' pretzel lovers are comfortable
dressed in an attractive manner. . . . The pretzel lover will be on
top of the latest craze _ having accumulated a herd of ``Beanie
Babies,'' they are ready to conquer the next fad.
</P>
<P>
   Pretzel lovers make decisions based on intuition and emotion. At
times, they are overly trusting, especially in romantic
relationships. One pretzel lover is a welcome addition to any
grouping _ they are ``the life of the party, lively, enthusiastic
and fun to be with!''
</P>
<P>
   SNACK CRACKERS : Contemplative, thoughtful . . . rather than
intuitively oriented, decisions are reasoned and not based on
emotions. Shy and introspective, (snack cracker eaters) avoid
confrontation so as not to hurt the feelings of others. They have
many diverse interests and are involved in a multitude of projects
simultaneously, all competing for their time and attention. They
value their private time and are most creative when allowed to be
alone, free from their daily responsibilities and interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Those who prefer crackers may easily find themselves
romantically involved in an Internet relationship.
</P>
<P>
   CHEESE CURLS: Formal, always proper, conscientious, principled,
the cheese curl lover maintains the moral high ground with . . .
family, work and romantic partners. They have a fine sense of right
and wrong and justly treat those with whom they interact _ the CEO
is treated with the same fairness and concern as the bus boy.
Cheese curl lovers are best described by one adjective _ integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than showing reckless disregard for the future, they plan
ahead, anticipate any possible future catastrophes. Whether it be
Band-Aids or batteries, the cheese curl lover's house is stocked
and ready. Orderly and perfectionists, they are most comfortable
with a neat, uncluttered desk. At work, play, or at home no detail
is left undone.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If it is so spotless you can eat off the kitchen floor,
you are in the domicile of one who craves cheese curls.
</P>
<P>
   MEAT SNACKS: Gregarious, social . . . They are generous to a
fault, and will make extraordinary self-sacrifices to please
others. Those who prefer meat snacks are loyal and true friends who
can always be trusted. However, their overtrusting nature
predisposes them to emotional turmoil, especially when breaking up
with a lover.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Those who prefer meat snacks are prone to, and thus should
be careful to avoid, rebound relationships!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And the study concludes: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Food hedonics, whether it be snack food, fruit or ice cream, has
potential utility as a projective test for psychiatric illness as
well as personality typing in subjects without pathology. Future
research establishing cross-geographics and cross-cultural validity
of this projective testing is warranted.

VOTING BY THE INTERNET: THE MOUSE STILL HASN'T ROARED

<P>
   In some parts of Alaska, about the only way to get to a voting
booth in January is by dogsled. So to encourage participation in
its presidential straw poll last Monday, the Alaska Republican
Party tried something different: Internet voting.
</P>
<P>
   By logging on to the Web site of VoteHere.net, a new company
that sells Internet voting software, Republicans in three remote
districts (and in the offices of Alaska's members of Congress in
Washington) could point the mouse at any of six presidential
contenders, then click on a button labeled ``Cast this ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the straw poll was not binding, this was not, as the
company labeled it, the ``first binding Internet election.'' Still,
it does appear to have been the first Internet ballot to be
sanctioned by a major party, and it was a happy debut: while only
35 people voted from their computers, they provided Texas Gov.
George W. Bush with just enough clicks (23) to lift him to a narrow
victory over Steve Forbes (4) in the straw poll as a whole. (The
overall tally was Bush 1,571, Forbes 1,566.)
</P>
<P>
   While Alaska may have been the first, it is not likely to be the
last. A small but growing number of state officials in both
parties, impressed by the sales pitches of start-up companies like
VoteHere.net and Election.com, see electronic voting as a way to
attract new voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole objective is to open voting to people who don't
participate, like the 18-to-34 age group,'' said Mark Fleisher,
chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party, which plans to offer
Internet voting in its March presidential primary, which will be
binding. He added that he hoped the novelty would provide a jolt of
publicity to upstage the Republicans, whose own primary is two
weeks before the Democrats'.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone sees Internet voting as a portal to a more
democratic future. The Voting Integrity Project, a nonprofit civic
group in Virginia, has sued in federal court to block the Arizona
Democrats' plan on behalf of two minority voters, saying it
discriminates against minority voters, who are less likely than
whites to have access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are security problems. The two electronic voting
companies use various kinds of software to protect voters' privacy
and make sure nobody casts more than one ballot. But the California
Internet Voting Task Force, a panel of technology experts,
political scientists and civic leaders convened by Secretary of
State Bill Jones, presented an alarming picture in January in a
report rejecting the notion of allowing voters to cast ballots from
home via the Internet anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The task force said that despite security measures, it would be
all too easy to distribute a ``Trojan horse'' virus, perhaps by
e-mail, to take up residence in voters' home computers. Such a
virus, the panel said, could direct Internet voting software to
take over the keyboard and mouse and place automated votes without
the user's even being aware that the vote had been altered.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Adler, president of VoteHere.net, said such concerns were
overblown, but he acknowledged that extra security measures might
be necessary and that they would involve some work on the voters'
part. ``You may have to sacrifice convenience for security,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers for the Defense Department, which is creating a
system to allow Americans overseas to cast ballots through the
Internet, came to the same conclusion as the California panel.
Glenn Flood, a Pentagon spokesman, said the pilot project,
scheduled to be tested by 250 military personnel in November, would
allow voting only from virus-free machines at military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts dispute a central premise of the Internet-voting
movement: that technology, in and of itself, will attract large
numbers of new voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pent-up demand for `Gee, if I could do this from
home, I would participate in politics,''' said Michael Cornfield, a
political scientist who is director of the Democracy Online Project
at George Washington University. ``We've been there. We've done
this. It does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Arterton, dean of the Graduate School of Political
Management at George Washington, said that experiments in
``tele-democracy'' in the 1980s, in which people could register
opinions by telephone on issues presented in town hall meetings on
cable television, were disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media was not a cure-all for the problems of democracy,'' he
said. ``The real resistance from citizens is attitudes toward
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And many state election officials are far from sold on Internet
voting. ``We have a couple of software companies that are driving
this process,'' said Thomas Wilkey, executive director of the New
York state Board of Elections. ``I don't think anybody is saying
they're totally against this, but let's take a look before jumping
into this. It's like jumping into the lake without testing the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Practical issues aside, the political obstacles are bound to
remain substantial. Consider the culture clash that took place in
Louisiana last spring, when VoteHere.net persuaded moderate
Republicans to propose Internet voting to bring attention to the
party's 2000 presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became a flashpoint in the longstanding rivalry
between conservatives and moderates. And as the software people
looked on in amazement, the old politics rapidly trumped the new:
conservatives, invoking a series of unorthodox parliamentary
maneuvers, managed to bury the proposal, at least for this election
year.

TUESDAY'S BIG TEST: HOW DEEP IN THE HEART OF TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For decades, it has been an article of faith among
Republicans that no issue is more politically powerful or truer to
their ideology than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now that orthodoxy faces one of its strongest challenges since
Ronald Reagan brought the supply-side revolution to the GOP. The
challenger is Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who has audaciously
taken Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to task at the beginning of the
primary season for the big tax cut plan that is the centerpiece of
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the federal budget surplus swelling, taxes will no doubt
remain an issue to some degree throughout the election. But the
outcome of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday could go a long way
toward determining whether the traditional Republican message about
cutting taxes has lost its potency in an era when voters seem
inclined to use the current prosperity to address expensive
long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself as a true believer in tax cuts, Bush has not
flinched. His differences with McCain, he said last week as he
received the endorsement of Jack Kemp, one of the original
supply-siders, pose ``a defining choice for our party.'' Kemp said
McCain was ``turning the party away from Ronald Reagan and back to
Herbert Hoover.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain has continued to attack Bush's plan in
terms redolent of both old-style fiscal conservatism and Democratic
class warfare. He calls the proposed cuts too big, too tilted to
the wealthy, too little focused on debt reduction and blind to the
challenges of shoring up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during a debate last week whether his approach was too
much like President Clinton's to suit Republican voters, McCain did
not blush, replying that perhaps Clinton's plan ``looks too much
like mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McCain's appeal in the famously anti-tax precincts of
New Hampshire may derive more from his war hero background and his
blunt-talking approach than from his stand on fiscal policy. But
should he defeat Bush in the first head-to-head matchup between the
two leading Republicans, it will clearly raise questions about the
Texan's reliance on a tax-cutting message to carry him through the
primaries, much less the general election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's approach, which includes smaller tax cuts than Bush's,
is framed by the combination of current prosperity and long-term
national problems. Few voters seem to be clamoring for tax cuts of
a few hundred or even a few thousand dollars a year now because
most are feeling flush; on Tuesday, as New Hampshire votes, the
nation's current economic expansion will officially become the
longest on record.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, voters seem to have a visceral feeling that
they should be planning now to ensure that the country's finances
are put in order before the inevitable downturn. Support for
reducing the national debt is far stronger than either party had
expected, and poll respondents regularly say their top priorities
are putting Social Security and Medicare on sound footing for the
retirement of the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   These developments have given McCain an opportunity to redefine
what it means to be a conservative in an age of plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's conservative in good times to put money into
Social Security,'' McCain said. ``It's conservative to pay down the
debt. And it's conservative, clearly, to try to save Medicare and
at the same time give these tax breaks to American families.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy has set off a heated debate among Republican
strategists and conservative thinkers. Most of them are more
dedicated to tax cuts than ever, especially at a time when the
federal surplus appears to be growing to astonishing heights. Last
week the Congressional Budget Office projected that the surplus
outside the Social Security system could reach $1.9 trillion over
the next decade, nearly twice as much as projected six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   True supply-siders say that tax cuts will not only keep the
economy healthy, but that returning excess revenue to the taxpayers
is the best way to stop the relentless growth of government. They
point out that when the issue is framed as a choice between letting
politicians spend the surplus and letting individuals choose how to
use their own money, tax cuts get strong support in polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to link it to wasteful Washington spending,'' said
Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``That's when it becomes not
only good policy but good politics.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans, even some who consider themselves
supply-siders and support aggressive tax-cutting efforts,
acknowledge that McCain may have tapped into a new politics of
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time of prosperity such as now, the one thing people are
more concerned about than anything else is not rocking the boat,''
said Bruce Bartlett, a former Treasury Department official in the
Reagan and Bush administrations, ``and they are deeply skeptical of
any ideas that seem large because large is seen as risky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rightly or wrongly, people have bought into the idea that big
tax cuts are risky,'' Bartlett said. ``At the same time, people
know instinctively that the good times won't last forever. They
view paying down the debt as putting money in the national piggy
bank and as the way you deal with the problems of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild card in the debate could be the surplus. McCain has
already dismissed the estimates as guesses that should not be the
basis for policy-making. And Democrats say the projections of a
$1.9 trillion surplus are a fantasy because they are built on the
unrealistic assumption that Congress will cut spending for the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the numbers give Bush some measure of protection against
charges that his $483 billion, five-year tax cut plan would be
fiscally irresponsible. Even if he loses the New Hampshire primary
on Tuesday, he will almost certainly stick to his message as the
campaign leaves the state (where independents can vote in the
primaries) for more traditional conservative battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the debate on the campaign trail is beginning to
percolate among Republicans in Congress. House Speaker Dennis
Hastert has made eliminating the national debt one of the party's
main goals, even as he has de-emphasized efforts to pass a sweeping
tax cut, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have not failed to recognize reality. With Kemp at
his side, Bob Dole ran for president in 1996 on a tax-cutting
platform and was beaten soundly by Clinton. Clinton has
subsequently blocked Republican tax-cutting efforts in Congress and
tried to make Democrats the party of fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican analysts are clearly concerned about the
potential for a debilitating split within the party if McCain's
strategy succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Republican uses the rhetoric of Democratic criticism
against the GOP,'' Luntz said, ``that's when you know you have an
electoral problem.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For decades, it has been an article of faith among
Republicans that no issue is more politically powerful or truer to
their ideology than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now that orthodoxy faces one of its strongest challenges since
Ronald Reagan brought the supply-side revolution to the GOP. The
challenger is Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who has audaciously
taken Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to task at the beginning of the
primary season for the big tax cut plan that is the centerpiece of
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the federal budget surplus swelling, taxes will no doubt
remain an issue to some degree throughout the election. But the
outcome of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday could go a long way
toward determining whether the traditional Republican message about
cutting taxes has lost its potency in an era when voters seem
inclined to use the current prosperity to address expensive
long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself as a true believer in tax cuts, Bush has not
flinched. His differences with McCain, he said last week as he
received the endorsement of Jack Kemp, one of the original
supply-siders, pose ``a defining choice for our party.'' Kemp said
McCain was ``turning the party away from Ronald Reagan and back to
Herbert Hoover.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain has continued to attack Bush's plan in
terms redolent of both old-style fiscal conservatism and Democratic
class warfare. He calls the proposed cuts too big, too tilted to
the wealthy, too little focused on debt reduction and blind to the
challenges of shoring up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during a debate last week whether his approach was too
much like President Clinton's to suit Republican voters, McCain did
not blush, replying that perhaps Clinton's plan ``looks too much
like mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McCain's appeal in the famously anti-tax precincts of
New Hampshire may derive more from his war hero background and his
blunt-talking approach than from his stand on fiscal policy. But
should he defeat Bush in the first head-to-head matchup between the
two leading Republicans, it will clearly raise questions about the
Texan's reliance on a tax-cutting message to carry him through the
primaries, much less the general election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's approach, which includes smaller tax cuts than Bush's,
is framed by the combination of current prosperity and long-term
national problems. Few voters seem to be clamoring for tax cuts of
a few hundred or even a few thousand dollars a year now because
most are feeling flush; on Tuesday, as New Hampshire votes, the
nation's current economic expansion will officially become the
longest on record.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, voters seem to have a visceral feeling that
they should be planning now to ensure that the country's finances
are put in order before the inevitable downturn. Support for
reducing the national debt is far stronger than either party had
expected, and poll respondents regularly say their top priorities
are putting Social Security and Medicare on sound footing for the
retirement of the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   These developments have given McCain an opportunity to redefine
what it means to be a conservative in an age of plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's conservative in good times to put money into
Social Security,'' McCain said. ``It's conservative to pay down the
debt. And it's conservative, clearly, to try to save Medicare and
at the same time give these tax breaks to American families.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy has set off a heated debate among Republican
strategists and conservative thinkers. Most of them are more
dedicated to tax cuts than ever, especially at a time when the
federal surplus appears to be growing to astonishing heights. Last
week the Congressional Budget Office projected that the surplus
outside the Social Security system could reach $1.9 trillion over
the next decade, nearly twice as much as projected six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   True supply-siders say that tax cuts will not only keep the
economy healthy, but that returning excess revenue to the taxpayers
is the best way to stop the relentless growth of government. They
point out that when the issue is framed as a choice between letting
politicians spend the surplus and letting individuals choose how to
use their own money, tax cuts get strong support in polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to link it to wasteful Washington spending,'' said
Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``That's when it becomes not
only good policy but good politics.''

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Last week, rebel insurgents from Myanmar
stormed a hospital in neighboring Ratchaburi, Thailand, holding
more than 800 staff members and patients prisoner for 22 hours.
Thai security forces then stormed the hospital, killing 10 rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas were part of a fundamentalist Christian
paramilitary group led by 12-year-old Burmese twins, Johnny and
Luther Htoo, neither of whom took part in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, a photo of the impossibly young-looking leaders
began appearing in American newspapers. Long-haired and pretty,
Johnny Htoo peers over his brother's shoulder with a slightly
furrowed brow; Luther, eyes narrowed, holds a cigar to his lips.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, the Htoo boys began surfacing on American
television, notably as a comedy news item on ``The Daily Show,''
starring Jon Stewart.

Luther's monologue at the end of the pilot. (To Executive No. 2)
Did you get all that?

<P>
   EXECUTIVE No. 2 (taking out pen): No, no, I was transfixed. (To

 WASHINGTON: good politics.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But other Republicans, even some who consider themselves
supply-siders and support aggressive tax-cutting efforts,
acknowledge that McCain may have tapped into a new politics of
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time of prosperity such as now, the one thing people are

said Bruce Bartlett, a former Treasury Department official in the

<P>
   When New York state opened the Tappan Zee Bridge in 1955 to span
the Hudson River at its widest point, officials proudly said they
were opening up new frontiers to the suburbs and beyond. The bridge
would pay dividends far beyond its $81 million cost, ``in new
satellite communities, in increased land values and in countless
other less tangible ways,'' said Walter Mahoney, a Republican who
was majority leader of the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This month, when a task force appointed by Gov. George Pataki
called for a $4 billion project to replace the bridge, the language
was strikingly different.
</P>
<P>
   There was no brave talk of new subdivisions or shopping centers.
Instead, the task force cast the bridge replacement almost as a
mass transit project _ a way to contain the suburban sprawl that
the bridge had been built to generate in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   It said the new span should include tracks for a commuter rail
line. And to relieve the rush-hour traffic that often results in
six-mile logjams, the panel called for a new toll-collection system
that would offer discounts to off-peak travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Costly and controversial as it is sure to be, the project may
never get off the ground. But whether it does or not, it has
already signaled a fundamental shift in the way major public works
projects are conceived, promoted and packaged, not just in New York
but all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, of course, is that sprawl has become a dirty
word. When the dividends trumpeted in the 1950s turned out to have
their own costs (including the heavy traffic that has made the
Tappan Zee Bridge and other roadways obsolete), public officials
and transportation planners had to change their vocabularies.

   Rather than proclaim the merits of suburban development and car
travel, as the legendary master builder Robert Moses did in New
York state from the 1920s to the '60s, they are framing new road
projects in cautious, modest terms, often coupled with ideas for
mass transit and relief of traffic congestion. Vice President Al
Gore has made such initiatives a centerpiece of his campaign for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Not so many years ago, it was common wisdom that the only way to
relieve highway congestion was to add new lanes. Now the common
wisdom, supported by several recent studies, is that expanding a
road usually leads to substantial increases in the number of
vehicles on it. ``Adding highway capacity to solve traffic
congestion is like buying larger pants to deal with your weight
problem,'' said Michael Replogle, transportation director of the
advocacy group Environmental Defense, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   So in New Jersey, the state transportation commissioner, James
Weinstein, could go before a business group last week and utter
words that would have been heresy in that car-besotted state just a
few years ago: ``We're past the period where adding lanes is the
solution to traffic congestion, make no mistake about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein added that most of the money in a new $500 million
transportation bond act would go toward mass transit and road
repairs. ``The commissioner feels quite strongly that we cannot
build our way out of congestion,'' said his spokesman, John
Dourgarian. ``The days of new highway construction are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-peak discounts have been tried in California and a few other
states, with mixed success. In Maryland, Gov. Parris Glendening has
killed five highway bypass projects, fearful that they would
encourage sprawl, and pledged to double the number of transit
riders by 2020. To get people out of their cars and promote
downtown revitalization, the state has also built 50 miles of
sidewalks in the last two years, said John Freece, an assistant to
the governor. Even the state highway administrator has adopted a
slogan that would cheer anti-sprawl activists: ``Thinking Beyond
the Pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tappan Zee Bridge may be something of a special case. It is
severely overcrowded, handling 130,000 vehicles a day, 30 percent
over capacity. (The planners envision an increase from seven lanes
to eight.) And because it is so long _ built at the Hudson's widest
point to escape the 25-mile jurisdiction of the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey _ it is unusually expensive to maintain,
repair and, if necessary, replace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the debate over the Tappan Zee echoes one in Washington
over the dilapidated Woodrow Wilson Bridge, on the Potomac River.
While there is wide agreement on the need to rebuild or replace the
bridge, a growing chorus of citizens, transportation groups and
government officials argue that a replacement structure should
accommodate as much mass transit and congestion pricing as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk pleases Robert A. Caro, author of ``The Power Broker''
(Alfred A. Knopf, 1974), the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of
Robert Moses that was one of the first works to focus on the toll
of build-at-all-costs highway construction on neighborhoods, the
environment and the overall quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Caro said, a growing number of public officials
have written to tell him the era of Moses is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a really encouraging extent,'' he said, ``I see that
there's a new understanding that it's no good just to go on blindly
building huge projects in the way that Robert Moses did. I don't
think we've come full circle, but I think we've come a long way.''

<P>
   When New York state opened the Tappan Zee Bridge in 1955 to span
the Hudson River at its widest point, officials proudly said they
were opening up new frontiers to the suburbs and beyond. The bridge
would pay dividends far beyond its $81 million cost, ``in new
satellite communities, in increased land values and in countless
other less tangible ways,'' said Walter Mahoney, a Republican who
was majority leader of the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This month, when a task force appointed by Gov. George Pataki
called for a $4 billion project to replace the bridge, the language
was strikingly different.
</P>
<P>
   There was no brave talk of new subdivisions or shopping centers.
Instead, the task force cast the bridge replacement almost as a
mass transit project _ a way to contain the suburban sprawl that
the bridge had been built to generate in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   It said the new span should include tracks for a commuter rail
line. And to relieve the rush-hour traffic that often results in
six-mile logjams, the panel called for a new toll-collection system
that would offer discounts to off-peak travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Costly and controversial as it is sure to be, the project may
never get off the ground. But whether it does or not, it has
already signaled a fundamental shift in the way major public works
projects are conceived, promoted and packaged, not just in New York
but all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, of course, is that sprawl has become a dirty
word. When the dividends trumpeted in the 1950s turned out to have
their own costs (including the heavy traffic that has made the
Tappan Zee Bridge and other roadways obsolete), public officials
and transportation planners had to change their vocabularies.

   Diving Into the Political Mosh Pit &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a week of mosh pit politics.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, eloquent scold against the evils of popular culture,
ignited a culture war of sorts when he literally threw himself into
a mosh pit to the music of Rage Against the Machine, a stunt
orchestrated by the maverick filmmaker Michael Moore. Gary Bauer,
Keyes' rival on the conservative right, upbraided him during the
Republican debate in New Hampshire for demeaning the solemn quest
for high office. (Bauer, meanwhile, did nothing for his own hipness
quotient by mangling the name of the popular band.)
</P>
<P>
   The larger mosh pit was the campaign itself: a week of jousting
as the race got wilder in snowbound New Hampshire. There, a simple
fact confronted those who would be president: Bill Clinton was the
only aspirant since 1952 to be elected without winning the nation's
first true primary.
</P>
<P>
   Racing from the Iowa caucuses, where social conservatism plays
well, to libertarian, tax-averse New Hampshire, the candidates
shifted tactics sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, adopting a risky new strategy that
could tarnish his above-the-fray luster, went on the attack after
Vice President Al Gore drubbed him in Iowa; each is now accusing
the other of resorting to that campaign no-no, negativity. Bradley
accused the vice president of lying and unleashed two surrogate pit
bulls, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Niki Tsongas, the widow of
Sen. Paul Tsongas, to attack Gore for distorting Bradley's record.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Iowa victor, found himself
squeezed harder from both the right (Steve Forbes and Keyes both
gained momentum in Iowa) and the left (Sen. John McCain, who
skipped Iowa to save money for New Hampshire, is seeking to attract
large numbers of independent voters in New Hampshire with his
reform-minded centrist platform).
</P>
<P>
   And the tone of the campaign got nastier for everyone, with the
abortion issue emerging again as the great divide.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, Keyes and Bauer confronted Bush on the issue, pushing
him to take a more conservative stand. Meanwhile, Bradley hit Gore
for being inconsistent in his commitment to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively small numbers of voters in the Iowa caucuses and
the New Hampshire primary are not really representative of the
country as a whole. But the contests are crucial in winnowing the
field (Sen. Orrin Hatch dropped out after winning no delegates in
Iowa, and endorsed Bush) and in helping candidates gather steam for
the decisive primaries in big states like California and New York.

   Freshman Year as Stress Test
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the fast-paced, multimedia society that surrounds
them. Maybe it's the mounting costs of higher education. Or maybe
it's the fact that just getting into college has become more
competitive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This year's first-year college students are more stressed out
than any in a generation, according to a national survey by
researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles; in the
survey, 30.2 percent said they feel ``frequently overwhelmed by all
I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly twice as many women (38.8 percent) as men (20 percent)
were found to be swimming in stress. Then again, the women reported
spending more time studying and doing volunteer work, while the men
logged more hours watching television and playing videogames.
</P>
<P>
   But just wait _ the survey was conducted during the students'
first days on campuses across the country. Imagine the stress in a
couple of weeks, when final exams start.

   A Hint in the High Court On Campaign Funding
</P>
<P>
   To the many critics of the current system of raising money for
political campaigns, the Supreme Court has been part of the
problem, not the solution. Critics point to the 1976 Buckley vs.
Valeo decision, which upheld federal limits on contributions while
ruling that as an aspect of free speech, campaign expenditures
could not be curbed.
</P>
<P>
   A decision last week indicated that the justices might be
growing increasingly attentive to the criticism and inclined, in
some future case, to address it. The 6-3 ruling itself, upholding
Missouri's $1,000 contribution cap for statewide races, simply
reaffirmed the contribution side of the Buckley vs. Valeo equation,
and in that sense made little new law.
</P>
<P>
   But four justices, in separate opinions, indicated an openness
to considering aspects of Buckley that were not before the court
this time: whether the Constitution really forbids any interference
with the uncontrolled flood of money into politics, whether through
independent expenditures or contributions of unlimited and often
unaccountable soft money.

   A Little Boy Gets To See His Grandmothers
</P>
<P>
   Two grim grandmothers from Cuba bounded from New York to
Washington to Miami and back again in a desperate attempt to bring
their 6-year-old grandson, Elian Gonzalez, home to his father. The
Justice Department, too, wants them to take the boy, who was
rescued last Thanksgiving after his mother drowned at sea while
fleeing Cuba with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's paternal relatives in Little Havana, with the
financial and promotional support of Miami's anti-Castro Cuban
exile community, want permanent custody for themselves, and so far
the courts have allowed them to keep the boy with them.
</P>
<P>
   As Elian's custodians whisk him in luxury cars to the circus and
Disney World and feed him the trinkets of America's consumer
society _ a battery-powered go-cart, a cell phone, gold chains and
Nintendo games _ they may already have captured his heart.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting with him privately Wednesday, one grandmother
said, ``He's changed completely.''

   U.S. Warns Pakistan
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly not a list most nations care to join. But the
United States is warning Pakistan that it may soon join Iran and
Iraq on the State Department's official list of nations that
support terrorism, which could mean new economic sanctions on that
already impoverished nation.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the Pakistani army's support for a terrorist
Kashmiri group blamed for the hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet.
Asked earlier this month by a group of visiting administration
officials to ban the group, Pakistan's new military leader refused.

   New Focus in Terror Probe
</P>
<P>
   The focus of inquiry into the group of Montreal-based men
accused of plotting a terrorist attack in America has shifted from
Algeria to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Though several of the Algerians accused in the plot were once
members of an Algerian militant group that had never before
targeted Americans, investigators have come to believe that the
head of the alleged terrorist cell was a Mauritanian with ties not
to Algeria, but to Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi charged in the
1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington's request, Senegal arrested the Mauritanian,
Mohambedou Ould Slahi, the alleged head of the Montreal Algerian
cell. The Justice Department sought his extradition to America.

   After nearly a year of wrangling over how to send arms
inspectors back to Iraq and who would lead them, the U.N. Security
Council named a compromise chief inspector, Hans Blix, the former
director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Blix, a Swede, was pushed by France, which was
looking for a candidate Iraq might be able to work with. The United
States, eager to avoid another prolonged crisis over Iraq, quickly
agreed; Washington's preferred candidate, Rolf Ekeus, had been
blocked in the council by France and Russia.

   Aid, Please. But No Strings.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana of Colombia went to Washington to
campaign for a proposed $1.3 billion in aid, and he opened with a
plea for bipartisanship. He got that right away.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who had pressed for more support for Colombia,
began complaining about the plan outlined by the Clinton
administration. Liberal Democrats liked the plan even less, and
said they would try to link any new aid to the human rights
performance of the Colombian army.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said he wanted no such conditions. Progress on human
rights would come, he insisted, but not because of pressure from
abroad.

   A New Look at Illnesses In Nuclear Bomb Plants
</P>
<P>
   For years some researchers have claimed that the 600,000 people
who have helped build nuclear bombs are prone to all kinds of
illnesses as a result. But from the time of the Manhattan Project,
the government said it wasn't so. Now the White House and the
Energy Department are preparing a review of years of data and
studies that accepts the idea that there are extra cases of cancer
among that population.
</P>
<P>
   The review, due to be completed in about two months, will not
settle the debate over how many more cancer cases the exposures
caused, and will not say how much radiation is safe. But it is a
marked turnaround in federal policy.

   Reeling from a year of falling profits and other problems at
home and abroad, the Coca-Cola Co. said it would cut 6,000
employees, or one-fifth of its worldwide workforce, in the largest
layoff ever for the soft-drink giant.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would take an $800 million charge against
earnings to cover severance and other costs related to the cuts,
and added that it expected its bottlers in several key markets to
buy less concentrate this year, further eroding profits.

   Barak's Party Is Fined
</P>
<P>
   Israel's state comptroller issued a sharply worded report
accusing the ruling party of violating campaign finance laws during
the election last year in which Ehud Barak was elected prime
minister, and the party was placed under criminal investigation.
The comptroller, Eliezer Goldberg, fined Barak's One Israel Party
$3.2 million but did not implicate the prime minister personally in
the alleged violations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who said he had advised his associates to operate
legally, said he welcomed the investigation as a way to clear up
ambiguities in the election law.

   NASHUA, N.H. _ After securing first place in the Iowa caucuses
last Monday night, an ebullient Texas Gov. George W. Bush
proclaimed ``the beginning of the end of the Clinton era.'' But
three evenings later there was a resurgent Bill Clinton before the
nation, using his last, and longest, State of the Union address to
frame the 2000 campaign with an expansive, activist agenda designed
to appeal to the great American middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton era will end, as all political moments must, but as
this past week demonstrated, that time has not yet come. In truth,
Clinton's influence pervades this presidential race. He has forced
the main candidates into a delicate balancing act: running against
the president's scandalous persona while hewing closely to the
political center he defined through seven turbulent years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to what the candidates here are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reaches out to those ``weary of polls and posturing,'' but
his very self-definition as a ``compassionate conservative''
signals that he will fight to keep a safe distance from the
fire-breathing House conservatives, once led by Newt Gingrich, whom
Clinton has soundly defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief rival, Sen. John McCain, fervently promises
audiences that ``I will never lie to you,'' but puts forward a plan
for tax cuts and Social Security that Clinton himself might have
written. Asked at the GOP debate last week whether his plan looks
like Clinton's, he could only huff, ``Well, I think President
Clinton's looks too much like mine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, former Sen. Bill Bradley talks of being
as ``straight as I can possibly be'' and then calls for ambitious
domestic programs only to see Clinton steal his thunder Thursday
night by calling for major new initiatives on everything from
health care to education to poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, began his campaign with
pointed comments about the need for character in high office,
explicitly seeking to distance himself from Clinton. But he has
abruptly reversed field and begun boasting about the Clinton-Gore
economic record. Last Thursday, he was once more in his familiar
place nodding as Clinton called on Congress to ``build the more
perfect union of our founders' dreams,''and trying not to smile as
his boss repeatedly heaped praise upon him.
</P>
<P>
   The political gyrations of the candidates only mirror the
ambivalence of the nation. New Hampshire voters, still numbed by
last year's impeachment crisis, sometimes come very close to
begging the new crop of presidential candidates not to behave like
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ever embarrass us,'' Bob Elliott, a 67-year-old retired
teacher, told McCain at a town hall meeting in Salem last week.
``When you go to Washington, you've got to assume the vows of the
priesthood of being a president. Now we don't expect you to be
celibate, but we do expect you to be faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, the nation embraces Clinton's view of
government. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll taken earlier this month
found that 50 percent of voters wanted to continue Clinton's
policies. Only 10 percent wanted a more liberal approach to
government. And 33 percent wanted more conservative policies. This
is a remarkable rating for a president entering his eighth year,
eclipsing even Ronald Reagan in his final year.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from the ``Clinton fatigue'' political
commentators were talking about just a few weeks ago. Al From, head
of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council and one of the
Democratic strategists who helped Clinton frame his centrist
appeal, said the election is not about searching for the
anti-Clinton at all. Rather, it is about ``who can give us
Clinton's third term?''
</P>
<P>
   For no matter how much he disgraced himself, Clinton does seem
to have made good on his second-term pledge to find the ``vital
American center.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans protest that it was they who forced Clinton to the
center when they won control of Congress in 1994 and pushed him to
agree to a balanced budget and to overhaul welfare.
``Fundamentally, it's been him hijacking our signature issues,''
said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist affiliated with the
McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's accommodations were strategic, blunting the issues
Republicans had long used against the Democrats and shifting the
political debate to health care, education, Social Security and
Medicare _ terrain long favorable to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The president did it again last Thursday night, mapping the
trail for his fellow Democrats as he set forth an agenda that
included gun safety, an increase in the minimum wage and a ``21st
century revolution'' in education.
</P>
<P>
   And in his call for a $350 billion tax cut he once again played
the political cat-burglar, filching the Republicans' idea of
eliminating the so-called marriage penalty, which causes some
married couples to pay more taxes than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Political strategists differ sharply over which side of Clinton
will dominate the coming election: his personality or his programs.
Steve Duprey, the New Hampshire Republican chairman, insists that
the nation wants Clinton off the stage. ``People up here are very
tired of the Clinton administration,'' he said. ``I think that's
one of Gore's biggest difficulties.''

   But Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, says that the public
is comfortable with Clinton's policies and that Bush will prove
vulnerable because of his call for a sweeping $483 billion tax cut
over five years, which Democrats _ and even McCain _ charge favors
the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budgets increasingly have become the way of defining political
philosophy,'' Garin said. ``And where Clinton has beat the
Republicans fairly consistently is on the question of priorities.
And a Bush budget reflects a very different philosophy than what
Clinton and the Democrats represent.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, for example, has used issues like paying down the
national debt, balancing the budget and saving Social Security to
steal the mantle of fiscal conservatism from the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night the Republicans often sat poker-faced as
Democrats rose and cheered, while the president set out his program
for the year 2000. Even before the speech, GOP leaders had
denounced Clinton as a profligate spender.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we enacted all the new programs the president has talked
about, we'd spend just about the entire surplus on bigger and more
expensive government,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional Republicans have already fled their own $792
billion tax cut package, which Clinton successfully defeated by
casting as a threat to Social Security and debt reduction. And both
Republican presidential and congressional candidates are being
called on to put forth their own plans for health care reform,
patient rights and education because the president has made the
case for them so effectively with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody recently remarked that while Clinton may be a lame
duck, he's still flapping his wings. So don't be surprised if, come
November, the GOP finds itself scrambling once again in reaction to
a master politician's valedictory agenda.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 30, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CAMPAIGN-REVIEW (Nashua, N.H.) _ Bill Clinton is casting
a large shadow over this presidential race, and may cast one over
the next presidency. So as the New Hampshire primary nears, the
main candidates are trying a delicate balancing act: running
against Clinton's scandalous persona while not straying too far
from the political center he has defined in seven turbulent years
in office. By Alison Mitchell. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-ISLAM-REVIEW (UNdated) _ Iranians are anguished after a
generation under ``the government of God'' and yearn for change.
Having wrested power from the shah in 1979 and created an
intolerant, often vengeful theocratic state that has ruined Iran's
economy, sponsored terrorist groups and left the country profoundly
isolated, most Shiite clerics are now widely unpopular. By John F.
Burns. (Moved in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SUBURBAN-SPRAWL-REVIEW (Undated) _ There has been subtle but
fundamental shift in the way major public works projects are
conceived, promoted and packaged: Sprawl has become a dirty word.
When the dividends trumpeted in the 1950s turned out to have their
own costs, officials and planners had to change their vocabularies.
Rather than proclaim the merits of suburban development and car
travel, they are framing new road projects in cautious, modest
terms, often coupled with ideas for mass transit and relief of
traffic congestion. Al Gore has made such initiatives a centerpiece
of his campaign. By David Chen. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-VOTING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Unlike established companies
that make traditional voting machines and maintain low public
profiles, startup companies that produce Internet voting software
are issuing press releases, placing their members on state advisory
boards, lobbying legislatures and persuading party officials that
trials in Internet voting would bring national attention to their
pet issues. But not everyone sees e-voting as a portal to a more
democratic future. By Rebecca Fairley Raney.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-DEFENSE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Politics, both domestic
and international, is driving the Clinton administration's
divergent public-private views on missile defenses. At stake are
not only U.S. defenses against new 21st-century menaces, and
whether the technology is ready to field, but also relations with
Russia, China and staunch European allies, all of whom are alarmed
by Washington's push to build a system. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   SNACKS-PERSONALITIES-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Snack Food
Association and the National Potato Promotion Board have
commissioned a study linking people's snack preferences with their
personality types. Surprise: People who inhale potato chips aren't
necessarily porcine gluttons but ``ambitious, successful, high
achievers.'' And cheese doodle lovers aren't slobs with orange
fingers but ``formal, always proper, conscientious, principled.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP-TAXCUTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Republicans try to decide
whether to bank on tax cuts once again as the best policy and the
best electoral strategy for winning the White House. For the first
time since 1980, the conservative orthodoxy on tax cuts in being
challenged from within the GOP. The challenger is John McCain, who
has attacked George W. Bush's plan in language redolent both of
old-style fiscal conservatism and Democratic class warfare. By
Richard W. Stevenson.

   GERMANY-ITALY-REVIEW (Berlin) _ The Christian Democrats in
Germany and Italy are crumbling in tandem. And it is not just the
Sicilian echoes of Helmut Kohl's behavior that has summoned Italy
into the midst of Germany's political crisis. The difficulties of
German Christian Democracy inevitably invite parallels with those
of Italy's Democrazia Cristiana, a party whose utter dominance of
post-war Italian politics was matched only by the unutterable speed
of its disintegration in the early 1990s. The similarities are
intriguing. By Roger Cohen.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 30, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CAMPAIGN-REVIEW (Nashua, N.H.) _ Bill Clinton is casting
a large shadow over this presidential race, and may cast one over
the next presidency. So as the New Hampshire primary nears, the
main candidates are trying a delicate balancing act: running
against Clinton's scandalous persona while not straying too far
from the political center he has defined in seven turbulent years
in office. By Alison Mitchell. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-ISLAM-REVIEW (UNdated) _ Iranians are anguished after a
generation under ``the government of God'' and yearn for change.
Having wrested power from the shah in 1979 and created an
intolerant, often vengeful theocratic state that has ruined Iran's
economy, sponsored terrorist groups and left the country profoundly
isolated, most Shiite clerics are now widely unpopular. By John F.
Burns. (Moved in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SUBURBAN-SPRAWL-REVIEW (Undated) _ There has been subtle but
fundamental shift in the way major public works projects are
conceived, promoted and packaged: Sprawl has become a dirty word.
When the dividends trumpeted in the 1950s turned out to have their
own costs, officials and planners had to change their vocabularies.
Rather than proclaim the merits of suburban development and car
travel, they are framing new road projects in cautious, modest
terms, often coupled with ideas for mass transit and relief of
traffic congestion. Al Gore has made such initiatives a centerpiece
of his campaign. By David Chen. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-VOTING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Unlike established companies
that make traditional voting machines and maintain low public
profiles, startup companies that produce Internet voting software
are issuing press releases, placing their members on state advisory
boards, lobbying legislatures and persuading party officials that
trials in Internet voting would bring national attention to their
pet issues. But not everyone sees e-voting as a portal to a more
democratic future. By Rebecca Fairley Raney.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-DEFENSE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Politics, both domestic
and international, is driving the Clinton administration's
divergent public-private views on missile defenses. At stake are
not only U.S. defenses against new 21st-century menaces, and
whether the technology is ready to field, but also relations with
Russia, China and staunch European allies, all of whom are alarmed
by Washington's push to build a system. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   SNACKS-PERSONALITIES-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Snack Food
Association and the National Potato Promotion Board have
commissioned a study linking people's snack preferences with their
personality types. Surprise: People who inhale potato chips aren't
necessarily porcine gluttons but ``ambitious, successful, high
achievers.'' And cheese doodle lovers aren't slobs with orange
fingers but ``formal, always proper, conscientious, principled.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP-TAXCUTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Republicans try to decide
whether to bank on tax cuts once again as the best policy and the
best electoral strategy for winning the White House. For the first
time since 1980, the conservative orthodoxy on tax cuts in being
challenged from within the GOP. The challenger is John McCain, who
has attacked George W. Bush's plan in language redolent both of
old-style fiscal conservatism and Democratic class warfare. By
Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   TRADITIONS-SCIENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Much indigenous or
traditional knowledge has been found to have a sound scientific
basis. In agriculture, nutrition, medicine and other fields, modern
research is showing why traditional peoples do the things they do.

   &UR; FOR SUNDAY AMs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of SUNDAY, Jan. 30:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GLOBALIZATION (Davos, Switzerland) _ Against a sudden
wave of angst among corporate and political leaders about the
growing gap between rich and poor, President Clinton made an
impassioned appeal Saturday to make globalization work for the
poor, too. By Jane Perlez and Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-DRAFTDODGERS (Moscow) _ Getting out of the Russian draft
is, in many ways, similar to unraveling other Russian bureaucratic
tangles: It takes intimate knowledge of arcane rules and
regulations, and a readiness to juggle family, residence and more
to avoid a direct conflict with the authorities. If all else fails,
you can try to buy your way out of a situation _ provided that you
have the means. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   MALI-SCHOOLS (Timbuktu, Mali) _ The Tindjambane community
primary school consists of just two tents of thatch walls and roofs
above carpets for the schoolchildren to sit on and blackboards for
the teachers to write on. All told, it amounted to a $60 investment
for the desert nomads who have settled in the area. But as the
first school the people have ever had, it can only be regarded as a
triumph. This school is playing a modest part in an ambitious
campaign by this poor, landlocked nation in West Africa to put more
children into the classroom. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   ECUADOR-REACT (Quito, Ecuador) _ In presidential palaces and
defense ministries all across Latin America last week, the same
question was being nervously asked in the wake of the military coup
here that toppled President Jamil Mahuad: Can it happen again
somewhere else? By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-BLAIR (London) _ Since coming to power in May 1997, Tony
Blair has enjoyed the highest public approval ratings of any prime
minister in Britain's history. But over the past weeks he has
suffered setbacks that have given rise to press articles describing
an enveloping crisis and suggesting that he is starting to lose his
sure and steady grip on the affections of the British electorate.
By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-ISRAEL (Istanbul, Turkey) _ When a 12-year-old earthquake
victim named Elif Gunduz boards a plane for Israel on Sunday, she
will become the latest symbol of how completely last August's
severe and deadly quake has changed Turkey and reshaped its role in
the world. More than humanitarian concern motivates this
generosity. Israel has seized on the earthquake and its victims _
more than 17,000 people were killed, many thousands injured and
hundreds of thousands made homeless _ as a way to improve its image
in Turkey. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   BIOTECHNOLOGY-TRADE (Montreal) _ Delegates from more than 130
nations adopted the first global treaty regulating trade in
genetically modified products, setting up an international
framework for the increasingly contentious debate about foods made
with biotechnology. By Andrew Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-TALENT-AGENT (Tokyo) _ In the cutthroat world of Japanese
show business, which is dominated by teen idols, few people
exercise the power and creative genius of Johnny Kitagawa. By
Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   TV-REALITY-SHOWS (Undated) _ Just months after a game show
imported from England transformed the competitive landscape of
network television, a new wave of television formats developed in
Europe, all based on real-life experience voyeuristically captured
on camera, is poised to invade prime-time network schedules,
bringing the potential to shake up the Hollywood entertainment
industry. By Bill Carter.
</P>
<P>
   FUEL-COSTS (Undated) _ The recent run-up in energy prices is
rippling across the American economy and affecting practically
every family and business, as it becomes more expensive to heat a
home, refuel an automobile or buy an airline ticket. By Keith
Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   STORM-SOUTH (Atlanta) _ A fresh layer of ice caused hundreds of
traffic accidents around northern Georgia Saturday as the region
was slammed by a storm that had swept across the South with more
than a foot of snow. (Summary from wires.)
</P>
<P>
   VEGAS-SHRINE (Las Vegas) _ Its face turned toward the glittery,
new casino-hotels on the southern end of Las Vegas Boulevard, a
life-sized statue of Jesus spreads its arms wide, as if to embrace
the throngs of tourists milling about. And, as if responding to the
invitation, many do make their way from the boulevard, the famous
Strip, to the Roman Catholic Shrine of the Most Holy Redeemer,
where people have been known to toss casino chips into the offering
plates. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   RACKETEERING-JUDGE (Douglas, Ariz.) _ The arrest of the local
judge in this southwest border town on drug racketeering and money
laundering charges last fall seemed to be one more disturbing sign
that the multibillion-dollar narcotics trade was corrupting law
enforcement, not only in Mexico, but north of the border, too. But
prosecutors preparing for the trial of the judge, Ronald J. Borane,
have said that details emerging from scrutiny of his lengthy career
suggest that he learned to disregard the law long before Douglas
became a crossroads in the international drug trade. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   COWBOY-POETRY (Elko, Nev.) _ Last week, Charlie Recora, a
building contractor from Garberville, Calif., packed his old-style
Stetson hat, black leather vest, wine red shirt and best cowboy
boots and headed to Elko for the 16th annual Cowboy Poetry
Gathering. Recora's enthusiasms are widely shared. Nearly 8,000
people from every state except Hawaii plus a smattering of foreign
countries made their way to Elko for eight days of poetry sessions,
workshops, music and dancing. By Sandra Blakeslee.
</P>
<P>
   AIR&AMP;SPACE-RENOVATE (Washington) _ As an airy space for
displaying spaceships and pioneering aircraft, the Smithsonian
Institution's National Air and Space Museum pulls relentlessly at
anyone within eyesight. But the museum's extensive skylights are
leaky, letting in water that stains the walls, irritates visitors
and even endangers some of the museum's artifacts, officials say.
So the museum is going through a three-and-a-half-year renovation
costing $22 million, more than half what it cost to build the
museum in the mid-1970s, much of it for a new skylight system.
</P>
<P>
   PRISONS-LOCAL-CONTROL (New York) _ In a series of landmark
decisions more than 20 years ago, judges across the country
intervened to force cities and states from New York to Texas to
maintain humane conditions in their prisons. They required prisons
to reduce crowding, discipline violent guards and provide basic
health care. But now, using a little-noticed federal law signed by
President Clinton in 1996, many of those cities and states are
moving to free themselves from court supervision. Ten localities
have won initial rulings to regain control of their prisons, and at
least 10 more are pressing judges to do the same. By John Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-FUNDRAISING (Washington) _ George W. Bush began his
campaign last March with an unassuming one-page letter. Almost as
an aside, the recipients were asked to contribute a few dollars.
Within four weeks, Bush had collected an astonishing $7.6 million.
By Don Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-HEART (Concord, N.H.) _ In their first comprehensive
interviews on the topic, Bill Bradley and his three cardiologists
said the former senator was in excellent physical condition and his
bouts of irregular heartbeat were not a serious hazard to his
health, or to his ability to serve as president, despite their
recent increased frequency. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Gore's ad challenge an old refrain;
a crowded ballot; California GOP split on gay marriage; California
Hispanics favor Gore, poll says. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>

ON TV, NEW VOYEURISM SHOWS REAL INTIMACIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just months after a game show imported from Britain transformed
the competitive landscape of network television, a new wave of
television formats developed in Europe, all based on real-life
experience voyeuristically captured on camera, is poised to invade
prime-time network schedules in the United States, bringing the
potential to shake up the Hollywood entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   The shows range from on-camera examinations of people trying to
survive on a desert island off Borneo to people trying to get along
while locked together in various settings of forced intimacy _ in a
house, on a bus or a tourist vacation, in a home set up to match
conditions in at the end of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The shows, many of which will have ambitious Internet
components, have been described as various combinations of MTV's
cinema verite show ``The Real World,'' the syndicated talk show
``Jerry Springer'' and the influential game show from Britain,
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' One show makes its Orwellian
aura overt: It is called ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the shows have been significant hits in various
European countries. ``Big Brother'' is a phenomenon in the
Netherlands, even spawning a second series, a talk show where the
events on the show are exhaustively discussed.
</P>
<P>
   It is the chance for the networks _ which have losing viewers to
cable television for at least a decade _ to create the kind of
phenomenon in the United States that ABC did with ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire,'' which is driving network executives to pursue the
other inventive European television formats that break the mold of
comedies, dramas and news programs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the bidding for the American version of ``Big Brother''
reached a fever pitch last week, with prices escalating to a point
where one senior network executive labeled the process ``totally
nuts.'' A deal for ``Big Brother'' is expected this week, with CBS
the front-runner. In a first, plans call for the show to run for
100 consecutive nights in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   That would give CBS the first two examples of this genre,
because the network is already deep into its planning for a
13-episode summer series called ``Survivor'' _ a giant hit in
Sweden _ in which 16 people will be stranded on an island off
Borneo, charged with finding ways to survive. One cast member will
be eliminated each week by vote of the other contestants until one
is the final survivor, winning $1 million. ``Survivor'' has lined
up eight sponsors, and they will be given product-placement
opportunities. For example, Reebok is a sponsor; the contestants
are likely to be wearing Reebok shoes.
</P>

<P>
   Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television, said the move
toward these wilder formats reflected the network's conclusion that
tried-and-true television, like situation comedies on brightly lit
Hollywood sound stages, now leaves many American viewers cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is people are realizing you need to be
different,'' Moonves said. ``You can't go with the same old meat
and potatoes anymore. You've got to shake things up. And clearly
people are realizing it's a big world out there and shows really
can come from the other side of the Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality shows have an economic advantage over scripted
series: they do not employ vast numbers of writers and they have no
expensive stars at all. That points to a downside for Hollywood.
Moonves said that every game show in prime time costs the industry
100 jobs. Producers have already complained that the proliferation
of news magazines and game shows are radically shrinking prime-time
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that if the reality shows take off, there
will be a contraction in the business,'' he said. ``There could be
a real shift in who's working and not working.''

<P>
   More than anything, the move toward the European shows reflects
the impact of ``Millionaire,'' which has transformed the network
prime-time ratings race, pulling ABC from a likely third place this
season to a near-certain first-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' has already fathered a brood of game shows. Last
year there were no game shows on network prime time. Now there are
eight hours of games each week. Because ``Millionaire'' emerged
from Britain as a fully developed hit, network executives have
started looking at other European shows.
</P>
<P>
   One agent who has been in the middle of many of the negotiations
for these new programs, Ben Silverman, head of international
packaging for the William Morris Agency, lived for more than four
years in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I scoured the TV listings all over Europe looking for shows
that sounded interesting,'' Silverman said. ``The European
producers don't come from the American system. They don't have this
track record that leads them to reject certain ideas. They also
don't have the infrastructure to support shows full of writers and
stars. So they have to find innovative stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman, along with a William Morris partner in Los Angeles,
Greg Lipstone, represented the British company Celador in
negotiations with ABC for ``Millionaire,'' which was supposed to be
nothing more than a summer series. After it became a hit, Silverman
started getting calls about other European properties he had
already lined up.
</P>
<P>
   Even PBS called, securing the rights to a show produced by a
British company called Wall to Wall. This one, ``1900 House,''
involves bringing a family into a home with cameras and making them
live just as they would have a century ago _ without, for example,
television.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Big Brother,'' owned by the Dutch company Endemol
Entertainment, is currently the hottest property in this genre.
Mark Itkin, the senior vice president of William Morris for reality
programs, said: ``I had no idea the bidding would be so hot. But
the show has so many elements, from being on 100 days in a row to
an Internet component that is especially attractive to networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman first believed only a cable network would make the
commitment to Endemol's format: 100 consecutive nights of ``Big
Brother.'' But after ``Millionaire,'' three big broadcast networks
jumped into the bidding, each promising to broadcast ``Big
Brother'' essentially every single night this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' throws a group of 10 people, mostly in their
20s, into a new house constructed with cameras and recording
equipment everywhere to document their every move. In the
Netherlands that included everything from showers to sex, though an
American version is clearly not going to go that far.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, the Internet helped drive the show because
users could log onto the show's Web site, pick out certain
characters and cameras, and literally watch 24 hours a day on
streamed video.
</P>
<P>
   Each week one cast member is voted out, with viewers
participating by phone and Internet. The last cast member standing
in the Netherlands won 250,000 guilders, about $111,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the elements are similar to ``Survivor,'' so similar,
that Mark Burnett, who is producing ``Survivor'' for CBS, said the
show's British originators had filed suit against Endemol. The suit
is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett described ``Survivor'' as ``a little bit of `Truman
show' and `Lord of the Flies,' with an edgy `Gilligan's Island'
thrown in.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett is now whittling down the hundreds of applicants for
``Survivor,'' using, among other things, a battery of psychological
tests. He hopes to avoid the unfortunate outcome of the show's
first edition in Sweden, when one cast member committed suicide
after being rejected by his comrades.
</P>
<P>
   And that was in a format that was softer than the American
version. In Sweden, cast members voted for who they wanted to
remain on the island. Burnett acknowledged that the American
version will be far more Darwinian. Individuals will be voted out
by the group.
</P>
<P>
   Though CBS may lead this trend, program executives at the other
networks are likely to try to come up with their own, similar
formats.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Darnell, executive vice president of special programs for
Fox, has been highly inventive in the reality arena, coming up with
the concepts for everything from the game show ``Greed'' to ``When
Good Pets Go Bad.'' He was also the man behind the now-scrapped
idea to crash a Boeing 747 live in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell's latest brainstorm is a special, set for Feb. 15,
called ``Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire,'' in which 50 female
contestants will be whittled down by beauty pageant-like contests
and extensive interviewing to five finalists, all in wedding gowns,
one of whom will be proposed to and married on the air, live, by a
willing millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these shows are voyeuristic,'' Darnell said. ``After a
while they become soap operas. That's why casting is so important.
The people you pick will determine whether you're a hit or a
bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, founder of the Center for the Study of Popular
Television at Syracuse University, called the trend toward
voyeurism shows an inevitable confluence of advances in technology
and basic human interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popular culture is beginning to catch up with our real
behavior,'' Thompson said. ``We all talk about family values, but
that's not how most of us operate as human beings. In some ways,
this is the programmers discovering what TV was always so great at
in the first place. This is Peeping Tom to the max.''

<P>
   The recent run-up in energy prices is rippling across the U.S.
economy and affecting practically every family and business as it
becomes more expensive to heat a home, refuel an automobile or buy
an airline ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices have nearly tripled since last winter, leveling
off in the last several days at about $27 a barrel. Prices for oil
products like gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and heating oil have
soared, and natural gas has become much more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   While oil prices are nowhere near the peaks they reached in 1980
and 1991 when inflation is taken into account, they are still
beginning to have a real effect on pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Along the frozen East Coast, consumers are growing angry about
the rising cost of heating oil. Steven O'Sullivan, 40, who owns a
three-story, three-family home in Rockaway Beach, N.Y., is now
paying $410 every 10 days for heating oil deliveries that used to
cost him $270 and were only needed every two or three weeks during
the milder weather last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm getting ripped off; I feel like I'm being
taken advantage of,'' he said. ``Consumption has been down the past
few winters, so there should be a glut of oil, not a shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, motorists are finding that it costs more to
refill a gas tank. In Toledo, Ohio, Edith Davis, a 60-year-old
widow and retired sales clerk living on disability checks, has
begun carefully planning trips in her 1989 Oldsmobile Cutlass to
save money on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to the doctor, I try to make a grocery stop on
the way back,'' she said. ``This is dead in the winter, when
everything else is expensive, like your heating.''
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses are beginning to feel the pinch, too. Airlines
have added $20 fuel surcharges to the price of round-trip tickets
for travel after the end of January. And trucking companies are so
unhappy that they are discussing steep price increases or even
parking some of their trucks for a while. The trucking trade
association asked President Clinton last week to send Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to the Middle East immediately to plead
for more oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration took three small steps last week to
respond to the problem. It temporarily halted oil purchases for the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It authorized the early release of $45
million in previously budgeted federal money to state governments
to subsidize heating bills for poor families. And it proposed that
Congress allocate an extra $154 million next year to help poor
households insulate their homes better.
</P>
<P>
   But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has resisted pressure from
Northeastern senators, led by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to put
oil from the strategic reserve onto the market to help bring prices
down. Richardson contends that the reserve is intended only for
severe supply disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have been rising because the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries decided last March to cut production
by nearly 8 percent, and commercial stockpiles have dwindled since
then. So, oil remains available now but at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say that in contrast to oil price increases in 1973,
1979 and 1990, the recent climb in prices is unlikely to cause a
recession. That is partly because the economy is booming, but also
because oil makes up a much smaller share of the economy these
days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   The total value of crude oil used by the United States fell to
just 0.8 percent of the nation's economic output last year, from
5.5 percent in 1980. The percentage will bounce back if oil prices
stay high, however.
</P>
<P>
   Energy-dependent industries like petrochemical and steel
production have grown more slowly over the last two decades than
sectors of the economy that use less energy, like health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy price increases don't have the same impact that they
used to, so that's why we're not too worried about a recession,''
said Harvey Rosenblum, the senior vice president and research
director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which specializes
in energy issues.
</P>
<P>
   The regional Fed bank estimates that long-term oil prices, as
measured by futures contracts for the delivery of oil up to three
years from now, have climbed 30 percent in the last year, and that
this will reduce employment across the nation by 0.3 percent. That
is a little more than half the effect such a rise in prices would
have had in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now imports half its oil, up from 37 percent
in 1980 but still less than many European or Asian countries.
Philip Verleger, an oil expert at the Brattle Group, a Boston
consulting firm, said that Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Southern
European countries would be the biggest losers from the recent rise
in prices, while Russia, Mexico, Venezuela and Middle Eastern oil
producers would be the biggest beneficiaries. Despite some regional
problems and benefits, the United States will be among the least
affected over all, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest increase in energy prices in the United States this
winter has occurred for heating oil in the New York area and in New
England. Executives in the heating oil industry say that many
corporations, government agencies and apartment buildings now have
``interruptible service'' contracts with natural gas companies that
give them a low price provided that they stop using natural gas and
switch to heating oil during very cold weather, when demand is
high. Very cold weather recently _ and the prospect of another
winter storm _ has prompted a rush to buy heating oil by these
natural gas users, bidding up prices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil inventories in the Northeast were unusually low
before the cold snap. Recent winters had been mild, and many
storage areas have been shutting down because of tightening
environmental regulations. The result of short supplies and
interruptible natural gas contracts has been that heating oil,
which homeowners can usually buy for 20 or 30 cents less a gallon
than gasoline, cost as much as $2 a gallon last week in New York,
up sharply even from the week before. By contrast, it remains on
sale for $1.30 a gallon just 400 miles west in Cleveland, where
very few companies have interruptible contracts with natural gas
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Allison Heaney, the president of Skaggs-Walsh Inc.,
a heating oil company in College Point, Queens, said that the
manager of a midtown Manhattan apartment building had called her
last weekend asking for an immediate start of deliveries of heating
oil every eight hours around the clock to fill the small oil tank
of the building, which usually relies on natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `I'll pay any price to get the oil,' and I
thought to myself, I wish some of my regular customers would say
that,'' Ms. Heaney said, adding that she had been unable to meet
the request because all of her oil and tanker trucks were already
booked.
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry consultants say that traders seeking profits are
now sending at least a dozen tankers full of heating oil to the New
York area from Europe, where the weather has been warmer and
heating oil prices are much lower.
</P>
<P>
   While the shipments should bring New York prices down in the
next week or two, they will leave heating oil supplies low on both
sides of the Atlantic, and refineries will have trouble producing
any extra heating oil to rebuild inventories, said Roger Diwan, a
heating oil expert at the Petroleum Finance Co., a Washington-based
oil strategy company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If another cold snap happens here or in Europe, we're both
vulnerable the next time'' to a longer-lasting price increase, he
said.

LAW HELPING PRISONS ESCAPE FROM GRIP OF FEDERAL COURTS

<P>
   In a series of landmark decisions more than 20 years ago, judges
across the country intervened to force cities and states from New
York to Texas to maintain humane conditions in their prisons. They
required prisons to reduce crowding, discipline violent guards and
provide basic health care.
</P>
<P>
   But now, using a little-noticed federal law signed by President
Clinton in 1996, many of those cities and states are moving to free
themselves from court supervision. Ten localities have won initial
rulings to regain control of their prisons, and at least 10 more
are pressing judges to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is New York City, where corrections officials have
filed suit to end a 22-year-old agreement that set strict standards
for nearly all aspects of prison life, from sanitation to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the legal activity has been spurred by the Prison
Litigation Reform Act, tacked onto a spending bill, which made it
much easier for local governments to end court orders involving
prisons. The law was intended, in the words of one of its chief
legislative proponents, to ``restrain liberal federal judges who
see violations of constitutional rights in every prisoner
complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials and lawyers for inmates agree that the statute
has significantly shifted the balance in court cases involving
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Before the law was passed, judges who took control of prisons
remained in charge until states and cities could prove they had
made every required improvement. In some cases, this meant a few
years of court oversight; in others, including New York City, it
turned into decades.
</P>
<P>
   The law invites local officials to file suits demanding an end
to the court orders. It requires judges to suspend court
supervision within 90 days unless inmates can prove that the
current conditions violate constitutional protections against
``cruel and unusual punishment.'' If the inmates succeed, the court
supervision continues. But after two years, corrections officials
can once again demand an end to the supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for inmates say they fear that ending court
supervision will eventually worsen conditions for the 1.2 million
men and women behind bars in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the guarantee of those orders,'' said Elizabeth
Alexander, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
National Prison Project, ``there is no natural barrier to prevent
conditions from returning to the horrendous level they were a
generation ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the federal law say it is working exactly as
intended. Several states, including Washington, Florida and
Arkansas, have already ended court supervision of parts of their
prison systems. The law's supporters say it allows more flexibility
in running prisons, and eliminates outdated requirements that have
made prisons more expensive and difficult to administer. In
particular, they say, it reins in federal judges who have
overstepped their authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges were not in the business of protecting constitutional
rights, they were in the business of running prisons,'' said Ross
Sandler, a law professor at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler said that Congress struck a balance so that ``courts
will intrude into state and local management of prisons only when
necessary and only as long as necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal judges have issued sharply differing rulings about
whether the law is constitutional, and the Supreme Court agreed
last year to review an Indiana case to settle part of the issue. In
that case, a circuit court ruled that part of the law violated the
constitutional principle that bars Congress from dictating judicial
decisions to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the battle is being joined in federal courts
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the state has asked a federal judge to end a court
order that has governed prison conditions since 1980. The judge
declined, saying the federal law was unconstitutional. In addition,
he ruled that Texas inmates face an unacceptable threat of
violence, living in ``a fear that is incomprehensible to most of
the state's free-world citizens.'' The case is under review by a
circuit court of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, state lawyers have called for the dismissal of a
1984 court-supervised agreement that ordered the dismantling of the
Southern Michigan State Prison, at the time the largest walled
prison in the world. State lawyers say conditions have improved and
the court's continued involvement is unnecessary. But lawyers for
the inmates disagreed, noting that while Michigan had broken up the
prison, it had not completed work on the jails to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, the attorney general has successfully sued to
dismiss 22 jail cases since 1996, arguing that conditions had
improved and that federal law required judges to end their
supervision. Before the 1970s, judges were reluctant to become
directly involved in running prisons, although courts did intervene
in some cases, typically over religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when lawyers, often fresh from civil rights
battles, began to argue that the conditions in many prisons were so
horrendous they violated the Constitution's protections against
cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest cases came in New York City, after a riot in
a notorious Manhattan jail called the Tombs. After six years of
litigation, the city agreed in 1978 to settle the case. The city's
jails have been under court supervision ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jails were falling apart,'' said John Boston, director of
the Legal Aid Society's Prisoners Rights Project. ``They were too
hot, too cold; kitchens were operated in ways that promoted
food-borne illness; facilities were infested with rodents and
vermin.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the city gutted the Tombs and built a new
jail on the site. It expanded the Rikers Island jails to 22,000
beds from 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now the city says conditions have improved and there is no need
to continue the court's involvement. City lawyers say corrections
officials have to follow more than 1,000 pages of judicial
guidelines on topics ranging from cooking to window washing.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Goodman, the city's lawyer, said New York had fixed ``all
the major things.'' The jails have been repaired or replaced, they
are no longer overcrowded, and violence is under control. But she
said that when maintenance problems cropped up, they were blown out
of proportion by vigilant Legal Aid lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a paper chase,'' Ms. Goodman said. ``The Legal
Aid Society is looking for perfect jails and perfect compliance.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Boston said judges had required city officials to operate
under specific guidelines because they repeatedly failed to follow
court orders. Each time the city fails to keep its word, he said,
judges have made the guidelines more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Fire safety has been a longstanding problem, and it remains
unsolved, Boston said. In November 1998, the court ordered the city
to correct serious fire violations at jails in Brooklyn and the
Bronx, and on Rikers Island. The violations included broken fire
alarms and sprinklers and inoperable fire doors.
</P>
<P>
   In a court appearance in December, Boston listed a series of
problems that Legal Aid representatives found during a tour of one
jail. ``There is a continuing infestation of insects and rodents in
kitchens and food-storage areas of some of the jails,'' he said.
``We went to the infirmary, and there was no heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Other areas, he said, had average temperatures above 90 degrees.
Some cells had no lights; others had no water because sinks did not
work.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, 1996, a month after the federal law was signed, city
lawyers appeared in court asking a judge to end the case. They
cited the federal law as support for their position.
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed to do so, but Legal Aid lawyers appealed to
federal circuit court, which sent the case back to the Manhattan
judge for hearings. Those hearings have been scheduled for next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates' lawyers in Oklahoma say the tangled history of the East
Cell House is a case study of how judicial oversight can make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, prisoners sued over conditions at the Oklahoma
State Penitentiary. After years of litigation, a judge ordered the
state to close the East Cell House in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Bullock, a lawyer for the prisoners, visited the jail and
said the conditions were medieval. Raw sewage ran down the walls.
Live electrical wires hung exposed throughout the jail.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the end of the story. The prison population
boomed in Oklahoma in the 1990s, and Bullock said hard-pressed
corrections officials began housing inmates in the East Cell
Housein 1995, even though the court order closing it remained in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Several inmates received electrical shocks and one was
electrocuted. Bullock went back to court, and two years later, the
department closed the East Cell House once again.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma corrections officials said the two years of imprisoning
inmates in East Cell House was a temporary measure while the state
found additional prison space through private contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a good answer, but it was better than the options
we had at the time,'' said Jerry Massie, a corrections spokesman.
Massie said the Oklahoma prison system had ``progressed an
incredible distance'' since the court's supervision began in the
1970s. The state is now asking a federal judge to end all court
supervision of its prisons, citing the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock said that would be a mistake, both for inmates and for
the prison system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Shutting off the prisons from the federal courts is something
that the nation is going to greatly regret,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law has always allowed judges to end court supervision
of prisons, and many states were relieved of court orders before
1996, including the Tennessee prisons, which house 17,000 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a federal judge approved an agreement between Tennessee
corrections officials and inmates to end overcrowding and violence
in all its state prisons. Negotiations over the case were initiated
after riots in the state prisons in the summer of 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Under the court's supervision, the state improved conditions,
reduced crowding and built two new prisons. ``There is no question,
they were entirely different places,'' said Claire Drowota,
executive director of the Legislature's corrections committee.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee asked the court to end its oversight, and in 1993, a
judge agreed the state had done enough.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Ms. Drowota said, the number of inmates has
continued to increase, even as the state has reduced its
corrections staff.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report from the Tennessee treasurer's office, the
state cut 400 jobs from the Department of Corrections in 1997 and
consolidated 11 prisons into five. The report said that annual
violations of regulations governing mental health care, fire
safety, occupational safety and hazardous materials increased
significantly. There were also six escapes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Donal Campbell, the state corrections commissioner, criticized
the report as unsubstantiated. He said the staff cuts and the
prison consolidations had allowed the state to save money. And he
insisted that the system was still well run, and that violence had
not increased after oversight ended. Campbell said he joined the
department as a corrections officer in the 1970s, ``when we were
having escapes and stabbings every day.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the improvements made under pressure of the
lawsuit had not eroded since the court ended its supervision.
``This system is in as good shape as it has ever been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drowota disagreed. She said a number of the recent changes,
increasing the number of prisoners in each cell or cutting staff,
would not have been allowed by the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no enforcement power whatsoever to see that these
changes are not made,'' she said. ``The oversight committee can
simply point things out, and state what they believe to be a trend
back to the original conditions that caused the problems.''

AFTER QUAKE, TURKEY GAINS STRONGER FOREIGN TIES 
</HEADLINE>

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When a 12-year-old earthquake victim named
Elif Gunduz boards a plane for Israel on Sunday, she will become
the latest symbol of how completely last August's severe and deadly
quake has changed Turkey and reshaped its role in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Elif spent 80 hours buried beneath the rubble of her home in the
shattered town of Golcuk until an Israeli rescue team, part of a
relief operation that included construction of a fully equipped
field hospital, pulled her out. A Jewish charity has taken her
under its wing, buying her a computer, paying for her schoolbooks
and now sending her to Israel for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   More than humanitarian concern motivates this generosity. Israel
has seized on the earthquake and its victims _ more than 17,000
people were killed, many thousands injured and hundreds of
thousands made homeless _ as a way to improve its image in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that Turkish people know about Israel they get from
pictures of Israeli soldiers beating Palestinians,'' said Ami
Bergman, an official of the New York-based American Jewish Joint
Distribution Committee, which is sponsoring Elif's trip to Israel.
``We want to show them another side, the side that gives life
instead of taking life.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the earthquake shattered western Turkey, the
political tremors have not subsided. Rarely has a natural disaster
had such far-reaching political and psychological effects on a
country.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake's impact on relations between Turkey and Israel
is a vivid example. Ties between the two governments had already
become close, but few ordinary Turks celebrated the new friendship.
Many still viewed Israel as a county dedicated to oppressing
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Israeli aid after the earthquake, and continued
Israeli interest in helping victims like Elif, however, that view
has begun to change. ``I had read some things about Israel in
schoolbooks, but now I love the Israeli people very much,'' Elif
said as she prepared for her trip. ``My friends and I talk about
them all the time. Everybody thinks they're great.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar shift in public attitudes has provided a broad base of
popular support for closer relations between Turkey and Greece.
Greek relief workers were among the first to arrive here after the
quake, and a Turkish team rushed to Greece after a quake there a
few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, commentators in both countries wondered whether the
thaw in relations would prove temporary or lasting. But the week
before last, Foreign Minister George Papandreou of Greece came to
Turkey to sign a series of agreements. The Turkish foreign minister
is scheduled to go to Athens next month to sign several more.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important result of the new Greek-Turkish
friendship has been Greece's decision to lift its veto of Turkish
membership in the European Union. Although it will be years before
Turkey is ready to join the union, the prospect has reshaped
politics here.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things in Turkey have totally changed, and you can
trace a lot of it back to the earthquake,'' said a European
ambassador. ``I can't really explain how it happened, and I'm not
sure I understand it myself. It seemed to give Turks a sense that
they need to open themselves to the world, and ``It certainly gave
many Greeks and other Europeans a sense that Turkey belongs to
them. If we share the same tectonic plate, I guess we share a
lot.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The quake was only the most vivid of a series of major events
that shook Turkey during 1999. Early in the year, the leader of a
14-year Kurdish uprising was captured and then asked his followers
to lay down their arms. In November, several dozen foreign heads of
state, including President Clinton, convened in Istanbul for a
summit meeting that had been planned in advance, but had the effect
of bringing Turkey and the world closer together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surfing on the crest of a terrific wave,'' said Rahmi
Koc, one of the country's wealthiest and most influential business
leaders. ``A series of events have cleared our way to the future.
We have passed a highly significant turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and businessmen are not the only people for whom the
earthquake set off new rounds of reflection. The quake also
unleashed the energies of many individuals and private groups, as
countless Turks began to question their traditional reliance on
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Among those profoundly affected by the quake is a 23-year-old
filmmaker named Emre Sahin. He plans to return from the United
States, where he has lived for several years, to make a full-length
film set against the background of the quake.
</P>
<P>
   The film, as described in a summary that is circulating among
potential backers here, tells the story of an American youth who
learns that his Turkish father, whom he has not seen since early
childhood, has perished in the quake. After returning to Turkey, he
not only discovers much about his father, but also realizes how
much the quake has changed the nation of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This earthquake has set off a lot of soul-searching, both in
Turkey and about Turkey,'' said Haluk Sahin, the filmmaker's
father, a prominent television journalist who is to produce the
film. ``It blew away all the smoke of hostility between Greece and
Turkey. Beyond that, it had all kinds of effects, not just
political but psychological. A lot of it we're just beginning to
realize.''

BLAIR'S PICNIC BEING SPOILED BY A SHOWER OF CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``A bad week at the office or the start of the end?''
The Observer asked as Britain pondered whether it was finally
witnessing the oft-predicted finish to Prime Minister Tony Blair's
political honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony's lost his Midas touch,'' the liberal-minded Independent
said as Blair reached his 1,000th day in office Wednesday. The
Guardian, the paper most identified with Labor thinking, concluded:
``The magic starts to fade. Tony Blair is no longer walking on
water.'' The Sun, the best-selling tabloid and the paper that
Blair's information officers court most assiduously, called recent
days ``The Week That It All Went Belly-Up for Blair.''
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to power in May 1997, Blair has enjoyed the highest
public approval ratings of any prime minister in Britain's history.
Projections have regularly shown that in the next election,
expected sometime in 2001, his Labor Party would keep control of
Parliament by a large margin if not its huge current 179-seat
majority.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past weeks he has suffered setbacks that have given
rise to press articles describing an enveloping crisis and
suggesting that he is starting to lose his sure and steady grip on
the affections of the British electorate. Blair himself has
protested these judgments and referred to the frequency with which
past diagnoses of his decline had turned out to be false.
</P>
<P>
   ``The daily headlines, the passing frenzies _ and I have lost
count of the number of times this or that week was supposed to be
our toughest since taking over _ all that comes and goes,'' Blair
said in a speech in London. He said he would not change his reform
policies, which he cast glowingly as ``the vision of the big
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also not clear whether public opinion has linked together
the largely unrelated incidents into the damning sequence that
editorialists have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would the media be so full of `Labor's midterm
miseries'?'' was a question that Sion Simon, associate editor of
The Spectator and a columnist for The Daily Telegraph, posed and
then answered. ``Such a uniquely stable, successful, popular,
boring government as this one leaves journalists nothing
interesting to write about, which is bad for their careers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the missteps of the first weeks of 2000
have cut in to his popularity, they have not affected Labor's
dominant position over the Conservatives, who remain a party with
sharp internal divisions and weak leadership. A MORI poll in The
Times of London on Thursday showed Labor still with its 20
percentage point lead _ 50 to 30 _ over the Tories among voters
asked whom they would favor were an election held now.
</P>
<P>
   The problem that has caused Blair the most damage is the growth
of waiting lists and shortage of beds in the National Health
Service, a problem aggravated by a near epidemic of influenza
throughout the country this winter. Bettering service was a
campaign commitment, and the government's failure to keep that
pledge has left it open to criticism that it is long on promises
but short on delivery.
</P>
<P>
   But however much of a setback the handling of the health crisis
was, it remains an issue that the Conservatives cannot exploit
since the overall sentiment in the country remains that Labor is
more trustworthy to run the National Health Service.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulation of issues include a rise in crime statistics
and continuing problems with railroad and highway transportation,
both matters that Blair had identified as special concerns of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The list also includes retreats on a new House of Lords, a
freedom of information bill and a plan to change Britain's voting
procedures to a more representative kind _ issues that have less
resonance with the public _ and the highly publicized mismanaged
New Year's Eve inauguration of the $1.2 billion Millennium Dome,
whose exhibits have also drawn a distinctly mixed reception from
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has at least temporarily lost his vaunted control over
party politics in the very visible case of the contest for Labor
candidate in the race for the first elected mayor of London. He is
busy these days attacking the front-runner, Ken Livingstone, whose
populist tendencies he abhors.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath all this is the preoccupation with Britain's
relationship with Europe. Polls show a significant hardening of
public resistance to substituting the pound with the euro, which is
soon to be the common currency on most of the Continent. Blair has
put off a final decision on when to hold a promised referendum on
the matter, while the Conservatives have staked their program to
the negative position that is finding increasing public favor.

<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ In their first comprehensive interviews on the
topic, Bill Bradley and his three cardiologists said the former
senator was in excellent physical condition and his bouts of
irregular heartbeat were not a serious hazard to his health, or to
his ability to serve as president, despite their recent increased
frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and the doctors, who have treated him since 1998,
confirmed that he suffers from a condition known as atrial
fibrillation. It is the most common heart-rhythm disorder that
doctors treat, affecting an estimated 2.2 million Americans in one
form or another. Many of these people work full schedules, and some
even run marathons.
</P>
<P>
   Medically, Bradley ``should be able to function perfectly fine
as president,'' said Dr. Robert H. Heissenbuttel, his personal
physician at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 56, agreed to talk after his heart condition received
widespread news coverage and questions were repeatedly raised about
his health. In the interview he said that last weekend he
experienced a fifth such episode over a month. He spoke with this
reporter, a physician, for an hour here on Tuesday during a break
in the preparation for his debate with Vice President Al Gore in
Manchester, N.H., the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the three cardiologists _ Heissenbuttel and Dr. J.
Thomas Bigger of Columbia University and Dr. Edward T. Anderson of
Stanford University _ spoke with Bradley's permission for several
hours in separate repeated telephone interviews before and after
the interview with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John F. Eisold, the attending physician to the Congress and
the person who first diagnosed Bradley's irregular heartbeat in
1996, did not consent to an interview. But he gave Bradley his
Senate medical records, and Bradley turned them over to
Heissenbuttel, who then discussed them.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate in Manchester on Wednesday night, after a reporter
asked Bradley why he had not yet provided access to his full
medical records, the former senator said he had done the same thing
Gore had done in ``laying out the latest doctor's report.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Bradley said that he now regretted not having
disclosed his ailment earlier. ``But, you know, you are in a
campaign and you let things drift,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley takes two drugs, procanbid and lanoxin (a form of
digitalis), to control his atrial fibrillation. He also takes an
aspirin a day to help prevent the formation of blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Bradley said, he told only ``a few'' close
friends about his atrial fibrillation. Now, he said, he has no
reluctance in discussing it because he believes the public has as
much right to know about the health of a presidential candidate as
about his finances. Bradley, who has expressed strong views on
privacy, said he did not consider an interview about his condition
an invasion of his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Three times after attacks of fibrillation, Bradley has needed a
procedure known as cardioversion, in which the heart is jolted with
electricity to snap it back into normal rhythm. His heart beats
normally at about 50 times a minute. Bradley has not had a
cardioversion in the last 19 months but might need one in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Before undergoing a cardioversion, a patient is made unconscious
for several minutes with an anesthetic and sedative to avoid
feeling the burning pain from the jolts of electricity.
Anesthesiologists not connected with Bradley's case said that they
generally advise such patients not to drive home. Many patients are
also told not to make important decisions for the rest of the day
until the aftereffects of the anesthetic and sedative wear off.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Bradley recalled: ``They give you anesthesia,
you kind of drift, and then when you wake up they say you are back
in rhythm. When you wake up, you are completely alert, you can
function.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley went home to sleep shortly after the procedures and
returned to work the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do if he needed such a procedure as
president, Bradley acknowledged that he might have to invoke the
25th Amendment, using its provisions to turn over executive power
to his vice president temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interesting, I do not know,'' Bradley said. ``I have not
thought of that.'' He added that ``the 25th Amendment sounds a
reasonable way to go,'' but that this was ``a decision that I can
make down the road a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroke can also be an important complication of atrial
fibrillation. But the risk of a stroke or other serious damage from
Bradley's type of atrial fibrillation is less than 1 percent a
year, about the same as for someone his age without the condition,
his doctors and other experts not connected with his case said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he had intended to disclose the atrial fibrillation
in mid-December after his latest complete checkup, on Dec. 3. But
his campaign staff unexpectedly made the disclosure on Dec. 10 when
Bradley canceled a campaign appearance in California because of a
burst of atrial fibrillation. Then, while driving across the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge en route to a hospital and expecting
to have his fourth cardioversion, Bradley said, his heartbeat
suddenly ``went back in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the faintest idea why'' the beat suddenly became
regular in that and other episodes, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, Bradley disclosed
that he had had four episodes in a period of about a month, the
most he had had in that amount of time. They lasted from 2 1/2 to
12 hours, and in each case his heart reverted to normal rhythm on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Bradley said he had experienced a fifth
episode that lasted about 2 1/2 hours on Jan. 22. The doctors said
they did not consider the number significant because the bouts tend
to come in flurries, and they added that it is likely more will
occur.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's irregular heartbeat is technically known as lone
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. ``Lone'' means the irregular
heartbeat is not caused by an underlying heart condition.
``Paroxysm'' refers to the bursts of irregular beats that come on
unpredictably for unknown reasons and disappear just as
mysteriously. Over time, the paroxysms sometimes become permanent.
Bradley has never had a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the heart's upper chambers, the atria, send electrical
impulses to make the bottom chambers, the ventricles, beat
regularly. Atrial fibrillation disrupts the heart's intricate
electrical circuitry so that during the paroxysms the atria quiver.
The ventricles then beat more rapidly (up to 200 beats a minute)
and less efficiently than usual, causing lightheadedness, weakness
and other symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his final checkup as a senator, on Oct. 25, 1996,
that Bradley learned he had atrial fibrillation. That December, he
had his first cardioversion. He said he was startled because he had
been exercising on a Stairmaster four to five times a week and had
experienced no symptoms, not even palpitations.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Eisold told him, ``Just forget it, this thing might
never come again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he experiences no symptoms aside from palpitations.
In the interview, he said that he had had one fainting episode in
1998 while exercising on a Stairmaster in Denver, where he had gone
to give a speech. His doctors said the fainting was due to a drug,
Rythmol, that he no longer takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got my heartbeat way too high and passed out,'' Bradley
said. ``The last thing I remember is I looked at my watch and it
said 2:12. The next thing I remember was waking up on the floor''
and wondering, ``Why did this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley recovered by the time a medical team responded. He was
taken to a hospital and kept overnight for observation. It was the
first and only time he has stayed overnight in a hospital, he said.
The next morning, he gave his speech.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of stroke comes from the possibility of blood clots.
Their formation tends to increase when atrial fibrillation is
sustained longer than about 48 hours but can occur within that
period. The risk that a clot will break off and travel through the
blood elsewhere in the body seems to be greatest when the
fibrillating rhythm suddenly changes to normal. For that reason,
doctors generally perform an electrical cardioversion only within
the first 48 hours or delay it until a patient takes a drug like
Coumadin for several weeks to help prevent the formation of blood
clots.
</P>
<P>
   However, Coumadin therapy increases the risk of bleeding.
Bradley has taken Coumadin for short periods around his
cardioversions but does not take it now.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has rejected a drug, amiodarone, because of its
potential hazards, such as damage to his liver and lungs and even
more serious heart rhythm problems.
</P>
<P>
   In some people, atrial fibrillation is triggered by factors like
stress, exercise, alcohol, caffeine and the time of day. Bradley
said that he had taken his doctor's advice to avoid caffeine and
alcohol. But he said he could not consistently correlate his bouts
with anything.
</P>
<P>
   The bouts of atrial fibrillation do not limit his daily work in
any way, Bradley and his doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   During the episodes, he said, ``I am aware I have a heart''
because it beats irregularly and sometimes faster, but ``it is not
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers cannot detect when Bradley is experiencing atrial
fibrillation, and the only reason people know about it is because
of Bradley's disclosure. Many people with symptoms from atrial
fibrillation have expressed surprise that Bradley says he is
bothered so little by his irregular heartbeat. In response, Bradley
said, ``We just have a different experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not affect anything,'' he said. ``That is why I
consider it a nuisance.''

   QUITO, Ecuador _ In presidential palaces and defense ministries
all across Latin America last week, the same question was being
nervously asked in the wake of the military coup here that toppled
President Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador: Can it happen again somewhere
else?
</P>
<P>
   Having made it through the 1990s without a single elected
civilian president being overthrown by men in uniform, Latin
Americans thought they were finally free of the military
adventurism that has plagued the region for two centuries. But
Mahuad's replacement, first by a military-led junta and then by his
vice president, suggests that judgment may have been premature and
is forcing them into a sobering reassessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political leadership of the continent should not be
sleeping too heavy a sleep today,'' Argentina's leading newspaper,
La Nacion, warned in an editorial titled ``The Ecuadorean Mirror.''
``Something is happening in Ecuador and in other countries of Latin
America, and the forecast is not for an easy passage.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming after the recent rise to power of Hugo Chavez in
Venezuela, the Ecuador coup indicates that groups of military
officers all over Latin America are coming under the spell of an
old ideology that is being dressed up in new clothes. Chavez calls
it ``Bolivarismo,'' after the 19th-century liberator Simon Bolivar,
and posits a system in which the armed forces bypass traditional
political parties seen as corrupt and ally themselves directly with
the masses.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, in contrast, the armies of Latin America
enthusiastically embraced the anti-communist ``doctrine of national
security,'' originally developed by U.S. policy-makers, as
justification for their repeated intervention in the political
process. The result was right-wing military dictatorships in
Central America and countries like Argentina, Brazil and Chile and
many abuses of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the loudest complaints about the Ecuador coup
have come from countries that survived the Cold War experience and
do not want a repetition. ``It is not tolerable that when
governments face difficult situations or economic crises, all it
should take to generate a situation of instability is an uprising
by a group of colonels,'' said the foreign minister of Chile, Juan
Gabriel Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   But the passage of time, combined with the political squabbling
and economic hardship that have accompanied the restoration of
democratic rule, have softened some of the bitter memories of
repressive military rule. ``Governments haven't produced results,
politically or economically, and people are fed up and looking for
an alternative that is functional and coherent,'' said Michael
Shifter, a senior policy analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue in
Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A poll taken here just before the coup, for instance, found that
the military in Ecuador has reached a level of popularity even
higher than the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 20 years, the Ecuadorean armed forces have
maintained a course of action that, in the midst of the chaos the
country has lived through, has managed to transform them into the
only institution that enjoyed prestige and respect among the
citizenry,'' said Simon Pachano, an analyst at the Latin American
Faculty of Social Sciences here.
</P>
<P>
   Given that opportunity, the armed forces here and elsewhere have
been searching for a new role and model, and the emergence of
Chavez has been fortuitous for them. His repeated citation of
Bolivar's pan-American vision and the nationalist and populist
regime he has installed in Venezuela resonate deeply, both among
frustrated and idealistic junior military officers and left-wing
politicians who have been shut out of power.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Chavez, the colonels who launched Ecuador's coup offered
a classic populist program. They presented themselves as protectors
of a downtrodden Indian minority, reformers who would satisfy unmet
demands for social justice and patriots who had suffered along with
ordinary Ecuadoreans at the hands of a corrupt and incompetent
political elite.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Jan. 21 coup, diplomats here and in Colombia
were acknowledging the existence of a ``Chavista'' faction within
the military. Indeed, one of the colonels who was involved in the
seizure of Congress here on Jan. 21 cited Chavez's pan-American
ideals in a letter he made public after he sought political asylum
in the Venezuelan Consulate in Guayaquil.
</P>
<P>
   In the document, Lt. Col. Guillermo Pacheco Perez proclaimed his
identification with ``the cause of Bolivarian liberation'' and the
``ultra-free Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.'' His goal, he said,
was ``to refound a New Republic that permanently marginalizes all
that has swept us away to institutional putrefaction and the
servitude that Bolivar repudiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Venezuela has been the only country to break
ranks and not speak out against the coup here. On his weekly radio
program, Chavez, himself a former army colonel and paratrooper who
led a failed coup attempt in 1992, not only condoned the rebellion,
but sounded downright sympathetic to its leaders and their goals
and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw 25,000 Indians asking for their rights, and I saw
military units supporting them,'' Chavez, who was elected to office
in December 1998 after a prison term, said approvingly. ``Who are
we to judge the people of Ecuador?'' he asked, adding that, ``We
cannot condemn people when they take to the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Venezuelan government approved the restoration
to active duty of about 200 officers who took part in Chavez's 1992
coup attempt and were cashiered as punishment, an action that
raised new doubts about its commitment to democratic principles.
``Along with Ecuador's coup, that sends exactly the wrong message
to every potential military conspirator in every barracks in the
continent,'' a Latin American ambassador here complained.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Ecuador, this month's breakdown of the political order has
been portrayed as a victory for constitutional rule, with Gen.
Carlos Mendoza, the armed forces commander who briefly led a
three-man junta before stepping aside for Vice President Gustavo
Noboa, being praised by the new minister of the interior for
``sacrificing a brilliant career so the world would be spared the
spectacle of a disoriented and destroyed Ecuador.'' But that
interpretation has not found much favor outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the stereotypical Latin American military coup,''
said Eduardo Gamarra, director of the Latin American and Caribbean
Center at Florida International University in Miami and an expert
on Andean politics. ``The president was toppled and replaced by his
vice president, who is supported and guaranteed by the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an interview with foreign reporters last week, Mahuad
directly linked his overthrow to his refusal to adopt policies that
the military favored. ``I made peace with Peru'' _ a neighbor with
which Ecuador fought several border wars in the 20th century _
``and cut the military budget,'' he said, incurring the wrath of an
officer corps unwilling to accept change.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new government here is aware that it faces ostracism
from other governments in the region unless it moves decisively to
punish the rebels, and it has taken some steps to do so. More than
a dozen colonels are now in custody and awaiting trial on charges
of sedition and conspiring against the constitutional order, and
investigations of an estimated 300 junior officers have begun to
determine their responsibility in the overthrow of Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
   But Gen. Telmo Sandoval, who supported the coup, has been
promoted to commander of the armed forces, and other generals who
played major roles, like Gen. Carlos Moncayo, who permitted Indians
to seize the Congress building by withdrawing his troops, are still
free. ``I will not permit a witch hunt,'' the new minister of
defense, Adm. Hugo Unda Aguirre, said Thursday.

130 NATIONS AGREE ON RULES FOR ENGINEERED FOODS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Delegates from more than 130 nations Saturday adopted
the first global treaty regulating trade in genetically modified
products, setting up an international framework for the
increasingly contentious debate about foods made with
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   The biosafety treaty, forged after a week of intense
negotiations that often pitted the United States against almost
everyone else, allows countries to bar imports of genetically
altered seeds, microbes, animals and crops that they deem a threat
to their environment.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually all of the proposed provisions that Washington had
feared would cripple world food trade and endanger billions of
dollars a year in American farm exports were watered down or
eliminated. This led some European delegates and environmentalists
to complain that the accord had been unduly weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the treaty heightens consumer concern or helps to ease
it, the debate surrounding genetically altered food is sure to
continue. European consumers, in particular, are wary of risks to
human health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the biosafety protocol was finally approved around 5
a.m., weary delegates from all sides stood up and applauded and
hailed it as a significant achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``By reaching an agreement today, I hope we have taken an
important step toward depolarizing the debate about
biotechnology,'' Frank E. Loy, U.S. undersecretary of state for
global affairs, said Saturday. ``Conversely, failure to reach an
agreement today would have exacerbated tensions over this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Chee Yoke Ling of the Third World Network, an environmental
group based in Malaysia, said that the treaty had ``a lot of
holes.'' But she added, ``I think it's historic in the sense that
international law is recognizing that GMO's are distinct and have
to be regulated separately.'' GMO stands for genetically modified
organism.
</P>
<P>
   About half the soybeans and one-third of the corn grown in the
United States last year contained foreign genes making the crops
resistant to herbicides or insects. European consumers are
rejecting food made with those grains.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration held
public hearings on the subject recently and some members of
Congress are calling for food with genetically modified ingredients
to be so labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology company executives said the new treaty could
actually help the industry by countering a perception that
biotechnology is not adequately regulated. ``I think it will give
some members of the public a stronger feeling that there is
appropriate amounts of oversight,'' said Steven J. Daugherty,
director of government and industry relations at Pioneer Hi-Bred
International, the huge seed company.
</P>
<P>
   But no one thinks the controversy will go away. Indeed, the
treaty could make consumers even more aware of the issue, raising
more concerns. Delegates said the treaty represented a rare recent
success in balancing environmental protection with free trade,
interests that are often difficult to reconcile.
</P>
<P>
   At the World Trade Organization meeting late last year in
Seattle, talks on these topics broke down and huge protests were
held by environmentalists, foes of biotechnology and others.
</P>
<P>
   The biosafety talks themselves broke down a year ago in
Cartagena, Colombia, when the United States and a handful of other
big agricultural exporting nations blocked a treaty agreed to by
virtually all the other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Montreal demonstrations were small and peaceful. And
the atmosphere in the negotiating halls was far more positive than
in Cartagena, as all nations realized that the rising controversy
over bio-engineered foods made it important to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, early Saturday morning, it appeared that history might
repeat itself. The United States and Canada refused to agree to a
requirement _ supported by virtually all the other countries _ that
shipments of genetically altered commodities like corn or soybeans
contain identification of the specific variety. The two countries
said such a requirement would be unworkable, requiring different
strains that are now intermingled to be segregated and tracked from
field to dock.
</P>
<P>
   A tense standoff with the European Union ensued for hours and
threatened to scuttle the entire treaty. Finally, frowning and
grumbling, the Europeans backed down. Instead of requiring
identification of the particular strain of genetically engineered
crop, the treaty requires stating only that the shipment ``may
contain'' genetically modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said genetically modified crops would not
have to be segregated from others. But the treaty might encourage a
trend that is already under way _ segregating crops free of genetic
modification.
</P>
<P>
   The new treaty will be known as the Cartagena Protocol on
Biosafety and will go into effect after being ratified by 50
countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Several years in the making, the protocol is an outgrowth of the
Convention on Biological Diversity forged in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, in 1992. Because the United States never ratified the
biodiversity convention, it cannot become a party to the biosafety
protocol. But American industry will still have to comply with the
rules when exporting to countries that are parties. And federal
officials here said the government would honor the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The new biosafety protocol is mainly concerned with protecting
the environment from the consequences of genetic engineering. For
instance, genes that make crops herbicide resistant could spread by
pollination to weedy relatives, creating super-weeds. Or fish given
genes to make them grow faster might out-compete the native
population for food or mates.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol is not really aimed at risks to human health from
food made using biotechnology, although it does contain some vague
language saying that such risks should be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty also does not address whether food containing
genetically altered ingredients, like corn flakes made with
bio-engineered corn, should be labeled as such on store shelves. It
deals only with labeling commodities like wheat or corn during
international shipments.
</P>
<P>
   The key requirement of the treaty is that exporters must obtain
permission in advance from the importing country before the first
shipment of a particular ``living modified organism'' meant for
release into the environment, like seeds, microbes or fish to be
put in a river.
</P>
<P>
   But advance notice and permission will not be required for
exports of agricultural commodities meant for eating or processing
rather than for release into the environment. Washington had argued
that requiring such advanced notification would have tied up food
trade in red tape.
</P>
<P>
   According to the compromise in the treaty, when a crop is
approved for commercial use in one country, that country must send
information about that crop to a central clearinghouse. Other
countries can then decide whether to prohibit imports of that crop
based on their own legislation. Countries that do not have their
own legislation, however, can use the protocol to bar imports.
</P>
<P>
   There are other deletions from the protocol that American
industry cheered but that some environmentalists said weakened the
accord. The treaty, for instance, does not apply to human
pharmaceuticals. And advance permission is not required for
shipments of genetically altered organisms intended for what the
protocol terms ``contained use,'' such as a vial of cells for use
in a research laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, as well as delegates from Europe and
developing countries, said the most significant achievement was
inclusion in the treaty of perhaps the strongest formulation to
date of the ``precautionary principle.'' This principle states that
a nation can take action to protect itself _ in this case by
barring import of a genetically modified organism _ even if there
is a lack of scientific certainty that it would be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The United States fears Europe will use this principle as a
pretext for trade barriers. But Washington did win language
assuring that the biosafety protocol will not relieve a nation of
its obligations under World Trade Organization rules. So if a
nation does ban a crop, it could be subject to challenge under
trade rules.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With Russian soldiers dying again in Chechnya, Galya A.
is ready to do anything to keep her gangly 18-year-old son, Ruslan,
from doing his compulsory two-year military service.
</P>
<P>
   If she could, she would bribe her local draft board. But on the
paltry $25 pensions she and her disabled husband get each month, it
would take them another lifetime to save up the going price, which
ranges from $2,000 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   She could try to dramatize Ruslan's list of childhood ailments,
but none is serious enough to warrant a coveted medical exemption.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a desperate mother to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Divorce, my dear,'' said Ludmila Obraztsova, a volunteer for
the Soldiers' Mothers Committee who conducts a weekly seminar on
ways to dodge the draft legally, held oddly enough in a central
Moscow veterans club. ``You can live together with your husband,
you do whatever you want together, but if you want to get your son
out of the draft, your best chance is divorce.'' In that way, Mrs.
Obraztsova said, Ruslan could legally argue that hewas the only
able-bodied person available to support his 63-year-old pensioned
father, a certified invalid.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of blunt if convoluted advice that Mrs.
Obraztsova has been giving since 1990 when she, herself a mother of
two sons, joined the Soldiers' Mothers Committee, an advocacy and
support group that sprang up during the war waged by Soviet troops
in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Obraztsova, 53, a researcher at a medical-technical
institute, has counseled thousands of mothers on how to get their
18-to 27-year old sons out of Russia's twice-yearly draft, guiding
them through the maze of draft laws, past a hostile military that
has resisted the concept of alternative service, and around the
increased pressure created by two bloody wars in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the mothers who come to the sessions, scribbling copious
notes, would come anyway, but the latest war _ while broadly
popular as a move to keep the Russian state intact _ has added
urgency to their quest. ``Who would want to give up their son to
such a war?'' said Tanya Knyazina, who came on behalf of her
19-year-old son. ``As my son says himself, if it were a question of
fighting for the motherland, of defending Moscow, he would gladly
serve, but why should he go and fight, and die, for Chechnya?''
</P>
<P>
   Getting out of the Russian draft is, in many ways, similar to
unraveling other Russian bureaucratic tangles: It takes intimate
knowledge of arcane rules and regulations, and a readiness to
juggle family, residence and more to avoid a direct conflict with
the authorities. If all else fails, you can try to buy your way out
of a situation _ provided that you have the means.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who can afford to pay bribes don't come to our Monday
meetings,'' said Mrs. Obraztsova. ``We counsel the middle class,
the ones who can't pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, Mrs. Obraztsova's suggestion made
perfect sense to Galya A., a 56-year-old pensioner who asked that
her last name not be used. Since she has two sons by a previous
marriage, the family could not argue that Ruslan was the only
able-bodied breadwinner. But if Galya divorced Ruslan's father,
then Ruslan could easily get a deferment as his father's only means
of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``A divorce is nothing, you just show up and do it,'' she said.
``Of course, we don't want to do it, but with this war going on,
what else can we do? He is our last, and only, son. Without him, we
would both probably die of hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   For other young men, the solution could be, for instance,
adoption. A single father of a child under 3 gets an automatic
exemption, prompting some young couples to file for a divorce. The
father can also get an exemption if the mother is under 18, or
considered unfit to cope alone. Mrs. Obraztsova herself used one of
these loopholes several years ago to get her younger son out of the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of ours had a daughter who was pregnant out of
wedlock, and didn't want anything to do with the father,'' she
said. ``They knew our situation and asked me if my son wanted to be
the adoptive father. Of course, he does, I said. It worked, and I
often pass on the advice to others. How many take it, I can't
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in peacetime, even in the Soviet Union prior to the Afghan
War, many families go and have gone to extraordinary lengths to
keep their sons out of an army notorious for its brutal treatment
of conscripts. Suicides, hazing and deaths by beating are regular
occurrences. They are the subject of periodic investigations and
reports, but rarely of criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable figures on Russian draft dodgers, although
the Defense Ministry last spring claimed their number in 1998 had
been halved, to 20,000 from 40,000 nationally. According to the
Moscow city draft board, an estimated 1,500 Muscovites are avoiding
military service, but according to a draft board spokesman, many of
these are students from other cities, whose registration is tossed
back and forth between draft boards.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring draft last year, a presidential decree called for
168,776 men to be drafted, of which 120,900 were destined for the
armed forces. The rest were sent to other quasi-military units like
the border guards and the Railway Ministry troops. With each draft,
about 25 percent of the armed forces' personnel is replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to get out of the army is to study. Indeed, the
incentive of avoiding the draft often encourages a sudden devotion
to studies among 17-year-old males. In Moscow, for instance, where
an estimated 50,000 young men were due to be processed last fall,
an estimated 52 percent of draft-age men were exempted because they
were enrolled in institutes, and technical colleges where they sign
up for military courses that put them on an officers' track.
</P>
<P>
   A student deferment can be prolonged indefinitely provided the
student is accepted at bona fide institutions that will keep him
enrolled until he is 27, when he is no longer eligible for the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Medical deferments provide an increasingly popular way out.
According to recent statistics, more than 30 percent of draft-age
men are excused for medical reasons. The high rate is usually
explained by the deteriorating health of Russia's male population
generally, but it may also be due to efforts by people like Mrs.
Obraztsova.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your own checkup before your son is called up to the
medical commission,'' she said at a recent seminar. ``Please,
please, remember, if he has any medical complaints, get them
documented _ send him to as many clinics as you can. I know what
they will say at the draft board _ they will say that he is
healthy, that you bought the medical records. Believe me, I know
plenty of doctors who want to send your sick son into the armed
forces.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is not a disease, ailment or injury that Mrs. Obraztsova
cannot peg to an article in the draft law. ``Hepatitis,'' she said.
``A, B, C, it doesn't matter: six months. Spinal disorders. I am
glad somebody mentioned that. If it is a third degree, then it can
be a deferrable disease. Migraines? Accompanied by fainting? Get it
checked. It can be deferrable. Ulcers? Beware of radical imported
medicines. They are so effective they can clear away the scar
tissue, and you don't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   A mother came up to her with a medical card showing that her son
suffers from a serious disease. ``Very good,'' said Mrs.
Obraztsova, nodding sagely, before she stopped herself. ``I mean,
of course there is nothing good about it at all, except in these
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Obraztsova is a stickler for the law, which she arguably
knows better than most draft board officials. She constantly
reminds mothers, and the few fathers and sons who occasionally
attend the meetings, how to stand up for their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember you have a right not to agree with the draft board,
but do not lose your temper, keep your voice quiet, just stick a
copy of the law under their noses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they won't listen, don't bother with them, write out your
complaint in a letter and mail it. But keep a copy. Little mothers,
always, always, keep copies of all your documents. One mother came
to me, and said the draft board had kept her medical file, and
wouldn't return it. I said to her, my darling, my little swallow,
who do you think you are dealing with?''
</P>
<P>
   For some Russian men, the yearly drafts _ from April to June and
from October to December _ may be times to get out of town, and
perhaps hide out at the family dacha, or country house.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, draft boards have been asking the police to
hunt down stragglers. Late last December, Moscow residents reported
that their buildings had been surrounded by police officers waiting
for young men to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cases when parents think that their children have
been kidnapped,'' said Valentina Melnikova, a spokeswoman for the
Soldiers' Mothers Committee. ``They come home and their sons are
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic sang-froid, Mrs. Obraztsova has advice for
parents who find the police at their door, looking for their son.
``Tell them he went away with a girl,'' she said. ``Tell them you
yourself are horrified, but there's nothing you can do. That one
usually works.''
</P>
<P>
   To parents whose sons are now abroad, her advice is simple: Keep
them away. ``If they tell you they want to come home, tell them
that an undeclared war is going on here, and that our boys are
being killed.''

   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas began his campaign
last March with an unassuming one-page letter that announced the
formation of his Presidential Exploratory Committee. Almost as an
aside, the recipients were asked to contribute a few dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Within four weeks, Bush had collected an astonishing $7.6
million, including 500 checks for $1,000, the maximum amount that
individuals may donate to a presidential candidate. Half of the
first flurry of checks came from Texans, but far more important
were the thousands of checks signed by longtime supporters and old
friends of former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old man's network is probably 50,000 people, and I think
they were looking for some sort of vindication for the president,''
said John Ellis, a first cousin of George W. Bush who is a
columnist at Fast Company magazine. ``I don't think you can
possibly overstate the hatred of Bill Clinton in the Republican
Party. The disgust with him. And so Governor Bush became the
vehicle to win back the White House. He was a brand name. And it
was so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The feat was accomplished with the help of the Pioneers, a
well-connected group of 200 fund-raisers who raised $100,000 each
for Bush's campaign. They were enlisted by Bush many months before
he mailed his exploratory letter last March, and their early
organization and coordination were what helped the governor raise
so much money so quickly early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the candidates prepare for the New Hampshire primary,
Republican fund-raisers say the Pioneers have begun to line up
pledges of the unlimited contributions known as ``soft money'' from
individuals and corporations. Some Republicans have estimated that
if Bush is the nominee, the Republican Party could easily raise
$250 million in soft money, more than twice the amount raised in
1996 by the party and its nominee, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush finance officials last week denied that they had begun to
raise soft money, or that they had even begun to discuss how to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is an especially sensitive one for Bush, who has been
criticized by his Republican rivals as the big-money candidate
beholden to special interests. In the Republican debate in New
Hampshire on Wednesday night, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Gary
Bauer criticized Bush as being beholden to special interests in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know that the Republican Party is now taking _ setting
up a mechanism for this huge soft-money thing?'' McCain said. ``The
Democrats also. We're talking about hundreds of millions of
dollars, if not billions, that are going to be washing around in
this presidential campaign, usually in the form of negative ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush shot back, saying, ``John, I don't appreciate the way
you've characterized my position. I'm for reform. I'm for getting
rid of the corporate soft money and labor-union soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, interviews with donors and an examination of records
show that the success of Bush's early fund raising was driven
largely by personal and family ties to campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush can capitalize on his victory in Iowa, survive the test
of New Hampshire and go on to win the Republican nomination, that
early money will have been one of the most important ingredients of
his success.
</P>
<P>
   It sent an unmistakable message to Republican and Democratic
rivals alike that Bush was poised to overwhelm his rivals in the
all-important financial primaries of 1999 and 2000. Three
Republican candidates _ Lamar Alexander, Elizabeth Dole and Dan
Quayle _ dropped out because they discovered it was impossible to
compete with the Bush money machine.
</P>
<P>
   And since those early days, Bush has raised over $67 million
from 171,000 Americans, more than triple his fund-raisers' original
goal of $20 million. With more cash on hand than any other
candidate, Bush may be able to use money as a fire wall while his
competitors deplete their coffers in expensive states like
California and New York. By declining federal matching funds, Bush
is not bound by the primaries' state-by-state spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every dollar we went out and raised, another $2 came in,
unexpected, over the transom,'' said a Bush senior adviser, who
insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a well-coordinated fund-raising organization that
tapped his father's network of money men and women, Bush has
managed an unprecedented feat in U.S. politics: He has raised more
than the total combined amount of individual contributions raised
by the two major party candidates in the previous presidential
election, Clinton and Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush finance officials say they have not yet begun to
think about a soft-money strategy, Bush himself has already begun
to quietly raise soft money for Republican state party committees.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 19, Bush attended a $25,000-a-couple dinner at the home
of the financier David Murdoch in Los Angeles. The event raised
over $2 million for the state's Victory 2000 committee, which was
set up with the help of Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials said that the $2 million, though raised
by the governor, would be spent by the California Republican Party.
But much of that evening's total, some of which was soft money,
would assist Bush if he became the party's presidential nominee,
two California fund-raisers said.
</P>
<P>
   The California dinner was one of 18 fund-raising events that
Bush attended in October, November and December. The campaign had
pulled in so much money that the Bush finance team significantly
scaled back its fund-raising operation at the end of last year, and
still managed to collect $10 million in the last three months of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush campaign aides have portrayed $67 million as
evidence of grass-roots support, the windfall is the handiwork of
the Pioneers, which had been quietly and meticulously built by
Bush, with help from his father.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, more than a year before the first check was
sent to a Bush exploratory committee, Bush had begun meeting in
Austin, Texas, with the Republican Party's most influential
fund-raisers and lobbyists, many of whom had raised huge sums for
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor had lunch or dinner with groups of eight or 10
people, and by early 1999 he had verbal commitments to raise money
from hundreds of influential Republicans and several governors,
including John Engler of Michigan and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is a year into his second four-year term, had his own
formidable fund-raising team and a rich Texas base to draw from. In
1994 he raised $15.8 million when he defeated Gov. Ann Richards.
And in 1998 he collected nearly $25.2 million for his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 25 percent of Bush's presidential contributions, over $12
million by Sept. 30, were from Texans, according to Federal
Election Commission records. In addition, Bush has received many
$1,000 checks from executives in the oil and gas industries and
other companies that do business with the state.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At several Texas companies, employees' combined contributions to
Bush totaled over $100,000. Vinson &AMP; Elkins, the Houston law firm,
led all contributors; with individual donations of $1,000 or less,
the firm's partners and lawyers gave Bush a total of $185,100 by
the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also received nearly $100,000 from lawyers at Jenkens &AMP;
Gilchrist, a Dallas firm, and $86,650 from executives and employees
of Enron, the Houston corporation that is one of the world's
largest energy companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his Texas supporters, Bush was helped by his
father's national network built over three presidential campaigns.
``They had a great list to work from,'' said a senior Republican
fund-raiser who insisted on anonymity. ``The Bush Christmas card
list is 35,000 people, and probably everyone on that list gave
somewhere between $100 and $1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald L. Evans, a former oilman from Midland, Texas, and one of
Bush's closest friends, acknowledged that President Bush had been
an immense help.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been supportive from the very beginning,'' said Evans,
the Bush finance chairman. ``He was most helpful because of the
great person that he is. There are people across America who care
deeply about America's family, the Bush family.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans declined to say how many calls the elder Bush had placed
on behalf of his son's quest. Evans said: ``Was he helpful? Did he
participate in some events? Did he make some phone calls? The
answer to all of those questions is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Money has flowed generously to Bush's campaign from California,
with some $6 million in donations, and from Florida, where his
brother, Jeb, is governor, with $3.3 million. Even in the least
populous states, the Bush candidacy has exceeded all expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In North Dakota, the Bush finance chairman had hoped to raise
$15,000, a bit more than Republicans in the state gave Dole in
1996. But last year North Dakota residents contributed nearly
$150,000 to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we got $25,000, we raised the goal to $50,000,'' said
Russell F. Freeman, the Bush campaign's North Dakota fund-raising
chairman. ``And then we got $100,000, so we raised it to $125,000.
After we got that, we raised the goal to $150,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has received the most support from contributors who are
retired, but he has also received over $4 million from lawyers and
generous support from the real estate industry. The governor, who
is a former oilman, has received more support than his rivals from
the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior Republican fund-raisers said that the states'
victory committees would be used to raise soft money later this
year. In November and December, the Bush campaign raised a total of
$5 million for as many as 20 state parties, focusing the most
attention on important battleground states like California, New
York and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we did it,'' Evans said. ``The state parties will
have control over those dollars, not us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican fund-raisers have discussed asking some of their
largest donors to write soft-money checks to the state parties.
That money could then be spent in highly contested states during
the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 state victory fund committee allowed the campaign to
take advantage of federal election rules that permitted some donors
to give as much as $25,000 to the state committees. That money
could then be used by state parties for their voter-turnout
programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican National Committee meeting in San Jose,
Calif., this month, several fund-raisers predicted that the party
could easily raise over $250 million in soft money once the
Pioneers began giving and raising large sums.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that chatter, Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush
campaign, said that the Bush finance team had not discussed
soft-money strategy. ``Our sights are set on securing the
nomination,'' Fleischer said. ``Every team enters the playoffs
thinking about getting to the Super Bowl. But the best teams focus
on the game in front of them _ and they don't begin planning for
the Super Bowl until they get there.''

COMMENTARY: WHO AM I, AND WHY AM I HERE? 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT , N.H. _ William the Good is so very patient with us.
</P>
<P>
   He has been disappointed when reporters and voters and even his
own advisers and big-shot supporters failed to understand why he
has dithered so much about Closing the Deal, why he hasn't just
picked up Al Gore by the scruff of his neck and said: ``Back off,
you phony, smarmy, sniveling, preppy sneak, you
no-controlling-legal-authority-Buddhist-nun-shakedown artist.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tall guy has been more interested in ``building a
relationship with the voters of New Hampshire'' than in razing Al
Gore. He's been preaching his gospel of New Politics, all positive
all the time. If he gave in completely to Old Politics, it might be
effective. But it would be wrong. Worse, it would be inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Sheridan, a retired fine arts professor who came to see
Bradley at a Newport senior citizens center Friday morning, did not
understand New Politics. ``How can you deal with the sleaze factor
without yourself going through the same type of tactics?'' she
asked Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   This philosophical conundrum tormented the Hamlet of New
Hampshire all day, as he tried to work up his nerve to deliver the
Big Attack on Al Gore that his spinners had promised.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's preference is to be oblique. Or to let surrogates hint
at Al Gore's hyperactive campaign finance phone calls. Or to give a
dollop of directness, but preferably in the void, late on a Friday
night, after the eager press pack has given up hopes of an attack
and wandered off to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a passive-aggressive campaign, new resisting old. In Old
Politics, you tangle with your opponent. In New Politics, you
tangle with yourself. OP is visceral. NP is cerebral. In OP, you
try to clobber your rival, without subtlety or ambivalence. In NP,
winning is beside the point: beliefs and convictions are the point.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley has less time to take on Al Gore because he's so
busy examining his own feelings about how far he should go in
taking on Al Gore. He finds his analysis of himself fascinating.
Sure, the primary that will decide his presidential fate is days
away. But he clings to tantric campaigning. He holds back, seeking
a level of self-realization deeper than the merely electoral.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many moral and political dilemmas still to wrestle
with: If he smacks his Democratic foe, is it fratricide? What is
the most just way to apportion blame for the Chinese money scandal
and Lincoln bedroom scam between the president and vice president?
If one goes negative, how negative can one go and remain true to
oneself? And when does a double negative become a positive? If one
is obviously better and smarter, why should one have to prove it?
</P>
<P>
   All day Friday, Bradley would only go so far as to call Gore
``tricky.'' He said he was waiting for him to repent about his
``misstatements.'' (Dream on, Dollar Bill.)
</P>
<P>
   But finally, at a Nashua fund-raiser at 9:30 p.m., he stuck his
little toe in the water on the topic he feels most strongly about
in private _ the fund-raising scandal of '96. Passive-Aggressive
said Gore must ``face up'' to the ``disgraceful'' behavior, but it
ended up sounding more like a hint from Heloise. ``If we don't
clean our house,'' he said, ``the Republicans are going to clean it
for us in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is also trying to hector Gore on abortion, saying he
must explain to the public his ``journey'' from opposing Medicaid
funding for abortion to supporting it. Here's a hint, Heloise: It's
called being the Democratic front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a master panderer who turned up at an MTV rally in jeans
so weirdly tight that even Ted Koppel felt compelled to comment.
But Bradley thinks trying to please is beneath a politician. His
campaign has been choking on dignity.
</P>
<P>
   When he played basketball, he hated being called a jock. He said
he dreaded ``the unnaturalness of being a sex object'' for
groupies. As a politician he doesn't want to stoop to politics. He
says he hates the ``rat-a-tat-tat.'' He doesn't care for the
rah-rah either. It would be so much more gratifying if voters could
be illuminated without expecting to be excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want him to hit Gore or something,'' said Mrs.
Sheridan.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't understand. Bradley has been working to restore
trust in the process. Under duress, he's trying to attack. But you
get the feeling that for him, losing, with its negation of craven
self-interest, might be the best way to prove he was worthy of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   He's too good for us, really.

COMMENTARY: ONE FOR THE MONEY? 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Maybe it's a sign of maturity; or maybe
it's just that typical American obliviousness to the outside world.
Whatever the reason, the United States has an admirably relaxed
attitude toward the international value of its currency. When the
dollar slides against the yen, we do not take it as a slur on our
national virility. Indeed, the strong yen mainly has the Japanese
worried, because they fear _ rightly _ that it may price their
goods out of world markets and make their
now-you-see-it-now-you-don't economic recovery vanish into thin
air.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the economic fundamentals are concerned, euroland _
the group of 11 European nations that has adopted the euro as its
common currency _ ought to be as blase about currency fluctuations
as we are. Like the United States, euroland is a huge economic
area, mainly trading with itself; if its exchange rate fluctuates,
as exchange rates will, why should it be concerned?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however, the decline of the euro since it was
introduced at the beginning of last year _ it was worth $1.17 at
the outset, and finally fell below $1 last week _ has led to much
wailing and rending of garments.
</P>
<P>
   In strict economic terms this dismay is not warranted. Serious
students of the new currency (eurologists?) will tell you that the
true test of its success is internal: does it deliver the promised
unification of the European market? Does it enhance the economic
stability of the euroland nations? And for what it is worth, things
are off to an OK if not great start: The first year of European
Monetary Union has actually been a fairly prosperous one for most
EMU members. It's just that the United States is doing even better
_ and so the euro has been falling against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The reason this matters is that although the serious economic
case for EMU has always been internal and long term, some euro
enthusiasts _ the French in particular _ have always had a less
creditable agenda: the desire to stick one in America's eye, to
take the dollar down a peg. Over the long years of discussion that
led to EMU, I have heard over and over again the claim that by
challenging the dominance of the dollar, the euro will somehow lead
to a large transfer of wealth and power across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   This was and is nonsense: No doubt in the year 2005 Russian
gangsters will make payoffs with 100-euro notes instead of $100
bills, but so what? Though it may be foolish, however, this hidden
agenda means that many Europeans have a predisposition to judge
monetary union not by the performance of the European economy, but
by the euro's competitive status against the dollar. And this in
turn means that the latest slide in the euro presents a dilemma for
the barely year-old European Central Bank: Does it defend the
euro's prestige _ which it can only do by putting its fundamental
goals at risk? Or does it stand by its principles, let the exchange
rate decline and live with the resulting embarrassment?
</P>
<P>
   Up until last week, the ECB was playing a dangerous game, trying
to have it both ways. Officially it had no target value for the
euro-dollar exchange rate. But repeated statements by ECB officials
that they regarded their currency as undervalued were taken by
markets as a strong hint that the euro would not be allowed to fall
below ``parity.'' And this hint itself supported the euro: whenever
the exchange rate fell close to $1 (and it has in fact spent most
of the last few months hovering just barely above parity),
speculators would buy the currency, figuring that it could go up
but not down.
</P>
<P>
   Now the game is up. The only effective way to strengthen the
euro now is to raise interest rates _ and thereby threaten to
undermine the growth of the real European economy. On the other
hand, if the ECB does not raise rates, speculators may declare open
season on the currency and at least temporarily drive it still
lower.
</P>
<P>
   The right thing to do is nothing. There will be some jeering
headlines, but a month or two later people will look around, see
that Europe is still standing and forget about the whole thing. The
question is: Does the ECB have the courage not to act? We'll soon
find out.

JAPAN TALENT AGENT SAID TO HAVE ABUSED CLIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In the cutthroat world of Japanese show business, which
is dominated by teen-age idols, few people exercise the power and
creative genius of Johnny Kitagawa.
</P>
<P>
   As president of Johnny's Jimusho, the country's top talent
agency, Kitagawa has a knack for creating young male stars who
sing, dance, act and make him millions of dollars along the way.
</P>
<P>
   So influential is the 68-year-old Kitagawa that media analysts
and reporters say he has tightly controlled what newspapers,
magazines and television programs report about his clients and
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no credible media organization in Japan had crossed him
until last fall when Shukan Bunshun, one of Japan's largest
magazines, began publishing a series of articles accusing him of
having sexual liaisons with teen-age boys he had groomed for
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a television station and you don't comply with
Johnny's Jimusho's wishes, then all the popular stars will be
withdrawn from your programs, your variety shows will not get any
interviews with celebrities, and your ratings will plummet,'' said
Masaru Nashimoto, an entertainment reporter. ``The same thing goes
for publications,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Since the articles began appearing in late October, Kitagawa's
agency has declared war on the magazine. It has accused Shukan
Bunshun of publishing lies, filed a libel suit and denied its
requests for promotional photos and interviews with acts managed by
Kitagawa. The magazine's sister publications have also been denied
access to Kitagawa's groups.
</P>
<P>
   None of Japan's other major news media have reported the
magazine's allegations or Kitagawa's lawsuit. Neither have they
taken note of several tell-all books written in recent years by men
who claimed that when they were boys, Kitagawa forced them and
others to have sex with him.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroshi Fujita, a journalism professor at Sophia University in
Tokyo, said he was not surprised. The Kitagawa story, he said,
reflects the well-known weaknesses of the Japanese press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese media tend to be quite cautious and timid when it
comes to sensitive subjects like sex, the royal family, and
right-wing groups,'' Fujita said. ``Only if the authorities launch
an investigation of Kitagawa we can expect widespread media
coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most reporters rely on official news sources and rarely dig up
information beyond that provided by government agencies,
corporations and public relations firms. Many reporters belong to
official press clubs established by government ministries, and the
reporters dutifully report what the ministries want to say.
</P>
<P>
   Kiyondo Matsui, Shukan Bunshun's editor in chief, is proud of
the Kitagawa stories because after the first article appeared, his
magazine received a flood of information from boys and men who had
been part of Johnny's Jimusho. The information was so compelling
that the magazine, despite pressure from Kitagawa's lawyers,
decided to proceed with what became a 10-part series.
</P>
<P>
   For two months, reporters at Shukan Bunshun interviewed about a
dozen teen-age boys. While initially reluctant to talk, the boys
eventually recounted their experiences after receiving assurances
that their identities would not be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The articles have sent shock waves across the entertainment
business, not only because of their graphic descriptions but also
because of their potential to dethrone Kitagawa, the industry's
most powerful broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that a publication with a good
reputation and a large circulation has written about this,'' said
Jinichiro Sudo, a former entertainment reporter who is now a local
assemblyman in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, Kitagawa's reign appears as strong as
ever. He declined to be interviewed for this article, but his
lawyer, Tsugio Yada, said in an interview that the sexual abuse
allegations against his client were a ``complete fabrication.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Johnny Kitagawa is a good person with a great reputation, and
no one believes the lies that were published,'' Yada said.
``Writing a story based on the confession of people who are now
separated from the talent agency is not a reliable way of
reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the articles, the boys took part in Kitagawa's
talent training corps, in which they received singing and dancing
lessons and did promotional activities in the hope of making it
into one of Kitagawa's major groups.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the boys told the magazine that they regularly had
sexual relations with Kitagawa because they feared that if they
refused he would not advance their careers, and that boys who did
refuse were ejected from the training program.
</P>
<P>
   Through Shukan Bunshun, The New York Times tried to get in touch
with the boys quoted in the magazine series, but all of them
refused to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But one former member of a 1970s teen-age group managed by
Johnny's Jimusho told The New York Times in an interview that
Kitagawa raped him when he was a 12-year-old recruit.
</P>
<P>
   The man reluctantly agreed to the interview on the condition
that his name not be used, for fear that he might lose his job as a
musician. At his request, the interview took place in a Tokyo hotel
room with a reporter from Shukan Bunshun, which arranged the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his 40s and married, he nervously recounted how he and
other boys had suffered. After reading the initial articles in the
magazine, the man said, he decided to tell his story because he was
outraged that Kitagawa was continuing to sexually abuse boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like what was going on,'' he said. ``But if I said
no, I would have been kicked out, and there was nowhere else for me
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   According to articles in Japanese publications, Kitagawa and his
older sister Mary, 71, with whom he runs the agency, were raised in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Kitagawa and his sister returned to Japan in the early 1950s,
and in 1962 he started his career as a manager of young male
talent. Kitagawa had his first major success with the Four Leaves,
one of the the decade's most popular groups.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Kitagawa displayed a golden touch for forming groups
aimed at teen-age girls. The most popular and profitable has been a
diverse group of five young men called SMAP, whose members are the
hottest draw on Japanese television.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the most recent year for which statistics were
available, AERA magazine said that Johnny's Jimusho's clients
appeared in about 40 television programs and 40 commercials for
products and services from food to life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Nashimoto, the entertainment reporter, said he regretted that he
and other media organizations had been reluctant to explore the
sexual abuse allegations, even after the books were published
making similar accusations against Kitagawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the mass media, including myself, had fully investigated
these claims a long time ago, especially when the books first came
out, then maybe we could have prevented other boys from suffering
abuse,'' he said.

 &HT;    CARE to receive Turner funding for U.N. project to fight mines
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some of Ted Turner's $1 billion gift to the United
Nations has boomeranged right back to Atlanta. CARE USA, the
Atlanta-based relief and development organization, will use the
Turner money to conduct the United Nations' land mine education
programs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, which encompasses two related programs, will use
$500,000 of Turner's money. Japan has donated an additional
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under one of the contracts, already signed, CARE's pocket-size,
74-page mine safety handbook will become, with minor editing, the
official U.N. handbook. The second contract, signed last week by
the U.N. Office for Project Services and scheduled to be signed
soon by CARE, calls for the humanitarian agency to work around the
world with employees of the United Nations and other
nongovernmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in February, CARE will conduct education programs in
five regions of the world _ the Balkans, East Africa, Southwest
Asia, Southern Africa and Afghanistan _ said Bob MacPherson, a
former Marine colonel who is CARE's top security analyst. Among
other assignments, MacPherson traveled to Kosovo last year to
supervise the start of mine removal there.
</P>
<P>
   Leaflets will be prepared that are specific to each region,
because different kinds of land mines are prevalent in different
areas, MacPherson said. And the handbook will be translated into
languages appropriate to each area.
</P>
<P>
   The handbook, designed for people who must work or travel in
high-risk areas, includes a wealth of harrowing advice. ``Do not
leave the road for any reason, even to relieve yourself,'' the
booklet says.
</P>
<P>
   And for those on foot: ``If there is no obvious safe exit route,
if you reach a point where you simply cannot remember what path you
took, or if you find a mine on what you thought was a safe exit
route, then you will have to feel first for trip wires and then
prod for mines in order to exit, a slow, painstaking, and
potentially very dangerous task. It cannot be hurried.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say many millions of land mines _ 10 million in Angola
alone, for example _ remain strewn around various parts of the
world, retaining the capacity to kill or maim long after the
conflicts that prompted their use have ended.
</P>
<P>
   The education sessions will be conducted by a subcontractor,
Mine-Tech, the Zimbabwe-based land mine removal company with whom
CARE worked in Kosovo. The sessions will be overseen by MacPherson
and a representative from the U.N. Mine Action Service.
</P>
<P>
   MacPherson, 54, is no stranger to the danger of mines. On April
7, 1969, as he crossed a rice paddy in Vietnam, he was injured by a
Claymore mine. He spent 17 months in hospitals and rehabilitative
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years later, he said, ``Desert Storm was a real
eye-opener. When we went into southern Kuwait, we had to breach
endless miles of minefields to open up the two gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the CARE/U.N. program is to ensure that employees of
the United Nations and other nongovernmental organizations, or
NGOs, stay as safe as possible as they go about their work.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the United Nations Foundation, the organization set up
to distribute Turner's gift, was available late last week to
comment on why CARE was selected to run the program. But MacPherson
said CARE is one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would now say CARE is in the top four international NGOs
that actually are involved in mines initiatives,'' MacPherson said.

 &HT;    Drug kingpin's fight for life back in court
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a day an ice storm paralyzed the region, nearly 100
people stood in the freezing rain, burning candles for an old
friend, David Ronald Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler is the marijuana ``kingpin'' from northeast Alabama
convicted of ordering the murder of a man who was keeping police
informed about his operation. He is on track to become the first
person executed by the U.S. government in almost 40 years. He is
running out of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear
arguments on whether Chandler is guilty and whether his attorney's
performance at trial was so poor he deserves a new sentencing
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Ronnie deserves a new trial,'' said Connie Farmer, an
organizer of the recent candlelight vigil and rally for Chandler,
held last weekend at Fagan's Park in Piedmont, Ala., his hometown.
``It would be a disgrace if he's executed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Chandler
proclaimed his innocence, saying he wants ``my basic right to a
fair trial and to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three months ago, Chandler's capital sentence was vacated.
In a 2-1 opinion, a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit ruled
that Chandler's lawyer was so unprepared and ineffective during the
sentencing phase of the trial that Chandler deserved a new one.
</P>
<P>
   But his reprieve was short-lived. In early January, the full
11th Circuit court vacated that decision and will now reconsider
it.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler now sits on federal death row in Terre Haute, Ind.,
where inmates are to be executed by lethal injection. The last
federal prisoner to be executed was Victor Feuger, hanged in Iowa
in 1963 for murder and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's case raises important issues. First is the question
of whether Chandler was involved in the May 8, 1990, shooting death
of Marlin ``Marty'' Shuler. A federal jury in Birmingham convicted
Chandler of having Shuler killed to silence him.
</P>
<P>
   The triggerman, Charles Ray Jarrell, was the government's star
witness in tying Chandler to the slaying. He said he killed Shuler
for $500, although he admitted Chandler never paid him. In return
for Jarrell's cooperation, prosecutors declined to prosecute him
for the death penalty; he is serving a 25-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But Jarrell has since recanted his testimony, saying it was all
a lie. Jarrell now says prosecutors pressured him into
incriminating Chandler. He says he killed Shuler because of
Shuler's abuse of his wife and mother-in-law, who were Jarrell's
sister and mother.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Jarrell recanted his testimony, Chandler's requests
for a new trial have been denied.
</P>
<P>
   LAWYER LACKED PREPARATION
</P>
<P>
   In motions before the court, Justice Department lawyer Robert
Erickson said the federal prosecutors and agents who tried Chandler
were found to be credible when denying Jarrell's new accusations
that they put him up to lie. The trial judge presiding over the
case found Jarrell's recantation was ``obviously untrue'' in some
respects and ``internally contradictory'' in others.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's best chance on appeal appears to be obtaining a new
sentencing hearing. In a line of court cases dating back decades,
the U.S. Supreme Court has said convictions and sentences can be
overturned if a defendant did not receive effective legal
representation.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish this, two conditions must be met: First, a court
must find that the lawyer's work did not meet acceptable standards.
Second, the court must find that the lawyer's deficient performance
so prejudiced the case there is a ``reasonable probability'' the
outcome would have been different.
</P>
<P>
   In other rulings, the high court has said lawyers cannot be
prohibited from presenting mitigating evidence on behalf of capital
defendants, so the jury can treat the defendant as a ``uniquely
individual human being.''
</P>
<P>
   During the sentencing phase of Chandler's trial, his lawyer,
Drew Redden, called only two witnesses, Chandler's wife and mother.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing an appeal, Chandler's new lawyer, Jack Martin of
Atlanta, found dozens of witnesses who said they would have come
forward at trial and testified on Chandler's behalf if only they
had been asked. Their testimony, during post-trial hearings in
Birmingham, was filled with remarkable stories of Chandler's
kindness, patriotism and benevolence.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler brought groceries, clothing and firewood to poor
families, taught laid-off workers carpentry and masonry skills,
helped build a church fellowship hall for free, gave money to an
indigent family so they could afford to bury their recently
deceased son, and bought two pairs of shoes for a boy he saw
running barefoot through the projects, according to some of the
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he did to prepare a mitigation case on behalf of
Chandler, Redden has said, ``I would say basically not anything
explicitly.''
</P>
<P>
   COMPARING CASES
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling vacating the death sentence, Judge Stanley Birch
of Atlanta noted that the scant testimony from Chandler's wife and
mother stated little more about Chandler ``other than the fact he
liked to participate in building houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Birch said the jury should have heard far more. This is not a
case in which ``only marginal mitigating evidence existed,'' Birch
wrote. ``There is no evidence that Redden asked a single question
or conducted any interview specifically with mitigation in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a strong dissent, Judge J.L. Edmondson urged that
Chandler's death sentence be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   As for Redden's performance in Chandler's case, Edmondson said,
``We have vindicated lawyers who did far less.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson, a former Gwinnett County school board lawyer, wrote
that the majority opinion was ``out of step'' with prior court
decisions, particularly the case of Robert Lee Tarver.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, Edmondson wrote the 11th Circuit's ruling
upholding the death sentence against Tarver, convicted in the 1985
murder and robbery of an Alabama grocer.
</P>
<P>
   Like Redden in Chandler's case, Tarver's trial lawyer tried to
get the jury to focus on lingering doubt as to whether Tarver
committed the killing. Tarver's lawyer also presented scant
evidence on his client's behalf in mitigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined that his acts were not ineffective; but today's
court says that counsel in this case was,'' Edmondson wrote in his
dissent in the Chandler case. ``Cases that are essentially similar
_ Tarver and this one _ ought to have the same result.''
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic twist, Edmondson added, ``The evidence of guilt in
(Chandler's) case was, by no means, overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Birch countered that the record shows that Redden began
preparing for the death penalty phase of the case ``only when it
was absolutely imminent. ... The fact there is a reasonable chance
of acquittal on capital charges does not in any way alleviate the
attorney's obligation to prepare for the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   In court motions, Martin, who will argue Chandler's case
Tuesday, said Edmondson was ``flat wrong'' in saying Tarver's and
Chandler's cases were virtually identical.
</P>
<P>
   Tarver's lawyer conducted a ``substantial character witness
investigation'' before making a deliberate decision not to use it,
Martin said. Redden failed to make even a preliminary investigation
on which to base a decision, he said.

 &HT;    Prison torture case reconsidered
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ During a 1996 shakedown at Dooly State Prison in
Georgia, guards engaged in sadistic and degrading abuse, several
inmates have alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven inmates filed a federal lawsuit, saying guards made them
take off their clothes in front of a female guard, tap dance naked
and shave with an unlubricated razor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear
arguments in Miami as to whether a law passed by Congress in 1996
bars such lawsuits by prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this law is upheld, guards can treat prisoners like animals
at the zoo, and so long as there is no physical injury involved,
they can get away with it,'' said Stephen Bright, director of the
Southern Center for Rights, a lawyer in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections officials have denied the allegations,
saying guards did nothing wrong at the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, a three-judge 11th Circuit panel dismissed most of
the claims. Only claims filed by prisoners who are no longer in
prison were allowed to go forward. But the full 12-member court
vacated that decision and will reconsider the case Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Congress, when it passed the Prison
Litigation Reform Act, could bar prisoners from seeking remedies
for certain constitutional violations. The act says no federal
action may be brought by a prisoner for mental or emotional injury
suffered while in custody, without a prior showing of physical
injury.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the case, inmates will be unable to collect damages
for claims of psychological torture, racial discrimination, sexual
harassment and invasion of bodily privacy, Robert Toone, a lawyer
for the inmates, said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department, in a motion supporting the state,
urged the court to uphold the law. Five international law
professors, who filed their own brief, say the law is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law of the United States does not allow torture, even if
the torture leaves no physical scars,'' said the brief, written by
Georgia State University Professor Natsu Saito.

 &HT;    An island with a view
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett, Scott Shepard and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain's campaign bus was somewhere in New Hampshire, five
days before voters will sort out McCain's political future.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the bus, the setting was Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, former prisoner of war, was telling a sweet story of
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Dinah Shore's version of ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' and
other holiday songs played on the loudspeaker as McCain sat alone
in his Hanoi Hilton cell on a cold Christmas Eve 1970. ``They did
everything they could to help our morale,'' he deadpans.
</P>
<P>
   In walks ``The Cat,'' as he is called by POWs. The chief of
North Vietnamese prisons, this is the man who offered McCain the
chance to go home two years earlier, an offer McCain felt bound to
refuse. ``I had not seen him since,'' McCain recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat is in an expansive mood and they talk for maybe 45
minutes. Unlike in previous encounters, The Cat speaks English,
going on about Ho Chi Minh, North Vietnam's leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat talks about Ho's private villa on an island in Ha Long
Bay, where Ho and his guests watch the sun set over the bay. Then
The Cat leaves, and McCain never sees him again.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, McCain, now a senator from Arizona, is lunching in
the Senate dining room with a Vietnamese official who worked on
restoring ties between the United States and Vietnam. McCain
mentions that he's planning a trip to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The man asks McCain if he'd like any help, McCain says he would
and begins to describe Ho's island villa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy almost fell out of his chair,'' McCain says. ``He
said, `How do you know about that? No one knows about that
island.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later, McCain, his wife, Cindy, and Mark Salter, his
chief Senate aide, visit Vietam and take a boat to the island and
watch the sunset. The ex-Navy pilot who once rained bombs on Ho's
people stays the night in Ho's villa, which by now is rundown.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you think?'' he is asked on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live long enough ...'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   LESSONS FROM THE KING
</P>
<P>
   As I watched the last debate between Al Gore and Bill Bradley in
Manchester, N.H., on Wednesday, I couldn't stop from mentally
morphing Bradley into Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   I had only recently learned that Bradley, while in the U.S.
Senate, had studied the King's movies. The senator thought that
this could, in some way, help him improve his own communications
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Bradley began duking it out with Gore in the debate the
other night, in my mind he slowly morphed into ``Kid Galahad.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the movie in which Elvis plays a singing ex-GI mechanic
who becomes a boxer and rises to fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis' best line in the movie certainly reflected the new
fighting-back nature of the Bradley campaign: ``This is one grease
monkey that don't slide so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more.
</P>
<P>
   It also seems that Bradley, at the age of 22, and already a
national celebrity as a result of his basketball skills, made a
pilgrimage to Graceland, the Presley home in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I climbed up the wall that surrounded Graceland, reached over
to a limb that was from a tree inside the wall, snapped the leaf
off the tree and kept that leaf in my wallet for about six years,''
Bradley told MTV last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley came into the press filing center after the debate, but
I couldn't get close enough to tell him about how he had turned
into ``Kid Galahad'' in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   I also couldn't tell him that a man who claims to be the King's
illegitimate son is working for his rival.
</P>
<P>
   I met that man last fall in Nashville when Al Gore was moving
his campaign headquarters to Music City.
</P>
<P>
   He had bushy sideburns, wore sunglasses and a jacket covered
with gold buttons. He signed one of the campaign volunteer forms
``Elvis.'' Then, before driving off in a black Corvette with the
license plate ``Elvis 1,'' he declared, ``Gore is our leader for
the next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   PIE IN THE SKY
</P>
<P>
   After losing two-to-one to Al Gore in the Iowa caucuses, former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley beat a hasty retreat to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley was in jovial spirits as he boarded a Boeing 727
Monday night for the flight to the Granite State. Before take off,
Bradley wandered back to the section of the plane reserved for the
press with a special treat for reporters: macadamia nut pie.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley cheerfully cut up pieces of the pie _ a gift from a
supporter _ and handed them out to reporters one at a time. Bradley
raved about the pie _ until New York Times reporter James Dao
examined the pie's list of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ingredients was Kona coffee beans from Hawaii, a
source of caffeine. Bradley must avoid caffeine because it can
trigger an irregular heart beat, a non-life threatening condition
he was diagnosed with in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding me,'' Bradley exclaimed, rolling his eyes,
shaking his head and forcing out a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The pie apparently wasn't enough to trigger any problems for
Bradley, as he stayed in the back of the plane chatting with
reporters until the it was airborne.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes into the flight, the pilot of the charter jet
announced that the plane was leaving Iowa airspace. A spontaneous
cheer erupted among the press corps and Bradley's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley only smiled.

 &HT;    Caesar spreads faith through singing
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Shirley Caesar answers the phone in her
North Carolina home with just a hint of formality. ``Is this for
radio?'' she asks. When told the interview is for a newspaper, she
relaxes her voice _ no need to sound peppy and perfect _ and says,
``This is good. I can lay down to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   And talk she does. When you're the reigning queen of gospel, a
61-year-old dynamo who delivers the truth as song, you've got
stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Like the time she sang for Bob Dylan at the Kennedy Center
Honors. The rock legend insisted she attend _ or else he wouldn't
bother showing up. ``Well, Bob is crazy,'' she says with affection.
</P>
<P>
   Or the time she took a small bit of the money she earned as a
child on the gospel circuit and treated herself to a cherry cola
and a hamburger. ``I felt guilty,'' she says, noting that she
normally saved her pay to support her ailing mother.
</P>
<P>
   But these stories pale in comparison to the music. When Caesar
sings, it's a joyful noise indeed. She maintains the
praise-be-to-Jesus bedrock of traditional gospel _ the music of
such greats as Mahalia Jackson and James Cleveland _ but she weds
it to a more R&AMP;B-friendly sound. The voice is big and beautiful,
the place where grand opera meets the dirt-road church. ``The
spirit of the Lord is upon me,'' Caesar exclaims in one of her
numbers. It's hard to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a singing evangelist, I have the two ministries in one,''
she explains.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't take her mission lightly: Caesar has looked beyond
the stage and started her own church in Raleigh, N.C. There are
about 600 members in the congregation, but she's already thinking
of building a house of worship that seats 1,500. She's hesitant to
ask for money, but if that's what it takes, she'll do it. ``There
was a time I was ashamed, because I've always been the giver. I've
come to a point now where I need everybody's help,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not on the pulpit, Caesar is likely to be in class:
She's going for her master's degree in theology at Duke University.
What could she possibly be learning that she doesn't already know?
</P>
<P>
   ``You sound like one of my instructors,'' Caesar says with a
laugh. She's taking a course this semester called ``Introduction to
the Old Testament.'' And, yes, she says she's learning plenty.
</P>
<P>
   But Caesar's main activity is singing. She gives 150
performances a year and has recorded 30 albums, earning nine Grammy
Awards along the way (she's up for another this year). Her work has
also extended into film: She's recorded songs for the soundtracks
of ``The Prince of Egypt'' and ``The Preacher's Wife,'' among
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do more of it. It gives my career a boost,'' Caesar
says, adding that she'd also be willing to try a role in front of
the camera. ``As long as I don't have to act out of character, play
the role of a prostitute or something like that,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little chance of that. After all, Caesar resisted
the temptation to do straight-ahead R&AMP;B and soul, despite the many
opportunities she's had. It's what distinguishes her from so many
gospel-trained singers: Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, et al.
Caesar has no objections to other people's choices; she just has to
do what's right for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel that somebody has to keep up that tradition,'' she
explains. That also means that even when she's still singing about
Jesus Christ, she's not about to let her sound stray too far in a
contemporary direction. ``With a lot of the music today, you don't
know whether you're listening to a gospel song or R&AMP;B ... If the
music is too far out then you will lose the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Caesar discovered her gift early in childhood. The inspiration
was a sink full of dirty dishes that she and her sister had to
wash. As she tells it, the two would sing to pass the time _ and in
those days before air-conditioning, ``our voices began to ring out
in the community.'' Performances in churches and schools soon
followed. By 8, she was touring as ``Baby Shirley.''
</P>
<P>
   Her name was firmly established a decade later when she became a
member of The Caravans, a renowned gospel troupe. A decade after
that, she went solo. It's been a busy career, with little time for
slowing down. Caesar says her biggest regret is that she married
late and never raised a family. ``At one point, I felt that life
had passed me by,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   But even without children, she's got a circle of friends, family
and admirers. She is revered by other singers, especially those
outside gospel, as evidenced by the Dylan anecdote. Her next album
may join her with the likes of Franklin, Houston, Gladys Knight and
Lauryn Hill for a gospel-meets-R&AMP;B series of duets. She likes the
idea of bringing some established artists back into the gospel
fold, but she also likes the idea of finding a more mainstream
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, you can stay in the running,'' Caesar says. ``I
don't want to get left behind in any sense.''

powerful political figures. Amalia Garcia, 47, is the first woman
to be elected president of a political party in this country where
machismo still generally rules. She was born one year before
Mexican women won the right to vote in 1953. She was deeply
involved in politics by 1975, the year when Mexico finally erased a
law declaring that husbands could forbid wives from working outside
the home. Today Garcia leads the Democratic Revolution Party, or
PRD, a leftist party that fiercely opposes Mexico's Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has controlled Mexico's federal
government and most state governments for 70 years. Garcia is
considered the brains behind a PRD strategy to gain power by
softening its left-wing image and forging electoral coalitions with
other Mexican opposition parties. Last year her party won, for the

Appeals will hear arguments on his case. Late last year, the court
reinstated the death penalty against Chandler, deciding to
reconsider a three-judge panel ruling that ordered a new sentencing
trial because Chandler's trial lawyer failed to call dozens of
witnesses who could have testified about numerous good deeds
Chandler did in the community. (He bought shoes for poor children
and groceries for hungry families and built a fellowship hall for
his church, among other things.) This is also the case where the
government's star witness - the actual killer in a murder-for-hire
- has recanted his testimony. (Rankin, Atlanta

him, his lawyers say. At issue is the Prison Reform Litigation Act,
passed in 1996, which bars lawsuits by inmates who claim to have
suffered mental or emotional harm unless they can show they also
have been physically harmed. The law has been upheld by a
three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit, but two other circuit courts
(the 2nd and 9th) have ruled to the contrary, saying Congress has
no right to take away constitutional claims from anyone. (Rankin,

SOUTH FACES A ONE-TWO WEATHER PUNCH

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ As the Mississippi Delta began to dig out
Saturday from the unusually heavy snowstorm of last week, another
storm made its way up from the Gulf of Mexico toward the already
weather-weary areas of Georgia and central North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, residents awoke Saturday to the second winter storm
in a week. Treacherous icy roads recalled the ice storm of the
previous week that had left 340,000 Georgia Power customers without
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   City officials determined to make sure that major roads were
passable for the thousands of visitors in town for the Super Bowl
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to get hit with this over the night, and
road crews are moving as quickly as they can,'' said Bill Howard, a
spokesman for the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very patchy,'' Howard added. ``The most concern seems to
be on the north side of the city where some of the bridges,
overpasses, entrances and exits to the freeways are giving us some
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Davis of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency said,
``It's really nerve-racking out there on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   City and state road crews scattered salt and sand on roads
throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area, as the National Weather
Service predicted that temperatures would hover around freezing
with occasional freezing rain through the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be kind of a long drawn-out affair over the next
24 to 36 hours, with temperatures hovering near or above the
freezing mark,'' said Dean Hutsell, a National Weather Service
meteorologist in Peachtree City, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the National Football League, said
Super Bowl officials were keeping a close eye on the forecasts.
``The weather has had some impact on some of the events surrounding
the game,'' Aiello said. ``Some people haven't been able to get
into town, because their flights were canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   Pregame festivities continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The annual Super Bowl party went off without a hitch,'' Aiello
said. About 5,000 people attended the coat-and-tie affair on Friday
evening just as snow had begun to fall, around 7 p.m. Freezing rain
continued into the night. ``I don't think the forecast is all that
severe,'' Aiello said. ``It's just unusual because it's here in
Atlanta,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the icy roads, fans were making their way to a 20-acre
Super Bowl theme park inside the Georgia World Congress Center,
said David Newman, vice president of marketing and events for the
park, called the NFL Experience. At 8:30 Saturday morning, 250
teen-age girls were standing in line to hear a 2 p.m. performance
by the rock group N' Sync, Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hyatt Regency in Atlanta, Ted Kanatas, the hotel manager,
said most of the Super Bowl guests had arrived, but because of the
icy roads, employees had difficulty driving to work, so only about
half of his housekeeping staff had arrived Saturday morning. ``We
are modifying our services,'' he said. ``We will reach every guest
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, disaster-weary North Carolinians braced Saturday
for additional snow and ice, even as record low temperatures
continued to keep last Tuesday's 2-foot snowfall on the ground in
many places.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 people in North Carolina remained without power, and
officials prepared for that number to increase if the storm moving
through Georgia makes it way north and east, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   State officials prepared for the storm by stockpiling
four-wheel-drive vehicles in eight locations around the state and
mobilizing 1,000 National Guardsmen to be ready to deliver supplies
to residents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Up to 100 two-person chain-saw teams were also formed, divided
between Asheville and Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hunt of North Carolina, who asked for federal disaster
aid to deal with the previous week's storm, urged residents on
Saturday to stock up on groceries, water, heaters and other items
they might need.
</P>
<P>
   Many took his advice, filling stores around the state faster
than shelves could be restocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are panicking and trying to stay ahead of the
weather,'' said Tim Riggs, manager of a Kroger supermarket in
Raleigh, where lines formed before the store opened Saturday
morning. ``It's getting worse as the day goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   In western Tennessee and Mississippi, an idyllic winter
landscape began to thaw Saturday as rising temperatures melted
snowmen and cleared snow-covered rooftops. The area was blanketed
with anywhere from an inch to a foot of snow, yet it had no major
power outages or road problems. But with temperatures in the 20s,
driving conditions in Arkansas remained dangerous, and 15 inches of
snow had fallen in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Stretches of Interstate 40, west of Little Rock, and of
Interstate 30, about 50 miles south of Little Rock, were impassable
because of trucks that jackknifed on the ice and snow. On Friday
the Arkansas Highway Patrol estimated that at least 1,000 motorists
had been stranded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow we had yesterday froze overnight,'' said Officer
Susan Willingham of the Arkansas State Police. ``Now the roads are
even icier.''
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, Tenn., James Webster, 42, played with his two
children in the snow and reflected on how the weather had affected
him in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Webster, a printing salesman, had been in New York on business a
couple of weeks ago and witnessed the city's first snowfall. Then
he flew to North Carolina last weekend for its record-breaking
snowstorm. And on Friday he was home in Memphis, as the city
received the most snow it had seen in over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has followed me all over the country,'' Webster said.
``Considering I haven't seen snow in years, it's pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted Saturday that the mix of ice and snow
creating problems in the Southeast would make its way up the coast
into the Northeast on Monday or Tuesday. That fits in with
Webster's travel plans. ``Next week,'' he said, ``I'm going to
Manhattan again.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FAMILY AND FOOD: PLAYERS RECALL THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, La.)  (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before they were football players, they were fans.
</P>
<P>
   They sat in front of the television set on Super Bowl Sunday,
watching and dreaming, absorbing the legends of the big game.
</P>
<P>
   And eating. Eating is a major aspect of the Super Bowl. Never
mind the junk-food stereotype of homebound fans. There are NFL
people who can remember serious cooking going on the morning of the
Super Bowls of their childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deviled eggs, fried chicken, greens, the whole soul-food
thing,'' recalled Barron Wortham, a Tennessee Titans linebacker who
will be playing in his first Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl has been with them all their lives, a presence
toward the end of January. By and large, the players do not dwell
on the excess, the way the league and the sponsors turn one game
into a weeklong glut of ceremony and hype.
</P>
<P>
   The players tend to remember the good times in their family
homes, the flickering images on the tube, the famous names that
gave them a goal, a hope, a framework, a history.
</P>
<P>
   These huge and graceful men are too young to remember when there
was no Super Bowl, merely league championship games. They remember
only the dominance of the Super Bowl, always held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would leave church early,'' recalled Wortham, who grew up
in Fort Worth, Texas. ``We had to get home to watch the Cowboys
win. The whole Metroplex was rooting for them. Whenever I think of
the Super Bowl, I think of Tom Landry.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just in the Dallas-Fort Worth area but everywhere, fans got
used to the impassive face of Landry, showing the odd flicker of
human expression below his ever-present hat. But there were other
faces of the Super Bowl. Every player has his own best memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember sitting in my dorm at North Carolina State
watching Doug Williams play quarterback for Washington,'' recalled
Ray Agnew, the defensive tackle with the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see a black quarterback winning the Super
Bowl,'' said Agnew, who is African-American. ``That meant a lot to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   As that old barrier crumbles year by year, Steve McNair of the
Titans has the chance to be the second winning black quarterback _
except that Agnew would just as soon sack McNair six or eight times
Sunday afternoon, to keep him from that honor.
</P>
<P>
   Every player has his memory of his first Super Bowl. Devin Bush,
the Rams' backup safety from Miami, was watching the game on
television when Cincinnati's Tim Krumrie suffered a broken leg
early in the 1989 Super Bowl, stopping the momentum of the game as
doctors treated Krumrie on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was ugly,'' Bush recalled with a shudder.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way Super Bowl tickets go mainly to the corporate fat
cats, few players saw a Super Bowl in person when they were
children. Somehow or other, the family of Matt Willig, now a backup
offensive lineman with the Rams, came up with tickets to the 1980
Super Bowl in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a blast,'' Willig recalled. ``We got there early. I
remember looking around me in the stands and seeing celebrities.
George Foster, who played for the Cincinnati Reds, was right near
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest celebrities were those frequent visitors to the
Super Bowl, the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with Jack Lambert,'' Willig recalled. ``Our
seats were down pretty close and I could see how tough he was, the
enforcer. But then after the game I saw him even closer, and he was
very impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to that point, I only played a little flag football, but
that made me want to be a football player,'' Willig added.
</P>
<P>
   The teams that made repeated trips to the Super Bowl tend to
dominate the memories of the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from Louisiana, I rooted for Terry Bradshaw and the
Steelers,'' said O'Neill Gilbert, the linebacker coach with the
Titans who never played pro football but has reached the Super Bowl
in his third year in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it was cold in Louisiana at that time of year, we would
have jambalaya and gumbo,'' Gilbert said. ``We'd have 15 or 20
people over and we would sit at the table and my mother would serve
a feast. I would root for the Steelers. I loved their linebackers
and I loved Mean Joe Greene.''
</P>
<P>
   His colleague, Jerry Gray, the former Pro Bowl safety from
Lubbock, Texas, who coaches the Titans' defensive backs, raised his
eyes hearing about Gilbert's team of preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated the Pittsburgh Steelers,'' said Gray, who never played
in a Super Bowl. ``I can remember Don Meredith, Garrison Hill,
Robert Newhouse, Tony Dorsett. When my Cowboys would lose to the
Steelers, it was a bad day for me. But the Super Bowl became the
ultimate. Everybody in the country is tuned in, and you can
identify.''
</P>
<P>
   The first 33 games are part of the collective memory of the
players. Thursday there will be millions of young fans dreaming of
being Eddie George and Marshall Faulk. And then there will be the
deviled eggs, the jambalaya. The dreams taste good on Super Bowl
Sunday. &QL;

AT CONFERENCE ON TRADE, CLINTON MAKES PITCH FOR POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Against a sudden wave of angst among
corporate and political leaders about the growing gap between rich
and poor, President Clinton on Saturday issued an impassioned
appeal to make global trade work for the poor, too.
</P>
<P>
   In what amounted to his gospel on globalization, Clinton told an
audience of chief executives and national leaders attending the
World Economic Forum that if the economic elite who had created,
managed and benefited from globalization did not listen to the
concerns of those left out, protectionism would return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new network,'' Clinton said, speaking to an affluent
and influential audience that included top business executives but
also the leaders of South Africa and Colombia, and the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat. ``But don't leave the little guys out.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500 demonstrators, apparently trying to mirror on a
smaller scale the disturbances against the World Trade Organization
meeting in Seattle last November, were kept away from the hall
where Clinton spoke by phalanxes of heavily armed Swiss police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of demonstrators broke windows in a nearby
McDonald's restaurant that features a large statue of the company's
icon, Ronald McDonald, and, according to witnesses, injured several
policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first U.S. president to attend the forum, and his
presence here, if only for less than a day, was seen as an effort
to put his personal imprimatur on the forces of globalization that
his economic polices have encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   And with five cabinet secretaries in tow, including Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence
Summers, Clinton used the occasion to elaborate on the major
foreign policy theme of his State of the Union address Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to reaffirm unambiguously that open markets and
rules-based trade are the best engine we know to lift living
standards, reduce environmental destruction and build shared
prosperity,'' Clinton said. ``This is true whether you're in
Detroit, Davos, Dhaka or Dakar.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to include the developing world in the benefits of
globalization, the well-off have to make some adjustments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among these, he listed lifting the burden of debt of developing
countries, inviting the committee on trade and environment of the
World Trade Organization to examine environmental concerns of
developing countries, and developing new institutional forums for
including those who feel left out of the global economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton was not specific about what new forums he had in mind.
Afterward, Summers said that the president had no new specific
proposals but was concerned that the ``institutional architecture''
take care of such issues as global warming, transborder crime and
developing vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's theme of incorporating the poor in the new global
economy received a mixed reception. The only applause during his
speech was his reference to his State of the Union proposal to give
tax benefits to companies that worked on vaccines for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, some economists questioned whether Clinton was
tempering his enthusiasm for open markets too much. ``It was a
balanced speech, but he left unclear whether he wants to impose our
social norms on the developing countries,'' said Horst Siebert,
head of the Kiel Institute of the World Economy in Germany.
``Nobody wants children in Bangladesh working in factories, but we
should not be imposing our norms on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister of trade for Singapore, George Yong-Boon Yeo,
suggested that Clinton's concern for the well-being of the
developing world would not be accepted as totally sincere.
Developing countries ``find it hard to believe that you care more
about their health and development than they do themselves,'' he
said after the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Tinges of anti-Americanism peppered some of the panel
discussions. At one panel, a moderator asked for a ``non-American''
questioner. It was noted that Clinton swept into town with a bevy
of cabinet secretaries, in contrast, for example, to Prime Minister
Tony Blair of Britain, who came and went quietly Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke, a cluster of annoyed participants and invited
officials, including Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey, had to
cool their heels and listen in the hall outside after the Secret
Service barred them from entering because of crowding.
</P>
<P>
   For the first, time nongovernmental organizations, which have
expressed concerns about the effects of globalization on the
developing world, were present at the forum in some strength.
Clinton did not refer to them directly, but repeatedly urged his
audience to be inclusive rather than exclusive in figuring the
rules of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the words of that slogan that people my daughter's age
always use, denial is not just a river in Egypt,'' Clinton said, to
laughter. ``And the more we hunker down and refuse to devote time
systematically to discussing these issues and letting peole express
their honest opinion, the more we are going to fuel the fires of
protectionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Without backing away from concerns that he insisted be covered
by the world trade talks that eventually collapsed in Seattle in
December, Clinton tried to address the unease in the developing
world about his sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the words `labor and environment' are heard with
suspicion in the developing world when they are uttered by people
from the developed world,'' he said. ``I understand that these
words are code for rich-country protectionism.'' He answered the
concern, saying: ``I have never asked any developing nation, and
never will, to give up a more prosperous future. But in today's
world, developing countries can achieve growth without making some
of the mistakes most developed countries made on worker protection
and the environment as we were on our path to industrialization.''
</P>
<P>
   This was possible, Clinton said, because the new economy had
produced enough scientific and technological advances that
disproved old ideas about growth.

 &HT;    FUNDING UP, SPENDING DOWN FOR SCHOOL TECHNOLOGY
 &HT;    With TECH-CHART. 670&AMP;add.
 &HT;    With photos.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ A bewildering array of public and private funders
is pumping roughly $7 billion a year into educational technology
for the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Yet spending on technology by public schools, which exceeded
$142 per student in the 1998-99 school year, is on track to drop to
as low as $133 per student this year, according to a recent report
from Quality Education Data.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trend is natural: Spending on computers and other
hardware is dropping by $13 per student as the most tech-savvy
districts finish the process of installing on-line data connections
in every classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, that drop was only partly offset by increased
spending on software purchases, support, training and related
costs.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of unprecedented national prosperity, many educators
expected much bigger spending increases for using technology to
raise student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the drop may be explained by the increasing reliance of
schools on technology partnerships with local businesses, community
groups and youth agencies, where the spending shows up only on the
other partners' books.
</P>
<P>
   But many public school supporters think there's another reason:
groups with better skills in ``grantsmanship'' are acing out the
public schools in the intense competition for technology funds.
These include universities, libraries, research groups and private
for-profit or nonprofit researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people, including teachers and principals, get
confused. They can't figure the system out,'' said Robert Cooke of
Boca Raton, Fla. As grants coordinator for the police department in
nearby Fort Lauderdale, he has raised funds for more than 20
programs run by his department, other city departments, youth
agencies and the local schools.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools compete fiercely for funds from a handful of
well-known programs, such as foundations run by brand-name
technology companies such as America Online, BellSouth, MCI
Worldcom and Microsoft. Meanwhile, other, lesser-known foundations
get too few requests from schools for technology funds, even though
many local foundations are flush with stock-market gains and
required by the IRS to give away a sum equal to 5 percent of their
assets each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if there is an extra billion dollars
available out there for every two billion dollars that is put to
use,'' Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
   He was part of an overflow crowd of more than 500 participants,
mostly teachers and principals, who paid up to $495 apiece for a
cram course here Thursday and Friday on grant-getting skills.
</P>
<P>
   Many have high hopes. A survey of graduates of last year's
seminar showed they raised an average of $7 million apiece last
year for education technology, said Gregg Downey, editor and
publisher of eSchool (cq) News. The monthly publication for
educators interested in technology trends sponsored the seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Some came with detailed questions about how they could squeeze
more money out of the nation's biggest single source of educational
technology money, the e-rate, which is funded from the ``universal
service'' surcharge on everyone's telephone bill.
</P>
<P>
   Their prospects are mixed, said Kate Moore, president of the
schools and library division of the non-profit company formed by
the Federal Communications Commission to distribute e-rate funds.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that, after distributing just under $1.96
billion last year, her e-rate agency hopes to give out $2.25
billion in each of the next two years. And the application process,
which baffled some educators and infuriated others, has been
simplified, though many restrictions on the use of such funds are
necessary under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that there's more competition. By this month's
deadline, Moore's division had received 36,000 applications from
schools, districts and libraries, up from 32,000 last year. And a
single big school system, the Los Angeles Unified School District,
has applied for $450 million, or 20 percent of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   E-rate funds are especially important to poor regions because,
the funds can help leverage other grants, said Cathey(cq) George, a
teacher in the La Vega Independent School District near Waco,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Her district is so poor that more than 80 percent of its 2,500
students qualify for free or reduced-price school lunches. But with
the help of e-rate funds, it just finished installing a $500,000
wireless network with ultra-speedy connections.
</P>
<P>
   All classrooms have several computers linked to the Internet,
all teachers have e-mail accounts, parents can get school news and
see homework assignments on a Web site, and video conferences can
be transmitted from the high school's multimedia lab to all other
school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   To finance it, George matched a $400,000 e-rate grant with a
$100,000 state grant, which she matched with $10,000 in local funds
that included donations and unspent funds she found in a textbook
account.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of three microwave towers, which couldn't be paid for
with e-rate funds, will be offset within two years by related
savings on the district's telecommunications bills, since it won't
have to lease high-speed T1 telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandparents can be your secret weapon'' in convincing school
boards to allow imaginative financial schemes, George told her
fellow teachers. With so many parents working one or two jobs,
grandparents ``are the ones with the time to show up and tell the
school board they want the very best for their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Few new competitive grants will be awarded by the U.S.
Department of Education this year, even though its technology
grants have grown from $82 billion in 1996 to $789 billion this
year, indicated Julie Kaminkow of the department's office of
educational technology.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the money will go to the states, which will hold
their own competitions. Much of the rest is being used to fund
runners-up from last year's competitions, in some of which the
losers outnumbered the winners by 20 to one. In addition, in some
cases where Congress increased funding, influential lawmakers
earmarked the new money for their own constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the lecturers told the grant-seekers that they
would have a better chance of getting funds if they joined in
partnerships with local businesses, volunteer groups, youth
agencies or institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tap your existing outside support systems first,'' urged Jill
Stephens, director of the AOL Foundation's day-to-day activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you give them all credit,'' advised Glenn Jones, a
former Atlanta educator who now is principal of a high school in
Washington, D.C. In a local experiment, the AOL Foundation sets
aside a $500 college scholarship each semester for any student in
his school whose lowest grade is an A or a B.
</P>
<P>
   He had to reassure some of the school's other business partners
``who started to get jealous'' when the big AOL program started at
his school. ``The politics of this job never ceases to amaze me,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in remote areas, it makes no sense for schools,
police or sheriff's departments and fire departments to try to fund
separate data networks, said Judy Isom, a board member of the Rural
Technology Foundation in Bessemer, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools need the Internet, and the law and fire forces need
redundant capacity to back up their phone lines,'' she said.
``Partnerships are the way to go.''

 &HT;    Parents can take steps to keep children safe from firearms in
other homes
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When Linda Blanford's new next-door neighbors
moved in last summer, she was glad the family had young children
who could play with her three kids, ages 4, 7 and 11.
</P>
<P>
   But Blanford also knew the household would contain a potential
danger _ a handgun. After all, the father was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was working up the courage to ask ``the big
question,'' said Blanford. She waited until her neighbor was mowing
his lawn one day and said to him, ``I was just wondering where you
keep your gun, and whether it's loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanford said her neighbor's answer was polite but not very
reassuring. ``He said his kids know not to touch it, but I couldn't
go with that. To me, it wasn't worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanford allows her children to visit inside the home only when
the father, and his gun, are at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this seems a little paranoid,'' she said, ``but I just
started thinking, gosh, anywhere your kids go, you don't know who
has a gun and who doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Paranoid? Child-safety experts say absolutely not. Chances are
50-50 that the home your child is visiting has a firearm, according
to national surveys. Every day, an estimated 13 children die from
gunfire in the United States, making it the second-leading cause of
death among those younger than 19.
</P>
<P>
   And for every child killed by a gun, four others are seriously
wounded, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Given those frightening numbers, says Julie Stucke, a pediatric
psychologist at Children's Medical Center in Dayton, ``it's very
appropriate ... to ask the family of your child's friend or
neighbor if they have a gun in the house and what safety
precautions they take.''
</P>
<P>
   The questioning doesn't have to be confrontational, she said.
``You can say, `I know there have been a lot of shootings lately,
or I've read a lot about kids being hurt by guns.' It's just a
concern _ not that you think the parents are irresponsible or allow
children to play with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ellen Rome, head of adolescent medicine at the Cleveland
Clinic, says parents shouldn't just drop their kids off at a
friend's or neighbor's home. They should go in and meet the
parents, and strike up a conversation to find out their views on
gun safety, teen alcohol use and other risk factors for children.
</P>
<P>
   If that seems too pushy, ``you can always dump the blame on your
pediatrician,'' Rome said. ``Tell them, `Boy, my pediatrician says
I need to be less naive and more aware about community attitudes on
guns. What's your view on guns in the household?'''
</P>
<P>
   Or ask the parents how they broach the subject of gun safety
with their own children. ``That way you're empowering another
parent rather than being offensive,'' Rome said.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Stucke said, parents should teach their children
about gun safety at the earliest possible age, perhaps when they
are still toddlers. Parents can start by telling children not to
point play guns at each other. Children also should be told that,
when they find a real gun, they should never touch it and
immediately tell an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Kids should be instructed in gun safety ``probably from age 3
on, if not sooner, because they are often watching TV shows where
there are guns, or hearing about them from friends,'' Stucke said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should make clear to young children that TV and movie
violence is fantasy, and that real guns can do terrifying harm.
``Using developmentally appropriate language, you have to tell them
that guns are dangerous, that they can hurt people, that they can
even kill people,'' Stucke said.
</P>
<P>
   For a toddler or 3-year-old who doesn't understand words such as
dangerous or death, ``you might say the gun can make a really big
ouchie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before a sleepover, parents can do some role-playing with their
young children about what they should do if they see a gun in the
home or if their friend brings one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about how you don't touch the gun. Or how you get out of
the room. Or maybe have them call Mom or Dad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Child-safety advocates say it's always safest not to keep
firearms in the house. But at the very least, guns should be
unloaded and locked, and ammunition stored and locked separately.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, there are no guarantees when it comes to children.
``The more you say `no,' the more it seems like forbidden fruit,''
Rome said. As for locks and hiding places, ``kids can figure these
things out.''
</P>
<P>
   In many inner-city neighborhoods, Rome says, teen-agers often
feel the need to carry a gun or knife for protection. Statistics
show, however, that carrying a weapon is a prime risk factor for
being hurt or killed by one.
</P>
<P>
   Among children and youths age 19 and younger, 84 percent of
firearm deaths occur in the home, according to the American Academy
of Pediatrics. And when a youth fires a gun at home, the victim
most often will be the youth himself (35 percent), a friend (34
percent), a sibling (25 percent) or a parent or other relative (6
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Parents shouldn't be shy about asking their children's teen-age
friends if they carry a weapon for protection. If the answer is
yes, Rome said, parents should ``raise the kid's and parent's
awareness that this is not the answer, that there are other ways of
conflict resolution that are more future-directed and
life-protecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents who have a gun in the home should volunteer that
information to the parents of visiting children so that the other
family can make its own decision about gun safety, Rome said.
``That would be the nice thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association and the American Academy of
Pediatrics have both been stumping for tougher federal laws on
firearm safety. The AMA said the need for handgun safety,
especially in households with children, was one of the country's
three biggest health priorities for the new millennium, together
with weight control and an end to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But with or without tougher gun safety laws, parents must remain
vigilant: guns and children simply don't mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parental awareness is the key,'' Rome said. ``Parents need to
be talking among themselves about these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   TIPS ON KIDS AND GUN SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   Parents who own a gun:
</P>
<P>
   _ Unload it and lock it up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lock and store ammunition separately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hide keys where children can't find them.
</P>
<P>
   All parents:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask if guns are safely stored at places your children visit or
play.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk with your children about guns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teach young children not to touch guns and to tell an adult if
they find one.

<P>
   The European invasion began with ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' which transformed the competitive landscape of
network television. Now, just months later, a new wave of formats,
all based on real-life experience voyeuristically captured on
camera, is coming from abroad. The shows range from examinations of
people trying to survive on a desert island to people trying to get
along while locked together in various settings of forced intimacy
_ in a house, on a bus or a tourist vacation, in a home set up to
match conditions in at the end of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The shows, many of which will have ambitious Internet
components, have been described as various combinations of MTV's
cinema verite show ``The Real World,'' the syndicated talk show
``Jerry Springer'' and the influential game show from Britain,
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' One show makes its Orwellian
aura overt: It is called ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the shows have been significant hits in various
European countries. ``Big Brother'' is a phenomenon in the
Netherlands, even spawning a second series, a talk show where the
events on the show are exhaustively discussed.
</P>
<P>
   It is the chance for the networks _ which have been losing
viewers to cable television for at least a decade _ to create the
kind of phenomenon in the United States that ABC did with ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' which is driving network executives to
pursue the other inventive European television formats that break
the mold of comedies, dramas and news programs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the bidding for the American version of ``Big Brother''
reached a fever pitch last week, with prices escalating to a point
where one senior network executive labeled the process ``totally
nuts.'' A deal for ``Big Brother'' is expected this week, with CBS
the front-runner. In a first, plans call for the show to run for
100 consecutive nights in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   That would give CBS the first two examples of this genre,
because the network is already deep into its planning for a
13-episode summer series called ``Survivor'' _ a giant hit in
Sweden _ in which 16 people will be stranded on a Pacific island,
charged with finding ways to survive. One cast member will be
eliminated each week by vote of the other contestants until one is
the final survivor, winning $1 million. ``Survivor'' has lined up
eight sponsors, and they will be given product-placement
opportunities. For example, Reebok is a sponsor; the contestants
are likely to be wearing Reebok shoes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television, said the move
toward these wilder formats reflected the network's conclusion that
tried-and-true television, like situation comedies on brightly lit
Hollywood sound stages, now leaves many American viewers cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is people are realizing you need to be
different,'' Moonves said. ``You can't go with the same old meat
and potatoes anymore. You've got to shake things up. And clearly
people are realizing it's a big world out there and shows really
can come from the other side of the Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality shows have an economic advantage over scripted
series: they do not employ vast numbers of writers and they have no
expensive stars at all. That points to a downside for Hollywood.
Moonves said that every game show in prime time costs the industry
100 jobs. Producers have already complained that the proliferation
of news magazines and game shows are radically shrinking prime-time
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that if the reality shows take off, there
will be a contraction in the business,'' he said. ``There could be
a real shift in who's working and not working.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than anything, the move toward the European shows reflects
the impact of ``Millionaire,'' which has transformed the network
prime-time ratings race, pulling ABC from a likely third place this
season to a near-certain first-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' has already fathered a brood of game shows. Last
year there were no game shows on network prime time. Now there are
eight hours of games each week. Because ``Millionaire'' emerged
from Britain as a fully developed hit, network executives have
started looking at other European shows.
</P>
<P>
   One agent who has been in the middle of many of the negotiations
for these new programs, Ben Silverman, head of international
packaging for the William Morris Agency, lived for more than four
years in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I scoured the TV listings all over Europe looking for shows
that sounded interesting,'' Silverman said. ``The European
producers don't come from the American system. They don't have this
track record that leads them to reject certain ideas. They also
don't have the infrastructure to support shows full of writers and
stars. So they have to find innovative stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman, along with a William Morris partner in Los Angeles,
Greg Lipstone, represented the British company Celador in
negotiations with ABC for ``Millionaire,'' which was supposed to be
nothing more than a summer series. After it became a hit, Silverman
started getting calls about other European properties he had
already lined up.
</P>
<P>
   Even PBS called, securing the rights to a show produced by a
British company called Wall to Wall. This one, ``1900 House,''
involves bringing a family into a home with cameras and making them
live just as they would have a century ago _ without, for example,
television.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Big Brother,'' owned by the Dutch company Endemol
Entertainment, is currently the hottest property in this genre.
Mark Itkin, the senior vice president of William Morris for reality
programs, said: ``I had no idea the bidding would be so hot. But
the show has so many elements, from being on 100 days in a row to
an Internet component that is especially attractive to networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman first believed only a cable network would make the
commitment to Endemol's format: 100 consecutive nights of ``Big
Brother.'' But after ``Millionaire,'' three big broadcast networks
jumped into the bidding, each promising to broadcast ``Big
Brother'' essentially every single night this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' throws a group of 10 people, mostly in their
20s, into a new house constructed with cameras and recording
equipment everywhere to document their every move. In the
Netherlands that included everything from showers to sex, though an
American version is clearly not going to go that far.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, the Internet helped drive the show because
users could log onto the show's Web site, pick out certain
characters and cameras, and literally watch 24 hours a day on
streamed video.
</P>
<P>
   Each week one cast member is voted out, with viewers
participating by phone and Internet. The last cast member standing
in the Netherlands won 250,000 guilders, about $111,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the elements are similar to ``Survivor,'' so similar,
that Mark Burnett, who is producing ``Survivor'' for CBS, said the
show's British originators had filed suit against Endemol. The suit
is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett described ``Survivor'' as ``a little bit of `Truman
show' and `Lord of the Flies,' with an edgy `Gilligan's Island'
thrown in.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett is now whittling down the hundreds of applicants for
``Survivor,'' using, among other things, a battery of psychological
tests. He hopes to avoid the unfortunate outcome of the show's
first edition in Sweden, when one cast member committed suicide
after being rejected by his comrades.
</P>
<P>
   And that was in a format that was softer than the American
version. In Sweden, cast members voted for who they wanted to
remain on the island. Burnett acknowledged that the American
version will be far more Darwinian. Individuals will be voted out
by the group.
</P>
<P>
   Though CBS may lead this trend, program executives at the other
networks are likely to try to come up with their own, similar
formats.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Darnell, executive vice president of special programs for
Fox, has been highly inventive in the reality arena, coming up with
the concepts for everything from the game show ``Greed'' to ``When
Good Pets Go Bad.'' He was also the man behind the now-scrapped
idea to crash a Boeing 747 live in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell's latest brainstorm is a special, set for Feb. 15,
called ``Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire,'' in which 50 female
contestants will be whittled down by beauty pageant-like contests
and extensive interviewing to five finalists, all in wedding gowns,
one of whom will be proposed to and married on the air, live, by a
willing millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these shows are voyeuristic,'' Darnell said. ``After a
while they become soap operas. That's why casting is so important.
The people you pick will determine whether you're a hit or a
bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, founder of the Center for the Study of Popular
Television at Syracuse University, called the trend toward
voyeurism shows an inevitable confluence of advances in technology
and basic human interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popular culture is beginning to catch up with our real
behavior,'' Thompson said. ``We all talk about family values, but
that's not how most of us operate as human beings. In some ways,
this is the programmers discovering what TV was always so great at
in the first place. This is Peeping Tom to the max.''

<P>
   DOUGLAS, Ariz. _ The arrest of the local judge in this southwest
border town on drug racketeering and money laundering charges last
fall seemed to be one more disturbing sign that the
multibillion-dollar narcotics trade was corrupting law enforcement,
not only in Mexico, but north of the border, too.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors preparing for the trial of the judge, Ronald
Borane, have said that details emerging from scrutiny of his
lengthy career suggest that he learned to disregard the law long
before Douglas became a crossroads in the international drug trade.
Borane amassed wealth and influence far beyond what could be
expected of a small-town judge, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Borane's brother, Ray, is the mayor of Douglas, which has a
population of about 15,000. Ray Borane is not implicated in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit filed against the judge in January asserts that he
turned the local jail into a debtors' prison, repeatedly jailing
poor laborers who were unable to settle debts with local property
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a judge, he saw himself as a law unto himself,'' said John
Evans, the Arizona assistant attorney general, who is coordinating
the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year drug investigation, Borane was arrested on
Sept. 9 in Tucson, where he was attending a judicial conference.
Investigators said the judge invested $5,000, twice, in two sham
drug deals described to him by an undercover FBI agent while video
cameras rolled. Borane was given at least $26,500, which he was
told was his share of profits from the deals.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Borane was carried out by federal agents,
but the U.S. attorney in Arizona deferred prosecution to the state
authorities. The four felony charges against him carry a maximum
total sentence of 50 years, but state authorities said it was
possible that, if convicted, he could be sentenced to probation.
</P>
<P>
   William Walker of Tucson, the defense lawyer, said Borane
believed he had been investing in a legitimate deal involving the
marketing of surplus U.S. Army uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outrageous case of government entrapment,'' Walker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Borane served simultaneously as justice of the peace and Douglas
city magistrate. For five months after his arrest, he continued to
draw his $113,000 joint salary, insisting he would be exonerated
and returned to the bench. But on Jan. 21 he resigned and promised
not to seek office again after Arizona's Commission on Judicial
Conduct agreed to drop an investigation of his court.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate review still under way, the Arizona Supreme Court
announced on Wednesday that a preliminary finding showed that
Borane had coerced defendants into pleading guilty, used his court
to circulate political petitions, and allowed businesses in
Douglas, including Wal-Mart, to issue criminal complaints against
customers who wrote bad checks. The judge's salary was based in
part on the number of cases he handled.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's arrest stunned most of the establishment in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was highly regarded,'' said Anita Sanchez, the Douglas city
attorney. ``Everybody is devastated. Nobody knows quite what to
think.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the arrest was less surprising to others who had watched
him build his power and reputation in Cochise County, a region of
sweeping desert vistas that borders Mexico and New Mexico. ``Joe
Borane has no scruples whatsoever,'' said Alberto Rodriguez, a
retired Army colonel and former mayor of Douglas, who has known the
judge since childhood. ``He's the greediest person I've ever run
across.''
</P>
<P>
   With a high school education, Borane rose from Douglas town
patrolman and police chief to magistrate, justice of the peace and
power broker, prosecutors and his former associates said. A
prolific fund-raiser for the Democratic Party, he built a statewide
reputation, serving for a decade on an elite panel that reviews the
conduct of Arizona judges.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he bought nearly 200 houses, ranches and
businesses that made him the county's largest landowner, with
assets he declared in February 1999 at $5.9 million, according to
county property records. County officials said his real estate
assets were worth far more than that declared value. The judge said
his net worth at that time was $4.7 million.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Borane began to build his wealth in the 1970s, when he headed
the Douglas police, fire, animal control and weights and measures
departments, with the catch-all title of safety director.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who was elected mayor of Douglas in 1978 after
returning from an Army career, said Borane had used patronage to
build a broad political base that gave him effective control of the
City Council. Ordering an investigation of city finances, Rodriguez
said he discovered ticket-fixing, contract-rigging and other forms
of graft, with much of it linked to Borane. Borane was not charged
in the inquiry but resigned his posts in 1979 as the investigation
advanced. A year later, he became justice of the peace, taking
control of a courtroom with 12 plastic chairs and jurisdiction over
misdemeanor cases. He was re-elected several times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, after Borane was driving his car when it crashed,
killing a passenger, the police determined that the judge's blood
alcohol level was 0.17. In Arizona, drivers with a level of 0.10
are presumed to be under the influence. No charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Borane again came under scrutiny after the discovery of
a cross-border tunnel used to smuggle tons of cocaine into Douglas
from Mexico. Investigators found that Borane had sold the warehouse
hiding the tunnel's Douglas entrance to the drug traffickers who
operated the tunnel, earning windfall profits on the sale. No
charges were filed against Borane in the tunnel inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Borane began to use his court as a debt
collection agency, ordering indigents held in jail until they made
payments, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th Amendment of the United States Constitution abolished
forever the concept of debtor's prison from American shores,
except, apparently, in Douglas, Ariz., '' wrote Ralph Malanga, the
lawyer for an indigent client in a 1999 lawsuit challenging
Borane's actions. ``This case demonstrates a grotesque miscarriage
of justice and a heedless indifference by the judge to the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cochise County attorney, saying that Borane had ordered the
arrests without advising other authorities, did not contest
Malanga's petition. As a judge, Borane is immune from prosecution
for his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Borane's jury trial is scheduled to begin June 6.

WASHINGTON: been completed.

<P>
   Legislation proposed by Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., whose
constituents include some of the beryllium disease patients, calls
for payments to an estimated 500 to 1,000 former workers who either
have the illness or are at high risk of developing it. Total
payments in the beryllium cases could range from $15 million to $30
million a year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One question that Congress would have to resolve in the
beryllium compensation, and that would have to be addressed in any
compensation plan developed as a result of the cancer finding, is
whether to make payments to survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 57 years since the Manhattan Project began processing
radioactive materials to produce bombs, the government has until
now minimized the hazards of radiation and chemicals, criticized
epidemiological studies that raised related questions and spent
tens of millions of dollars in defending itself against lawsuits
charging that the bomb plants had made workers sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the role of government was to take a hike,''
Richardson said, ``and I think that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   One expert on nuclear weapons manufacturing, Robert Alvarez, a
former Energy Department official, welcomed the government's
conclusion that many of its critics had been correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``A review of the studies by a body impaneled by the president
is official recognition,'' Alvarez said. ``That's what makes this a
big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel J. Guttman, a lawyer for the Paper, Allied-Industrial
Chemical and Energy Workers Union, which represents workers at 11
weapons factories, said of the draft conclusions, ``That's
stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The prior story line is, `What's the big deal, the risks were
marginal,' '' said Guttman, former executive director of a
commission formed by the Clinton administration to look into
improper radiation experiments using human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Richard D. Miller, a policy analyst with the union, said the
change was remarkable because the Energy Department and its
predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, had ``spared no
resources in seeking to defeat claims'' by employees who said they
had been made sick by radiation or chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary Richardson addressed a related issue last July,
describing the problem of workers employed by private companies
that had processed beryllium for weapons use. They could rarely
collect worker's compensation, a program geared to injury rather
than illness, and in any event their symptoms or diseases
frequently did not emerge until years after their employment ended.
Also, he said, the contractors who ran the factories for the
government argued that the link to the workplace could not be
demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said then that the government should pay for workers
made sick by beryllium, a toxic metal, and that radiation and
chemical exposures should be studied. That statement led to
President Clinton's request for the task force report.
</P>
<P>
   At one site that figured in the report's draft, K-25, a
now-shuttered Tennessee factory for enriching uranium, Mike Church,
the president of the Energy Workers' local, said, ``It would be a
start in the right direction, trying to get help for these people,
that the government is finally stepping forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The industrial process used at the plant exposed workers to
radiation and chemical hazards from uranium, plutonium and
fluorine. The union says workers at the plant have higher than
expected rates of leukemia, cancer of the lung and bladder, vision
problems and chronic fatigue syndrome, among other health problems.
The draft report, though, says only that workers there show more
lung cancer than the population at large. The study does not list
another plant that used the same industrial process, at Paducah,
Ky., where workers recently learned that their exposure included
plutonium as well as uranium.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-BOMB-PRODUCTION-DANGER-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
WASHINGTON: as uranium. &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The government has the names of workers and former employees who
died from cancer or other causes. Researchers using government
records have calculated the expected rates of various fatal cancers
from such groups. In some cases these rates are drawn from
epidemiological studies of general populations, in other cases they
are drawn from studies of workers in the weapons complex who have
been exposed to lower amounts of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Among 14 plants, according to the draft report, a total of 22
categories of cancer, ranging from bone to bladder to leukemia,
occurred more often than expected. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The cancers listed in the report, most of them fatal, are
presumed to be caused by radiation and chemicals, although the
report does not address the precise scientific mechanisms and does
not clearly divide between chemicals and radiation in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   It also leaves open the question of how to compensate people who
worked in the complex and suffered illnesses now found at elevated
levels among their co-workers but which may not all be
occupationally related. It also raises the prospect that workers
will get sick in years to come from past exposures. Among the other
problems, acknowledged by officials at the Energy Department, is
that records of radiation doses and other exposures are poor at
many sites.
</P>
<P>
   The cancers were found among nearly 600,000 people who have
worked in nuclear weapons production since the start of World War
II. They range from leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma to cancer of
the prostate, kidney, salivary gland and lung. In addition to
several other operations at Oak Ridge, Tenn., where K-25 operated,
the draft also says that elevated cancer levels were found at
Savannah River in South Carolina and Hanford, in eastern Washington
state, where plutonium was manufactured; Rocky Flats, near Denver,
where the plutonium was shaped into weapons components, the Fernald
Feed Materials Center, near Cincinnati, where uranium was
processed, and at the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos national
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the findings are drawn from epidemiological studies
performed from the mid-1960s onward, some of them disavowed by the
government at the time they were published. Others are from data
gathered by the Energy Department, which now owns the plants, its
predecessor the Atomic Energy Commission, or their contractors.
None of the research was done specifically for this study, which is
due to be finished in March.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not sum up the cancers, but a senior government
official familiar with its contents and preparation, said in an
interview that ``my guess, we could be talking about hundreds of
cases, in a population of hundreds of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alvarez said that the number of victims would depend on how
many diseases are linked to radiation; if, as some epidemiologists
believe, radiation damages the human immune system and thus leaves
people vulnerable to a wide variety of diseases beyond those
cancers usually associated with radiation, then the number could
rise to the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The draft, however, explicitly states that the scientific
questions of causation were outside the task force's mandate.

<P>
   TIMBUKTU, Mali _ The Tindjambane community primary school sits
on a windswept patch of the Sahara east of this city, just two
tents of thatch walls and roofs above carpets for the
schoolchildren to sit on and blackboards for the teachers to write
on. All told, the school amounted to a $60 investment for the
desert nomads who have now settled in the area.
</P>
<P>
   As the first school the people have ever had, it can only be
regarded as a triumph. The clanging of the school bell _ an
abandoned car-wheel rim hanging on a stick _ brings the children
rallying from their mud houses and tents. Inside the school, the
pupils fight over scarce chalk to write on their slates, which have
all been cut in half to save money.
</P>
<P>
   When the second-grade teacher, Mohammed Assadeck Ag Oumar,
recently asked if anyone could read the word ``porte'' on the
blackboard _ door, in French _ a dozen hands shot up in the air.
``Me, sir! Me, sir!'' several children begged, some of them
bouncing several inches above the carpet in their exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   The school is playing a modest part in an ambitious campaign by
this poor, landlocked nation in West Africa to put more children
into the classroom. Unable _ like many African nations _ to educate
all or even most of its children, Mali is encouraging towns and
villages to build their own primary schools and hire their own
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year program, adopted officially in 1998, is part of the
democratically elected government's larger efforts to decentralize
power, and many community schools are being supported by
American-financed private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   After these community schools began appearing in the relatively
prosperous south in recent years, they eventually found their way
to the north, centering in Timbuktu.
</P>
<P>
   This city, once the fabled crossroads between the Arab world to
the north and the African interior to the south, was renowned
centuries ago for its scholars and judges, and for having the first
Islamic university in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet today the people
living in this sand-blanketed city of winding alleys and mud houses
rank among the most poorly educated in Mali and in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But while Timbuktu's educational challenge may be greater than
that of other places, in many ways it reflects problems elsewhere
in the region. Mali's experiment with community schools is one that
is certain to be watched by other governments, especially those in
Francophone Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This country, like its neighbors in West Africa, gained its
independence four decades ago and inherited a colonial educational
system that essentially sought to instruct a select few to serve as
administrators. The country has failed to turn that system into one
for all Malians, government officials acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government has the obligation of educating all the
children of this country,'' said Bazi Maiga, the ministry of
education's primary schools inspector in Timbuktu. ``But from
independence to this day, it has been incapable of doing so. Does
the state have the means to educate all the country's children?
Clearly, no. We have to be honest about that. So we can only
encourage communities to start their own schools.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of independence in 1960, only 7 percent of Mali's
children had been educated, most of them in colonial schools that
emphasized the history and geography of France.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Mali, like the rest of the continent, went about
changing that curriculum. Textbooks focused on Africa and _ as Mali
turned toward socialism for eight years before a 23-year military
dictatorship that ended in 1991 _ on China or the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, the Malian government set about making
sure that all children had access to primary education. But as of
1996, only 44 percent of children had been schooled, with the
figure even lower, at 34 percent, for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Experts attributed the low figures to a number of causes.
Primary education directed from the capital, Bamako, continued to
be seen as an extension of colonial rule. The language of
instruction remained French, even in rural areas where few adults
understood it. Poor peasants saw few economic benefits in freeing
their children from farm work and sending them to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no relation between the needs of our economy and our
educational system,'' said Barthelemy Togo, the official in charge
of primary education in the 10-year educational reform program, in
an interview in his office in Bamako. ``Our educational system is
still directed mainly toward producing civil servants, and that is
still the situation in many French-speaking countries in Africa.
Schools in those countries are considered for the elite. They are
not regarded as belonging to the local populations, but as
something imposed on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the reform program, which aims to educate 75 percent of
Mali's children by 2008, the government essentially grants towns
and villages autonomy over their new schools.
</P>
<P>
   In these community schools, teachers can use local languages for
instruction through the third grade. And as long as the schools
follow the national curriculum, they can also add nontraditional
subjects, like agriculture or fishing, in hopes of persuading rural
parents to leave their children in the classroom, Togo said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, officials and parents seem more focused on simply
opening schools and keeping them alive than on the long-term goals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the year the reform program was adopted, 245 community
schools opened in Mali, and today there are about 500, according to
the Education Ministry. By contrast, Mali had 2,377 public primary
schools and nearly 900 private schools. Community schools, unlike
their counterparts, are expected to keep growing.

<P>
   The 900 or so people of Tindjambane are Tuareg, traditionally
desert nomads. This group settled in 1996 in Tindjambane, an area
near the Niger River that they had long frequented.
</P>
<P>
   Inside his mud-brick house, furnished with the nomad's
essentials _ two suitcases, one yellow jerrycan, several pots, a
carpet, teacups and the kind of blue robe that since French
colonial days has inspired countless yarns about the Tuareg as the
blue lords of the desert _ the village chief, Aljohari Ag
Abouacrine, 58, explained that his people had long regarded
schooling with suspicion. The French teachers spoke a language they
did not understand, and the Tuareg believed that the French wanted
to convert them to Christianity from Islam.
</P>
<P>
   So when French colonial authorities visited them and demanded,
often at gunpoint, that the village chief send five children to
school, including his own, Abouacrine hid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to hide us in holes in the sand,'' he recalled. His
father, who was also a village chief, would instead order or
sometimes pay families to send their own children to school. ``Here
_ take these five children,'' his father would tell the French
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The aversion to education endured after independence, said
Oumar, 34, the second-grade teacher. But over the years, as
nomadism declined, education become harder to avoid, and as the
professional successes of the few educated Tuareg became clear, the
people of Tindjambane decided they wanted education for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we couldn't send them to Timbuktu'' about 13 miles away,
Oumar said. ``And we couldn't let them rot here without doing
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And so two years ago, Tindjambane decided to open a community
school. A private charity in Timbuktu donated $225 to cover Oumar's
salary for six months, and the community raised the rest to build
the tents and buy material.
</P>
<P>
   This school year, with the first-year students moving on to the
second grade, a second teacher was hired from another community.
Like many teachers in Mali, the new instructor, Noiradine Ag
Mahmoud, 30, has completed only the ninth grade. Today, 10 girls
and 26 boys are enrolled in the first grade; seven girls and 21
boys in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the starkness of the school tents, the energy and
enthusiasm in the classrooms pointed to real school spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times two,'' Oumar said, as his pupils scribbled the
answer on their slates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good, good, good, good, good,'' the teacher said, and then
stopped at Mariama Walet Abdouchacour, 9, who was holding her slate
upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hold it like that, it's 9!'' Oumar said.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing year, the Tindjambane primary school will
require another tent for another graduating class, and perhaps even
another teacher. But it is unclear how it _ and the other community
schools _ will be able to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Abdoulaye Toure, the education coordinator for CARE, one of
several private organizations helping villages and towns build
schools in Timbuktu, said a visit to some schools in the south
raised worries. ``I found places that were poorly organized,''
Toure said. ``I saw poorly qualified teachers and places where the
national curriculum was not being followed.''
</P>
<P>
   What role the federal or local governments will eventually play
in overseeing community schools remains unknown. Critics say
community schools, while meeting an immediate need, give
governments an excuse to withdraw from their duty to educate
children. And worse, the schools could become second-rate
alternatives for poor, rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get the bureaucrats at the Ministry of Education
involved in community schools,'' said Muhammad Ali, the mayor of a
district that includes Tindjambane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, the NGOs will leave,'' he said, referring to the
international nongovernmental organizations that are supporting the
schools, ``and once they do, the community schools will become
orphans.''

   ELKO, Nev. _ Last week, Charlie Recora, a building contractor
from Garberville, Calif., packed his old-style Stetson hat, black
leather vest, wine red shirt and best cowboy boots and headed here
for the 16th annual Cowboy Poetry Gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my eighth year,'' he said happily after listening to a
morning of verse-slinging cowboys. ``I like the poetry, the music
and the values that everyone gets behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Recora's enthusiasms are widely shared. Nearly 8,000 people from
every state except Hawaii plus a smattering of foreign countries
made their way to Elko for eight days of poetry sessions (featuring
self-proclaimed rhyme-stoned cowboys), workshops (e-cowboys on the
Internet), demonstrations (Basque cooking and horsehair braiding),
music (mostly fiddles and guitars) and dancing (Great Basin swing.)
</P>
<P>
   The festivities were to end Saturday night with a dance
featuring Wylie and the Wild West. Sponsored by the Western
Folklife Center, a nonprofit organization that preserves and
documents folk cultures of the American West, the gathering in Elko
is the oldest and largest event of its kind. Its roots go back 25
years when an Elko artist, Sarah Sweetwater, heard about the art
form and began collecting poems.
</P>
<P>
   To find poets, she talked to the town's madams _ who knew which
cowboys, in town for a Saturday night, were kind to prostitutes or
which ones, Ms. Sweetwater said, ``were the kind to burn the girls
with a cigarette butt.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``kind ones'' were writing poetry for each other and keeping
it to themselves, she said. They were reluctant to share their
rhymes with others since cowboy poetry was an intensely private
affair to be shared only by close confederates.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, however, a Utah state folklorist, Hal
Cannon, recognized the importance of the grass-roots poetry and in
1985 he organized the first Cowboy Poetry Gathering. The gathering,
which alludes to the ``gathering'' of cattle during a roundup, is
held in the last week in January when ranchers and cowboys have
enough downtime to be away from their livestock.
</P>
<P>
   While the Elko gathering draws large numbers of California
urbanites and Arizona retirees, about a third of the audience is
composed of ranching families, said Charles Seemann, executive
director of the Folklife Center. ``People like to say it's one big
family reunion, only everyone likes each other,'' he said. The
first gathering spawned a renaissance of cowboy poetry and material
arts, which are being performed each year at 150 smaller gatherings
throughout the West. These smaller gatherings especially bring
rural communities together, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy poetry is a homespun amalgam of verbal arts from Ireland,
Scotland, England and Wales and was strongly influenced by Mexican
and African performance traditions. It has elements of Greek
heroes, quixotic sidekicks and knights of the Round Table, where
cowboys use poetry to explain their world to outsiders and, like
Homer, teach one another about the proper course of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The poetry first blossomed in the 1870s along the cow trails
between Texas, Kansas and Montana. ``Today it's the glue that
reminds cattle people of their shared identity and values,'' said
Cannon, who produces a radio show on Western life for National
Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   In deep, drawly voices, 60 of the nation's best cowboy poets
recited their poems at this year's gathering. Some stuck to the
classic form _ regularly rhymed and metered ballads in four-line
stanzas _ with traditional themes of self-deprecation, solitude,
braggadocio, work, animals, memory of fallen comrades and the code
of the West. Eschewing easy rhymes like ``horse'' with ``course,''
these ``cowboy poet lariats'' show great inventiveness within the
strict boundaries of the form.
</P>
<P>
   Others experimented with open verse and newer themes in the
cowpoke cosmos: demographic changes in the West, fights with
environmentalists, domestic violence, women's rights and a new
honesty about cowboy life.
</P>
<P>
   The audience listened raptly every time the poet Paul Zarzyski
from Great Falls, Mont., recited his work, including his poem
``Staircase'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Like two helpless sailors
</P>
<P>
   marooned with age and mourning
</P>
<P>
   a familiar orca beached
</P>
<P>
   in the storm's debris, we crutch
</P>
<P>
   our feeble human frames
</P>
<P>
   beneath the horse's weight and heave
</P>
<P>
   each time he tries.''
</P>
<P>
   As many of the poets like to say here, ``Cowboy poetry lets you
talk about things that are too important to let right out.''
</P>
<P>
   To be invited to the gathering, a cowboy poet must pass a
screening committee that listens to his (or her) tapes and assesses
how well the person rides a horse and throws a rope. Poets from
places like Boston who dress up in spiffy cowboy outfits and write
good verse cannot pass themselves off as real cowboy poets, Seemann
said.
</P>
<P>
   While not hearing poetry and music, many of the real cowboys in
the audience attended workshops to help them get ready for the 21st
century _ namely how to get connected to the Internet, how to raise
cattle while protecting the land, and how to avoid having their
land snatched up by developers.
</P>
<P>
   People who raise cattle for a living are under attack from
environmentalists who think that all cows should be banished from
public lands and that cowboys are the bad guys of this world, said
a cowboy poet and rancher, John Dofflemyer of Lemon Cove, Calif.
``We need to teach ourselves new ways of doing things,'' he said
after sessions on environmentally sensitive ranching and
conservation easements in estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we need to convince people living in New York City that
we're human beings, just like them. Cowboy poetry is the best way
to reach them,'' he said. ``My poems are survival tools to help
save our culture and the culture of the West.''

 &HT;    Frontiere finally finds fame on odd route
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When people asked the little girl with the curly blond
hair _ ``What are you going to be when you grow up?'' _ Georgia Lee
Irwin knew the answer.
</P>
<P>
   She was going to be a singer. An opera star. She was going to go
to some exotic place and become famous. And she was going to make
everyone back home in St. Louis proud of her.
</P>
<P>
   Like most childhood plans, it didn't turn out exactly as
envisioned. But after a lifetime of unexpected twists _ seven
marriages, the drowning of her sixth husband in the Florida surf,
ownership of a professional football team, a nasty divorce from Los
Angeles _ she has reached the expected destination.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Frontiere is making everyone in St. Louis proud of her.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old woman who always loved a good party has gotten
her hometown invited to America's biggest bash _ the one that comes
with Roman numerals, international media coverage and, yes, a
football game.
</P>
<P>
   The latter will be played in ... the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how she got here _ how she became the only female
owner in the NFL, how she moved the Rams from Los Angeles to St.
Louis, how Georgia ended up in Georgia for Super Bowl XXXIV against
the Tennessee Titans _ is wilder than anything she ever dreamed up
as a little girl.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tale that makes stops on stages at casinos in Las Vegas,
in front of a weather map at a television station in Miami, at
parties in the Kennedy mansion in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it is best to start at the beginning. With the birth
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   For much of her life _ ever since she did indeed become famous _
Frontiere has either coyly avoided talking about her age or lied.
She has put down different ages on different marriage licenses. And
in 1979, the year she became owner of the Rams, the team's media
guide listed her age as 42. It turns out she was 51.
</P>
<P>
   When the St. Louis Post-Dispatch dug up a copy of her birth
certificate, it answered one question _ she was born on Nov. 21,
1927, in Richmond Heights, Mo. _ but raised several more. The birth
certificate lists the name of the baby as ``Violet Francis Irwin.''
The first and middle names are scratched out, replaced by ``Georgia
Lee'' along with the initials of an unknown person and a date, Aug.
23, 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Getting an explanation to this _ and many other details of her
life _ are difficult. The Post-Dispatch has had several in-depth
interviews with Frontiere; each with her carefully avoiding
questions about her marriages or the chronology of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her eccentricities are well-documented. She has
monitored her players' astrological charts. She once had their
uniforms rubbed with crystals for good luck. And she is late for
seemingly everything _ even the funeral of her sixth husband.
</P>
<P>
   During her time in Los Angeles, she went from highly visible _ a
cover of Sports Illustrated _ to nearly reclusive, prompting
sportswriters to dub her ``The Howard Hughes of football.''
</P>
<P>
   This season she has become more visible again. She not only has
been going to home games _ something she eventually stopped doing
in Los Angeles _ but she has traveled to most of the road games.
Last week, after the Rams clinched the NFC title with a victory
against Tampa Bay, she allowed a reporter from USA Today to tag
along at a private post-game celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she maintained a low profile this week. She and her
longtime companion, Earle Weatherwax, reportedly arrived in Atlanta
on Thursday night. But the Rams' public relations department said
neither would be available for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   So to learn about her, you must talk to others.
</P>
<P>
   The players describe her as a motherly type, gleefully recalling
how when they returned from Carolina and stood at the airport,
signing autographs in the rain, she took off her cape and draped it
over the shoulders of quarterback Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The front-office people describe her as an owner who takes a
strong interest in the team without being meddlesome.
</P>
<P>
   Charitable organizations _ from the Los Angeles Musical Center
to the New York Metropolitan Opera _ describe her as a loyal
supporter of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The fans in St. Louis describe her as the antidote for Bill
Bidwill _ the owner who moved the Cardinals from St. Louis to
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave us something Bill Bidwill never did _ a winning
football team,'' said Sarah Lockhart, a Rams fan who drove to
Atlanta for today's game. ``St. Louis has always been ready to
support a good team. We just never had one. She gave us one.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another side to the story _ a side that
says she took away this team others. From Los Angeles. From the son
of Carroll Rosenbloom.
</P>
<P>
   That story has its roots in South Florida, circa 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Frontiere, then a ``weathergirl'' for Channel 10 in Miami, has
said she and Rosenbloom met at a party at the Kennedy mansion and
``were together from 1957 on.'' The problem with the timeline is
that in 1957, she hadn't yet divorced husband No.4 or married
husband No.5.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: On June7, 1966, Rosenbloom divorced his
wife of 25 years and three weeks later married Frontiere in London.
And nearly 13 years later, on April2, 1979, he went for a swim in
the surf near their rented beach home in Golden Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He drowned. Authorities ruled out foul play, but Frontiere has
had to deal with whispers about the end of marriage No.6 ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the height of cruelty,'' she told USA Today last week.
</P>
<P>
   When Rosenbloom died, everyone in the football world assumed the
Rams would end up in the hands of Steve Rosenbloom, a son from his
first marriage. Steve Rosenbloom had been around his father's teams
most of his life, starting with a job in the Baltimore Colts'
laundry room as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   But when the will was opened, it revealed that Rosenbloom had
left 70 percent of the team to Frontiere and 30 percent to be
divided among his five children.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the funeral _ the one she was an hour late for _
she named herself team president and told Sports Illustrated:
``There are some things that need to be ironed out.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, one of them was Steve Rosenbloom.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Frontiere fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbloom has since said it wasn't a complete shock to him that
such a large portion of the team was left to Frontiere. He says his
father told him that the will would keep as much money as possible
in the family by taking advantage of the widows' tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'd rather trust Georgia to do the right thing than
give it all to Uncle Sam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``right thing,'' in his mind, was letting him run the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is 54 and lives in Covington, La. The closest he has
come to football recently was going to high school games to watch
one of his sons play. He says he is glad he's out of the NFL and in
the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has changed so much,'' he said Thursday in a phone
interview from his home. ``It's so much about advertising and
media. Not many of the owners are real football people. It's a
whole different set of people involved now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbloom keeps in contact with his stepbrother and stepsister,
children of Frontiere and his father, but not with Frontiere. When
asked about her and the past _ the fact that this is her team and
not his _ he does not sound bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life goes on,'' he said. ``You don't find too many healthy
people who cannot move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Frontiere moved on in June 1980. She married the man whose name
she keeps to this day, Dominic Frontiere. He later was indicted for
scalping tickets for Super Bowl XIV in January 1980, the Rams' only
other Super Bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Georgia Frontiere struggled to break into the men's
club of NFL ownership. Her biggest battle came when she tried to
move the team to St. Louis. She won. And in 1995, the Rams left Los
Angeles, their home for 49 years, and moved them to Frontiere's
hometown, which was offering a $260million stadium, $70million in
personal seat license revenue and an estimated $22million annually
in luxury box and ticket revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's St. Louis' Misery, And It Can Have Her,'' proclaimed a
headline on a column in a Los Angeles paper.
</P>
<P>
   She has turned out to be St. Louis' heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Although she never became an opera star, she did get to travel
the world. She sang in night clubs in New York and, while living in
Los Angeles, at dinner parties attended by Jimmy Stewart and Cary
Grant.
</P>
<P>
   She kept her Bel Air mansion for a while after moving the team.
But these days she and Weatherwax _ a 60ish rancher type with a
long, gray ponytail _ have a home in Sedona, Ariz. They didn't
spend this fall there, though. They lived in St. Louis, savoring
what has turned into the biggest ovation of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone back home is proud of her.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and about the age thing, these days she likes to tell people
she is 34 _ as in Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Patchy snow will surround a weakening low-pressure area as it
drifts across the northern Ohio Valley. Meanwhile, developing low
pressure gradually will move north parallel to the middle Atlantic
Coast, bringing a mixture of snow, ice and coastal rain from the
Carolinas early Sunday to southern New York and New England on
Sunday night and early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will spread north from the mountains of North Carolina and
Virginia during the morning and early afternoon. Rain will develop
near the middle Atlantic coast as winds from the east import milder
ocean air.
</P>
<P>
   In the interior, a mixture of snow, sleet and some freezing rain
will fall as breezes from the northeast continue to draw chilly
low-level air from New England. Several inches of snow and sleet
will accumulate by late Sunday near eastern slopes of the central
Appalachians. Farther south, drier air will arrive over the
interior Southeast, although areas of low clouds and patchy drizzle
will linger near the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   The day will begin cold, with ample sunshine over New York and
New England where high pressure remains strong. Clouds will thicken
later Sunday as the area of snow and ice approaches from the south.
Overnight, snow and sleet will accumulate several inches in the
interior while mild ocean air will bring some rain to the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly dry weather will cover the Plains and interior West. A
front will bring rain to central and northern areas of California
and southern Oregon. Snow will develop in the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Big Snow in Little Rock
</P>
<P>
   For residents of Little Rock, Ark., the crust of snow and ice
several inches deep that covered the area late last week is an
uncommon site. The 6.5 inches of snow that fell on Thursday more
than doubled the previous record snowfall for the date which was
3.0 inches set in 1915. The storm brought the first measurable
snowfall to the Arkansas capital since Feb. 13, 1997, setting a new
local record for the longest period without snow. While the
long-term average snowfall in Little Rock is 5.1 inches, last
week's wintry storm equaled the total snowfall in the previous four
years.

AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM UNDERGOING $22 MILLION RENOVATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As an airy space for displaying spaceships and
pioneering aircraft, the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and
Space Museum pulls relentlessly at anyone within eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum's extensive skylights are leaky, letting in water
that stains the walls, irritates visitors and even endangers some
of the museum's artifacts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   So the museum is going through a three-and-a-half-year
renovation costing $22 million, more than half what it cost to
build the museum in the mid-1970s, much of it for a new skylight
system.
</P>
<P>
   The leaks that prompted the renovation might have been avoided _
or at least greatly minimized _ if not for an effort to cut costs
in the museum's construction, people working on the renovation say.
That effort, they say, resulted in a decision to forgo the glass
skylights called for in the original design in favor of less
expensive plastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cost-saving measure that failed,'' said Robert
Cvejanovich of Cannon Architecture and Design, the firm that
designed the renovation, which began two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's managers say the leaks in the skylight system are
the product of 23 years of exposure to the elements since it opened
in 1976. ``It's going to wear out over time,'' said Richard
Kowalcvyk, the museum's building manager.
</P>
<P>
   But Cvejanovich says that is an oversimplification. ``Age is
part of it, but basically it's an inferior system,'' he said.
``It's been leaking since day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton Ferrell, a museum spokesman, said the leaks have only
caused minor dripping during rainfalls. A museum official working
on the renovation, however, disputed that characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an awful lot of water in that building,'' said
the official. Others say the leaks have marred gala fund-raisers
and other special events held in the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Cvejanovich said ``you could write a dissertation'' on the
skylight problems. But the crux of the issue is that ``glass does
not expand as much as plastic, so there's not as much stress'' on
the building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the much older National Gallery of Art, the glass skylight
system installed in 1939 lasted more than 50 years before leaks
made renovation necessary, a spokeswoman at the gallery said.
</P>
<P>
   Gyo Obata, the architect who designed the Air and Space Museum
more than two decades ago, called for glass skylights in his
original design, but opted for acrylic plastic, he said in an
interview, because of ``tremendous pressure'' from the General
Services Administration to keep the budget within the $40 million
allocated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Supersky Products, Inc., the company hired to put in the new
skylights, said the cost of installation would be $3.2 million. But
the most expensive element of the $22 million renovation is
protecting the possessions inside while the work is being done, a
museum official familiar with the renovation plans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are one-of-a-kind possessions, and you just can't chance
them,'' the official said. Already, at least one plane has been
damaged when it was dropped on its way to safer confines, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides installing a new glass skylight system, the renovation
entails replacing virtually all of the building's windows with
models that block damaging ultraviolet sunlight, as well as more
than a dozen smaller projects. The museum will remain open during
the work, which is to be completed in July 2001.

FEEDING SPIRITUAL LIFE AMID PULL OF CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Its face turned toward the glittery, new
casino-hotels on the southern end of Las Vegas Boulevard, a
life-sized statue of Jesus spreads its arms wide, as if to embrace
the throngs of tourists milling about the towering Sphinx outside
the Luxor, the fairy-tale castle at the Excalibur, and the
make-believe skyscrapers at New York New York.
</P>
<P>
   And as if responding to the invitation, many do make their way
from the boulevard, the famous Strip, to the beige stone church
behind the statue, the Roman Catholic Shrine of the Most Holy
Redeemer, where people have been known to toss casino chips into
the offering plates.
</P>
<P>
   A strange juxtaposition of symbols can be found here. Within
sight of the shrine stand billboards advertising magic shows, a
marquee advertising a dance revue (``sexier than ever'') and a big
screen flashing images of Cher in a silver wig. But inside the
shrine, visitors can gaze on sculptures of the Last Supper and the
Crucifixion and on a mural portraying such servants of the poor as
Dorothy Day and Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   The church's rector, Monsignor Patrick R. Leary, 50, sees a
biblical parallel. ``Read Corinthians,'' Leavy said, referring to
two of the apostle Paul's letters, in the New Testament, to early
Christians in the Greek port city. ``Corinth was a wide-open town,
known for its ability to provide all sorts of entertainment. And
the church flourished there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in this conjunction of the profane and the sacred lies
evidence that Las Vegas, for all its emphasis on worldly good
times, does not lack a spiritual life. Organized religion, if not
quite extending from A to Z, nonetheless spans the spectrum from
Baha'is and Buddhists to Unitarians and United Methodists. The
Mormons, who settled here over a century ago, dedicated a temple in
1989 and now count nearly 80,000 members in surrounding Clark
County.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics make up one of the fastest-growing religious groups, a
change from a few decades ago when there were so few here that
Nevada, alone among the lower 48 states, lacked a resident bishop
until Rome finally placed one in Reno, in 1931. In 1995,
recognizing the flock's growth, Pope John Paul II created a
separate diocese of Las Vegas, under Bishop Daniel F. Walsh, who
previously had jurisdiction over the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Nevada, Walsh has overseen construction of 10
churches and a school, accounting for $57 million in capital
projects. But in the past dozen years the Catholic population in
southern Nevada has doubled, to 390,000, continuing to strain
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the shrine began after a rector of the diocese's
Guardian Angel Cathedral (up the Strip), told Walsh that Sunday
Masses there had reached capacity, and an even greater demand
loomed with new hotels going up.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, the diocese found a lot in the shadow of the
Tropicana, on East Reno Boulevard, a block from the Strip, and
broke ground for the shrine. It opened in 1993, with seating for
2,500, the building topped by a 22-foot gold-colored cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got in just in the nick of time,'' said Walsh, who figured
the land would soon have become unaffordable. ``We're within
walking distance of about 20,000 to 25,000 hotel rooms.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a culture of high-decibel entertainment, he said, the staff
and volunteers at the shrine strive to create a prayerfully
reverent atmosphere where people are given a feeling of welcome.
``We have a good liturgy, the readings are enunciated, they're
heard,'' Walsh said. ``The music is singable. The homilies are
excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a gift shop, managed by Brother Andre Le May, a
Franciscan, selling rosaries, holy cards and _ in a nod to the
city's big industry _ souvenir gambling chips emblazoned with the
emblem of the church. From his place behind the counter, Brother
Andre has met South Africans, Germans, Brazilians, Filipinos and
many others. ``That they come here, Las Vegas, and go to church _
that's phenomenal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance averages 5,000 a week, most coming to the five
weekend Masses. Those attending, accustomed to stage shows at the
casinos, tend to be demonstrative, applauding soloists and, on at
least one occasion, Leary's homily. People line up on the way out,
to shake hands with the celebrant.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent midday Mass, Robert Zoeller, a mechanical
engineer from Louisville, Ky., said he had been coming to the
shrine daily. ``I think it's a great service to the Catholics that
come to Las Vegas,'' Zoeller said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Lambert Leykam, a retired Franciscan priest visiting
from Fort Worth, Texas, said, ``It gets you away from the rush _
everybody's rushing.''
</P>
<P>
   The shrine sometimes attracts ``whales,'' as gambling's high
rollers are known, who have left evidence of their visit in the
collection plate. Leary said he had seen casino chips in
denominations as high as $500. Similarly, generous cash donations
have turned up in the shrine's poor boxes, to be sent on to the
local Catholic Charities' offices, to help the needy.
</P>
<P>
   But Leary, who also serves as the diocese's vicar general, said
he finds many visitors in a prayerful mood, earnestly seeking a
priest for confession. ``And it's good confessions,'' he said.
``People really want to make some significant changes in their
lives, values-oriented changes.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, he sometimes receives requests to pray for a
visitor's luck at the gambling tables. And he responds with good
humor: ``I say that there wouldn't be a debt on this building if it
were a matter of prayer.''

 &HT;    These TV movies rock!
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As an ABC executive vice president,
Susan Lyne hears more movie ideas in a year than viewers will ever
see in a lifetime. Light-hearted romantic romps. Serious
biographies. Killer viruses. Lately, however, there's one concept
Lyne hears more than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pitched 8 million music-related movies and
miniseries recently,'' Lyne says, exaggerating ever-so-slightly.
``After the success of `The Temptations,' every producer was
looking to get their music property on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   TV's mantra-of-the moment? If it's got a beat, we can dance to
it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 14 months, ``The Temptations,'' ``The '60s'' and
``Mr. Rock and Roll: The Alan Freed Story'' have aired on NBC. ABC
did a Sonny and Cher movie. David Cassidy's tormented tale of a
wannabe rock star trapped inside a bubblegum icon's body was the
subject of two TV films. The older-skewing CBS hopped on the trend
with ``Shake, Rattle and Roll,'' its splashy miniseries about the
birth of rock. And cable channel VH1 produced original movies about
forgotten Woodstock band Sweetwater and TV teen heartthrob Ricky
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   And the beat goes on.
</P>
<P>
   During February sweeps, ``Two of Us,'' a movie about a
post-breakup meeting between Beatles stars John Lennon and Paul
McCartney, premieres on VH1. There's ``The Beach Boys: An American
Family,'' a four-hour ABC miniseries about the troubled band that
defined the California surf sound, and NBC tells the rags-to-riches
story of '50s pioneer Little Richard. Movies documenting Linda
McCartney and John Denver are scheduled for May, along with ``The
'70s,'' the inevitable sequel to ``The '60s,'' which will feature a
star-studded rock soundtrack. And VH1 is working on a movie about
Stevie Ray Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real gold rush right now to exploit'' the golden
rock era, says Tim Brooks, co-author of ``The Complete Guide To
Prime Time, Network and Cable TV Shows.''
</P>
<P>
   FUN-LOVING ERA
</P>
<P>
   Why all this shake, rattle and roll? For starters,
nostalgia-waxing baby boomers who grew up grooving to Elvis, the
Rolling Stones and Motown now run the networks. For them, rock 'n'
roll and classic rhythm-and-blues songs bring back memories of a
rebellious, fun-loving era. And everybody already knows the stories
behind the songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rise and fall of these stars, you don't even need a
scriptwriter,'' says Robert Thompson, founding director of the
Center for the Study of Popular Television and a professor of Film
and Television at Syracuse University. ``The great thing about all
of these movies is they have something in them that is already
pre-sold.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks have also discovered that rock films can make more
money than, say, your average Tori Spelling-in-distress thriller.
They can be sold to video or music video channels and tied-in to
greatest hits CDs.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, NBC and ABC have signed deals with VH1, giving the cable
channel exclusive non-network broadcast rights to such films as
``The '60s,'' ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' and ``And The Beat Goes
On: The Sonny and Cher Story.''
</P>
<P>
   `THE TEMPTATIONS'
</P>
<P>
   The trend really got a hold with ``The Temptations,'' which
aired on NBC in November 1998. A richly detailed look at the
triumphs and troubles of the Motown supergroup, it nabbed 22
million viewers, making it the fourth highest rated program in the
country. Those numbers certainly helped boost The Temptations' CD
and video sales, which were sold through an 800-number. Then, last
February, ``The '60s,'' a critically lambasted look at the
turbulent decade through the eyes of a fictional family, also
scored with viewers. Its hit-laden CD sold 400,000 copies right
after the movie aired and quickly became a best-selling soundtrack
on Billboard's chart.
</P>
<P>
   CBS soon produced ``Shake, Rattle and Roll.'' The film was
basically the network's attempt to cash in on CBS' ownership of
dozens of radio stations that could be used to promote the
miniseries and CD. Songs written by music legends such as Bob Dylan
and Carole King were on the disc, as were tracks from contemporary
artists Blink 182, Terence Trent D'Arby and K-ci and JoJo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw NBC's success,'' admits Sunta Izzicupo, CBS' senior
vice president of television movies and miniseries. ``There's
always parallel development in our business.''
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKE, RATTLE AND ROLL'
</P>
<P>
   But the high-profile promotional campaign, CBS' largest ever,
flopped. ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' finished a disappointing 42nd
out of 139 shows. Only 13 million viewers tuned in, and CD sales
peaked at 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was disappointment, because all of us connected with the
project wished more people could have seen it,'' says Spencer
Proffer, a longtime music industry veteran who scored and produced
the film's original recordings. ``Maybe people just weren't
interested in the period.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps viewers just weren't interested in watching what
often resembled a four-hour music video.
</P>
<P>
   Proffer disagrees. ``We didn't use our film as an excuse to
produce a record,'' he says. ``Every music number propelled the
story. The record was just a byproduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Shake, Rattle and Roll's'' less-than-impressive showing is
symbolic of the problem with most rock TV movies _ they don't rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these movies just don't pan out,'' says ABC's Lyne.
``Some of the stories begin sounding very familiar. Discovery,
instant fame, drugs, downfall and sometimes resurrection. In some
cases, they've been approached like music videos, and you're laying
the songs in and trying to find scenes you can set to music.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Syracuse University's Thompson: ``We haven't had our
masterpiece yet. `The David Cassidy Story' was absolutely
fascinating, but it didn't get us any closer to understanding the
true David Cassidy. It was a delightful confection of
schlockumentary kitsch.''
</P>
<P>
   Making music-related films about real-life stars poses a number
of thorny problems. One of the main challenges is finding actors
who can convincingly play these larger-than-life characters. ``When
you try to make a movie about rock 'n' roll stars, you're better
off doing something on a lesser known person,'' says Anthony
DeCurtis, a Rolling Stone contributing editor. ``Once you try to
dramatize a legendary, recognizable figure on the screen, you run
into a lot of trouble. It's very hard for viewers to shake the
image they have in their minds of who that person is.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Matt Letscher, who plays Mike Love in ``The Beach
Boys.'' Letscher says he watched countless hours of interview,
documentary and concert footage to become the group's lead singer.
He acknowledges it wasn't easy. ``When you're performing and
singing, impersonation is a dirty word, so I don't think anybody
can do that. I just tried to look like him the most when I was
performing.''
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC PRESENTS PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   Another headache producers face is securing music rights. Many
of these films spend a good deal of their $15 million to $20
million budgets on getting original period music, skimping on other
things, such as scripts and actors.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they still don't get the music. Don't expect, for
example, to hear any Lennon-McCartney tunes in ``Two of Us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you try to get music from Motown or the Beatles, those
are the most valuable music catalogues in the world, and they
aren't given up easily,'' says DeCurtis. ``That puts you in a
bind.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just where Lyne was when ABC tried to secure rights to
The Beach Boys' music. While Capitol Records releases all of the
group's music, another business owns the publishing rights. That
meant separate negotiations with two companies, as well as prickly
negotiations with multiple songwriters, who don't always get along,
especially when it comes to the famously squabbling leftover
members of the Beach Boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a movie about a contemporary music group is
unbelievably complicated,'' says Lyne. ``It's a Byzantine process.
There are certainly easier things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Neil Meron, ``The Beach Boys: An American Family's''
co-executive producer: ``It's the first time anyone has had signed
deals from Mike Love and Brian Wilson, who were suing the pants off
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how long will the trend last? Lyne, for one, doesn't think
viewers will lose their appetite for music-themed films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers on down have grown up on music, and it's such a
key element in their lives,'' she says. ``People have fallen in
love to music, they got married to music.''
</P>
<P>
   Meron, however, believes rock TV movies will soon go the way of
rabbit ears. ``The ones in the past have really disappointed
audiences,'' he says. ``What they expect to see in drama just
didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if it's got a beat, get ready to see it on your
TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   IF WE RAN TV, WE'D GO FOR THESE RATINGS GRABBERS
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Let Me Bleed: The Keith Richards Story.'' A two-hour movie
about the Rolling Stone's hellish descent into booze, heroin and
plasma replenishment. Starring Tommy Lee Jones as Keith.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``White Like Me: The Michael Jackson Story.'' A
four-to-six-hour miniseries about Michael's hellish descent into
chimps, Elvis, skin peels and hyperbaric chambers. Starring Matt
Damon as Michael.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Our House: The Melissa Etheridge-Julie Cypher-David Crosby
Story.'' A two-hour Lifetime movie about a very, very, very '90s
house. Starring Ellen Barkin as Melissa, with a brief (uncredited)
appearance by Wilford Brimley as Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   TOP OF THE POPS MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Temptations.'' NBC's 1998 miniseries is still the best
TV biography, with a riveting performance by Leon as troubled lead
singer David Ruffin. Plus it re-creates the world of Motown's
recording sessions in loving detail. It's like sunshine on a cloudy
day.
</P>
<P>
   FLOP OF THE POPS MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   _ The dueling Partridge Family films _ ABC's ``Come On Get
Happy'' and NBC's ``The David Cassidy Story.'' ABC scores points
for telling the tale from Danny Bonaduce's sad and humorous point
of view, rather than the sappy and humorless Cassidy's. But they're
both pretty cheesy. And neither got David's hair right.

key element in their lives,'' she says. ``People have fallen in

</P>
<P>
   Meron, however, believes rock TV movies will soon go the way of
rabbit ears. ``The ones in the past have really disappointed

didn't exist.''

   _ ``Let Me Bleed: The Keith Richards Story.'' A two-hour movie
about the Rolling Stone's hellish descent into booze, heroin and
plasma replenishment. Starring Tommy Lee Jones as Keith.

<P>
   _ ``Our House: The Melissa Etheridge-Julie Cypher-David Crosby

   TOP OF THE POPS MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Temptations.'' NBC's 1998 miniseries is still the best
TV biography, with a riveting performance by Leon as troubled lead

<P>
   FLOP OF THE POPS MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   _ The dueling Partridge Family films _ ABC's ``Come On Get
Happy'' and NBC's ``The David Cassidy Story.'' ABC scores points
for telling the tale from Danny Bonaduce's sad and humorous point
of view, rather than the sappy and humorless Cassidy's. But they're
both pretty cheesy. And neither got David's hair right.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Would this act bring down the house?
</P>
<P>
   Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, the executive and artistic director of
Carnegie Hall, watched intently on Jan. 18 as an iron column the
size and color of a tree trunk was extracted from its place under
the main auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the morning after a recital by the violinist Anne-Sophie
Mutter, and crews had begun dismantling the structural framework
that held up the floor of the main hall for 110 years. Taking its
place is temporary steel shoring that will permit an extraordinary
project to unfold between now and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing less than an entirely new theater, seating up to 688
people, will be built under the main auditorium. In some spots, its
ceiling will be only 10 feet below the parquet level seats.
</P>
<P>
   Ohnesorg was on hand to watch the removal of the first column,
bundled against the subterranean cold, looking as dapper as a man
can in a hard hat. (A bow tie helped.) Asked how he felt at that
suspenseful moment, he said simply:
</P>
<P>
   ``In between heaven and earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a more southerly latitude suggests itself, for the
scene under Carnegie Hall these days is truly infernal, as workers
excavate 8,000 cubic yards of Manhattan schist and debris _ enough
to fill 363 New York City garbage trucks _ to make room for the
theater, which is replacing the Carnegie Hall Cinema but will be
far greater in volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mining operation,'' said John L. Tishman, chairman of
Tishman Construction Corp., the construction managers of the
project, and a member of the Carnegie Hall board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no choice, said James Stewart Polshek of the
Polshek Partnership, architects of the new theater. ``If St.
Peter's was out of space and had to build a chapel for 600 people,
they wouldn't go across the Tiber,'' he said. ``They'd excavate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for the rock removal is that a performance hall has
to have volume. The secret to any hall where unamplified music is
played is volume. We couldn't go up. So we had to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless they pass by the construction staging area on Seventh
Avenue, however, concertgoers may be unaware of the unearthly realm
below.
</P>
<P>
   With all 12 cast iron columns removed, the floor of the main
auditorium is held up by 45-foot-high steel pipe columns, 12 inches
in diameter, atop of which are 24-inch steel I-beam girders topped
by thick pads of Neoprene, a rubberlike synthetic that acts as a
kind of cushion.
</P>
<P>
   James D. Nomikos, director of operations at Carnegie Hall, said
there had not been a single comment about acoustics in the 10 days
since the shoring took up the load.
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a performance space under the main
auditorium. Originally called the Carnegie Recital Hall, it was
opened in 1891 by pianist Franz Rummel. It next became the Carnegie
Lyceum, for student dramatic productions, then the Carnegie
Playhouse, for off-Broadway productions and classic movie revivals.
In 1960, it was converted to a commercial cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Nomikos told Judith Arron, who was then the
executive and artistic director, that the cinema's lease was about
to expire.
</P>
<P>
   Nomikos modestly suggested that the space could be used for
badly needed storage. Or perhaps a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or,'' Ms. Arron replied, ``we could turn it into a theater
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the moment, Nomikos said: ``I'll never forget her
look. Her eyes lit up. Her face lit up. It was almost like a follow
spot came on.'' Although, as a practical-minded man, he confessed
that his first thought was, ``There goes my storage space.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (The performance space within the new hall is to be named the
Judith Arron Auditorium, in honor of Ms. Arron, who died in
December 1998. The overall hall will be named after Judy and Arthur
Zankel, who gave $10 million toward the estimated $50 million
construction cost.)
</P>
<P>
   A team was assembled with Robert Silman &AMP; Associates as
structural engineers, Flack &AMP; Kurtz as mechanical and electrical
engineers, Jaffe Holden Scarbrough as acousticians, and Auerbach &AMP;
Associates as theatrical consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The Polshek firm and the Tishman company were responsible for
the 1986 renovation that restored the architectural luster to
Carnegie Hall but, to many discerning ears, diminished its fabled
acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, it was reported that a layer of concrete had been
discovered under the stage floor, 1 to 4 inches thick. The floor
was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Nomikos said what was widely described as concrete was a fill
material, ``a loose kind of mortar that existed in the original
design.'' The loss of resonance listeners noticed, he said, was
more likely attributable to the new stage floor, a combination of
tongue-in-groove maple and two layers of laminated plywood.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said: ``Polshek and Tishman for too long took an
unfair beating on this. They need to be exonerated. Carnegie Hall
never blamed anybody. We have the utmost faith in the capability of
John Tishman and Jim Polshek.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that acoustics in the main hall, now known as
Isaac Stern Auditorium, were of no concern. In fact, maintaining
the sound and structure of that room was initially the chief
preoccupation of the designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest point was to make sure there were no acoustical
implications for the main hall,'' said Charles M. Griffith, the
project architect, who is working with Polshek and Richard Olcott,
the partner in charge of design for the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern was whether construction vibration might bring
down the ceiling in the main hall. ``It's a heavy building, but
some of it is very fragile,'' Tishman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to go out and find mining experts, tunneling
experts,'' he said. That led to Schiavone Construction Co. of
Secaucus, N.J., builders of the 63rd Street subway tunnel, among
other projects.
</P>
<P>
   The construction team studied many methods of excavation and
removal, including shipping the debris out on subway trains,
Tishman said.
</P>
<P>
   What they settled on was a variety of methods, said Michael J.
Goldstein, vice president for New York construction at Schiavone:
sledgehammers, picks, shovels, rams, robotic rock splitters and a
chemical compound that is poured into holes in which it expands,
cracking the stone as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Blasting will also be used as a last resort, with the consent of
the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which designated Carnegie
Hall in 1967. The chairwoman, Jennifer Raab, said, ``We were
convinced of their argument that it's safer to do short blasting
than continuous drilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomikos said there were sure to be outcroppings of bedrock
``where you could drill for eight hours and get three wheelbarrows
of rock out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By blasting, you're eliminating a lot of drilling,'' he said,
``and drilling causes a lot more vibration over a longer period of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the Carnegie Hall interiors are designated
landmarks, Ms. Raab asked that as much as possible of the remaining
19th-century decorative plaster and ironwork be salvaged from the
old recital hall and cinema. Some of it is now in the commission's
storehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Other archaeological finds have come to light, like plasterwork
reinforced with marsh reeds. ``You're not going to see that
again,'' said Roy Barnaby, the project superintendent for Tishman.
``We're half builders, half explorers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arron Auditorium, which is to open in the spring of 2002,
will be 96 feet long and 30 feet high, encircled by an elliptical
concrete wall that will carry the load of the floor above,
permitting a column-free space.
</P>
<P>
   The floor of the new hall will be composed of nine sections,
each 45 feet wide, on independent lifts that can be raised or
lowered to create a stage at the end with raked seating, a stage
and orchestra pit, a stage in the center or a completely flat
floor. Seats will be mounted on movable wagons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do educational work in the morning, change it in the
afternoon and be ready for an evening performance,'' Ohnesorg said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his office, he pondered the nerve-racking engineering
feat that was going on downstairs by recalling the Empire Theater,
which was rolled 170 feet along West 42nd Street in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you change, there is always a certain risk,'' Ohnesorg
said. ``But technology is so advanced. When you realize you can
move an entire building from one place to another place, that shows
you can trust these people.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 WILMOT, N.H.: ... of all time.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though the New Hampshire primary remains at the head of the
parade, so much else has changed, and most of the state now has a
modern, suburban and, sometimes, even antiseptic, feel to it. State
game wardens, for example, no longer pay a bounty on porcupines (25
cents per nose, one of the ways the legendary White Mountain guide
Joe Dodge earned his way in the 1920s), so now, when the phrase
``counting noses'' is heard in New Hampshire, the meaning is
assumed to be purely political. Life here now is less ambiguous,
but it's less colorful, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of the last century, the Upper Valley on the
eastern bank of the Connecticut River was dominated by Claremont, a
mill town that had its own trolley system, an opera house and a
Roseland Dance Hall where Tommy Dorsey and others of the big-band
era used to play regularly. Now the region is dominated by Hanover
(in the early days a sleepy college town with one movie house,
called the Nugget) and Lebanon (in the early days a dreary mill
town), which together now form an education, high-tech and medical
center near the intersection of two interstate highways.
</P>
<P>
   The entire profile of Manchester, the main urban center since it
was planted on the Amoskeag Falls of the Merrimack River by Boston
developers in 1837, has changed, too. In the early 20th century,
the Amoskeag mills comprised the biggest textile plant in the
world, employing some 17,000 workers in 30 major mills and
accounting for 8 million square feet of floor space along two miles
of the river. It was, wrote Tamara K. Hareven and Randolph
Langenbach, the editors of a compelling oral history of the mills,
``a total institution, a closed and almost self-contained world.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 74 cloth-making departments, three dye houses, three
steam power plants and the hydroelectric power plant fell victim to
competition, mainly from the South. The mill shut down in 1936.
``The death of those mills was catastrophic,'' said Frisbee, the
executive director of the historical society. ``New Hampshire went
into a depression and pretty much didn't come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the time when Gregg occupied the governor's office in
the Concord capitol, roughly a half-century ago, the economy of the
state was dominated by the remnants of the shoe, textile and wood
products industries _ in short, the very factors that dominated the
economy in 1850.
</P>
<P>
   None of those is dominant or even prominent now. The fastest
expanding business today is Fidelity Investments, followed by HADCO
Corp., which makes printed electrical circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state has gone from low tech to high tech, from a work
ethic to a learning ethic, from basic manufacturing to
sophisticated software entrepreneurship,'' said John Crosier,
president of the Business and Industry Association of New
Hampshire. ``Thirty-five years ago we boasted of low taxes and low
labor costs and the work ethic. Now we talk about productivity and
the office economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the political culture has remained remarkably stable _
even after searing 1970s conflicts over the Seabrook nuclear power
plant and a doomed Aristotle Onassis proposal to build a $600
million oil-refinery project at Durham Point. Remarkably stable _
and remarkably misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the political culture is the state's long and
stubborn resistance to income and sales taxes. Vermont adopted
broad-based taxes seven decades ago, after a major flood washed out
most of the state's bridges. New Hampshire didn't have a similar
disaster and its constitution requires a two-third's majority to
pass an amendment permitting a non-proportional tax.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there haven't been attempts _ more than a dozen votes,
referenda and commissions since the 1920s. None prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire hunkered down and decided to go bare bones,''
said Peter Haebler, a historian at the University of New Hampshire
at Manchester. ``It decided to have the leanest possible
government. New Hampshire looked at Massachusetts, thought it might
be the future, and decided to go in the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The antitax orthodoxy was strengthened as William Loeb, the
maverick publisher of the Manchester Union Leader, the only
statewide paper in New Hampshire, called on political candidates to
take what he called ``the pledge,'' a vow of eternal opposition to
income and sales taxes. Loeb has been dead for 19 years and yet the
pledge still lives, and a measure of its health is that a
Democratic governor, Jeanne Shaheen of Madbury, has taken it and
lives by it.
</P>
<P>
   More than any elected official, Loeb dominated the politics of
the state, an extraordinary reign of power and fear. He rewarded
his allies (he described Meldrim Thomson, who served three terms as
governor in the 1970s and campaigned on an ax-the-tax platform, as
``one of the best things that happened to the State of New
Hampshire since its founding'') and punished his enemies (he
described Henry J. Kissinger as a ``spoiled marshmallow'' and one
of ``the biggest, stupidest suckers the world has ever seen.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The method was the megaphone _ the biggest voice in the state
and the wider reach the New Hampshire primary gave him _ and the
word _ his ability to turn a phrase that stuck in people's mind,''
said Mike Pride, the editor of the Concord Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the state's aversion to taxes meshed comfortably, even
seamlessly, with the state's natural impulse toward limited
government and local control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't fund state government _ not because we don't want
state government, but because we don't want to feed the government
and waste money and take away individual freedoms,'' said Michael
York, the state librarian. ``This is our natural philosophy here.
We keep government under control and assure that individual
citizens don't lose any liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   That view, embedded so deeply in the hard soil of New Hampshire,
is at the heart of the Republican revolution that Ronald Reagan
began (merchandising it first in the New Hampshire primary in 1976)
and that Democrats now no longer fully reject. ``The decentralizing
impulse that is sweeping the United States has been part of the New
Hampshire landscape for a century,'' saidJere R. Daniell, a
Dartmouth College professor who teaches New England history.
Indeed, New Hampshire, geographically at the center of New England,
is surely the most decentralized state in the region _ and perhaps
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And though the folk wisdom is that New Hampshire is a deeply
conservative state, the impact of the Progressive Yankees, who
disappeared by World War I, never wore away. Their populist
impulses, along with the primary, inculcated a soak-the-rich brand
of politics that remains hidden but hearty in the state. The state
may have no income or sales tax, but it does possess an 8 percent
business-profits tax, a business-enterpise tax and an interest and
dividends tax _ plus an 8 percent meals, rooms, and rental-car tax
aimed at wealthy vacationing outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The wallet of New Hampshire may be in the southern part of the
state, but the soul of it (and, come to think of it, the lungs of
it) are in the northern reaches, beyond Crawford Notch and Pinkham
Notch, in the vast and, in winter, terrible mountain peaks where
the winds are brutal, the temperatures subzero, the air crisp, the
views unrestricted. And though it is no longer reached only by
foot, or stage, or rail, it remains remote and rugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a point of pride in being part of the North Country,''
said Thomas L. Havill, a retired geographer at Keene State College.
``It is harsher there. The winters are harder, longer, colder. You
have to be tough to live there. Down here in Keene we look at those
guys up at Dartmouth and say: `They get less sunlight than we do.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Frost, who lived in Salem, Derry, Plymouth, Franconia,
and Hanover, whose father was born in Kingston and whose first
teaching job was in a district school in the southern part of
Salem, spent much time in Vermont but kept his heart in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In the rare books collection at Dartmouth College there rests a
slender volume of Frost poetry, the first issue of the first
edition of ``Mountain Interval,'' and there, in ink in Frost's own
hand, are annotations he made for his friend Edward Connery Lathem,
who later edited the standard volume of Frost's poetry. Sit in the
Rauner Library in Webster Hall on a cold New Hampshire winter
afternoon and turn the pages slowly, and it becomes clear that
``Christmas Trees'' is rooted in Franconia, ``The Cow in Apple
Time'' in Derry, ``Out, Out _ '' &UR;  &LR; in Bethlehem, and ``Brown's
Descent'' in Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   In ``New Hampshire: A Guide to the Granite State,'' assembled by
the Federal Writers' Project in 1938, is the personal testimony of
Frost:
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a poem, I believe, in all my six books, from `A Boy's
Will' to `A Further Range,' but has something in it of New
Hampshire. Nearly half of my poems must actually have been written
in New Hampshire. Every single person in my `North of Boston' was
friend or acquaintance of mine in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost, who thought of himself as a Grover Cleveland Democrat,
proclaimed, in the poem ``New Hampshire'': ``I choose to be a plain
New Hampshire farmer.'' Perhaps. But that, like everything else in
and about New Hampshire, is only part of the story.

NEW HAMPSHIRE POLITICS SHAPED BY GEOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMOT, N.H. _ Whose woods these are they think they know.
</P>
<P>
   This is a classic New Hampshire upland in winter, a frosty
mountain meadow and a hillside cemetery covered by the dust of snow
from a hemlock tree. Up here on the northwest shoulder of Mount
Kearsarge, amid the roar of trees and the crack of branches, and
with snow falling and night falling fast, is a grand glimpse of
Mount Sunapee, of Ragged Mountain and of the land below _ the
complex, confounding, contradictory and contentious state that on
Tuesday holds the first presidential primary of the political
season.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters, with their nightly tracking surveys, think they
know the subtlest impulses of the voters milling beneath the spruce
and fir. The candidates, with their open forums and their jaunty
walks along Elm Street, think they know the temper of the people in
the towns. The commentators, with their first-class upgrades on
nonstop jet flights into Manchester's shiny airport, think they
know the lay of the land.
</P>
<P>
   And they do, more or less. They know more of this state _ a
barnicle on the coast of America, extending like a wedge, thick end
to thin, all the way to the mountain frontier with Quebec, an
industrious colony of 1,185,048 souls _ than they do of other
states, like, say, Michigan, which has eight times the population
and a dozen times the diversity.
</P>
<P>
   That's the more. Here's the less. The New Hampshire that is the
setting for Tuesday's primary _ the New Hampshire that now has the
greatest concentration of high-tech workers in the nation _ was
shaped by the land, whose contours challenged white settlers as
early as 1642; and by the state's constitution, which has made an
income tax an impossibility for generations; and by the mills, most
of which closed in the mid 1930s but whose shadows (and sober
lessons of the limits of technology) dominate the towns and give
them a gloom even in an economic boom; and by poets who, as Robert
Frost remarked in a poem he called ``New Hampshire'' in a 1923 book
he titled ``New Hampshire,'' sometimes seem ``so much more
businesslike than businessmen.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is America's Canada, with most of the population
hugging the Massachusetts border (the way that most of Canada's
population is within four hours' driving distance of the American
border), with a simplistic image that belies the complexities, with
a great backyard of woods and hills that shapes the views and
perspectives of people who haven't even ventured there, and with a
sense of place so firm, so robust, so large that it works its will
on newcomer and native alike.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is a place, but it is also an outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the North Country weaves into the souls and minds of its
men those patterns of ruggedness, of sturdiness and individuality
and self-expressive independence,'' Dartmouth College president
Ernest Martin Hopkins said in 1923, ``so these men in turn weave it
back into the fabric of the life of the society and the groups and
the environment within which they live.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 77 years later, reflecting on his state in the new century
and millennium _ a state whose biggest employers now are a defense
contractor and a manufacturer of high-speed, high-tech connectors _
former senator Warren B. Rudman has a remarkably similar view:
``We're independent. We're self-reliant,'' said Rudman, who was
born in Boston and moved to Nashua at age 4. ``It's even true of
the people who move into the state. They take on the character.''
It's what draws them here, and what keeps them here.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the change, with all the plants making print and
circuit boards and Calloway golf clubs, with all the mutual-fund
managers and the thermal heat-sink manufacturers, New Hampshire is
still a product of its history and its geography. And of the two,
geography has prevailed every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geography is the foundation of this sense of localism and
autonomy,'' said John L. Frisbee, executive director of the New
Hampshire Historical Society. ``People everywhere say they are
different. People here really are. Here we are at the beginning of
the 21st century and we're finally developing a decent connector
between Portsmouth in the east and Keene in the west.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of knowledge in New Hampshire is the recognition
that all of the movement in the state _ goods, services, people _
is in a north-south direction. As a result, the Connecticut River
Valley (with its market in Springfield, Mass., and Hartford, Conn.)
and the Merrimack River Valley (which looks to Boston and
Worcester) and the North Country (which is oriented to Portland,
Maine, and Canada) are separate entities.
</P>
<P>
   The roads and rivers (and, not so long ago, the railroads)
carried goods in and out of the state, but they also carried
people, and with the exception of the great influx of
French-speaking Canadians in the last century, mostly the people
left. The situation grew so grave at the last turn of the century
that a visionary governor named Frank West Rollins came up with a
phrase that is now lodged in the American imagination and with an
idea that changed the face of New Hampshire:
</P>
<P>
   Old Home Week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899 the governor delivered an invitation _ no, perhaps a
summons _ to those who had left. He bid them to return, and in so
doing bid New Hampshire to return to its heritage. Indeed, Old Home
Week helped build the idea (and image) of New Hampshire that is so
prominent now: the Yankee farmer, the sturdy individual, the church
steeples, the town greens, the long white afternoons. In a series
of addresses Rollins made around the state in 1900, he delivered
what Yvonne Stahr Fried described in the journal Historical New
Hampshire as ``a strong heart-felt attempt to rekindle feelings of
local pride and state patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing more astonishing than the idea was its success,
and as a result New Hampshire built new roads, took new steps
toward preserving its northern forests and cultivated an image that
remains with us still. And the pride it generated led directly to
the New Hampshire primary, which began in 1916 and, since 1920, has
always been the first in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The primary was also a product of the progressive impulses that
were sweeping the nation and that, between 1906 and 1916, were
especially prominent in New Hampshire. These local reformers, known
as Progressive Yankees, fought the power of the Boston and Maine
Railroad, which controlled politics here, instituted controls on
lobbying, created the first important regulatory board, pushed
through child-labor laws _ and instituted a primary election law.
</P>
<P>
   The Progressive Yankees were attracted by the new idea of direct
primaries in part because they believed it would help them elect a
reform governor, and it set the stage for the presidential primary
that has become such an important part of the American political
landscape. And though in decades to come New Hampshire officials of
all stripes would fight fiercely to retain the state's position as
the staging ground for the first presidential contest, an element
of Yankee thrift also prevailed: For years the primary was held on
the second Tuesday in March, which is Town Meeting Day. No one
wanted to have to heat the town hall twice.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the New Hampshire myths that have been turned into sturdy
truths, none is sturdier than the idea that the road to the White
House runs through the byways and community halls of this state.
The myth-become-truth is that, with one exception (Bill Clinton,
who was defeated by Massachusetts neighbor Paul E. Tsongas in 1992,
an extenuating circumstance if there ever were one) no modern
president has been elected without first having won the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows that this one-on-one political style of ours pays
off,'' said Hugh Gregg, who served as governor between 1953 and
1955. ``We pick the candidate with an open mind. We don't always
concentrate on the issues. We always concentrate on the character
of the candidate. It works here. We serve the nation in the way no
one else can.'' And, of course, only no one else but the voters of
New Hampshire could have persuaded Republican Senator Robert Taft
of Ohio, dressed impeccably in a suit, tie and overcoat, to clutch
a chicken close to his breast. That scene, immortalized in 1952 by
an Alfred Eisenstaedt photograph, remains perhaps the classic
campaign picture of all time.

 &HT;    An island with a view
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain's campaign bus was somewhere in New Hampshire, five
days before voters will sort out McCain's political future.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the bus, the setting was Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, former prisoner of war, was telling a sweet story of
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Dinah Shore's version of ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' and
other holiday songs played on the loudspeaker as McCain sat alone
in his Hanoi Hilton cell on a cold Christmas Eve 1970. ``They did
everything they could to help our morale,'' he deadpans.
</P>
<P>
   In walks ``The Cat,'' as he is called by POWs. The chief of
North Vietnamese prisons, this is the man who offered McCain the
chance to go home two years earlier, an offer McCain felt bound to
refuse. ``I had not seen him since,'' McCain recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat is in an expansive mood and they talk for maybe 45
minutes. Unlike in previous encounters, The Cat speaks English,
going on about Ho Chi Minh, North Vietnam's leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat talks about Ho's private villa on an island in Ha Long
Bay, where Ho and his guests watch the sun set over the bay. Then
The Cat leaves, and McCain never sees him again.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, McCain, now a senator from Arizona, is lunching in
the Senate dining room with a Vietnamese official who worked on
restoring ties between the United States and Vietnam. McCain
mentions that he's planning a trip to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The man asks McCain if he'd like any help, McCain says he would
and begins to describe Ho's island villa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy almost fell out of his chair,'' McCain says. ``He
said, `How do you know about that? No one knows about that
island.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later, McCain, his wife, Cindy, and Mark Salter, his
chief Senate aide, visit Vietam and take a boat to the island and
watch the sunset. The ex-Navy pilot who once rained bombs on Ho's
people stays the night in Ho's villa, which by now is rundown.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you think?'' he is asked on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live long enough ...'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   LESSONS FROM THE KING
</P>
<P>
   As I watched the last debate between Al Gore and Bill Bradley in
Manchester, N.H., on Wednesday, I couldn't stop from mentally
morphing Bradley into Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   I had only recently learned that Bradley, while in the U.S.
Senate, had studied the King's movies. The senator thought that
this could, in some way, help him improve his own communications
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Bradley began duking it out with Gore in the debate the
other night, in my mind he slowly morphed into ``Kid Galahad.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the movie in which Elvis plays a singing ex-GI mechanic
who becomes a boxer and rises to fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis' best line in the movie certainly reflected the new
fighting-back nature of the Bradley campaign: ``This is one grease
monkey that don't slide so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more.
</P>
<P>
   It also seems that Bradley, at the age of 22, and already a
national celebrity as a result of his basketball skills, made a
pilgrimage to Graceland, the Presley home in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I climbed up the wall that surrounded Graceland, reached over
to a limb that was from a tree inside the wall, snapped the leaf
off the tree and kept that leaf in my wallet for about six years,''
Bradley told MTV last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley came into the press filing center after the debate, but
I couldn't get close enough to tell him about how he had turned
into ``Kid Galahad'' in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   I also couldn't tell him that a man who claims to be the King's
illegitimate son is working for his rival.
</P>
<P>
   I met that man last fall in Nashville when Al Gore was moving
his campaign headquarters to Music City.
</P>
<P>
   He had bushy sideburns, wore sunglasses and a jacket covered
with gold buttons. He signed one of the campaign volunteer forms
``Elvis.'' Then, before driving off in a black Corvette with the
license plate ``Elvis 1,'' he declared, ``Gore is our leader for
the next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   PIE IN THE SKY
</P>
<P>
   After losing two-to-one to Al Gore in the Iowa caucuses, former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley beat a hasty retreat to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley was in jovial spirits as he boarded a Boeing 727
Monday night for the flight to the Granite State. Before take off,
Bradley wandered back to the section of the plane reserved for the
press with a special treat for reporters: macadamia nut pie.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley cheerfully cut up pieces of the pie _ a gift from a
supporter _ and handed them out to reporters one at a time. Bradley
raved about the pie _ until New York Times reporter James Dao
examined the pie's list of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ingredients was Kona coffee beans from Hawaii, a
source of caffeine. Bradley must avoid caffeine because it can
trigger an irregular heart beat, a non-life threatening condition
he was diagnosed with in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding me,'' Bradley exclaimed, rolling his eyes,
shaking his head and forcing out a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The pie apparently wasn't enough to trigger any problems for
Bradley, as he stayed in the back of the plane chatting with
reporters until the it was airborne.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes into the flight, the pilot of the charter jet
announced that the plane was leaving Iowa airspace. A spontaneous
cheer erupted among the press corps and Bradley's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley only smiled.
</P>
<P>
   MONKS AND PICKET FENCES
</P>
<P>
   A New Hampshire street scene:
</P>
<P>
   Driving through downtown Manchester talking on a cellphone, a
reporter's attention is diverted by three saffron-robed Buddhist
monks _ American political activists, actually _ carrying a sign
that says ``Al Gore Finance Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the reporter and the ersatz monks are making their way
toward the center of town, where already _ it's midday before the
Republican and Democratic debates _ a solid wall of placards line
the way to the WMUR-TV studios.
</P>
<P>
   There are whole picket fences of McCain and Bush signs, with
Keyes placards looming behind. Gore and Bradley signs fill the
chinks in the line. Not to mention placards for groups opposing
Internet taxes and favoring defense cuts.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall the weather has dipped into the low teens, but the
crowd outside the station has grown into the hundreds. A hip-hop
group keeps Steve Forbes' supporters warmed up, while across the
way a nonaligned group favoring campaign finance reform strikes up
a chant: ``BIG MONEY _ UNITED _ CAN NEVER BE DEFEATED.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in ski masks and parkas struggle dutifully to maintain
some order in the frigid festival. But the monks are nowhere to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: HAVE A LAUGH ON ME
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush, who has misspoken
his way into a reputation as a word mangler, said Friday it's OK to
have a laugh
</P>
<P>
   at his expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I say something that sounds silly to you, I think it's fair
for you to write it,'' Bush told reporters Friday in Portsmouth,
N.H. ``Just make sure to put in there, `He is real tired,' too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has engaged in sporadic mangling of the language throughout
his campaign trips in Iowa and New Hampshire. Last week, his effort
to get through an ``us vs. them'' passage about foreign policy had
reporters doubled over in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he has talked about people ``working hard to put food
on your family.'' At an elementary school where ``perseverance''
was the character trait of the month, Bush launched into a speech
about ``preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what you do when you run for president. You gotta
preserve,'' he said before getting back on track. On Friday, Bush
said he can take the ribbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the color of the campaign. I would suspect that every
candidate winding down in a grueling schedule like we're all going
through is not going to get everything perfectly correct,'' he
said. ``I sometimes say things that are mispronunciations. I say
that sometimes even when I'm not tired, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was a case of the syntax of the father being visited
on the son, Bush said: ``He was a Phi Beta Kappa at Yale, in case
you don't remember. And I wasn't.''

FBI PROTECTION OF MOBSTERS COST MANY LIVES, EX-WITNESS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DICK LEHR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the closing days of 1978, federal prosecutors in
Boston worked feverishly to put the final touches on an indictment
to bust open a horse race-fixing enterprise that had amassed
millions of dollars in illegal profits while operating in eight
East Coast states.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the biggest organized crime cases in years, and
prosecutors had an ace in the hole: The master race-fixer himself,
Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Ciulla, was on board to testify as their star
witness.
</P>
<P>
   But a band of Boston FBI agents was far from ecstatic about
that: Two of the government's targets were James J. ``Whitey''
Bulger and Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, newly minted informants
enlisted to help the FBI go after the Boston Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, Ciulla, the witness whose testimony
eventually helped win a slew of convictions, has broken his silence
to talk about the time when Bulger and Flemmi could have been
prosecuted _ but were not _ and the consequences of that decision.
``Start counting the bodies from '78 on, from Stevie and Whitey,''
says Ciulla.
</P>
<P>
   In the ongoing investigation of Bulger and Flemmi, authorities
now believe the pair was involved in the murders of at least eight
people since they were dropped from the race-fixing case. Two weeks
ago, the decomposed bodies of two men and a woman were recovered
from a makeshift grave in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people?'' asks Ciulla, a hulking, 6-foot-4-inch,
gravelly voiced gambler who has never lacked for bravado and whose
exact whereabouts remain a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about buckets of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Indicted in early 1979 in the historic race-fixing case were
gang boss Howard T. Winter and 20 others _ gangsters, Las Vegas
casino executives and jockeys, but not Bulger and Flemmi. ``I had
them dead to rights,'' Ciulla says about his readiness more than 20
years ago to testify against the two, if they had been charged with
the others.
</P>
<P>
   But that never happened. The maneuverings by former FBI agents
John J. Connolly Jr. and John Morris to protect Bulger and Flemmi
have since been exposed, mostly during federal court in 1998 that
revealed FBI wrongdoing in an alliance with the gangsters that
began in 1975 and lasted two decades. Under oath, Morris has
admitted working to get Bulger and Flemmi out of the race-fixing
case. Connolly, in interviews, has said he and Morris believed
their informants' insistence that they were not involved in the
gang's scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ciulla is talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a critical moment,'' he says, ``the inception of the
feds doing them a big favor.'' If Bulger and Flemmi had not been
dropped from the case, he says, ``a lot of people, families, kids
would have fathers, husbands, brothers, whatever. It makes me want
to vomit. That's the bottom line. They should have been indicted.
They were as guilty as everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the 70-year-old Bulger remains a fugitive on the FBI's 10
Most Wanted list, the public unraveling of his underworld reign,
and of the wrongdoing by Boston FBI agents associated with him, is
now six years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   It started with Bulger and Flemmi's racketeering indictment in
1995 and extended through the federal court hearings overseen by US
District Judge Mark Wolf. Last month, Bulger's former FBI handler,
Connolly, was indicted on racketeering charges, including tipping
Bulger to his indictment so that he could flee. Morris, under a
grant of immunity, has confessed to illegally taking money from
Bulger. Wolf ruled that to protect Bulger and Flemmi, Connolly,
Morris and others would warn them repeatedly during the 1980s about
investigators' plans to wiretap or target them.
</P>
<P>
   But the race-fixing case was different. The probe had originated
in New Jersey in 1977 and was first taken up by FBI agents based in
Lowell, not Boston.
</P>
<P>
   During one lengthy FBI debriefing in Sacramento in early 1978,
Ciulla gave agents a ``recap of the overall scheme,'' according to
the FBI report of that session. He told how jockeys were bribed to
throw races, and how the gang collected thousands of dollars in
wagers made at tracks and with bookmakers. He named Bulger and
Flemmi as two of the seven key Winter Hill gangsters who managed
the scheme. He broke down how the illegal profits were split up _
``50 percent to Howard Winter and his six aforementioned
associates.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, during a state trial against jockeys in New
Jersey, Ciulla took the witness stand and was told to name his
Boston partners. Like an actor setting up his best lines, he
hestitated. ``Your honor, I have been in front of federal grand
juries with these names,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are here now,'' replied the judge, unimpressed. He ordered
Ciulla to answer the question. Ciulla did. He then named Howie
Winter and, for the first time publicly, other partners: ``Whitey
Bulger. Stephen Flemmi.''
</P>
<P>
   In November of 1978, Ciulla was the subject of a cover story in
Sports Illustrated under the headline ``Confessions of a Master
Fixer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the federal case was too far along for Morris and
Connolly to give Bulger and Flemmi a heads-up. Indeed, as 1978
wound down, it looked like Bulger and Flemmi were certain to be
indicted. But then the agents paid a visit to Jeremiah T.
O'Sullivan, the lead prosecutor on the New England Organized Crime
Strike Force. They explained that Bulger and Flemmi were an
investment they wanted to preserve as part of the FBI's war on the
local Mafia. The meeting achieved the hoped-for result. Bulger and
Flemmi were not charged.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to con me,'' says Cuilla, now 56, referring to the
reasons he says O'Sullivan gave him to explain Bulger and Flemmi's
absence from the indictment. ``I went in and had big beefs with
them.'' Having described Bulger and Flemmi's participation to FBI
agents and identified the two under oath during a state trial,
Cuilla says he was angry and incredulous when told the federal case
in Boston would not include the pair.
</P>
<P>
   Ciulla, formerly of Stoneham and the son of a fish merchant,
admits his outrage was not based on some high-minded devotion to
justice. It was self-preservation. ``I didn't want to leave them
out there,'' he recalls. ``You got to remember the more of them
left on the street, the more likely I get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan, says Ciulla, sought to play down Bulger and Flemmi's
culpability. ``He tried to justify Stevie's not being in the
indictment by the fact he was a little bit on the lambrooskie,''
says Ciulla. Flemmi had returned to Boston in 1974 after several
years on the lam in Canada. ``Then he was saying, `We couldn't
correlate certain dates' '' of fixed races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That is not true.' And Whitey was there all the
time.'' Ciulla says Bulger helped round up Boston-area bookmakers
to unwittingly take bets on fixed races. After suffering huge
losses, the bookies found themselves indebted to _ then controlled
by _ the Winter Hill gang.
</P>
<P>
   Ciulla says Bulger and Flemmi were ``very disciplined guys'' who
eschewed the partying, which he says included snorting cocaine,
that might begin in the gang's headquarters at Marshall Motors in
Somerville and run deep into the night. ``Did I hang out with
him?'' he says about Bulger. ``Socialize after the day's business?
Go with him to Southie? No. But he was always there. There was
always the money for him and for Stevie.''
</P>
<P>
   During the months leading to a trial that ended up running into
the summer of 1979 and lasted 46 days, Ciulla says, he was still
complaining about the failure to indict Bulger and Flemmi. He says
he asked O'Sullivan, ``Why are these guys being left out? They are
no more or less guilty than the others. They were partners. They
were part of the conspiracy. Why would you leave them out when I
had direct dealings with them?''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan, now in private practice at the Boston firm of Choate
Hall &AMP; Stewart, did not return a call seeking comment.

 BOSTON: ... seeking comment.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From O'Sullivan, Ciulla says, he always got double-talk. From
FBI agents, he says, he finally got the truth. ``They had to tell
me,'' says Ciulla, ``because I was going nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the FBI told him Bulger and Flemmi had given their word
they would not go after him, a pledge Connolly has mentioned in
interviews. ``I wasn't OK about Stevie and Whitey, but I had to
swallow that load. You know what I mean? That's how it was.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prosecution overseen by O'Sullivan, Ciulla proved his
worth. Howie Winter and seven codefendants who remained in the case
(some had fled and others had pleaded guilty) were convicted in
July of 1979 after a 10-week trial. Ciulla testified for 17 days.
Winter was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Even before the trial
began, Morris had filed internal FBI paperwork cleaning up the
crisis as far as Bulger was concerned, and he resorted to the spin
that has since been exposed as commonplace in the FBI's files about
Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Morris wrote to FBI headquarters that Bulger was clear because
``no prosecutable case developed against source in the opinion of
Strike Force attorney handling the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Wolf did not mince words in ruling about Morris's
report. ``This was not true,'' he concluded. ``Rather, Bulger and
Flemmi were not prosecuted in the race-fix case because Connolly,
Morris, and O'Sullivan had decided that their value as informants
outweighed the importance of prosecuting them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pending case against Bulger and Flemmi assembled by a new
generation of prosecutors and investigators, the two crime bosses
are charged in the race-fixing scheme as one of their many acts of
alleged racketeering _ the same charge O'Sullivan chose not to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ciulla has spent the intervening years in and out
of the federal Witness Protection Program, and lives today under a
new identity at an undisclosed location. His last public appearance
in Boston was in mid-1995, when he was whisked into town to testify
at the bail hearing of John Martorano, the hitman for the Bulger
gang who had been a fugitive until his arrest that year.
</P>
<P>
   Ciulla says his decision to grant an interview was prompted
mostly by the latest sensational news in the Bulger case _ the
discovery Jan. 14 of the three buried bodies in Dorchester.
Authorities believe the three were killed by Bulger and Flemmi or
their underlings during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm telling you, listen, the three bodies they found . .
. that wouldn't have happened'' if Bulger and Flemmi had been
prosecuted in the race-fixing case, Ciulla says.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that FBI agents in 1979 had no idea of possible
murders to come. But agents did brush aside reports from other
informants at the time indicating Bulger and Flemmi's criminal
activities were growing and expanding into cocaine trafficking,
loan sharking, and extortion. In his recent ruling, Wolf wrote:
``Connolly and Morris were well-aware that he (Bulger) and Flemmi
remained involved in a range of criminal activity . . . The FBI
neither investigated nor disclosed such information to any other
law enforcement agency.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dead were what was on Ciulla's mind when he was
interviewed last week. He ticked off the names of others now
believed to have been killed either by Bulger and Flemmi, or on
their orders. ``Those things were impossible to happen if they went
along with it, if they were in the indictment,'' he says. ``Didn't
Howie (Winter) get 10 years? They would have been in jail. It would
have been the downfall of all that.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The minimalist stage is set for super bowl xxxiv.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's game should be shorn of all capital letters and
pretentious Roman numerals, for it most decidedly is a downsized
duel.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans and St. Louis Rams, two teams that in the
recent past forsook megamarkets for megadeals, will kick off at
6:18 in the Georgia Dome, with their caravan of disciples _ who
undoubtedly arrived in compact cars _ in tow.
</P>
<P>
   The transplants have followed similar paths downhill to reach
the top. After a half-century in the nation's second-largest
metropolis, Los Angeles, the Rams headed for the heartland _ and
the No. 21 television market _ in 1995. Two years later, the
Houston Oilers erased 37 years of history in the nation's
fourth-largest city and No. 11 TV market as they escaped to the
Volunteer State, where their new address is listed as No. 30 in the
Nielsen parade.
</P>
<P>
   Each team got a honey of a stadium deal as their suitors tried
to prove that smaller is better. But they also tampered with the
natural order of things _ and the network numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps reflecting this, the weather here has been apocalyptic
by the standards of the Gateway to the South, which has turned into
the Gateway to the South Pole this week, with snow, ice, and
sub-freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   But all that will be forgotten once the opponents step indoors
for an intriguing match between teams that are considered upstarts
because of more than just their locales.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were coming off 5-11 and 4-12 seasons this year under
reborn coach Dick Vermeil, who at age 61 had decided to rekindle
the flame _ moderately this time _ after leading the Philadelphia
Eagles to the 1981 Super Bowl, then taking a 14-year hiatus from
coaching not long after that because of burnout.
</P>
<P>
   With expectations hardly higher this season, the Rams rolled to
a 13-3 record and through their overmatched opponents by an average
score of 33-12. Kurt Warner, the quarterback straight from
oblivion, otherwise known as the Arena Football League and NFL
Europe, supposedly was thrown in over his head when the designated
starter, Trent Green, was lost for the year with a preseason knee
injury. Warner proceeded to become the NFL's Most Valuable Player
and the second man ever to throw 40 touchdown passes. ``He's the
story of the NFL, really,'' said Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Warner wasn't even necessarily the MVP on his own team.
That honor probably belongs to Marshall Faulk, who became the
second running back in history (joining the 49ers' Roger Craig) to
accumulate more than 1,000 yards each rushing and receiving and who
set an NFL record for total offense from scrimmage (2,429 yards).
In addition, wide receiver Isaac Bruce returned to breakaway form
after two seasons of hamstring problems, catching 77 passes for
1,165 yards. Az-Zahir Hakim (37 catches, 677 yards) was a dynamic
long-distance complement, and Torry Holt (47-666) wasn't far
behind. Pro Bowl tackle Orlando Pace anchored an immovable
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' defense thus lost out in the headlines, though not in
effectiveness. End Kevin Carter and cornerback Todd Lyght, Pro
Bowlers both, set the standard that was on display last week, when
the St. Louis defense was positively heroic while the offense
sputtered in an 11-6 victory over the gritty Tampa Bay Buccaneers
for the NFC title.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the high-profile Rams have been installed as 7-point
favorites. And truth be told, that's just the way the Titans want
it.
</P>
<P>
   After three straight 8-8 seasons, the Titans have reveled in
their underdog role this year, real or imagined, while compiling an
unlikely 13-3 record and then toppling Buffalo, Indianapolis, and
Jacksonville for the AFC crown.
</P>
<P>
   A fast, ferocious defense has been their calling card, with
rookie Pro Bowl end Jevon Kearse and veteran strong safety Blaine
Bishop leading the charge. The offense's mandate has been to not
gum up the works, and it has succeeded under the resourceful
direction of mobile quarterback Steve McNair. The major force is
Pro Bowl running back Eddie George, a battering ram who the Titans
hope will take the term literally Sunday tonight. Another strong
effort from George, who has gouged out 354 yards during the
playoffs after a 1,304-yard regular season, will be essential if
McNair's favorite target, wide receiver Yancey Thigpen, is unable
to go because of a hairline fracture of the right foot.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the stars of this modest extravaganza. The coaches
believe you can throw out the demographics when these two teams
play.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-effusive Vermeil said, ``I can't tell you how exciting
it is and what a pleasure it is to be here representing the city of
St. Louis.'' Then again, he'd be equally enthused about
representing the city of Podunk.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart, Titans coach Jeff Fisher, won't hear of this
game being dismissed as the Hee Haw Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only heard it referred to as Super Bowl XXXIV,'' he said,
supplying the traditional emphasis on magnitude. ``I think it's a
great example and a tremendous opportunity for anybody to make it
to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's usually no small achievement. Except for this
year's game.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Make no mistake, the students of Memorial
High School here liked Steve Forbes when he visited. Several said
so. Then those same students skewered him with merciless teen-age
candor.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Gulley, junior: ``He's a smart guy, he's just not a
speaker. He stands up there _ `flat tax, flat tax, flat tax' _ and
doesn't blink.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lavers, senior: ``He's not very charismatic, in my
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner Browning, senior: ``I thought Dole looked like a
president; McCain looks like a president; Forbes looks like a
CPA.'' and ``I wonder what his statue would look like if they made
one of him?''
</P>
<P>
   No one says it's fair. But in New Hampshire in these final
pre-primary days, many residents, even some supporters, relate to
Forbes as the class geek running for class president. His central
challenge, it seems, is not money, not ideas and, after his strong
second-place showing in Iowa, not momentum. It is the charisma
question, the problem that he is so far from a natural politician
that some audiences are left wondering what self-image distortion
ever put him at the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   His speaking has improved greatly, many say, but Forbes still
suffers from an animatronic air. He looks a bit like an orchestra
conductor with poor motor control when he gestures, and his little
hand chops are often just off the beat of the syllable he is
emphasizing. Some also question whether he looks presidential, and
say they hurt for his awkwardness in debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were in central casting and wanted a face to run for
president, that isn't the face you'd choose,'' said Donna Sytek,
speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, a Republican
who has yet to commit to a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Geeky is as geeky does, is the essence of Forbes' response. He
encourages people to vote their conscience and says ``the ultimate
charisma is enacting bold change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You find that very few people look presidential until they
become president,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``There was
probably no one more homely _ and he was the first to tell you _
than Abraham Lincoln, and probably the most presidential-looking
was Warren Harding.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes enthusiasts say that the message is more important than
the messenger. Lynn Leser of Londonderry, N.H., who has volunteered
on his campaign, demanded: ``Where is it written that someone who
debates well on TV will make a good president?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's an honest human being and he wants the best for
America,'' Ms. Leser said. ``If someone else would pick up his
ideas and go with them, he'd stand aside and say, `Go. Vote for
him!' But until someone else does it, he's not going to let America
go down the tubes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another supporter, Bob Duffy, an aviation engineer, said of
Forbes' manner: ``We can get used to it. I'm sure we've had
presidents with deader personalities, like Cal Coolidge. It's the
message, not his personality. We're voting for him for his ideas,
not his smile.''
</P>
<P>
   For Forbes to go far, however, he must win over the likes of Don
McGuigan, 50, an AT&AMP;T communications technician interviewed at the
Mall of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of Forbes, McGuigan replied: ``I like his
tax plan, but I don't think I'd vote for him because I don't think
he's a viable candidate who would go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just his mannerisms,'' McGuigan said, sighing. ``But I do love
his tax plan and I do think about voting for him. But it'd be about
like a protest vote.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is it about him?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of his mannerisms, his look about him, it's
just his personality,'' McGuigan, a registered Republican, said.
``He seems genuine, that he really cares, but I just don't think he
can go anywhere after New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is likely to ``get his fair share'' in New Hampshire
after years of campaigning here, McGuigan said, but he himself
wanted to vote for a candidate who could win in the rest of the
country, and in this television nation, ``you've got to be more
Reagany.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire polls by several different organizations show that
Forbes has yet to win over a great many Don McGuigans. He appears
to be holding steady around 12 percent of likely Republican primary
voters. Two polls, however, one by CNN, USA Today and Gallup, and
another by WMUR, Fox News and the University of New Hampshire, show
a small bounce for Forbes after his Iowa showing, up to about 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Bodendorf, a Sears sales associate, when asked what she
thought of Forbes, offered an initial opinion that he had good
ideas. A friend of Ms. Bodendorf's who declined to give her name
promptly put in, ``Some people say he looks like a turtle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And he doesn't blink,'' Ms. Bodendorf added. ``But I watched
him and he blinks. But I don't judge him by that.'' Rather, she
said, she did not like his advertisements against Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, and his lack of governmental experience.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes did win over The Union Leader of Manchester, but even it
felt compelled to mention his lack of personal appeal in its
endorsement. ``Some would say he looks like a geek,'' the paper
wrote in an editorial. ``But he's also not a phony. Ask him a
question, you'll get a thoughtful answer.''

 MANCHESTER, N.H.: thoughtful answer. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, Forbes presents voters with a multipronged, idea-heavy
program of great consistency. He proposes ``freedom from fear'' of
the Internal Revenue Service through a vastly simplified tax
system, ``freedom to choose'' doctors and schools in his health
care and education proposals, ``freedom to be born'' for fetuses
and ``freedom to be secure'' with his plan to have people invest in
their own retirement accounts rather than pay into a great Social
Security pool.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas outweigh persona for supporters. Donna Ballard, a
former member of the Texas State Board of Education, who is backing
Forbes and publicly denouncing Bush's education record, called
Forbes the only candidate who had sought to learn the truth about
the state of education in Texas and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   She added, tellingly, ``When I am with him, I get the sense that
his candidacy is more about the truth than the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Forbes supporters argue that the country has seen enough
politicians like President Clinton, whose great charisma obscures
personality flaws until they come to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see someone genuinely awkward rather than someone
with polished, slippery, lounge-lizard behavior,'' Duffy, the
aviation engineer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes supporters also emphasize that the awkwardness does seem
to be diminishing. At a Republican dinner on Friday night, one
Forbes volunteer could be overheard telling two women, ``He's not
the communicator, but he's come so far.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question lingers whether that improvement is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Sytek, the state House speaker, agreed that Forbes seemed to
have become much more comfortable speaking, but concluded: ``We're
a long way from his being a natural. It's just not his nature to be
as confident as a George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are who you are,'' Ms. Sytek said. But that does not mean
Forbes has no chance. After watching the camera pan the chamber
during the State of the Union address this week, Ms. Sytek said, it
is clearer than ever that in politics, ``you can overcome your
looks.''

PROVIDENCE PROBES FATAL SHOOTING OF BLACK OFFICER BY WHITE
OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: R.I.)  (jw) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After an off-duty black police officer was shot to death in
Providence, R.I., while coming to the aid of two other officers,
city leaders were calling for calm Saturday and demanding a full
investigation into the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal shooting of the officer, Cornel Young Jr., 29, the son
of the Providence police force's highest ranking black member,
occurred Friday morning outside an all-night restaurant where Young
had been eating. After two other officers were called to break up a
fight, Young, who had been on the force for three years, came to
their assistance with his gun drawn. He was not in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, Aldrin Diaz, also had drawn a gun. When uniformed
officers ordered Diaz and Young to drop their weapons, Diaz
complied. When Young did not, the other police officers shot him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two officers did not recognize Officer Young as a police
officer,'' said Chief Urbano Prignano, in a statement. ``It appears
at this point that Officer Young did not realize that the officers
did not recognize him and were ordering him to drop his firearm.''
</P>
<P>
   An officer at the police station who did not give his name said
that the names of the police officers would not be released over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to an article in The Providence Journal on
Saturday, one of the officers shot someone last fall while being
attacked. State prosecutors later cleared him of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to us that these African-American officers should be
fully known by their fellow police officers,'' the Providence
branch of the NAACP said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement called for a grand jury inquiry into the shooting.
``Did Officer Young have the opportunity to identify himself or is
there a shoot- first, ask-questions-later policy?''
</P>
<P>
   As of 1996, the most recent year for which complete figures were
available, ethnic and racial minority groups made up about 36
percent of the city's population but less than 16 percent of the
police force. There are only 33 black male officers on a police
force with 462 members, the NAACP statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Montiero, head of the Providence NAACP branch and a
former Providence police officer, said the victim's father, Maj.
Cornel Young, head of the city's community policing unit and a
25-year veteran of the force, was very proud of his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He introduced me to him five times _ `Here's my son, he's a
Providence policeman,' Montiero said. ``His pride was sticking out,
like sunbeams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose so many to jail, and here we got somebody who took the
right path, and he wasn't safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Montiero described Young as quiet, reserved, a graduate from the
Classical High School, for college-bound students.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Almeida, a state assemblyman and former Providence police
officer, said that when Young came out of the restaurant: ``Some
people say he identified himself. We have witnesses who say he did.
Other cops say he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Almeida said that like his father, Young became involved in
minority issues on the force. He worked on his own time to recruit
other members of minority groups to the police force.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who fired their guns are white, Almeida and Moneiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could they not know who he is?'' Almeida said.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, 30, of Providence, was charged with murder in the
shooting, under a law stating that anyone committing a crime in
which someone is killed is responsible for that death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Young worked in Pawtucket for 900 hours as a volunteer
with impoverished school children, with the AmeriCorps national
service program. He joined the police force the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a really nice kid. I have four daughters, and I would
introduce him to one of my daughters,'' Almeida said. ``He was a
well-liked, physically big, good looking kid. He was soft spoken,
and always wanted to be a cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Almeida had announced on Wednesday that he planned to introduce
a bill calling for a study of racial profiling by state police
during traffic stops.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The coaching staff of the Tennessee Titans spent much
of Super Bowl week buried in a bunker watching films, analyzing
scouting reports, drinking coffee and devouring pizza. George
Henshaw, the assistant head coach, looked like a man cramming for a
bar exam, his nose deep in a playbook. His job: make sure running
back Eddie George has lots of gorgeous holes in the St. Louis Rams'
line to scamper through.
</P>
<P>
   Henshaw, one of the most dedicated coaches in pro football,
slept a total of about 10 hours between Sunday and late Tuesday
night, helping to put the game plan in place. He spent a
significant amount of time reviewing in his mind a single play, one
the Titans will run over and over.
</P>
<P>
   The play is called Unit Right-14 Gut. If the Titans get their
bread-and-butter play cranking, they can control the game and the
clock, and, most important, keep the vaunted St. Louis offense off
the field. If the Rams shut George down, it could be bombs away for
St. Louis and a high-scoring contest, something Tennessee does not
want.
</P>
<P>
   Henshaw is in charge of Tennessee's running game, and has helped
transform the Titans into one of the most prolific rushing units in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to establish the running game,'' Henshaw said,
``and that is one of our best plays. It will be the key for us.
Most of the teams we watched play the Rams, by the end of the first
quarter, the Rams were playing with a two-touchdown lead. We don't
want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher was more blunt. ``In order for us to
win this ballgame,'' he said, ``Eddie must have an MVP type of
game. There's no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When George falls into a deep sleep the night before a game,
visions of 14 Gut are dancing in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he likes to put the pressure on me,'' George said of
Fisher. ``I'm just looking to do my job and put the offense in
position to score some points. If I put up MVP-type numbers, so be
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few teams in pro football run their base running play with the
kind of precision and discipline that the Titans do. With a
powerful, veteran offensive line that can handle the most
complicated blocking schemes, a power runner in the 6-foot-3-inch,
240-pound George, who has great vision and can skip from hole to
hole, and not to mention wide receivers that are outstanding
blockers, it is no wonder that 14 Gut is so formidable.
</P>
<P>
   George just completed his best regular season as a pro, carrying
the ball 320 times for 1,304 yards, averaging 4.1 yards a carry. He
joined Barry Sanders, Eric Dickerson and Earl Campbell as the only
backs to gain at least 1,200 rushing yards in each of their first
four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A chunk of those yards came from 14 Gut. The team's favorite
rushing play starts up front with the skilled linemen, who mostly
use a zone-blocking scheme. Tennessee linemen don't block specific
players, instead blocking a certain area. Zone blocking is much
more difficult than one on one, and few players can master the
technique, but the Titans pull it off to near perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Part of 14 Gut designates which hole George is supposed to run
in and the appropriate blocking scheme. This is where George can be
dazzling. When a hole opens up, George usually attacks it with an
uncommon ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was on defense, Eddie would scare me to death,'' said
Bruce Matthews, the 17-year guard. ``Here is this 240-pound back,
all muscles, high-stepping right at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rams defensive lineman Kevin Carter: ``We've seen film
where he has just flat-out run guys over. Defensive lineman,
linebackers, whatever. He has a lot of power. We're going to make
sure we wrap up on tackles and hit him hard. Because that
tackling-at-the-ankles stuff won't work with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But George is also great at bouncing outside and possesses a
modicum of speed and quickness. In fact, George has two options on
14 Gut: he can go directly between the center and right guard, or
if that gap is closed, bounce left between the center and left
guard.
</P>
<P>
   When the Titans beat the Rams on Halloween, George had 68 yards
on 17 carries, not great numbers, but several of his cutback runs
went for key first downs. He slowly wore down the St. Louis
defense, and when the Rams stacked the line with eight and nine
defenders to stop George's runs, it was then that George became a
receiver, catching a 17-yard touchdown pass from Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw eight- and nine-man fronts all season long,'' George
said. ``But we do well against them because we run our base plays
well and we stick with them. I'm just patient and wait for things
to open up.''
</P>
<P>
   Another basic Titans running play helped get them to the Super
Bowl. It is called 17 Switch and is a version of the Washington
Redskins' old countertrey play, in which a guard and tackle pulled
and George burst through the hole up the middle. It produced a
68-yard touchdown run early in the second half of the playoff game
against the Indianapolis Colts that broke the game wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage George and Titans. Good blocking up front, strong
running by George and a critical block by wide receiver Yancy
Thigpen in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee will run a number of running plays against St. Louis,
but the offense will always fall back on its main course, 14 Gut.
No one on the Tennessee team would have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we might see that play a few times,'' McNair said,
smiling. ``Just a few.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The St. Louis Rams are built in the manner of recent
Super Bowl champions from Denver, Green Bay, Dallas and San
Francisco. Those four franchises won the last seven Super Bowls
with offenses that sparkled like diamonds and with defenses that
many fans tossed aside like bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Offenses dressed in silk.
</P>
<P>
   Defenses adorned in polyester.
</P>
<P>
   But like those champions, the Rams know that beneath the surface
their defense is a jewel, a trendsetter. It led the league in
rushing defense, allowing an average of only 74.3 rushing yards a
game. It has not allowed a 100-yard rusher in its last 18 games. It
tied Jacksonville for most sacks with 57. The Rams' 242 points were
the fewest allowed with the exception of three other teams. It
scored a touchdown on a fumble return, seven more on interceptions
and scored a safety. Two Rams defenders, end Kevin Carter and
cornerback Todd Lyght, are Pro Bowlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are confident in Super Bowl XXXIV that their offense
can continue its spellbinding production against the Tennessee
Titans. If not, they are certain that their defense can vault to
the forefront and win this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``For at least the last five years we had been a defensive team
with no offense,'' Rams safety Keith Lyle said. ``On offense, we
used to fumble the ball away in the end zone, throw it away or just
break down and wind up shut down. We lost a lot of 17-10 type of
games. Now, with the offense we have, and the defense, too, we are
in the Super Bowl. Our defense is willing to give up any glory to
win this Super Bowl. We are also willing to make the plays to win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' defensive scheme is the creation of the team's former
defensive coordinator Bud Carson, who is retired from coaching but
has been a longtime respected defensive guru.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme is based on confusion, on throwing kinks into the
opponent's offense. On every snap, the Rams want to give an offense
a different look. The defense is in constant motion, providing
different mixes. It wants a quarterback to have to make more than
one pre-snap read, and then several post-snap reads. The Rams have
been known to use as many as 12 checks, or alterations, before the
snap on some plays.
</P>
<P>
   It is a complex defense with as many if not more packages than
the Rams' big-play offensive scheme. It takes time to learn this
defense; some Rams said it took at least two years to completely
know it. Though the base defensive alignment is four down linemen
and three linebackers, the Rams' defense will use the 3-4, the zone
blitz, any formation to pressure the quarterback. It tries to gain
a pass rush with its talented four. If that is not enough, it will
bring a fifth pass rusher. Then a sixth. Even a seventh and an
eighth. It will rush the passer until he is at least uncomfortable
in the pocket. This requires that the secondary provide solid
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Because so much activity is happening on the defense at all
times, the Rams require that each of their 11 defensive players
stay true to his responsibilities. That, in fact, is demanded _
that each player before even thinking of helping out in another
area be certain, first, that he has completed his initial task.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Giunta, the Rams' assistant head coach and defensive
coordinator, concentrates on the opposing passing game. John
Bunting, another defensive coordinator and linebackers coach,
concentrates on the running game.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Brown (secondary) and Carl Hairston (line) are solid
game-day coaches who are on headsets in Giunta's ear talking
strategy, personnel and tendencies. Todd Howard also serves as a
defensive assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the players learn this defense, they love it; it is
player friendly,'' Giunta said. ``In our last game against
Tennessee'' _ a 24-21 loss at Nashville _ ``we were more prepared
for Neil O'Donnell to start at quarterback and not Steve McNair. We
had to adjust on the fly. We're excited about the chance to play
this game knowing what to expect at quarterback. Jacksonville sat
back and didn't bring an extra pass rush on McNair until it was too
late. We won't do that. Of course, you can be there and miss the
tackle. We have always preached that the bigger the game, the
better you have to tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, Lyght and middle linebacker London Fletcher are the
defense's most talented players.
</P>
<P>
   Carter possesses size, speed and agility. He led the league in
sacks with 17. Lyght is supremely intelligent, a supreme cover
cornerback, is deceptively fast and tends to be involved in big
plays. Fletcher is a nonstop, ferocious hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But the four players on defense whom the Rams can least afford
to lose are Carter, linebacker Mike Jones, strong safety Billy
Jenkins and tackle D'Marco Farr.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is the voice and pulse of the defense and a key liaison
for players with coach Dick Vermeil. Jenkins should be a key player
on Sunday because he must help contain McNair in the pocket. He and
cornerback Devin Bush are the first two the Rams add to their pass
rush to support the front four. Farr is quick and disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, all four Rams defensive linemen _ ends Carter and
Grant Wistrom and tackles Farr and Ray Agnew _ are mobile, quick
players.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are known for their offensive speed, especially on the
perimeter, but these defensive linemen are as fast and quick as any
interior group in the league. They stunt and spin and break down
running lanes and thwart passing lanes. They can be especially
effective when Carter is double-teamed because that means that one
of them may be overlooked, resulting in a chance to be more
overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough-man defense with 11 guys crashing toward the
ball, with every one having the opportunity to make plays,'' Carter
said. ``We complement each other. Sometimes offenses don't know who
is going to break free from our side. I do get double-teamed a lot,
and that's flattering and it also turns into frustration pretty
quickly. But I feel like even in that situation, I can still make a
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defense that especially knows how to play with a
lead. But our first game against Tennessee built our character. It
was the turning point for our defense this season. We got down,
21-0, in the first quarter and then in the last three quarters gave
up only three points. That's real character. We expect Eddie George
in the running game and Steve McNair with his arms and legs to be
the guys we have to shut down in the Super Bowl. That is our focus.
And both are the type of players where as a defense you have to
finish the play. You can't just throw your body and try to lay a
lick at them or arm tackle those guys. You have to tackle them to
the point where they are down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee cannot ignore Lyght and throw all day at cornerback
Dexter McCleon _ he made four interceptions this season. Just when
Fletcher looks tamed, here comes linebacker Todd Collins _ he made
74 tackles, fourth-most among the Rams. This Rams defense is a
jewel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is all about gaining advantage and gaining
leverage,'' Lyght said. ``And we do that by throwing you off
balance and creating mismatches in favor of the defense. It gives
us a chance to make plays and be creative within the scheme with
options, lots of options. I don't think there is a guy here who
would rather play in another defense.''

 &HT;    Jones denies rumors that he's hot to play for Miami, Orlando
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Eddie Jones rumor mill is in such full production
even Jones has tried to deflect some of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no truth to those reports whatsoever,'' Jones said.
``I've heard all that stuff. I knew it was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN/SI has reported several times that Jones would welcome a
chance to play for the Miami Heat. The Orlando Sentinel has
recently said Jones is telling friends he'd like to play for
Orlando. And ESPN has simply reported Jones, a native of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., would like to play for either Miami or Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Jones is saying the Hornets will keep his services if
they make the maximum offer allowed under the collective bargaining
agreement: seven years for $86.625 million. Other teams can give
Jones a six-year, $67.5 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that sometime in January or February, it'd
suddenly become a hot issue,'' Jones said. ``Everybody wants to be
the first to have the story. That's just the way it is. They want
to be the first and they know you're from down there so they say
you want to play there.''
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE PRACTICE FOR JORDAN
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan said he will continue to scrimmage with the
Wizards ``as long as my body holds up.'' But he would not allow the
media to watch so long as he was on the court with them. ``I still
love the game,'' he said. ``Don't get me wrong, I don't want to
take away from their progress, in fact I want to enhance their
progress either by watching what I do or telling them some of the
things to look for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would not discuss any individual battles but he was quite
taken with rookie Laron Profit's trash-talking skills. ``He's the
one who talks the most,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Countered Profit: ``He talked, I talked, he talked a little more
and I talked a little more, he talked some more and I left him
alone after that. I can only go so far.''
</P>
<P>
   HILL LIKELY TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   Wondering about Grant Hill's free agency next summer? All
indications are that the Pistons forward will take a one-year deal
to remain with the team. That will allow him to take a seven-year
contract worth $103 million in 2001, rather than an $86 million
contract he's eligible for now as a six-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   SMITS WANTS RESPECT
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits again sat out the fourth quarter against the Suns on
Wednesday, a trend for the season as Smits is averaging 12.8 points
per game, his lowest in nine years, and 23.6 minutes. Foul trouble
has been the problem. Said coach Larry Bird: ``Rik makes a lot of
fouls that are uncalled for. But we don't want him to sit back
there and do nothing. We'd like for him to be aggressive.'' Said
Smits: ``I've never gotten the respect others get and probably
never will. Maybe it's a case of being a foreigner in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING LIGHTS OUT
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks beat the Kings 112-104 in the closest the NBA comes to
the ABA these days. There were 187 shots combined and the Kings
squeezed off 37 3-pointers, making 11. Bucks coach George Karl said
of Jason Williams: ``With his shot selection, he should play for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   EASY PAY FOR ASKINS
</P>
<P>
   Miami is paying Keith Askins not to play, having waived him
before the season. So, when Dan Majerle was declared out four to
six weeks with a stress fracture in his left leg, Riley briefly
considered re-signing Askins, who is living in South Florida. A day
later, Riley backed away from the idea. Askins played 486 games for
Miami, a franchise record ... The Celtics are 1-10 when Paul Pierce
doesn't play at all and 0-2 when he gets hurt and plays less than a
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   NO BULL
</P>
<P>
   After all those years of providing big ratings for NBC, the
network has dumped the Bulls. The Bulls-Raptors game Saturday,
scheduled for NBC, and the team's Feb. 27 game with Detroit, also
set for NBC, were quietly dropped by the network.

 &HT;    Downcourt dilemma: When should Elliott return?
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They all want the same thing in San Antonio. It's just
that their perspectives are a little different.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Elliott wants to play immediately, to confirm that the gift
of a kidney from his brother will allow him to return to his
profession _ NBA player.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's doctors are openly encouraging their patient. They
want him to succeed on the court, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Gregg Popovich, the coach and general manager to
whom a healthy Elliott means a run at a second NBA title. He needs
Elliott's good shooting and defense.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma has been when to say yes.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' medical staff continues to work toward an agreement
that would have the former All-Star forward back on the court by
the end of this week. After a Wednesday morning meeting between Dr.
John Reineck, Elliott's physician, and the team's training and
medical staffs, Popovich said Elliott would not be cleared to
practice with the team until the doctors complete further research
and paperwork related to Elliott's medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich also said the Spurs are in the process of setting up a
support system that would allow the team to monitor Elliott and
address his specific medical needs on a daily basis. Barring any
problems, Popovich said both procedures should be completed by
Wednesday at the latest. Popovich also said there could be some
liability issues that might need to be addressed, but other Spurs
officials said the team likely would not try to block Elliott's
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to look under every rock to make sure we have all
the information we can possibly have,'' Popovich said. ``We feel
comfortable that we have a great process in motion that is in the
best interest of Sean and in the best interest of the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said he needs to scrimmage to better gauge his chances
of actually playing in a game, and he wanted to practice last week.
Dr. Francis Wright, the surgeon who led Elliott's transplant team
on Aug. 16, last week gave Elliott the green light.
</P>
<P>
   When Popovich refused to allow it, Elliott said, ``No, I'm not
happy with this, but I have no choice. Once the attorneys get
involved, everything . . . gets stalled. They have cleared me,''
Elliott said of his own doctors. ``Now it's in the hands of their
doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said last week there is little risk of Elliott suffering
trauma to the donor kidney he received from his older brother,
Noel. The kidney is well-protected by a thick layer of muscle
behind his right pelvic wall, Wright said. ``I stand as much chance
of hurting any one of my organs as I do hurting my kidney,''
Elliott said. Even after Elliott is allowed to practice, Popovich
said it could be weeks before he is ready to play in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elliott participates in conditioning drills. But it
could take a month of full-scale workouts before he plays, putting
his return date at early March.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott doesn't want to hear that. ``There are a lot of factors
going into whether I will play _ the coaches, myself. But I will be
ready to play. To be honest, I think I will be playing (soon). I
may be wrong, but I don't think so.''

 &HT;    HARDAWAY BALKS AT WALKER'S TALK
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Miami's Tim Hardaway gave Boston's Antoine Walker a
strong tongue-lashing after their game in Miami, chiding him for
his immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics forward taunted Heat players after a Boston victory
earlier in the season. Tuesday, Hardaway let go after Walker's
immature celebration when he drew a foul with his team trailing
90-66.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one,'' Walker shouted, thinking his shot would go.
Instead, it missed and he missed two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Antoine. He's not a bad guy,'' Hardaway said. ``He's
just an (jerk). I know it and he knows it. Once he gets over being
an (jerk), he'll be fine. Maybe hearing me say this will open his
eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the night, Hardaway was making a similar point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not mature yet. He's a great, great athlete. He has all
the skills you can put in a player. But his attitude is (messed)
up. Someone asked me why he's the least-liked player in the NBA.
It's because he has a (messed) up attitude. You've got to change
your attitude to win games, and he hasn't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker objected. ``That's one player's opinion. I mean, Tim's a
good guy. I don't have no problem with Tim, but that's his personal
opinion of me. Everybody's going to pose their opinion. I don't
want to get into what I think is wrong with him, as well. Nobody's
perfect, but I'm far from immature. I've been in this league for
four years and I know how to get it done on a night-in and
night-out basis.''
</P>
<P>
   BLAYLOCK ON THE BLOCK?
</P>
<P>
   Mookie Blaylock is involved in trade talks again. Toronto is
trying to push Doug Christie on Golden State for the ex-Hawks point
guard. The Warriors are interested but are trying to figure a way
to get Philadelphia's Larry Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock has no say in the matter contractually but he is
digging in his heels at the idea of moving his wife and twin sons
for the second time in six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to deal with no snow,'' Blaylock was quoted as
saying. ``I'm happy where I am. Toronto is not a city I would want
to play in.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie said he is trying to play through the trade rumors but
they obviously have distracted him: He was 2-for-10 in a victory
over Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Several agents say the Raptors have told other NBA clubs of
their intention of acquiring a point guard immediately. GM Glen
Grunwald spent Wednesday huddled with directors of Maple Leaf
Sports and Entertainment Ltd. at its annual board meeting,
apparently asking the brass to dip deeper for a player who can run
the offense, but they will have to give up one of their better
players to get a significant addition.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the names swirling around include Portland's Greg
Anthony, Milwaukee's Haywoode Workman, Orlando's Chucky Atkins and
Minnesota's Bobby Jackson, all backups.
</P>
<P>
   The team is privately admitting what has been obvious for some
time: Alvin Williams isn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   Denver coach Dan Issel gave Popeye Jones an indefinite leave of
absence so he could be with his brother, Tony Bonderant, an
Atlantan stricken with stage 4 stomach and colon cancer. Bonderant
vowed to be in Philips Arena March 28 to see his brother play the
Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Agent Herb Rudoy ripped Cleveland team doctor John Bergfeld for
refusing to put a pin in Zydrunas Ilgauskas' fractured left foot
last February. Ilgauskas had such a pin inserted last week. This is
the fourth season in five he has missed with broken bones in his
feet.

 &HT;    Olajuwon tired of getting tired
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pig Miller's backup in Houston is having trouble with
his conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon, the former All-Star center, has been coming off
the bench to spell the journeyman Miller, but is frustrated with
his lack of progress five games into his comeback from hernia
surgery Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has not been able to play more than 24 minutes in any
game. And he had to excuse himself after 21 minutes in a game
Tuesday night, then went to a lab on Wednesday to see if he had a
recurrence of the anemia that troubled him in the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Olajuwon said on Thursday after he
checked out OK. ``I'll have to get my bloodwork done to see if
maybe I'm losing the blood count again. It has to be something
because I'm working so hard to get into condition and there's no
way I should be that winded out there like I was (Tuesday).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little discouraging for me. When I was in the game, I
was winded throughout and I didn't get a chance to recover. The
game before that I was encouraged because my wind was coming back.
I had been working hard to get my conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has made 11 of 33 shots, averaging 5.8 points and 4.4
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   NO ROLE MODEL
</P>
<P>
   Delton Carter, one of the men entrusted by the NBA Players
Association with the care of troubled Mavericks rookie Leon Smith,
is a convicted felon. Carter, better known as ``D.C.'' at the
Westside Tennis Club in Houston where he works and the Houston
Rockets practice, was sentenced to four five-year terms in the
Texas Department of Corrections in 1990 for forgery. He served less
than six months before being paroled. He was convicted of theft in
1994. He was also convicted of solicitation of prostitution, for
which he served 10 days ... So much for an outgoing Maverick.
According to coach-general manager Don Nelson, if Dennis Rodman
signs a contract to play with the team this season, he will be
excused from most practice sessions and pregame shootarounds and
will be allowed to report to games a half-hour later than his
teammates. Rodman wants uniform No. 69.
</P>
<P>
   SINGING GARNETT'S PRAISES
</P>
<P>
   Count Utah's Jerry Sloan as a member of the Kevin Garnett fan
club. ``He's a great player,'' Sloan said. ``He always keeps
everybody under control. His understanding of the game is terrific.
... He's a tremendous all-around player. He's unique. The guy could
probably play four positions. How many guys can do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Rudy Tomjanovich called Garnett ``larger than life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People, I have no formula, no answer, to why we're winning,''
Garnett said as his team took its 14th in 17. ``We're just flowing.
It's a flow that I can't really even explain. It's almost like when
you're playing ping-pong, and things are just going back and forth.
But it feels good. I can explain that.''
</P>
<P>
   TRY THINKING ABOUT WINNING
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times' headline read ``Meditate on This: Since,
they're 0-2''. What does it mean? Phil Jackson took his Lakers into
their first short period of meditation last week and the club
dropped its next two games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was interesting, Kobe Bryant said. ``It was pretty
intense. We just went in there and did it. No candles or nothing
like that.'' And the effect? ``You're more aware. You wake up _
like even now when you just close your eyes and then open them,
things look a little different.''... Jackson says Ike Austin would
be a nice backup center, but Washington would have to take back
Travis Knight.
</P>
<P>
   LIKES BEING IN THE MIDDLE
</P>
<P>
   Nick Anderson's father was on hand when he scored 29 on
11-for-16 shooting as the Kings beat Charlotte on the first leg of
their eight-game Eastern swing. ``I'm back in the post, and it
makes my game complete,'' Anderson said.

<P>
   Leon Smith looked at his right arm, then at his left. As he
awoke in a hospital after a suicide attempt, he asked a doctor why
only the left arm still had an intravenous line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach said to take the IV out of your right arm,'' she
said. ``He said that's your shooting hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith wondered why a team that did not want him around would
make sure that his shooting hand was spared. The coach, the Dallas
Mavericks assistant Bill Peterson, said later that he could not
think of any other way to help _ besides offering a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Smith semiconscious that day last November at Parkland
Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Peterson was no longer observing the
big, strong 19-year-old with vast athletic potential, a
6-foot-10-inch, 240-pound Chicago schoolboy star whom the Mavericks
had selected in the first round of the NBA draft last June. Smith
was now a deeply troubled soul who had tried to end his life by
ingesting a half-bottle of aspirin, approximately 250 tablets'
worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't instruct the doctor to take the IV out, I just
mentioned it,'' Peterson recalled. ``People can look at that the
way they want, but at least I got in there to visit him. Where was
everybody else when Leon needed help?''
</P>
<P>
   The question has haunted, if not defined Leon Smith from the
very beginning. Abandoned by his father and removed from his
mother's custody when he was 5, Smith grew up a ward of the state
of Illinois. He moved from group home to shelter, forced sometimes
to rummage through Dumpsters for food with his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   But he could play the game. At Martin Luther King High School in
Chicago, he dominated opponents routinely enough to be considered
one of America's top hoop prospects. He had his mind set on
following the path of other prep superstars who skipped college and
went right to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But if Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett are models of players who
were mature enough athletically and emotionally to make that huge
jump, Leon Smith's sad and tumultuous basketball odyssey is a
cautionary tale _ one that is forcing the NBA to rethink how to
decide which teen-agers are capable of going right from high school
to the pros and what to do with those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   Smith stormed out of the gym during his first practice with the
Mavericks last summer. He fired two agents in three months. He was
arrested twice, had his contract suspended and spent 31 days in a
Dallas psychiatric center after his suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unfair to call Leon a poster child for anything
but Leon,'' David Stern, the NBA commissioner, said. ``All of these
young men are individuals. But I remain convinced, in a broader
context, that we need to disincentivize players who have other
options from coming into the NBA too young.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is in Houston now, living in a two-bedroom apartment with
a childhood friend. He is working out daily, hoping to earn another
shot in the league. The Mavericks are expected to waive him within
days, agreeing to pay Smith his full $1.45 million salary over 10
years. He is expecting to work out for two teams next week, but it
is unclear whether he will return to the NBA this season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and the people around him understand there are more
important hurdles to clear. And while many people who were close to
Smith in Chicago are busy assigning blame, Smith says he is ready
to accept responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it on myself,'' he said before a recent workout in
Houston. ``When I was in the hospital, I had time to grow up. I sat
in my room and I cried. I sat in there and thought about what I
did, and realized that things didn't have to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the executive director of the National Basketball
Players Association, and Purvis Short, the union's director of
player programs, have spent the past two months helping Smith put
his life back together. He still attends counseling sessions in
Dallas and Houston, and he has been off all medication for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family from Chicago have painted the Mavericks as an
organization not equipped to deal with such a sensitive situation.
Smith, though, bears no strong resentment toward anyone. Not even a
system that caters to impressionable teen-agers who happen to play
basketball well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did the best they could even when they didn't know to
help me,'' he said. ``I don't hold grudges. And I don't feel sorry
for myself. I'm here now. That's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had long dreamed of playing in the NBA, and he had no
shortage of elders and peers to help nurture the fantasy. In
elementary school, he once blocked 27 shots in a single game. In
his freshman year in high school, Smith says, he decided he wanted
to become a pro some day. He had grown nearly 5 inches over the
previous summer, to a gangly and uncoordinated 6 feet 9 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my teammates were teasing me, saying, `You can't block a
shot, you can't even dunk,''' he said. ``I couldn't. My knees hurt
so bad. But Kevin Garnett had just come out of high school the year
before. So I was, like, `Man, I bet you I go straight from high
school to the NBA'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After his junior year in high school, Smith attended Sonny
Vaccaro's prestigious ABCD camp at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
The camp is a showcase for many of the country's top high school
stars. Vaccaro approached Smith after the camp ended, asking him if
he wanted to be drafted in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Smith said, his voice thick with excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a done deal,'' Vaccaro told him.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Bauer, whose mother runs a group home where Smith lived for
eight years, said the conversation was a watershed. ``Once Sonny
confirmed it, Leon became obsessed with making it,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Competing for space on the wall of Smith's room were posters and
pictures of nearly every current NBA player who skipped college and
turned pro. Kobe Bryant, sailing in for a dunk. Kevin Garnett,
scowling while harnessing a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Smith led nationally ranked King High to the Chicago public
school championship his senior year, averaging 25 points, 15
rebounds and eight blocked shots a game. He briefly explored
enrolling at Fresno State and Rhode Island, but he feared that his
poor grades would force him to sit out a year to become eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be on TV,'' he said. ``That's all I wanted to be.
I wanted to get out of the projects. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith acknowledged that he made his decision without much
consultation. ``A lot of these kids have families, and their
families could show them how to handle themselves in certain
situations,'' he said. ``I didn't have a family. They can put it on
me, but if a child decides he wants to come out of high school and
play in the NBA, that's his decision. And if the teams feel like
he's ready, then I think he should do it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Smith's first agent, Dan Fegan, said, ``Look, Leon wanted to do
this. No one was going to tell him he couldn't. People may have
given him ideas about turning pro, but he wasn't pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was selected with the final pick of the draft's first
round last June. The Mavericks had not met him or worked him out.
The following month, Smith flew from Chicago to Dallas with his
only possession, a bag of dirty laundry. He moved into an
unfurnished, upscale apartment. With loans, he bought two beds, a
television and stereo equipment.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just threw him a little bit,'' said Doris Bauer,
the woman who ran the Lydia Home, where Smith lived from age 5 to
13. ``He was used to coming home to people, and all of a sudden
he's got a big, empty apartment with nothing. Leon was alone
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's first practice with the Mavericks ended with him
storming off the floor in front of television cameras. Another
player had been slow running sprints, so Donnie Nelson, an
assistant coach, told the group to run again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go run the sprints,'' Smith told Nelson, who asked Smith
to repeat himself because he was so stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson, the team's coach and general manager (and Donnie
Nelson's father) soon decided that Smith was too disruptive to be
allowed around the team. He assigned Peterson and Kiki Vandeweghe,
another assistant coach, to work with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, there was just a lot of frustration,'' Smith
said. ``When they first drafted me, they were telling me I had to
go somewhere else to get my game. I felt like they were cheating me
out of my opportunities. I put my name in the NBA draft, because I
felt I could play in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks decided that Smith was not ready to play in the
league, and told him that one way to improve his raw game was to
play for a year with a minor league team in St. Louis. Smith
resisted. His heart was set on following his heroes by going right
into the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson felt Smith's presence was so disruptive that he pleaded
with Smith's new agent, Matt Muehlebach, to make sure his client
did not attend the Mavericks' season opener Nov. 2 _ Smith's 19th
birthday. Undeterred, Smith paid for his own plane ticket from
Chicago and bought a ticket to the game from a scalper. The
Mavericks contend that a season ticket-holder gave Smith the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt him more than anything,'' said Short. ``The team not
wanting him around really set him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and the Mavericks have been accused of gross negligence
in their handling of Smith, especially by Smith's supporters in
Chicago. ``They treated him like a piece of meat,'' said Sonny Cox,
Smith's high school coach. ``Dallas did that boy wrong. They talk
about a support system, but they're trying to save their own
behinds at this point. They segregated Leon from everyone instead
of truly trying to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson defended the team's actions and insisted that there
was a support system for Smith. But he also conceded that he had
drafted Smith for one simple reason: Nelson and other Mavericks
officials were very worried that the Lakers were going to use the
first pick in the second round to acquire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the lack of big, talented people in the NBA, and
in college basketball, and if we didn't take him someone else would
have,'' said Donnie Nelson. ``That was the worst draft in 10 years.
If you're going to take a risk, the rule of thumb is, take it on a
big guy with some potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't delve into Leon's medical records, but we knew
about the issues and the challenges. It just goes against any
grain. You do not cut or trade talented young players, unless it's
for fantastic reasons. Leon had a 7-foot-5 wingspan. Looking back,
maybe you sometimes get blinded by talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Said one high-ranking league official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, ``They can defend themselves all they want, but how do
you draft a player without ever talking to him?''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure built on Smith. Friends kept calling him for money.
He felt the Mavericks did not want him around. Then he and his
girlfriend, Cassie Pondexter, a 16-year-old basketball star in
Chicago, broke up.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 14, Smith swallowed the aspirin tablets and was found by
a friend, passed out on the floor of his Dallas town house, with
green war paint smeared on his face. After being released from the
hospital, he returned two weeks later to Chicago, where he was
immediately arrested twice within two days for threatening
Pondexter and damaging her mother's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to tell anymore that I was hurt, because I
was,'' Smith said. ``When you care for somebody, you want to see
them. I had to get past that.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   People in the NBA are struggling with the lessons of Leon
Smith's saga.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just lay this off on the league and say it somehow
failed him,'' said Gregg Popovich, the coach and general manager of
the San Antonio Spurs, who had actually drafted Smith with the
intention of trading him to the Mavericks in a prearranged
deal.``They've got numerous programs to help them. But if we're
going to draft these young kids, individual teams are going to have
to install the proper support systems. Economically, emotionally,
psychologically or whatever, they need more support than we're
currently giving them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, the NBA commissioner, said, ``This is an area we and the
players have to look at again.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This isn't an expertise that we come to easily, but
we're determined to do whatever is necessary to ease the transition
of these young men.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Smith is trying to learn from his experience. On this day in
Houston, he looks at the rim and down at his feet behind the
3-point line. He is going one on one with Ashley Hunter, a mature
20-year-old with whom Smith grew up and who lives with him on the
recommendation of the players association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottoms up!'' Smith says as he releases a rainbow jump shot
from 25 feet away on the left baseline.
</P>
<P>
   The ball passes gently through the net at the Westside Tennis
Complex, where the Rockets practice in the morning and a
19-year-old trying to make a comeback practices in the afternoon.
Hunter retrieves the ball and tosses it off the backboard for his
friend, who leaps high and tomahawks it through the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm ready to play on this level,'' Smith says, pausing
between shots. ``I'm just working as hard as I can, just in case
somebody calls me up. I'm in Triple-A right now. I'm trying to make
it to the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Smith grabs the ball, turns and fires another 3-pointer.
All net. All better. At least for now.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: TITANS FIND THEY CAN'T GET ANY RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ People love the crying coach. The quarterback blows
kisses to his wife in the stands. The running back is the most
talented guy in the game. The offensive coordinator has been
certified a football genius.
</P>
<P>
   And the receivers have a cute end zone dance, which should be a
penalty, but they get away with it because they are the St. Louis
Rams and it's just about a NFL ordinance to be nice to them this
season.
</P>
<P>
   There's no mistaking it, the Rams are meant to be the stars of
Sunday's football show. For a week now in Atlanta, they have been
Super Bowl darlings, fawned over like returning champions.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee? They are Titans in name only.
</P>
<P>
   They have been treated like the obligatory opponent, one step up
from the Washington Generals.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Wednesday morning's news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, who are being housed in a small, stark hotel off a
highway, had to conduct interviews with reporters inside a
temporary plastic tent stretched across a windy parking lot. The
tent wasn't heated, and with subfreezing temperatures, various
Titans sat at tables delivering comments through chattering teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Titans coach Jeff Fisher wore a heavy overcoat. When he spoke
you could see his breath. After about five minutes, his nose and
cheeks were turning red.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing was the penguins.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, in a posh hotel built deep in a parklike
setting with streams and waterfalls, the Rams met with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   They did so inside a cozy, wood-paneled ballroom graced with
palm trees and wide tables draped in white linen. St. Louis coach
Dick Vermeil wore a golf shirt and regaled his audience with
humorous stories while sipping from an iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   The place was awash in the Rams' blue and yellow colors with
banners congratulating the team, and in the lobby, you could pick
up a copy of the Rams' official magazine. Inside the magazine, you
would find a map of the downtown parade St. Louis has already
planned for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, after all, are champions.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, so are the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   You just wouldn't know it in Atlanta this week, where the Titans
are supposed to be a football footnote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they're the story, no doubt,'' Titans safety Blaine
Bishop said. ``They've got the high-scoring offense, the comeback
coach, the hot quarterback. They're the team with the billing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's teammate, cornerback Samari Rolle, had an interesting
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we seven-point underdogs to a team we've already beat
this year?'' he asked. ``Explain that to me. Obviously, somebody
doesn't think we're that good.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Titans are good. They have a physical, attacking
defense. They have great team speed in the secondary and their
linebackers are quick, too. They have a bruising running back and a
230-pound quarterback who throws and runs well. The Titans even
have the superior kicking game, which could be the difference
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the Rams, they haven't had a losing season in five
years. They have been steadily building to this moment.
</P>
<P>
   They have come from behind in games and won playoff games on the
road. It may be difficult for the Rams if they fall behind by two
or three touchdowns, which they did last time they played
Tennessee. Teams that are used to coasting usually don't react well
when everything that had been so easy becomes difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, meanwhile, are battle-tested.
</P>
<P>
   They essentially played every game on the road for two years as
the Tennessee Nomads. They're not going to be easily distracted
Sunday, and the Super Bowl is the ultimate distraction.
</P>
<P>
   When you get right down to it, there can be only one reason the
Titans have been treated with such disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   It must be the uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   If you look like an Arena Football League team or a team playing
in Duesseldorf, you'll get treated like one. If your colors don't
match and your shoulders are swathed in a pallid blue, people are
going to assume you don't belong in a championship game. If your
logo looks like something yanked off a cartoon action hero, you're
not going to be favored in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean you can't win one.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one lesson learned from 33 Super Bowls, it's that
there is little that passes as true wisdom in the week preceding
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams won Super Bowl week in a rout. You don't get any points
for that in the game.

 &HT;    Prime deal for Philly
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It will be a while before a winner in the Keith
Primeau-Rod Brind'Amour trade can be graded, but the resilience of
Brind'Amour's legs are likely to be the deciding factor. He is
revered by his teammates and fans. But he is 29 years old, a year
older than Primeau, and is recently back from the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   There may be questions about Primeau's attitude and dedication
but there is no doubting his size and skill. And how about Roger
Neilson's new forward trio on the power play: Primeau, Eric Lindros
and John LeClair.
</P>
<P>
   Flyers general manager Bob Clarke now says he ``misspoke'' when
he said the team would not make any deals while Neilson was
undergoing chemotherapy. But it turns out, several players knew
something might be forthcoming. A week before the trade, he met
with a group of veterans, including Brind'Amour, to get the
go-ahead on a big trade if one became available. After the trade,
Brind'Amour said, ``Earlier in the season, Clarke said no one would
be traded. Then just two days (before being traded), he said, `What
I meant was, Eric Lindros would not be traded.' I told my wife to
pack her bags.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Brind'Amour, who spent nine years with the Flyers,
says he was ``in shock'' after learning of the deal. He played like
it. His first game with Carolina resulted in one shot on goal, a
minus-one rating and three minor penalties. ``The worst game of my
career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CLARKE DEFENDS PAYROLL
</P>
<P>
   The deal was held up for a few days because the Flyers did not
want to part with prospect goalie Jean-Marc Pelletier. ... Clarke,
fending off attacks about the Flyers' skyrocketing payroll: ``I'm
not in competition with (the Rangers') Neil Smith at all. ... It's
almost as if we are trying to operate under a form of socialism. If
you only draw 8,000 people, and only take in $100,000 a game, then
I'm supposed to reduce my roster? Am I supposed to reduce the
number of my players so that I'm the same as you? We (the Flyers)
take in enough revenue to pay our players. Same as Detroit, New
York, some of the top franchises. And we sell out everywhere we go.
So should we lower our payroll so that we can become a lousy team,
so we don't fill our building and don't draw on the road? How's
that help the NHL?'' ... More from Clarke: ``It's interesting to me
that everybody is applauding Carolina, Ottawa and those guys. But
the reality is that these are players who make their teams better
and are better for the game.'' But when asked about Ottawa holdout
Alexei Yashin, Clarke said, ``Oh, I think Yashin's just a (bleep).
I don't care if he ever comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   MOVE OVER, BARRASSO
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh general manager Craig Patrick acknowledges for the
first time that rookie Jean-Sebastien Aubin, who stopped 28 of 29
Atlanta shots the other night, could unseat injury-prone Tom
Barrasso as the team's starting goalie. ... Ottawa wants to add a
physical defenseman and reportedly is pursuing New Jersey's Lyle
Odelein, who has been a healthy scratch two straight games. Odelein
met with Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello but denied asking to
be traded. ... Tampa Bay GM Rick Dudley (formerly of Ottawa) denies
trade interest in Yashin. . . . The Lightning's Chris Gratton
played in his 500th career game _ impressive, considering he's only
24. He has missed only five games in seven seasons, three of those
coming via suspension.

 &HT;    Dark days in Vancouver
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brian Burke has no complaints of the view and no
complaints of the job.
</P>
<P>
   The view was never expected to cause heartache. When the former
NHL executive accepted a job as Vancouver's general manager a year
and a half ago after failing to get assurances of his candidacy in
Atlanta, he knew the views in British Columbia would blow away the
miles of concrete outside his Manhattan office.
</P>
<P>
   The job? Burke knew the position of running the Canucks would
not be aesthetically pleasing to the eye, the cranium or the
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``No surprises,'' said the architect of one of the league's
worst teams at 14-24-10 entering the weekend. ``No one ever
misrepresented a thing to me about how easy or difficult this job
would be. I've got no complaints. We're having a hard time right
now, but I knew that might be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, in the middle of several storms when he handed out
suspensions for NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, has been equally
high profile in Vancouver. He inherited a team in financial straits
and one of hockey's most successful but combustible coaches, Mike
Keenan, who six months earlier had been promised complete say over
personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   Burke vowed he and Keenan could work together. Nobody bought it,
least of all Keenan. He was gone by the All-Star break last season.
Burke replaced Keenan with Marc Crawford, the former Stanley
Cup-winning coach in Colorado who had found himself unemployed
after ensuing playoff failures and a contractual showdown with the
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile moves didn't end there for Burke. Pavel Bure,
one of the few reasons to attend a Canucks game, was holding out.
Burke eventually dealt him to Florida for a package of players many
deemed unimpressive. Burke said the key to the deal was rookie
goalie Kevin Weekes.
</P>
<P>
   But Weekes floundered and so did the Canucks. Earlier this
season, the goalie Burke had dubbed a key to the franchise's future
was shipped in a multi-player deal to the New York Islanders for
veteran goalie Felix Potvin, who has been in a career coma since
being shelved in Toronto for Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   After a miserable start with the Canucks _ 1-5-2 with a 3.00
goals against average and .888 saves percentage _ Potvin suffered a
knee injury and is out indefinitely. Statistically, he has been
worse than either Weekes (2.86, .898) or Garth Snow (2.56, .909).
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the team hasn't been much better. Vancouver lost
only six of its first 20 games (10-6-4) and had a cameo appearance
atop the Northwest Division. But entering Friday's game against San
Jose, the Canucks were winless in six (0-4-2) and had won just once
in nine games (1-6-2), twice in 14 (2-9-3) and three times in 22
(3-15-4).
</P>
<P>
   Mark Messier, who captained Stanley Cup teams in Edmonton and
New York, seemingly has had more injuries than goals in Vancouver
(seven this season, which is ninth on the team). His resume got him
into the All-Star Game. Messier remains confident of his abilities
_ ``I might not be able to carry a team to the Stanley Cup but I
think I can still lead a team to a Stanley Cup'' _ but this likely
is his final season with the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Burke shot down a report that he has been shopping Messier, who
has a no-trade clause in his contract. He called the rumor ``stupid
beyond description.'' But Messier makes $6 million this season and
Burke is not likely to exercise two options years. Expect Messier
to either waive his no-trade clause and move on before the trading
deadline or sign elsewhere as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Burke defends the moves with Weekes, ``I still believe he's
going to be a fine goaltender. But in my opinion, we couldn't wait
for him to emerge as a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Thrashers, Burke would have had a longer honeymoon and
been backed by deeper pockets. But then-team president Harvey
Schiller declined to promise Burke he would get the job over Don
Waddell and other candidates at the time Vancouver wanted an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, already losing several million dollars per year, took
another financial hit when the Canadian government did a U-turn on
potential federal assistance to six NHL clubs. Burke said, ``The
fact is, I could cut our payroll by $4 million or $5 million and
sell out the building every night and we'd still lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bright future. But Burke expected potholes, even if the
road was surrounded by snow-capped mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have difficult jobs, whether we're in Vancouver or
Atlanta,'' he said. ``But we're still a team fighting for a playoff
spot and looking to improve.''

 &HT;    New rule leaves mind-bending results
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the NHL went to a five-minute, four-on-four
overtime format this season in an effort to break ties, the belief
was that the highest-scoring, skilled teams would do best. So how
do you explain the fact that Calgary, the lowest-scoring team in
the Western Conference in the first half of the season and the last
to crack the 100-goal mark, is a league-best 10-1-5 in overtime?
Two reasons are Valeri Bure (the less-famous Bure) and Phil
Housley, who lead the league with five overtime points each. ``We
definitely didn't want to set an OT record _ we'd rather win the
games in regulation time,'' Bure said. ``But we'll take the wins.''
No other team has more than five overtime wins (Toronto and New
York Rangers). Four teams remain winless in overtime _ the
Thrashers (0-3-6), Los Angeles (0-3-7), Tampa Bay (0-4-6) and
Pittsburgh (0-5-4).
</P>
<P>
   GO WEST
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessarily a sign of what to expect in the Stanley Cup
finals, but Western Conference teams have been dominating their
Eastern counterparts this season. Only two Western teams (Anaheim
and Chicago) have losing records against the East, and the West
held an overall advantage of 102-82-35 in interconference meetings
through Thursday. Following are the best and worst teams (by point

<P>
   When the Phoenix Coyotes were stranded for nearly four days in
Raleigh, N.C., because of a snowstorm, food supplies got so low at
the team hotel that team publicist Rick Braunstein eventually
commandeered another guest's car and trudged to a food mart for
groceries. ``I heard they ran out of beer, too,'' goalie Sean Burke
said. ``Heck, we were ready to leave.'' The best line during the
ordeal came from All-Star defenseman Teppo Numminen, who said,
``This is like the movie 'Groundhog Day.' Is this ever going to
end?''
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE/UNQUOTE
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope this is not going to be the end of the Canadian
teams involved in our sport. I just hope that there is still time
for people in every level of government _ at the city level and
provincial level _ to try to help these teams. It's the blood of
the country; it's like a religion over there.''

 &HT;    Fedorov missing in action
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Sergei Fedorov is still trying to impress Anna
Kournikova, he's failing miserably. The Detroit center has missed
nine games with a concussion and a stiff neck, and went 11 games
without a goal until scoring Wednesday against Toronto. He has only
11 goals in 40 games, not commensurate with his fat contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, this season's been just up and down,'' he said. ``I
just think it's part of this business. I just always think I can do
better and bounce back and play even better than before the injury.
We have half a season to go. Everything is still possible.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Ken Holland is banking on the fact Fedorov has
been a strong postseason player. ``Maybe he hasn't played to the
level he's capable of over an entire regular season,'' Holland
said. ``But every year, he's at his best in the playoffs. So
history tells us he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   BELFOUR BUCKLES DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Dallas goalie Ed Belfour, snubbed for the All-Star Game, allowed
eight goals on 155 shots (.948 save percentage) during Dallas'
five-game win streak. ``I like proving people wrong,'' he said. . .
. Anaheim won twice in a span of 14 games and there are signs coach
Craig Hartsburg is having problems getting through to his players.
But he doesn't think his methods are the problem: ``(A coach) can
scream and yell but sooner or later it has to come from them. This
league is about players being hungry. I could do lots of things
that would work for one day or two. But if you want to be a great
team in this league, it has to come from in there (pointing to the
locker room).'' . . . Seven teams have gone West and played Los
Angeles and Anaheim on back-to-back nights, and each won at least
one game.
</P>
<P>
   FUHR RETURNING AS NO. 2
</P>
<P>
   Calgary goalie Grant Fuhr, close to returning from arthroscopic
knee surgery, accompanied the team on its current road trip. But at
best, he'll be No. 2 to Fred Brathwaite, who has started 16 of the
past 17. . . . Colorado coach Bob Hartley after a loss to Chicago
with rookie goalie Marc Denis: ``We left him by himself. We should
have put him on a wall with five guys with shotguns and it would
have been the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   . . . We were awful. We can't even spell defensive-zone
coverage.'' . . . The Stars' 22-game unbeaten streak against Los
Angeles is still well short of the league record. Montreal went 34
games without losing to Washington in the 1970s. . . . Detroit is
looking for a veteran defenseman for the playoff stretch. Then
again, who isn't? . . . Phoenix is 23-5-3 when Jeremy Roenick
scores a point, 1-10-1 when he plays and doesn't score.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDSTROM INVISIBLE
</P>
<P>
   San Jose coach Darryl Sutter benched Niklas Sundstrom three
games after the forward went 21 games without a goal. ``You can't
be a top skill player and be average,'' Sutter said. ``You have to
be noticed out there.'' . . . St. Louis is 11-0-2 against Canadian
teams. . . . Phoenix center Keith Tkachuk, after the Keith
Primeau-Rod Brind'Amour trade killed a deal that would have sent
him to the New York Rangers: ``It's been a long four days. I'm not
worried about (the trade talk). I've come to the conclusion that I
can't let anything distract me. You do that, you're just going to
go in the wrong direction. Whatever happens, happens.''

   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ A gun shop owner here sells bumper stickers
demanding her conviction, while just a few miles away, a cafe that
serves vegan dishes alongside espresso helps raise money for her
legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   The woman at the center of this community's rift is Sara Jane
Olson, 52, known in the 1960s as Kathleen Soliah, a member of the
radical Symbionese Liberation Army. For the last two decades, she
has lived in St. Paul as a doctor's wife and the mother of three,
known for her fine cooking and as a stage actress. But last summer
the FBI found her and charged her with conspiracy to commit murder
in an SLA bombing plot. Since then, Ms. Olson has been
simultaneously embraced and reviled by neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put her in the same category as Timmy McVeigh or the
Unabomber, the only difference being that her bomb didn't go off,''
said Mark Koscielski, owner of a gun shop that sells ``Fight
Terrorism _ Jail Kathleen'' bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olson, who legally changed her name from Soliah, is accused
of trying to blow up two Los Angeles police cars in 1975 to avenge
the deaths of six SLA members, who had been killed in a police
shootout a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI says Ms. Olson joined the leftist paramilitary group
soon after it kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst in 1974.
Ms. Hearst will be a reluctant witness against Ms. Olson when her
trial begins, probably in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olson, who is free on bail, moved to California in January
to await the beginning of her trial, leaving clashing ideas about
justice and forgiveness in her wake.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are Koscielski and others, who are bothered by Ms.
Olson's apparent refusal to take her case seriously. They are
offended by a cookbook Ms. Olson wrote last summer to raise money
for her defense, while being held in a Los Angeles jail after her
arrest: ``Serving Time: America's Most Wanted Recipes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the cover is a photograph of her standing in front of a
target, essentially mocking the crime she is charged with, said
Koscielski, who, like many of her detractors, refers to her as
Kathleen Soliah. Her defenders, some of whom encouraged her to
write the cookbook, stand by Ms. Olson, saying that for 20 years,
she has been an outstanding member of their community and society
in general. The cookbook had to be controversial to draw attention
to her plight, they say. So far, 900 copies of the book, which
includes recipes for dishes with names like ``funeral punch,'' have
sold for $21 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's facing a serious situation, and you've got to have a
break from that. There has to be some relief,'' said Mary Ellen
Kaluza, a friend of Ms. Olson's since the late 1970s when the two
women worked together on anti-apartheid efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Her supporters are so ardent that 250 of them raised $1 million
cash to pay her bond after her arrest last July. Some even took out
second mortgages on their homes to offset her mounting legal fees.
Ms. Olson's husband, Fred, and their three teen-age daughters have
remained in St. Paul while he continues to work and the daughters
go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors say they are not surprised that Ms. Olson, who has
always embraced liberal causes, has received so much support in the
Twin Cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the rich liberals looking out for each other,'' said Greg
Lang, a Minneapolis resident who started an anti-Olson Web site,
Soliah.com, and who believes Ms. Olson, a Democratic Party
fund-raiser, has been helped by her political connections.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Ms. Olson received unabashed support from local
liberals, including a longtime friend, Andy Dawkins, a Democratic
state representative who donated money to her bail fund. Also
firmly in her camp are many women in their 60s, who ``remember the
1960s, and remember seeing their sons go off to war and not coming
back,'' said Mala Vujnovich, owner of the May Day Cafe, where Ms.
Olson had a book signing party in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would do anything for you,'' Ms. Vujnovich said,
explaining the widespread support for Ms. Olson, who was active in
community theater and the Minnehaha United Methodist Church while
she lived here. Her friends have started their own site,
www.saraolsondefense.com, where supporters can receive updates on
Ms. Olson's trial status and buy copies of the cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   Koscielski's sympathizers, who he said are not as outspoken as
Ms. Olson's because theirs is not ``the politically correct way to
think,'' include members of local law enforcement. A group of local
police officers bought 100 of his bumper stickers to hand out at
her book signing.
</P>
<P>
   Although her close friends remain her strongest allies, Ms.
Olson appears to have the support of many Twin Cities residents.
``The last 20 years have to count for something, you have to take
into account the fact she stayed clean,'' said John Hutchens, an
airport shuttle bus driver who lives in suburban St. Paul.

 &HT;    What Super Bowl LXXXIV looks like
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The final strains of the international anthem ``We Are
The World,'' warbled by Puff Granddaddy, faded as team captains
stood at midfield for the toss of the euro. ``We'll take whichever
side is heads,'' said Huck Manning, quarterback for Silicon Valley.
The universal coin landed, and the perplexed parties stared at the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tails, it is _ I think,'' the referee declared.
</P>
<P>
   Manning raged. ``Hey, ref, it slipped off the side of your
thumb. Instant replay challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The referee cued up the video on the micro-TV dangling from his
belt and examined tapes from the One World/One Network's 100
cameras trained on the toss. Each view was inconclusive except for
27, 53 and 89. The referee reinspected those three in super-slo-mo.
The appeals clock stopped at 13:17.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flip stands as called on the field,'' he announced.
``Silicon Valley is charged with its first of 20 timeouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen television commercials later, toe met leather and
Super Bowl LXXXIV between the Silicon Valley M's and the Tokyo
Pokemons was underway. The bourgeoisie in the 4,238 luxury boxes
that ringed the field hurriedly lifted the right armrest in their
padded swivel chairs, exposing a keypad, and punched in their
perfectly legal last-minute wagers to NFL Bookmakers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The touts had made the Pokes a narrow favorite. No surprise
there, given that only its ownership conglomerate of Sony, Nippon
and Mitsubishi could shell out the lifetime contracts in such
demand by the most desirable free agents _ a hefty expense, what
with the average life expectancy now at 121. Silicon was the
league's po' boy, having changed ownership when the high-tech
industry crashed to a prescription drug consortium that paid out a
paltry $3.9 billion in player wages.
</P>
<P>
   The only disquieting factor for Tokyo devotees was quarterback
``Throwback'' Jack Jablonski, so nicknamed not only because he was
a throwback to a bygone football era of boozing and womanizing, but
also because, at 45, he could barely throw the ball back to his
tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback had attempted but five passes in the continental
championship final, when the Pokes rubbed out the Russia Roulette.
Stateside, Silicon Valley had shimmied out of the North American
playoffs by dunking the Coca-Cola Home Depot Falcons, devastating
metro Atlantans sprawled from just south of Chattanooga, Tenn., to
the outskirts of Macon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   As the M's huddled for the first snap, shareholders in the
publicly owned teams pulled up their left armrests, exposing a
panel of buttons, and tapped in the offensive plays and defensive
formations of their choice. The results were tabulated in a
nanosecond and flashed on the players' helmet shields.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pokes: a linebacker/safety blitz on Manning. The 'backer
hit Huck late and broke his elbow. Up in the Manning suite,
great-grandfather Archie, grandpa Peyton and father Beavis let out
a choral gasp.
</P>
<P>
   The offending player was flagged, banned on the spot from the
NFL for life, fined 5 million euros and sentenced to 10 years
without parole under the freshly passed felony law that forbids
touching a quarterback after the whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Along the sideline, as the Backstreet Good Ol' Boys performed
during a commercial break, doctors injected Manning with morphine
and applied a newfangled bone fuser to the elbow, then an
osteoblast stimulator to accelerate the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I go back in now?'' Manning begged. ``Pretty please?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' the doctor said. ``You're gonna have to sit out one
more series, until the bone is completely healed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the game disintegrated into a field goal swap
meet. Tokyo's Morten Andersen big-footed from 48, 63 and 76 yards _
while shanking from 18 and 21. Brandi Chastain III touched from 66
and 74, only to miss off the crossbar from 81 at the gun. Halftime:
9-6, Pokes.
</P>
<P>
   GrandKid Rock, Counting Crow's-feet and Metalmucil provided the
music at the halftime show, a re-creation of the millenium
celebration 50 years ago. In the Pokes' locker room, team
nutritionist Lawrence Taylor distributed perfectly legal pep pills
as Throwback pulled aside wide receiver ``Velcro'' Vic Green.
``I've got something up my sleeve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback noticed some suit waving an envelope in the face of
the Pokes' head coach, Dick Vermeil. This didn't look good.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil approached and said, ``Got some bad news, Throwback.
We're going with The K.I.D. in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   When Throwback noticed the suit high-fiving, low-fiving and
soul-shaking with Kristopher Ignatius Droppelman, it all came back
to him. That was attorney John-John Cochran, who successfully sued
the NFL so The K.I.D. could jump directly from middle school to the
pros.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback bit his tongue, which did not hurt because of all the
perfectly legal pain-killers in him. ``Coach, The K.I.D. has some
talent, but he's only 16. You really think he's ready for a Super
Bowl?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope, but I had no choice,'' Vermeil said. ``Cochran just
called a judge and got a temporary restraining order against you
playing on the grounds that we have no touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the second half, Throwback fumed on the sideline,
alternately consulting with the team psychiatrist to clear his head
and the team chaplain to cleanse his soul. When a strange brew of
jeers and shrieks rained down from the crowd, Throwback turned to
see The K.I.D. being hustled into an ambulance, his broken lower
leg dangling like the squiggly line in a capital Q, and the referee
signaling a safety.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the huddle minutes later, Throwback glanced toward the
giant scoreboard. Nothing. The indoor blimp that floated around
fans who paid serious euros to follow the action from above blocked
his view. Eventually, amid all of the blinking ads in five
languages, TV promos, political messages, videos from Super Bowls
past and the hourly winning lottery number, he managed to find the
score (11-6 M's), the time (4:52, fourth quarter), the ball's
location (Pokes' 18-yard line), timeouts (two remaining) and replay
challenges (three left).
</P>
<P>
   Perfect scenario, he surmised, to dispatch Velcro on a fly
pattern. The shareholders demurred. From their comfy chairs, they
sent in one low-risk play after another, each designed to get the
ball out of Throwback's hands pronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokes inched forward until it was fourth down, 2 yards to
go, at the M's 47. On their helmet shields: Pitch 42-Y. Another
no-frills run up the gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fools,'' Throwback told Velcro as the Dixie Hens sang during
the commercial break. ``The M's will stack the line. We're toast.''
</P>
<P>
   Throwback intentionally fumbled the snap, throwing the defense
off-kilter, then fetched the ball and lunged toward the invisible
laser beam that served as the first-down marker. He felt the beam
on the hand that cradled the ball as a tackler wrapped his head in
a boa constrictor squeeze. When the ball was marked shy of a first
down, Throwback spent his last replay challenge, in part so the
team's CT scan machine could be wheeled out to determine the
severity of his latest concussion. As the final musical guest, the
Rolling Stones, sounded their last note during the break, the
referee announced, ``After further review ... FIRST DOWN.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pokes lurched to Silicon's 23, but Throwback was out of
time, timeouts, replay challenges and patience. The clock blinked
0:07, triggering a flashback.
</P>
<P>
   In the huddle, Throwback pulled Velcro aside. ``These
shareholders don't know diddly. Look, they're calling for XZ-99.
That's you, a post pattern. The safeties will be sitting back,
waiting for the pick. Won't work. We're gonna try some deception
for a change, like James Bond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' Velcro asked.
</P>
<P>
   Velcro ran the XZ-99 route. The other Pokes stayed true to their
playbook's X's _ except one.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback faked a handoff, snuggled the ball next to his right
hip and rolled out. Up in the TV booth, the five announcers did a
high-speed computer check through their electronic Pokes game plan.
Nothing matched what they were about to witness.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden: ``Where's the freaking ball? Bam! Wait, it can't
be. Zoom! Not that trick play from the old days. Doing! A
quarterback bootleg.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Summerall: ``Who's playing again?''
</P>
<P>
   Outraged shareholders leapt furiously from their swivel chairs,
only to watch Throwback waddle into the house. Pokes win, 12-11.
</P>
<P>
   The first to greet him in the end zone was M's coach Jeff
George, screaming, ``You can't run that play. You're supposed to
run XZ-99. Our hackers saw it when they busted into your
computers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as I suspected, you cyber-thief,'' Throwback croaked. ``I
pulled the ol' switcheroo.''
</P>
<P>
   The next hour was a blur. It was just after midnight when NFL
commissioner Ryan Leaf handed Throwback the keys to a jetmobile,
the spoils for Most Valuable Player. U.S. President Chelsea Clinton
video-phoned her congratulations. There were questions from the
three newspapermen who were permitted into the pressbox with the
217 on-line Web site correspondents. Interviews from the 60
companies that had paid their way into the locker room to quickly
assess players for endorsement contracts. Cochran tossing a
restraining order in Throwback's lap to prevent him from signing
with Toys R Us, leaving it for The K.I.D.
</P>
<P>
   Someone thrust a microphone in his face. ``Well,'' a detached
voice said, ``what do you have to say now?''
</P>
<P>
   Throwback tried to push the words from his clouded brain to his
strained vocal cords. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, don't you have something to say to our special viewers?''
</P>
<P>
   Throwback wiped his eyes and saw the TelePrompter adorned with
the likenesses of familiar cartoon characters. Deep inside the
recesses of his mind, a lightbulb went on. He cleared his throat,
smiled and said, ``I'm going to Interplanetary Disneyland.''

AS ACCUSATIONS FLY, GORE ADMITS FLIP-FLOP ON ABORTION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This is a late add to the front page of The New York
Times.)  
(jw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY, N.H. _ Several days after he asserted he had
consistently favored abortion rights throughout his career, Vice
President Al Gore acknowledged Saturday that he had changed his
position on the issue since he entered politics nearly 25 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's reversal, on the weekend before the New Hampshire
primary, came as Bill Bradley, who has slipped appreciably in polls
in recent days, repeatedly assailed Gore's record on the issue in
some of his most pointed attacks of the campaign. Gore's comments
followed a question about a letter he had written as a member of
Congress, in 1987, in which he said it was wrong to spend federal
money for abortion, which he said, was ``arguably the taking of a
human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned Saturday about whether he still believed abortion was
the taking of human life, Gore was quick to assert that he had
qualified that thought 13 years ago. ``I used the word arguably,
and yes my position has changed,'' he said. Then, when he was asked
whether he stood by the idea that abortion was ``arguably'' the
taking of a human life, Gore added, ``I would not use that phrasing
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' wrangling over abortion came as candidates in
both parties, seeking to gain ground or protect their positions
before Tuesday's primary here, leveled some of their harshest
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who polls show is struggling to hold his lead in a tight
battle with Gov. George W. Bush here, sought to raise doubts about
one of the governor's strongest selling points: that he could
defeat a Democrat in the general election. McCain asserted that the
governor's backing of current campaign finance laws would leave him
with ``nothing to say'' in a contest with Vice President Al Gore.
Repeatedly, McCain, campaigning in the town of Raymond, drew a
contrast between himself and Bush, asserting that he would not need
``on the job training'' as president. Standing before a large
American flag at a high school, McCain suggested that he would be
much more effective in a debate against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to beat Al Gore like a drum,'' he said. ``Because
I'm going to turn to Al Gore, and I'm going to point my finger at
him and I'm going to say, `Al, your buddy Bill Clinton debased the
institutions of government in 1996.'' Repeating his sentences for
emphasis, McCain said, ``If George Bush is in that debate, he'll
have nothing to say. Because he's defending the system.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the onslaught of accusations Saturday, several
candidates beefed up their already hefty media campaigns with tough
new commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In the most provocative new commercial, Bradley sought to
portray himself as the only candidate in either party who has
always, unequivocally, backed abortion rights. ``This is the kind
of issue that you can't straddle,'' Bradley said in the
advertisement. ``You can't be on both sides; you have to decide
which side you're on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments Saturday contrast sharply with his statement in
a debate Wednesday night with Bradley in New Hampshire. Bradley had
asked the vice president whether he had been ``consistent'' on the
issue of abortion over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded: ``I've always supported Roe vs. Wade. I have
always supported a woman's right to choose. And let me say that if
you entrust me with the presidency, I will guarantee that a woman's
right to choose is protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the National Abortion and Reproductive Right Action League,
which supports Gore, has acknowledged that his stand on the subject
has ``evolved'' over the years, since he voted several times
against public financing for poor women who wanted abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But this record also includes a 1984 vote in support of an
amendment to civil rights laws to redefine the word ``person'' to
include ``unborn children from the moment of conception.'' That
amendment would have extended civil rights to those children, a
move that was strongly backed by abortion foes, and rejected by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statements mark the second time that he has backtracked
from a position he has taken in a debate with Bradley. In early
January, Gore said in a New Hampshire debate that he would require
that any appointees to the joint chiefs of staff fully support
allowing gays to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   After an uproar by military leaders, Gore reversed himself.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the drive to depict the vice president as a late
convert on the issue, the Bradley campaign released a letter
written in 1984 by Gore, then a member of Congress, in which he
told a constituent that it was his ``deep personal conviction that
abortion is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he does not name his opponent, Bradley's choice of
words offers a stinging echo of an infamous 1988 attack commercial,
``Senator Straddle,'' that George Bush used in the closing weekend
of that campaign here to depict Bob Dole as a fence-sitter on
cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing his commercial, Bradley said of Gore's position on
abortion, ``It's not an issue you can dance around, that you can
nuance. When someone makes the change from right to life to
pro-choice, that is a profound journey. I believe that there's the
obligation on Al Gore to tell us why and how he moved from one
position to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While McCain was on the attack, Bush's aides talked excitedly
about the recent polls that suggested Bush had closed much or all
of the distance between himself and McCain. And Bush, too, seemed
more upbeat and ebullient than he had been all week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his day by addressing an enormous crowd at Yoken's
restaurant in Portsmouth, where 1,000 people packed an oversize
banquet room, many of them having to stand throughout his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush was scheduled to appear at a country-western concert
in Milford that his campaign had organized. The Bellamy Brothers
were to perform, and his father and his mother were expected to
show up for what would be a first joint parents-and-son campaign
appearance since Bush's announcement tour in June. It was a sign
that the close contest in New Hampshire was coming down to the
wire, and that Bush was pulling out many of the stops.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain, campaign, by contrast, was moving aggressively to
hold its ground and unleashed a blunt new commercial. In it, McCain
tells voters, ``You have lost your representation in Washington.
It's been taken over by the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes also broadcast a direct new appeal for support,
declaring in an advertisement, ``We can make government smaller,
and your voice bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's remarks Saturday were particularly striking because
they represented a change in tone overnight. With Bush rolling out
endorsement after endorsement from Republican luminaries, McCain
accused the Bush of surrounding himself with people who had led
their party to defeats in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment that has endorsed George Bush now,'' he
said, ``are the same ones that'' had helped the party lose
elections. Seeking to stoke populist passions, he added, ``The
establishment is obviously in a state of extreme distress if not
panic because they know I will break the iron triangle of money,
lobbyists and legislation.''

 &HT;    `Air McNair' showing inconsistency
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is there any air in McNair?
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair has largely failed to live up
to the hype of ``Air McNair,'' a nicknamed that has followed him
since an All-American career at Alcorn State, where he passed for
100 touchdowns and gained 16,000 yards total offense.
</P>
<P>
   But since the former Houston Oilers made McNair the first
quarterback drafted in 1995, his arm has been erratic. In three
seasons as a starter, he has thrown 31 interceptions and only 41
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   As a pro, McNair, 6-2 and 225 pounds, seems to prefer to make
more noise with his feet. Twice he has rushed for eight touchdowns
in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see glimpses of (`Air McNair') all the time,'' Titans
general manager Floyd Reese said. ``It's there, but it comes and
goes. We don't have the consistency. But we know it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it be there today? The Titans may need it to keep up with
the high-powered Rams.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, 26, will become the second African-American quarterback
to start pro football's title game, following Doug Williams of
Washington in Super Bowl XXII in January 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``(McNair) is a football player,'' Titans coach Jeff Fisher
said. ``That's the most important thing. He has guided this team to
a championship because he is a football player. If he needs to
throw for 350 or 400 (yards) in a game, he'll do that, given the
opportunity. Most importantly, he finds ways to win.''
</P>
<P>
   In high school, McNair also played defense and tied a state
record with 30 interceptions, including 15 as a senior. Several
NCAA powers, including Miami, Florida and Notre Dame, wanted him as
a defensive back. But McNair didn't want them.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Quarterback) is what I wanted to play,'' he said. ``That's
where my heart has been all along. ... I had the opportunity to
play defensive back at many big colleges ... but I didn't feel that
was my best position to show my skills. ... So I went somewhere
where they would let me be a quarterback.'' Reese said the Titans
had a five-year plan for McNair when they drafted him third overall
in 1995. Unlike most high-priced rookies, McNair wasn't thrown into
the fire immediately. He spent two seasons as a backup to current
Falcons starter Chris Chandler, playing in only 13 games in '95 and
'96.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we held him back,'' Fisher said. ``He came in
because of injury. When we were eliminated (from the playoffs), he
came in when games didn't mean anything. He came in when games were
out of reach. He got all kinds of experience in his first two
years. We think that was valuable, obviously, before we named him
the starter his third year.''
</P>
<P>
   But McNair still looked inexperienced, throwing 14 touchdowns
with 13 interceptions in 16 starts in '97. His passer rating was
only 80.1 in his second year, as his team went 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claimed McNair left the pocket too soon to run and had
``happy feet'' there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you let what the outside people say (bother you), you're
going to tend to fold up,'' McNair said. ``People have been talking
about the way I play all my life. You can't let that faze you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily go out and put up big numbers. It's the
little things that I do offensively that make a difference in
winning and losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this season, Reese caught a glimpse of the strong-armed
quarterback he was expecting. Against Cincinnati, McNair threw for
three scores in a 36-35 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `OK, we're off and running,''' Reese said. ``He threw
the ball up and down the field and we squeaked out a win.''
</P>
<P>
   But then ``Air McNair'' was grounded again. McNair underwent
back surgery on Sept. 19 and missed five games.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Neil O'Donnell, who led the Steelers to Super
Bowl XXX in January 1996, went 4-1 in McNair's absence. O'Donnell's
success fueled more criticism when McNair returned against the Rams
on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   McNair threw two touchdowns in the Titans' 24-21 victory over
St. Louis. But he threw seven interceptions _ and no touchdowns _
over the next six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that work goes into the toilet,'' Reese said. ``He was
trying to make up for his six-week layoff in the middle of the
season and win games. It's very, very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair seemed to turn the corner against the Falcons on Dec. 19,
when he ran and passed for a touchdown in Tennessee's 30-17 win. He
threw five touchdowns against Jacksonville in a 41-14 victory the
following week.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he has accepted the Titans' conservative offense. He
is averaging only 24 attempts and 100 passing yards in three
playoff games. But he has rushed for 145 yards and three scores in
those victories. The Titans are 9-0 this season when he runs for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's getting enough respect for his arm,''
Titans tight end Frank Wycheck said. ``He is very selfless. He
doesn't care about statistics. He doesn't care about how we win,
just as long as we win.''

 &HT;    Who has the advantage?
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE RUN OFFENSE VS. ST. LOUIS RUN DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had the No. 1 run defense in the NFL, but the Titans'
best chance to win is on the ground. Running wide against St. Louis
would seem to be a mistake, given the Rams' speed, but Titans
running back Eddie George might be able to hurt the Rams between
the tackles. The Rams allowed an NFL-low 74.3 rushing yards per
game, but the stat is misleading. Often, they were so far ahead
that other teams abandoned the run. St. Louis faced 338 rushing
plays all year, 35 fewer than any other team. The Titans have been
solid running the ball in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: TITANS
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS RUN OFFENSE VS. TENNESSEE RUN DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to left tackle Orlando Pace and right guard Adam
Timmerman, both selected for the Pro Bowl, Rams running back
Marshall Faulk often gets plenty of room. Tennessee's 22nd-ranked
run defense has been better in the postseason, and the Rams'
running game has taken a dive. But still, the speedy Faulk is due
for a big day, and it might come running right at Tennessee rookie
left defensive end Jevon Kearse. If the Titans drop strong safety
Blaine Bishop in an attempt to aid the pass defense and help
first-time-starting free safety Anthony Dorsett, Faulk could go
wild.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: RAMS
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE PASS OFFENSE VS. ST. LOUIS PASS DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The Titans often appear fearful of trusting McNair to throw
downfield. The likely absence of wide receiver Yancey Thigpen, who
has a fractured foot, further cramps a minimal downfield passing
game. Meanwhile, St. Louis left defensive end Kevin Carter led the
NFL with 17 1/2 sacks, and a quick Rams defense might make life
very rough on the Tennessee passing game. The Titans have geared
their passing offense around tight end Frank Wycheck. The
craftiness that enables him to create mismatches against many
linebackers won't be there against the speed of the St. Louis
players.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: RAMS
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS PASS OFFENSE VS. TENNESSEE PASS DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The Titans could be in trouble unless they muster a pass rush
like the one that sacked St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner six
times in Tennessee's regular-season victory over the Rams.
Tennessee cornerbacks Samari Rolle and Denard Walker can't play as
tight in coverage as the Tampa corners did a week ago. The
Tennessee secondary is physical, but the Titans ranked No. 25 in
pass defense largely because their coverage skills are average.
Also, the Rams' passing attack was held in check last week against
the Bucs partly because offensive coordinator Mike Martz got
conservative. That won't happen today.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: RAMS
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TEAMS
</P>
<P>
   Rams kickoff returner Tony Horne led the NFL with a 29.7-yard
average, and punt returner Az-Zahir Hakim averaged just 10.5 yards
but can bust a long one. Tennessee return man Derrick Mason is on a
roll. He had an average regular season, but in the postseason he's
averaging 39.4 yards per kickoff return. The Rams were second-worst
in the NFL in kickoff coverage. Also, St. Louis place-kicker Jeff
Wilkins is ailing. Titans kicker Al Del Greco hit 21 of 25 field
goals in the regular season and seven of eight in the postseason.
Rams punter Mike Horan has great aim, and Tennessee's Craig
Heintrich is one of the NFL's best.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: TITANS
</P>
<P>
   COACHING
</P>
<P>
   The Titans' staff is young, energetic and closer to the players
than most staffs. The Rams' staff has been around the block a few
more times, with longtime NFL coaches Jim Hanifan and Frank Gansz
as assistants. Coaching is more important for preparation than
game-day execution, and St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil seems much
more in touch with his players this year than with the Eagles team
he led to the Super Bowl 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: NONE
</P>
<P>
   FINAL ANALYSIS
</P>
<P>
   The Titans would not have defeated the Rams on Halloween if St.
Louis had not lost three fumbles. Even so, the Rams nearly overcame
a 21-0 deficit and had a chance to tie with seven seconds left, but
Wilkins missed a 38-yard field goal. St. Louis also bore the burden
of carrying a 6-0 record to Tennessee. The chances of the Titans
getting a similar set of advantages are not good. The game is at a
neutral site, and it's on an artificial surface indoors, as is the
Rams' home in the Transworld Dome. The Titans were 4-0 on
artificial surfaces this season, beating New Orleans, Cincinnati,
Pittsburgh and Indianapolis.

IN MIAMI, DUELING DEMONSTRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ About 200 women, mostly Cuban-American, dressed in black
and white, with white ribbons attached to their shirts and carrying
white roses, stopped traffic Saturday in the heart of downtown
Miami as they marched and prayed in memory of Elizabet Brotons, who
drowned while fleeing Cuba in November with her 6-year-old son,
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty blocks north, along a poorer stretch of Biscayne
Boulevard, nearly as many men and women demonstrated beside the
Miami offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to urge
the Clinton administration to wrest the boy from the great-uncle
who is keeping him here and to return him promptly to his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sizes of the demonstrations were similar, little else
was. About 50 police officers held the marchers seeking the boy's
repatriation behind barricades to keep them off Biscayne Boulevard
and largely out of sight beside a shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, a half-dozen police cars blocked traffic to permit the
marchers seeking to keep Elian in Florida to proceed unimpeded and
relied on the women themselves to control their troops. No
crowd-control officers were in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The police, asked Saturday about their different handling of the
two marches, said no one was available this weekend to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cristina Ruiz, an advertising executive, who organized and
led the Mothers' March for Human Rights downtown, said the rally
was not a political demonstration fanning the Cuban exile
community's 41-year feud with the government of Fidel Castro but
one ``in honor of Elian's mother and any mother who has lost her
children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very American,'' Ms. Ruiz said over the blaring horns
of the disrupted traffic in front of the Miami Intercontinental
Hotel, a Biscayne Boulevard landmark. ``This is a women's march.''
</P>
<P>
   But anti-Castro posters peppered the air above the marchers,
along with portraits of Ms. Brotons, who was divorced from the
boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. A child in a stroller carried a
sign reading, ``Love is great. Freedom is greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, in demonstrations like these, the image of Elian as a
refugee from tyranny has been evolving into a miraculous creature
of God, described as having survived three days in the ocean
because dolphins encircled him to protect him from sharks. Mothers
and children held posters depicting Elian cradling a ceramic baby
Jesus. ``Elian knows Christ but is being denied,'' the words on it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Far up Biscayne Boulevard, demonstrators favoring the boy's
return to his father assembled by the Interreligious Foundation for
Community Organization, which is also known as Pastors for Peace,
wore lapel buttons with portraits of Elian. The picketers' mission
was wholly different.
</P>
<P>
   Their target is neither Castro nor Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's
great-uncle in whose house the boy is living here, but Attorney
General Janet Reno and the Clinton administration. For more than a
month, the administration has declined to enforce the immigration
service's repatriation order so Lazaro Gonzalez and the Cuban exile
community can make a case in the courts to take custody of him
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guilt is in Washington,'' one sign said. Marchers chanted,
``The INS needs to know. Send Elian home! Janet Reno needs to know.
Send Elian home!'' A poster read, ``Rip child from father? This is
family values?''
</P>
<P>
   On the picket line, Richard Becker of San Francisco, western
region coordinator for the International Action Center, a liberal
organization founded by former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, said
he believed most Americans shared his view that the government
should both end the embargo on trade with Cuba and give custody of
the boy to his father there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for the majority voice of this country to
be heard in this community,'' Becker said. ``There's a minority
here, Cuban-American, that uses tension and intimidation against
those who want to see an end of the hostility and the blockade
against Cuba. Those voices dominate despite the fact that they are
extreme right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another demonstrator, Andres Gomez, who is Cuban-American and
national coordinator of an anti-embargo group here, said: ``We want
a normalization of relationships. We have been working for that for
20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian,'' said a poster, ``is a metaphor for the madness of the
embargo.''

 &HT;    Montana, Lott make it into Hall of Fame
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Quarterback Joe Montana and safety Ronnie Lott, two
superstars during San Francisco's dynasty of the 1980s, were
elected to be in the NFL Hall of Fame on Saturday on their first
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Former Raiders defensive end Howie Long, 49ers linebacker Dave
Wilcox and Steelers owner and president Dan Rooney also were voted
into the 2000 class.
</P>
<P>
   Montana and Lott were the cornerstones of San Francisco teams
that won Super Bowls in 1982, '85, '89 and '90.
</P>
<P>
   Montana was MVP of the Super Bowl three times and never threw an
interception in 122 pass attempts in pro football's title game. He
still holds six Super Bowl passing records, including 11 career
touchdown passes, 357 yards passing vs. Cincinnati in 1989 and
1,142 career yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This honor goes beyond anything you could dream,'' Montana
said. ``As a kid growing up, you never allow yourself to dream of
certain things. You accomplish a lot of things in your back yard. I
won a bunch of Super Bowls by the time I was nine. You never dream,
or fathom the thought of the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana, who finished his career with the Kansas City Chiefs in
'94, directed 31 fourth-quarter comebacks in 15 seasons. He
finished his career with 3,409 completions, the third-best total in
league history, and 273 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Lott was one of the hardest-hitting and most versatile defensive
backs in NFL history. He was an eight-time All-Pro selection at
three different positions _ cornerback, strong safety and free
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, whose pro career ended with the New York Jets in '94,
still holds the NFL postseason record with nine interceptions, and
he twice led the league in interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said it was appropriate that he and Montana entered the
Hall of Fame together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of great years and over the years (we've) been
able to accomplish a lot of things,'' Lott said. ``What we
accomplished took a lot of love. You talk about love and you talk
about passion. You talk about passion and you talk about
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The class will be inducted into the Hall in Canton, Ohio, on
July 29. A selection committee of 38 writers and broadcasters chose
the inductees, with 80 percent of the ballots required.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox, 57, was a finalist for the first time since he became
eligible for induction 21 years ago. He was nominated by the senior
committee, which consists of five veteran members of the selection
board.
</P>
<P>
   Former Bills coach Marv Levy, Packers receiver James Lofton,
Steelers receivers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth and Rams
defensive end Jack Youngblood were among the finalists who didn't
get in.

FOR RAMS AND TITANS, THE SPECIAL TEAMS HAVE BEEN SUPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Sunday, which is a very big day, Frank Gansz is
evoking Goethe.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not Poetry 101 _ it's more like Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   But Gansz, a follower of the great man theory of history, is
unwrapping the big guns _ the historic voices with which, each
Sunday, he rallies his St. Louis Rams special teams to go beyond
the ordinary, to make something happen, to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goethe spoke about getting to your highest level,'' Gansz
says.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gansz remembered the novelist John Gardner, who wrote
of ``tenacity and purpose and discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alan Lowry is thinking clever: how does he get his
Tennessee Titans special-teams grunts to use their wiles and
bamboozle the opposition? Somehow, he has presided over a unit that
has created more havoc in the playoffs than it did in the regular
season. Goethe would have been proud of the Titans, too.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gansz and Lowry have survived the vagaries of coaching in
the NFL to reach Super Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lowry was virtually on the way out the door 12 months
ago, he acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Titans have never spoken of it publicly, coach Jeff
Fisher saved Lowry's job after the 1998 season. Lowry had been the
wide receivers coach, and the team's upper management was not
enamored of the job he did. He would have to go.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, though, asked that his old friend remain _ but with a
different role. He would switch to special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story's true,'' Lowry said. ``Jeff told me, `They want to
make some changes, and it's you.' It was very tough on me and my
family. But Jeff going to bat, Jeff feeling that way about me, I
had to show him something.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowry recalled that he and Fisher used to travel together to
work every day for a year and a half when both were with the San
Francisco 49ers in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans' special teams were not so special during the season,
though. They had a decent record but did not lead in any category
and were particularly bad in returning kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the kickoff return that preserved the Titans' playoff
run.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the Music City Miracle, it was Kevin Dyson's 75-yard
kickoff return for a touchdown following Frank Wycheck's lateral
that gave them the 22-16 wild-card victory over the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen that play only once before, and it worked,'' Lowry
said. He remembered it was 1982, in his days as an assistant coach
with the Dallas Cowboys, and he was driving home when he heard a
Southern Methodist-Texas Tech game on the radio. He heard the play,
heard it work and then saw it repeated that night on television.
Later in the week, he asked for films of the play.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years, Lowry kept it in the back of his mind. ``It was
really a one-shot deal,'' he said. ``What made it more unusual was
that 10 seconds before we went out, I grabbed Kevin. Anthony
Dorsett was not available. Kevin had watched the play, but he had
never practiced it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, his unit produced another one-shot deal. This
was the return of a free kick after a safety last Sunday that was
the crushing blow against Jacksonville in the American Football
Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   It turned into an 80-yard return for a touchdown by Derrick
Mason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about that play,'' Lowry said, ``was that in the
huddle, before going on the field, Derrick said, `We're going to
score on this play, and if you don't believe it, don't go out
there.''' Mason, Lowry added, ``has been attacking the returns
since the playoffs began.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the entire unit has been practicing in a fiery style,
Lowry said. ``It helped our confidence,'' he said. ``The players
believe they can make any plays.''
</P>
<P>
   If they do succeed, it will be against the unit coached by one
of the more famous special-teams gurus. Gansz has his punt
returners at a playoff peak, averaging 13.7 yards a return; his
kickoff returners are averaging 32.4 yards a return, including a
95-yard touchdown by Tony Horne. One weak spot for Gansz is the
condition of his sore-kneed kicker, Jeff Wilkins. During the
regular season the Rams led the league in kickoff-return average.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gansz says a few quotable sayings himself. Such as:
``Mothers hide their children's eyes when our punt team takes the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Do these millennium-age players really listen to this sort of
thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are no different from the Army plebes or the good
Columbia teams,'' Gansz insisted. ``Maybe the kids yawn, but they
don't fall asleep. It seems to me that if I were a young man, I'd
like to hear about overcoming adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   And was there a literary saying that could help instill freedom
from pain in Wilkins?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying,'' Gansz said. ``Stay healthy.''

 &HT;    CLINTON SEEKS TO RESUME FREE TRADE TALKS
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland President Clinton pledged Saturday to press
for a new global round of trade talks despite strong opposition
from some of his fellow Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton warned the world's corporate elite, who have
gathered for a week-long retreat here, that their campaign for
freer trade will fail unless they become more open in their
dealings. And he urged them to make certain the poor share in the
wealth that can flow from open markets.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to recover from last November's debacle in Seattle,
where the trade talks collapsed amid violent demonstrations, the
president told some 1,500 members of the World Economic Forum:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those who heard a wake-up call on the streets of
Seattle got the right message. But those who say we should freeze
or disband the (World Trade Organization) are dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Clinton's hour-long speech, the streets of Davos,
an Alpine ski resort, echoed the Seattle protest in miniature. Amid
a sudden snowstorm, police struggled with hundreds of demonstrators
who smashed car windows and sprayed paint about a mile from the
four-star hotel where Clinton met briefly with other world leaders
and a select group of chief executive officers from the world's
largest corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The president got off to a bad start when the conference
organizers had sought to clear the packed meeting hall, at the
insistence of the Secret Service, so it could be swept for bombs.
For Davos, that was a first.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the executives, who are more used to giving orders
than taking them, refused to budge. ``We had to go through a
gauntlet of machine-gun totting Swiss cops and metal detectors,''
one of them noted. ``This is just ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated threats that the meeting could not begin unless
they complied, they continued to mill about until the organizers
gave in. They settled for clearing only the first five rows for
inspection so that many other heads of state, prime ministers, five
members of the Clinton cabinet and U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan could be seated there.
</P>
<P>
   After another 35 minutes, when Clinton finally entered the hall,
he did his best to strike a responsive chord with his diverse
audience, where Americans are in a minority. But they only clapped
once, when he said rich nations needed to do more to help the
debt-ridden developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his domestic political hat, Clinton repeatedly
complimented the forum for inviting John Sweeney, the AFL-CIO
president, to attend their proceedings. Sweeney also drew a special
seat of honor up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier for us to gather here, in vigorous agreement _
and I'm glad you brought Mr. Sweeney over here so we could have an
occasional voice of disagreement,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He supports our position on human rights but he wants to move
the process along this year and we don't support him on that,''
Sweeney told a reporter later, referring to Clinton and the bid to
admit China to the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton sought to make amends by working the hall,
shaking hands and getting his picture taken with those few who
stayed behind. At one point, he paused and told a reporter from
Washington: ``The overall economic situation just couldn't be
better. But who knows how long these good times will last? We have
to seize the moment while we still can.''
</P>
<P>
   In his formal remarks, Clinton drew laughter from his listeners
when he reminded them that ``denial is more than a river in
Egypt.'' Wearing a serious look, the president said:
</P>

increase in inequality (as a result of economic globalization) and
we should start instead explaining why it has happened and what we
can do about it.''

<P>
   Clinton made the day-long round trip from Washington for
essentially one purpose'' to plug his trade policies before the
world group, many of whom had paid as much as $250,000, not
including helicopter services, to attend. (The president's planned
32-hour trip was extended when the snow forced him to be driven
back to Zurich airport, a three-hour trip.)
</P>
<P>
   But he also used the occasion here to once more hug Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in public and to meet with him privately at
his hotel for 30 minutes. Afterwards, a White House official said
that Dennis Ross, a senior White House negotiator, will travel to
Israel on Wednesday to see where the Israeli-Palestinian talks
stand and to try to push them along.

   NORTH CAROLINA: RECYCLING AN AD CHALLENGE
</P>
<P>
   Remember that let's-shake-on-it shot of Vice President Al Gore
extending his hand and daring Bill Bradley to agree to forgo
running campaign ads in exchange for a series of debates?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley rejected the proposal as a political gimmick, saying he
needed advertising because he was the lesser-known candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's dare was not original. And neither was Bradley's
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago in North Carolina, John Edwards, a Democrat, made
a similar dare in his successful effort to unseat Sen. Lauch
Faircloth, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth said no, figuring he needed advertising more than
Edwards did.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes another North Carolinian, Attorney General Mike
Easley, looking for a political leg up as he and Lt. Gov. Dennis
Wicker compete for the Democratic nomination in this year's
governor's race. Easley says he will give up ads if Wicker will.
</P>
<P>
   Wicker says he's thinking about it, but worries, as did
Faircloth and Bradley, that giving up ads might cost him the
election.
</P>
<P>
   There's a what-goes-around-comes-around quality to all this.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1998 when Edwards issued his no-ads dare, the big names
on his campaign team were Harrison Hickman and Bob Shrum, two of
the Democratic Party's top political consultants. This year Gore is
relying heavily on them.
</P>
<P>
   And so, too, is the as-yet-undecided Wicker.
</P>
<P>
   NEW HAMPSHIRE: A CROWDED BALLOT
</P>
<P>
   Given all the hoopla about the New Hampshire primary, it may
seem that only those who can raise multimillion-dollar campaign war
chests have any hope of getting on the ballot. But, in fact,
anybody with $1,000 (the registration fee) can buy in.
</P>
<P>
   Come Tuesday, then, the New Hampshire ballot will carry more
than just the names of seven by-now-familiar Republicans and
Democrats. Also listed will be 22 candidates most voters never
heard of.
</P>
<P>
   It is an old New Hampshire primary tradition to run just for the
sake of ego, to yell into the wind when not even mother is
listening, to preen and strut when nobody is looking.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have fringe candidates, too. But tiny New Hampshire
tends to have more. It even has organizations, such as the New
Hampshire Historical Society, that clear space somewhere so that
they can hold a debate or two of their own while the big guys are
holding forth elsewhere on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   Few candidates and not a lot more voters show up. So why do they
run?
</P>
<P>
   The way Heather Anne Harder, a Democrat from Crown Point, Ind.,
explains it, she worries that there are too many ``hidey holes''
for politicians to duck into. This is her third race in New
Hampshire, and she vows to keep trying until she wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Took Gandhi decades to wake up India,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   To Mark Greenstein, a Democrat from Culver City, Calif., traffic
jams are a special national problem. So he proposes ``a special
Service Corps that shall be permitted to fly helicopters from which
servicemen can rappel to any disabled vehicle, secure it to cables
from the chopper and lift the vehicle off the highway to a service
station.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Mosby, a Republican from Red Bluff, Calif., professes to
be running because he needs a job. Simple as that. ``I'm in love
with a woman,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Taylor, a Democrat from St. Paul, Minn., says he is running
because everything is bad. He talks of paying off his campaign
debts by selling ambassadorships and, he goes on, ``if we get a
higher bid later for the same ambassadorship, we'll just replace
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Thomas Oyler, a Republican from Wichita, Kan. Why
is he running?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew you were going to ask that,'' he told an Associated
Press reporter the other day. ``I don't have a good reason. I guess
I'm just upset with everything that's going on and I thought I'd
give it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA: GOP SPLIT ON GAY MARRIAGE
</P>
<P>
   More trouble for California's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   It lost control of the governor's office, the legislature and
most major Cabinet and agency posts in the 1998 elections and, more
recently, its members have been squabbling over the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes one of its most prominent members, Ward Connerly, with
some more division. He opposes Proposition 22, the measure on the
March 7 ballot that would ban gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly is best known as the leader of the campaign that won
passage of Proposition 209, the 1996 California ballot measure that
outlawed affirmative action and sparked similar outlawing efforts
elsewhere around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support two people having the right to do whatever they want
to do,'' Connerly said on Thursday in a statement that also was
signed by Rep. Tom Campbell, a moderate Republican from Santa Clara
County who is probably the party's best hope to take on Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly warned that Republican support for Proposition 22 could
cost the party dearly this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have a more difficult time than Democrats because some
think it is written somewhere that we should oppress gays,'' he
said. ``Some people invoke the Bible and don't think it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Most top Democrats are outspoken in their opposition to
Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA: HISPANICS FAVOR GORE, POLL SAYS
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Republican support for touchy ballot propositions.
</P>
<P>
   A poll indicates that Hispanic voters in California are still in
a mood to punish Republicans for support of Proposition 187, the
highly divisive 1994 ballot measure that Gov. Pete Wilson, a
Republican, pushed to passage. It called for an end to government
benefits for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, some polls have been indicating that Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas is favored by more Hispanic voters than Vice
President Gore. But a recently released poll of Hispanic voters in
California, conducted by the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute of
Claremont Graduate University, found Gore ahead of Bush by a ratio
of better than 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics now make up about 13 percent of the California
electorate, the nation's largest and most important, and turnout is
on the increase. Both Bush and Gore have been making a determined
play for Hispanic voters there and in other states with big
Hispanic populations, like Texas, New York and Arizona.

<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ If federal prosecutors have their way,
Kristen Gilbert will be put to death in the murders of four men and
the attempted murder of three others, although the crimes she is
accused of were committed in one of 12 states that do not have
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths occurred at a Veterans Affairs hospital, which is
under concurrent state and federal jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert denies the charges and has been fighting Attorney
General Janet Reno's authorization last spring to make hers a
capital case.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed Jan. 20, Gilbert's lawyers, David Hoose and
Harry Miles, argued that trying to impose the death penalty here
``is a direct insult to citizenry'' of a state that has ``time and
again rejected the reinstitution of capital punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors declined to comment on the motion other than to say
that they would file a written response by the Feb. 15 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But David Bruck, a lawyer with the federal Death Penalty
Resource Council, said: ``The continual federalization of criminal
law is a retrograde development. It is politically driven and is
leading to a huge expansion of federal crimes that were perfectly
well handled by the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, 32, the divorced mother of two boys, is charged with
killing patients while she was a nurse in an acute-care unit of the
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northampton.
</P>
<P>
   A notice of intention to seek the death penalty submitted by the
U.S. attorney Donald Stern in November 1998 stated that 37 men died
during Gilbert's shifts between January 1995 and February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She is accused of injecting her victims with epinephrine, a
synthetic form of adrenaline that can cause a healthy heart to go
into arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said through a spokesman that he could not comment on the
deliberations leading to the pursuit of the death penalty in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Hoose said the local district attorney was well equipped to
prosecute his client and he has accused the federal Justice
Department of using racial considerations in choosing Gilbert for
capital prosecution. Three-quarters of those selected for federal
death-penalty prosecution in the early 1990s were members of
minority groups, he said, and Gilbert, who is white, helps ``make
the numbers look better.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, in a letter to The Boston Globe last spring, stated that
the suggestion that race played a role in his deliberations was
``offensive, unwarranted, and untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert is being held in the Hampden County jail outside
Springfield, where her trial is expected to begin in September.

   FBNSBOWL-PREVIEW _ ATLANTA _ (25 inches, developing): After all
the surprises of the regular season _ Kurt Warner as MVP _ it would
have been wrong to have ended up with familiar teams in Super Bowl
XXXIV. Denver going for a three-peat? Atlanta playing at home? No,
this is perfect. St. Louis and Tennessee. The Mayflower Bowl. The
Rams left Los Angeles and moved to St. Louis in 1995. The Titans,
then known as the Oilers, left Houston in 1997, spent one year
playing ``home'' games in Memphis and another year at Vanderbilt
University's football stadium, before settling into their new
stadium in Nashville last summer. And that was just the beginning
of the odyssey. For it to end like this _ Titans vs. Rams for the
first NFL title of the new century _ required everything from an
injury that gave Warner his chance to a lateral that is known as
``The Miracle in Music City.'' (Woods, Palm Beach Post). 25.

RAMS REACH BASE IN ST. LOUIS 
 (WITH BBO-NOTEBOOK)
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   First Mark McGwire; now the Super Bowl. What more could the city
and fans of St. Louis want?
</P>
<P>
   ``From my long experience in sports, I've always felt this is a
sports town, whatever the sport is,'' Bing Devine said. ``We
haven't had a chance to test this before this year. St. Louis was a
baseball town because it didn't have another sport like it with the
background. Now that the Rams have won for the first time and are
in the Super Bowl, it's a chance for sports fans to express
themselves and make themselves known.''
</P>
<P>
   Devine, 83, and a special assignment scout for the city's
baseball team, was a longtime general manager of the baseball
Cardinals and had also served as president of the football
Cardinals, the team that by way of Chicago preceded the Rams, who
play the Tennessee Titans Sunday in the NFL championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball Cardinals have had a glorious history that it
easily dwarfs the meager success of St. Louis' football teams. In
28 years, from 1960 through 1987, the Cardinals won two division
titles and reached the playoffs three times, losing their first
game each time. The Rams, by way of Cleveland and Los Angeles,
continued the Cardinals' mediocrity for four seasons, until this
one.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball team, on the other hand, has played in more World
Series (15) and won more (nine) than any team except the Yankees.
The Cardinals have achieved that record in spurts. They played in
five World Series from 1926 through '34, four from '42 through '46,
three from '64 through '68 and three from '82 through '87.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the great success in 1964, '67 and '68,'' Devine said,
``during the course of the '70s things didn't work. I was general
manager from '70 to '78, so if somebody has to take the blame for
it, I guess I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Devine, who was referring to his second term in that role,
recalled how the Cardinals had what he called dominant players in
their championship periods, citing Rogers Hornsby, Dizzy and Paul
Dean, Ducky Medwick and Stan Musial. But they have never had a more
dominant player than McGwire, and they have not won anything with
him. Nevertheless, McGwire and the St. Louis fans have conducted a
lovefest for two plus seasons and 159 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many people would capture fans the way McGwire did,''
Devine said. ``Even a mild baseball fan would recognize the home
run record and Babe Ruth, so he immediately did something most
people, even if they weren't fans, could relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans are the reason McGwire continues to play for the
Cardinals. When Oakland traded him to St. Louis in 1997, he planned
to finish the season there and then become a free agent. But he was
so taken by St. Louis, he signed a contract extension before the
season ended.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, McGwire has to share the city with Kurt Warner,
the unheralded quarterback who turned into the NFL's Most Valuable
Player and led the Rams to the Super Bowl in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to separate them and say one has made more of an
impact and is more of a heroic figure in the St. Louis area,''
Devine said. ``How many cities wind up with two superstars with the
kind of background they have? Who would ever believe the story of
either one?''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the story of St. Louis football isn't only the Rams, the
baseball story isn't only the Cardinals. The city, some fans
recall, once had two teams. The St. Louis Browns, who now play in
Baltimore, moved in 1954. The Browns died a slow death in St.
Louis, succumbing in their 52nd year after having finished in last
place (eighth) 10 times and seventh place 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   Creating their own kind of legend, the Browns won the American
League pennant only once. At the end of that season, 1944, they
played the Cardinals, of all teams, in the World Series. It became
one of the Cardinals' nine winning visits.

 &HT;    Slow Rams attack or get clobbered
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What will it take for the Titans to beat the Rams
today in the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Titans defensive end Jevon Kearse on a caffeine buzz?
</P>
<P>
   Rams offensive tackle Fred Miller on a banana peel?
</P>
<P>
   Titans quarterback Steve McNair finding a wide receiver?
</P>
<P>
   Rams quarterback Kurt Warner finding Jevon Kearse?
</P>
<P>
   Rams running back Marshall Faulk finding virtually nothing?
</P>
<P>
   Probably all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when an aggressive (Titans) defense meets a
wide-open (Rams) offense? Well, probably one of two things.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are either going to win or get winded. Either they
make life annoying for Warner with their barrage of blitzes _
achieving something along the lines of a six-sack day during the
regular season _ or they lose big. There won't be anything in
between.
</P>
<P>
   They also need to:
</P>
<P>
   1. Stop Marshall Faulk. At least some of the time, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rams can control the clock with him, forget it. Faulk
rushed for 90 yards in the regular-season matchup, a 24-21
Tennessee victory, and caught six passes for 94 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let him get going,'' Kearse said. ``You have to keep
an eye on him all the time. He comes out of the backfield and he
makes things happen. You have to know where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my biggest concern,'' Titans coach Jeff Fisher said. ``He
was our concern during the regular season. He's the guy you have to
stop. I'm not lessening the importance of other players in their
offense, but to have a chance, you have to minimize his big
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Get Kearse to disrupt the Rams' offense _ specifically,
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   OK, he's not Lawrence Taylor, as Rams coach Dick Vermeil pointed
out this week, but he still has the potential to draw attention and
make big plays, which is what Super Bowls are all about.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are Kearse is not going to get Miller as fidgety this
time around _ he was called for six false starts in the first
meeting _ so Kearse must work harder for similar results. Last
week, he failed to dominate Jaguars tackle Leon Searcy.
</P>
<P>
   3. Win the turnover battle. How did the Titans manage to win
three games with the Jaguars? They won the turnover battle with the
Jaguars all three times. The Titans forced five Rams fumbles in the
regular season and recovered three of them. A similar effort will
be needed today.
</P>
<P>
   4. Get the ball downfield. The Titans aren't going to throttle
the Rams. They're going to have to score points, and they're going
to have to get the ball downfield, not just throw over the middle
to the tight ends. With wide receiver Yancey Thigpen out, it's an
assignment that won't get any easier. Last week the Titans were
able to get 91 rushing yards from McNair, his sore toe
notwithstanding. This time that won't be enough to open things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be a one-dimensional team,'' McNair said.
``You want to be able to throw the ball. You want to be consistent
at what you do offensively and stay balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Make something happen early. Against the Rams at Nashville on
Oct. 31, the Adelphia Coliseum noise was a huge factor _ no
surprise, since it was amplified. There will be noise today in the
Georgia Dome, but the Titans won't enjoy the same crowd dominance.
In addition, with a Rams offense this potent, even an early score
might not be enough to turn the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody saw the first meeting between us, we put up 21
quick points and then they came back after halftime and put up 21
quick points,'' Titans wide receiver Derrick Mason said. ``It's
going to be tough, because those guys can put up points in a
minute.''

&HT;     BRADLEY ACCUSES GORE OF `TRICKY' WORDS TO DECEIVE VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley accused Vice President
Al Gore on Friday of the ``tricky'' use of words to create the
``illusion'' that he favors the registration of all hand guns,
creation of universal health care coverage and the protection of
abortion rights _ the cornerstones of Bradley's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley underscored his determination to wrest the Democratic
presidential nomination from the vice president, vowing additional
attacks on Gore before Tuesday's presidential primary in New
Hampshire. And he touted his campaign resources of almost $20
million and unveiled a far-flung travel schedule that includes New
York and Florida following the primary here.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley emphasized his courtship of New Hampshire's largest bloc
of voters _ the 37 percent of the electorate who are independents _
by showcasing the endorsement of Lowell Weicker, the former
three-term Republican senator and member of the Watergate committee
who bolted the Republican Party to run as an independent and win a
term as governor of Connecticut in 1990. Weicker has been mentioned
as a possible presidential candidate for the Ross Perot-backed
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Weicker urged New Hampshire's independents to resist voting for
Republican maverick John McCain. The populist, reform-minded
Arizona senator leads Texas Gov. George Bush here in the latest
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only independent thinker and actor here is Bill Bradley,''
Weicker told a rally in this remote community in western New
Hampshire. ``I make a special plea to my independent friends _
don't waste your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley later told reporters that he and McCain are at odds on
gun control, health care coverage and abortion rights, even though
they share a commitment to overhauling the nation's campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Bradley also acknowledged for the
first time that he had suffered another episode of irregular
heartbeat. Bradley said the episode lasted for ``about two hours''
three or four days ago. That would mean the incident occurred
either on Monday, the eve of the Iowa precinct caucuses, or on
Tuesday when he flew into New Hampshire before dawn to begin his
final push. Bradley lost the vote in the Iowa caucuses to Gore by a
2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance before several hundred people in Newport,
Bradley escalated the allegations against Gore that he began during
Wednesday evening's televised debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said voters should listen extremely closely to Gore or
else they may be misled into believing that the vice president
favors the comprehensive hand gun registration, universal health
care coverage and abortion rights that Bradley supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a citizen, you have to listen very careful to a
practitioner of the old politics _ very carefully,'' Bradley
warned. ``Because a practitioner of the old politics wants you to
believe one thing and says one thing when the reality is quite
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that Gore implies support for licensing and
registration of all handguns when his proposal merely deals with
``new hand guns.'' Bradley accused Gore of expressing support for
universal health care coverage when his budget blueprint provides
no money to achieve it. And Bradley said that Gore cites support
for the constitutional right of a woman to choose an abortion, when
Gore had an 84 percent anti-abortion voting record early in his
career in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley declined a chance to accuse Gore of ``lying'' in
response to a reporter's question. But he added: ``You don't want
to use the word truth, use bait and switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made the same point more strongly in earlier remarks to
about 100 people gathered in a senior citizens community center in
Lebanon, north of Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you listen to Al Gore speak, you have to listen very
carefully because the old politics uses words in a very tricky
manner,'' Bradley said. ``You have to look at every word and every
clause.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Gore had been using words ``in a tricky manner ...
so the illusion is created that he is there fighting for universal
health coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's use of the word ``tricky'' appeared designed to draw
implicit parallels with the nefarious campaign practices of
President Richard Nixon, forced to resign in 1974 in the fallout of
the Watergate scandal. Nixon's nickname among critics was ``Tricky
Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   William Ludlow, 75, of West Lebanon, N.H., said when he heard
Bradley use the word ``tricky'' several times during his
presentation at the senior citizens' community center, he
immediately thought of Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking like that doesn't show much faith in the other
Democrat in the race,'' said Ludlow, a Gore supporter. ``They're in
the same party; I don't think he should be talking like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates once served together in the Senate, Gore from
Tennessee and Bradley from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in subsequent remarks to reporters in Newport, denied
that he was accusing Gore of using tactics such as those used by
Nixon. Bradley said that it was ``actually a joke'' when he drew
such parallels during Wednesday night's televised debate. The
remark during the debate ``made the point, which just happened to
mention Nixon but it could have been anybody,'' Bradley insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year Senate veteran said that he was merely ``clarifying
the record'' so voters would not go into polling booths on Tuesday
``believing the misstatements and mischaracteriztions of my
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, asked about Bradley's latest charges, replied in
Portsmouth: ``I'm going to emphasize the positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore underscored his pro-choice credentials by releasing an
endorsement from New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, who cited the
vice president's ``strong leadership'' abortion rights, and a
letter from members of Congress who defended his position on the
divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, a Bradley spokesman, said the campaign has almost
$20 million available for the next five weeks of the presidential
campaign _ plenty to wage a Democratic primary challenge to Gore
into March, no matter what the outcome of Tuesday's primary.

   NH-GOP (Windham, N.H.) _ Arizona Sen. John McCain, showcasing
his differences with Texas Gov. George Bush, declares that he alone
``does not need on-the-job training'' to lead the nation. McCain
staged three town hall-style meetings with prospective voters as
Bush canvassed populous southern New Hampshire with his family in

to people who had been waiting for up to two hours to hear from the
apparent front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.

 &HT;    Warner expects the best, plays even better
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The phone in Jay Johnson's office in Lawrence, Kan.,
rings now more than ever. Media types from around the nation seek
his time.
</P>
<P>
   That's how big Kurt Warner has gotten: He makes his friends
famous.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson holds the distinction of being the starting quarterback
ahead of Warner for four years during their college days at
Northern Iowa. Johnson went on to become the quarterbacks coach at
Kansas. Warner went on to author perhaps the most remarkable season
in NFL history, considering his background.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awesome deal,'' Johnson said last week. ``To me, it
shows the power of taking advantage of an opportunity. That's what
Kurt did.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Warner is inconceivable. Yet, he is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what has happened to Kurt, to be where he is after
where he's been, is just unbelievable,'' St. Louis Rams linebacker
London Fletcher said. ``No one could have imagined this. No one.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner has moved to the top of his profession, being named the
NFL's Most Valuable Player and leading his team into tonight's
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play the game week by week hoping to get to this point,''
Warner said. ``When you do, it's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more amazing is that Warner got where he is from where he
was. ``I try not to take a lot of time to reflect on what I've been
through to get to this point,'' he said. ``But sometimes I can't
help it.'' Four years ago, after a college career at Northern Iowa
in which he got off the bench only in his senior year, Warner
worked at a grocery store stocking shelves during the late shift
for $5.50 an hour. Not exactly quality preparation for a pro
football career _ or the kind of wages to take care of a wife and
two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Warner said. ``But I stayed in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner worked the grocery store gig after hours so he could work
out and study football film at his alma mater. The work paid off _
sort of. He made it to Green Bay's camp in 1994, but was cut after
getting just 10 plays in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still not discouraged enough to relinquish ``the dream,'' Warner
landed with the Iowa Barnstormers in the Arena Football League.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of playing football in basketball arenas,
Warner made it to the Rams' camp but quickly was banished to NFL
Europe's team in Amsterdam. He played one year there, flourished
again, returned to the Rams' camp this season and landed the No. 2
job behind Trent Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I ever wanted was a chance,'' he said. ``Like most
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Green suffered a season-ending knee injury in the preseason.
Warner took over and led the Rams to a 13-3 record while passing
for 4,353 yards and 41 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Warner credits his previous seasons for his NFL success. ``Every
experience added to me as a player and a person,'' he said. ``So,
while there were times when it looked like the dream would never
come true, everything in the journey helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   The limited space of the Arena League stressed a quarterback's
accuracy, and the pace required a quick read of defenses. Now, an
NFL field seems wide open to Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams asked that Warner go to NFL Europe as a way of gaining
playing experience, even though the level of competition was not
comparable to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about the Arena League and NFL Europe is that I
got a chance to play,'' Warner said. ``I wasn't sitting around,
watching from the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, Warner, 28, did give hints at his ability
when he got opportunities. When Johnson graduated and Warner
inherited the job, he led the Gateway Conference in total offense
and passing efficiency. For the Iowa Barnstormers, he passed for
10,164 yards and 183 touchdowns in three seasons. In Europe for
Amsterdam in 1998, he led the league in passing yards (2,101) and
TDs (15).
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes advantage of his chances,'' Johnson said. ``When we
played together, we had a good relationship. He was really
supportive. We fed off each other in practice, pushing each other.
And I knew that if I was out and he got a chance to play, he'd make
the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he did not seriously consider making an NFL push.
But now, Warner's outrageous success has made Johnson wonder,
``What if ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot, seeing what Kurt has done,'' Johnson said.
``The difference between Kurt and a lot of people is that he would
not let go of his dream. And it's fun to know someone who is doing
what he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner seems less fazed about his accomplishments than others.
He didn't expect to be MVP, but he expected to be a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited him during camp,'' Johnson said. ``He didn't talk
about being the MVP, but he was confident that he would do a job
when or if the chance came. The chance came and what he's done
qualifies pretty substantially as taking advantage of an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Preposterous as it might seem, Kurt Warner's story could get
even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a one-year flash in the pan,'' Rams coach Dick
Vermeil said. ``I've never seen someone like him. And I've been
around this game a long time.'' Vermeil, 63, said, ``There's a
chance that people will say Joe Montana threw like Kurt Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach has been known to overstate in his enthusiasm. But
Warner has been so remarkably efficient that he at least has a
chance to do what Montana did _ lead his team to a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing that's most important in all of this,''
Warner said. ``Our team is winning. Statistics or awards don't mean
as much if you're not winning. That's what I'm most proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   He also is quite proud of the faith he embraced when it looked
as if being a clerk at a grocery store might be one of a string of
odd jobs to keep his family fed. Warner started attending Bible
study when he played in the Arena League. He later led the classes
in Amsterdam and now does so with the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's wife, Brenda, has the same faith. Her son Zachary, 10,
fell from her ex-husband's arms when he was an infant and suffered
severe brain damage. It was thought that he would not survive. He
did but had major troubles. He was blind and had virtually no motor
skills.
</P>
<P>
   But now Zachary is able to see, read, walk and talk, and Brenda
credits prayer. She was eight months pregnant with daughter Jessie
when she and her first husband divorced. She met Warner in 1992 and
they married in 1997, with Warner adopting the children.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, Brenda's parents were killed in a tornado in
Mountain View, Ark. ``We went through a lot together,'' Warner
said. ``Our faith has been tested, but we've hung on to it and are
better for it. Faith is a major part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has earned the faith of an entire organization. The Rams
believe in Warner. Significantly, he believes in himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how he got to where he is,'' Johnson said. ``You can't
do what he's done without believing you can do it. I'm a
quarterbacks coach, and I'm happy with that. He wanted to do what
he's done. You can't tell his story enough. It's unbelievable.''

BOAT-ROCKING BISHOP SITS DOWN AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Va., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Gushing with fond praise, the parade of deacons,
rectors, chaplains and other local luminaries of the Episcopal
Church took their turns at the dais of the Marriott Hotel in
Teaneck as the guest of honor squirmed and smiled in his chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mighty warrior,'' ``a voice crying in the wilderness'' and
``a simply marvelous man'' were some of the phrases they used to
describe John Shelby Spong, the bishop of Newark, who is retiring
after 24 years as one of the church's most outspoken, boat-rocking
leaders in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing purple and black vestments, with a lei of flowers around
his neck, Spong was clearly overwhelmed by the attention. ``If my
mother were here, she would have believed every word of it,'' he
said after the three and a half hours of speechmaking. ``I know I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1,200 people at Friday night's send-off were among
his most fervent allies, Spong, 68, knows there are probably just
as many Christian leaders glad to see him go, among them the Roman
Catholic archbishop of Newark, Theodore E. McCarrick, who once
called the bishop's northern New Jersey diocese ``a church without
morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Kelly, a columnist for The Bergen Record, marked the
bishop's retirement by gleefully announcing, ``Good riddance.''
Calling his tenure ``a sad example of misguided potential,'' he
complained that the bishop had spent more time on book tours and
public speaking than on ministering to the desperately poor
residents of New Jersey's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   As the spiritual leader of 40,000 congregants in 130 churches,
Spong has made headlines as a vocal champion of gay rights, a
supporter of assisted suicide and a theologian who has questioned
the most fundamental tenets of Christian theology.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking engagements around the world, in appearances on
``Oprah'' and ``Larry King Live,'' and in the 18 books he has
written, Spong has questioned the resurrection of Jesus, called
Saint Paul ``a self-loathing and repressed gay male'' and suggested
that the Virgin Mary was no virgin but a ``sexually violated
teen-age girl.''
</P>
<P>
   He has attacked the Roman Catholic position on birth control as
``an act of immorality'' and the Vatican's treatment of women as
``so insulting, so retrograde,'' that women should abandon the
church ``for their own humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   While his successor, the Rev. John P. Croneberger, 60, is
considered just as liberal on issues such as the ordination of gay
priests, he said he planned to have a much lower profile. ``I think
the clergy of the diocese are looking for a pastor, are looking for
a shepherd who will be present, who will be available,'' he said.
``I will be less of a national and international figure.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church, which has produced more U.S. presidents _
including George Bush _ than any other denomination, would hardly
be recognizable to another of its members, George Washington, if he
were alive today.
</P>
<P>
   The church now allows the ordination of women, its clergy is
racially diverse, and no one takes notice anymore when openly gay
priests are ordained. ``I lost count at the number of gay priests''
in his diocese, said Spong, who found himself at the center of a
national storm in 1989 when he ordained Robert Williams, who was
living with another man.
</P>
<P>
   Spong turned Williams' ordination in Hoboken into a public
event, even sending invitations to every Episcopal bishop in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The church's House of Bishops later voted to censure him, but
Spong had the last word that day and chastised the body's 160
members after the vote. A dozen bishops who had voted against him,
he recalled, came forward that day to say they would not have done
so if they had heard him first. The church has since come full
circle on the question of gay priests, in 1996 removing a policy
that barred the ordination of openly gay men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Charlotte, N.C., the son of an alcoholic man who died
when he was 12, Spong said his radical streak was spawned by the
Christian fundamentalism in which he was reared. During the 1950s
and 1960s, when he served as rector at a number of churches in the
South, he took on the issue of racial inequality, calling on his
Durham, N.C., congregation in 1959 to support the integration of
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, one of his first acts as rector of St. Paul's
in Richmond, Va., known as the ``Cathedral of the Confederacy,''
was to haul down the Confederate flag that flew over the church.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s he helped overturn the church's prohibition on
ordaining women. His diocese became one of the first to ordain a
woman, in 1977, and today, he said, at least a third of the
diocese's 283 clergy are women.
</P>
<P>
   A loquacious man whose Southern gentility sometimes gives way to
gruffness, Spong likes to be called ``Jack'' and says he hates to
wear the cope-and-miter garb of his rank. He has three children
from his marriage to Joan Ketner, who died of cancer in 1988. Two
years later he married Christine, a longtime friend who was working
as an administrator in the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   His years as a widower, he said, made him appreciate the pain of
loneliness and question the church's stands on homosexuality and
nonmarital relationships. In a 1987 report he called on the church
to ``open its eyes to reality'' and bless nontraditional unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it difficult to believe that the church blesses dogs
and the Virginia fox hunt, but can't find a way to bless
life-giving, lasting relationships between human beings,'' he said
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He said his main goal over the years has been to find a middle
ground between fundamentalism and secularism, saying the church
must find a way to accommodate modern science if it is to survive.
As an example of the ``new reformation'' he espouses, Spong said
theologians must tackle such bedrock beliefs as the Virgin birth
and Christ's ascension to heaven. ``Jesus rising off the earth?''
he asked. ``Try that on an astrophysicist.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his departure from the diocese, Spong said he would not
be retiring into oblivion. After turning over the pastoral staff to
Croneberger in a ceremony Saturday morning, he drove south to
Richmond for the first stop of a 17-city publicity tour for his
latest book, a memoir called ``Here I Stand'' (HarperCollins).
</P>
<P>
   This week he will begin a yearlong stint as a lecturer at
Harvard University, and his public-speaking calendar is booked
through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   And of course another book is in the works. ``Just because I'm
retiring doesn't mean I'm going to disappear,'' he said. ``You
can't shut me up that easily.''

 &HT;    Avoid turnovers in the rematch
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the Rams are going to win their first Super Bowl
today, there's no mystery to the first key to success.
</P>
<P>
   They can't afford to treat the football like a flopping fish.
</P>
<P>
   They went to Nashville in October the talk of the NFL with a 6-0
record, but it didn't stay that way long. They fumbled five times,
and lost three of four by Pro Bowl quarterback Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   That was some nice juggling, but no way to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans didn't have a turnover, and after charging to a 21-0
lead in the first quarter with the help of two touchdowns after
Warner fumbles, they held on to win 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   That was out of character for the Rams, who finished the season
with a plus-five turnover ratio and a modest 31 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Subtract the Titans game and the season finale _ in which the
Rams (15-3) had seven turnovers and a minus-five turnover ratio in
a 38-31 loss at the Philadelphia Eagles when reserves played a lot
_ and the Rams were plus-13 with 21 turnovers in the other 14
games.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, the Rams turned into ballhawks in the
second half, when they got 23 of their 36 takeaways.
</P>
<P>
   Besides avoiding turnovers, the Rams also must:
</P>
<P>
   1. Get back to flinging it rather than dinking it. After an
early interception, the Rams turned conservative in last Sunday's
NFC Championship Game. The Titans' defense doesn't have the
quickness of the Bucs', but the Titans are likely to play more
two-deep coverage than usual, mimicking the Bucs, and roll up
cornerbacks Samari Rolle and Denard Walker. But wide receivers
Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt and Az-Zahir Hakim and running back
Marshall Faulk provide matchup nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Hold their water'' and don't let the dam burst. The first
part of that is a phrase usually reserved for jumpy defensive
linemen. But in the first meeting of these teams, Rams right tackle
Fred Miller was penalized six times for false starts while trying
to slow Titans rookie defensive end Jevon Kearse. The Rams gave up
five sacks that day. The Titans' pass rush is good, and Warner will
have to throw quicker than he did on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   3. On defense, play the run foremost, and ``spy'' on Titans
quarterback Steve McNair. Titans running back Eddie George is one
of the NFL's best, and at 6 feet 3, 240 pounds, his size might be a
problem for the slightly undersized Rams front. Then there's McNair
(6-2, 225), who had 36 rushing yards and a touchdown against St.
Louis. ``When we prepared for them last time, we quite frankly
didn't believe that they'd throw McNair in there (he was coming
back from back surgery),'' Rams co-defensive coordinator John
Bunting said. ``He does present some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Run the ball better than they have lately. The Rams rushed 21
times for just 51 yards in the NFC Championship Game. ``You could
give Marshall Faulk the ball 11 times and he could have 11 yards,''
coach Dick Vermeil said, ``and on the 12th carry, he could go 80
yards.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Contain the Titans on special teams. The Titans have scored
on two kickoffs in the postseason.

 &HT;    A Ram tough victory
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By this time, every news conference that could be
held, has been held. Even to one about the coin toss. My favorite
coin toss is that staged commercial with the bumbling referee who
asked, ``Does anyone have change for a dollar?'' Let's replay it
today at the Georgia Dome, just for fun. Instead, you'll notice
there will be seven coin tossers and I can't wait to see how seven
guys toss one coin.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been asked over and over again triggering the
same weary replies. When Steve McNair was asked, ``Why did you
choose to be a quarterback,'' he said, ``Since I was a kid I wanted
to play quarterback.'' Every kid wants to play quarterback, but
only the chosen make it.
</P>
<P>
   After just three seasons in the National Football League, now he
finds himself playing quarterback in the Super Bowl, which his
coach, Jeff Fisher, says, ``Should gain him a little more
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kurt Warner was asked why he wanted to play quarterback, I
never heard it. It's rather obvious that playing quarterback beats
stacking cereal boxes in a supermarket, which was what he was doing
a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So we have reached the ultimate point, the Rams playing the
Titans in the Super Bowl. Not exactly the enthralling matchup
television would have craved. The combatants have the ring of Arena
League names, but that only reflects their itinerant lives. The
Rams have played in four different locations, Cleveland, Los
Angeles, Anaheim, Calif., and St. Louis, the Titans/Oilers in
Houston, Memphis and Nashville, Tenn. Both are veteran franchises
and both have been here before, in one status or another.
</P>
<P>
   As the Oilers in Houston, the Titans won the first two
championships of the old American Football League. The Rams once
were sort of the Buffalo Bills of the NFC Championships, lost four
in five seasons before finally making their one previous appearance
in Super Bowl XIV, losing to Pittsburgh right there in their back
yard at Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Since history has little bearing on what's on our plate today,
aside from our exasperating weather, let us move forward. In one
championship game, the point spread was 73 points, total
humiliation. The most humiliating score since the Super Bowl
arrived was 55-10, when the 49ers beat the Broncos in New Orleans.
This one appears to be tighter than a pair of Marine's boots.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, it would seem that some of us would get the
message. The Titans had beaten the Jaguars twice during the season,
yet when the championship game came up last week, the Jaguars were
the pick. Beating the Bills and the Colts hadn't been enough to
convince anybody but Tennessee, the team and the state.
</P>
<P>
   There were many, of course, who had the feeling that the Titans
shouldn't have been there in the first place. The finish of the
Buffalo game was a freak, a quite questionable lateral pass. If the
game had been in Buffalo, it would have been a forward, one is
prone to say. Then the out-of-bounds runback in the Indianapolis
game, a righteous call without doubt, but another twist of fate.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes another rematch. In season, the Titans beat the Rams
24-21, scoring twice on turnovers in the first quarter. Before they
could take a deep breath, the Rams were down 21-0. A field goal
eventually decided the game. So, do the Titans do it again?
</P>
<P>
   The contention here is that the Rams don't lose this one. McNair
beat the Jaguars with his running. The Rams' defense will surely be
steeled for that, and though there is no requirement that I do so,
I take the position that the Rams win 28-17.

 &HT;    Ne'r-do-well teams in never-never land
 &HT;    By Terrence Moore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As you know, the Falcons spent last season as a fluke,
a whole fluke and nothing but a fluke. So, even after they proved
that we truly are in the final days with one of the prettiest runs
in NFL history to the Super Bowl, they weren't respected by their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of. The reason why the Titans and the Rams are
playing today in the Georgia Dome for the world championship is
because they were motivated by the evolution of the Dirty Bird.
</P>
<P>
   One season, the Falcons were joining the Rams and the Titans as
everybody's favorite punching bags. The next, the Falcons were
bruising enough bullies around the league to become the antithesis
of the franchise with 14 losing seasons in its previous 16.
</P>
<P>
   Just the thought of those Falcons was enough to make these
Titans furious with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' said safety Blaine Bishop, recalling how Titans
coach Jeff Fisher called his team together before the season and
reminded them of the following: Unlike the Falcons, the Titans'
streak of ineptness hadn't lasted nearly a lifetime. The Titans had
only five consecutive nonwinning seasons after reaching the
playoffs during the previous seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then (Fisher) told us to think about this,'' Bishop said. ``He
asked us, `Do you really believe the Falcons are better than us?'''
</P>
<P>
   You know the rest. While the Falcons became the Falcons again by
dropping to 5-11, the Titans won 16 of 19 games along the way to
the AFC title. They'll face a Rams team with a history of
challenging the Falcons for looking the silliest each season.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Rams' current miracle, they hadn't managed a winning
season since the 1980s. Now, as NFC champions, they're 15-3, and
they resemble the Dirty Birds who flew to glory on the wings of
dandy running, prolific passing, stifling defense and pixie dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely were an inspiration for us,'' Rams defensive
tackle D'Marco Farr said. ``For years, the 49ers had been
dominating both teams in the NFC West. It was kind of mental thing.
But then the Falcons jumped out of nowhere and just nailed them.
They were like the little brother that was always getting beat up
like you, but then they finally made it big.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. After the Falcons dropped their opener this season to
the Vikings, they lost their next game and star running back Jamal
Anderson on a Monday night in Dallas. Then came the Falcons' trip
to St. Louis, where the Rams just couldn't contain themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Rams sprint to a 35-7 victory with a potent
combination of quarterback Kurt Warner, running back Marshall Faulk
and a slew of frantic defenders, they delivered more than a few
blows with their tongues. Falcons wide receiver Terance Mathis was
among the highly peeved in the aftermath, and Rams safety Keith
Lyle understood why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Terance during that game, `And new ... NFC champions of
the world ...','' Lyle said, laughing, recalling that Mathis wasn't
amused. ``Terance was like, `Keith, man. Just chill out.' And I
said, `You're right. You're right. I'm not going to go there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Rams went to where the Falcons had been, and so did
the Titans. According to Falcons offensive tackle Bob Whitfield,
floating this week between news conferences for the Rams and the
Titans: ``We've shown them the whole panorama. From watching us,
they know how to reach the Super Bowl, and they also know what not
to do the next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep.

DEFENSE WANTS DIALLO JURORS TO SEE THROUGH OFFICERS' EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: With NY-DIALLO-SHARPTON)  
(jw) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the year since four police officers fired 41 shots
at Amadou Diallo as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building, the case has largely played out in the news
media and in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The ferocious debate over whether the shooting of an unarmed
peddler was also a crime has at times made the legal proceedings _
and the facts of the case _ seem almost incidental.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, with the start of jury selection for the trial in
Albany in State Supreme Court, the focus will shift _ back to the
early morning of Feb. 4, 1999; back to the vestibule; and perhaps
most important, into the heads of Officers Edward McMellon, Sean
Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   For the four prosecutors from the office of the Bronx district
attorney, Robert T. Johnson, the initial strategy is to prove that
the officers killed Diallo _ something they have never denied _ and
then sit back and wait. Then the defense offers its justification,
defining the trial.
</P>
<P>
   To convince a jury that the shooting was justified, the
officers, who indicated through their lawyers that they thought
Diallo had a gun, must also convince a jury that that belief was
reasonable. To do that, defense lawyers will seek to put jurors in
the officers' shoes, to make them feel the fear they say the
officers felt. They will try to humanize the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the defense is to steer jurors from what one
defense lawyer calls ``Monday morning quarterbacking'': holding the
defendants accountable for the fact that Diallo never had a gun.
The black object he pulled from his pocket turned out to be his
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants' other challenge is internal: the four officers
each saw and heard different things in those few moments, and
played different roles. Some fired more times than others, and
fired earlier. Conceivably, they could be assessed different levels
of blame. They must stick together.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution is flying somewhat blind. Because the officers
chose not to testify before the grand jury that ultimately charged
each one with two counts of second-degree murder and one of
reckless endangerment, the prosecutors have no direct knowledge of
what they will say.
</P>
<P>
   At the arraignment, Johnson adopted a scathing tone about the
officers' actions, essentially equating the killing with a drive-by
shooting. Albany is a different place, and its residents have
different attitudes toward the police, but Barry Kluger, Johnson's
senior assistant, said that the change of location would not affect
how the prosecution would proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The first task, proving that the officers killed Diallo, is
simple; it could be accomplished with as few as three witnesses.
More than that will take the stand, but the prosecution is still
expected to use only about a fourth of the 47 witnesses who
testified before the grand jury. The rest have been eliminated
because they are redundant or in some way helpful to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution will call the medical examiner, Dr. Joseph
Cohen, to testify about Diallo's 19 wounds, and possibly about
whether he believes Diallo fell to the ground before all of the
shots were fired. Ballistics experts will testify that the bullets
that struck Diallo and littered the vestibule came from the
officers' semiautomatic pistols. A few civilian witnesses from the
street will take the stand. The prosecution will probably show
where the defendants were standing and what the trajectories of
their bullets were.
</P>
<P>
   Then it will be the defense's turn. The officers will be
portrayed as human beings who feel the same fears as anyone else.
``These are not brutal cowboys,'' said Steven Brounstein, a lawyer
for Boss.
</P>
<P>
   But, defense lawyers will say, the officers perform
extraordinarily dangerous work. The Bronx will be portrayed as
habituated by rapists, drug dealers and other violent criminals, a
characterization that will certainly resonate more in Albany than
it would have in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers will also try to convey that more is at stake
than simply the fate of four officers. ``A conviction here would
send a message to law enforcement that could result in deaths and
serious injuries to police officers throughout the country,'' one
defense lawyer said. ``If a cop holds back, there are going to be
police funerals.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense is also expected to show how quickly 41 shots from
four semiautomatic pistols can be fired.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, officers are told to shoot only as a last resort
and only enough to stop a threat. But that leaves a lot of room for
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has filed a brief indicating that it may try to
raise Diallo's background to explain why he may have failed to
respond to orders from the officers; Diallo lied on an application
for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing whether the prosecution will raise the propriety
of the officers' approaching Diallo in the first place, the defense
will try to assure jurors that the initial contact with Diallo was
proper.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the defense case as well is making the jury believe
that the officers made a reasonable mistake in thinking that
Diallo's wallet was a gun. The defense will contend that the light
in the vestibule was off _ a detail the prosecution is likely to
dispute _ but that even if it was on, it was too dim.
</P>
<P>
   The defense will also stress the remorse the officers feel, and
elicit testimony from them.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution will then rebut the defense's points, and rest.
``The front end of the trial is going to be short,'' said John D.
Patten, a lawyer for Carroll. ``The whole battle is going to be in
the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   James Culleton, the lawyer for Murphy, added: ``It's going to
come down to whether you believe the police officers or you don't
believe the police officers. Their evidence is going to be our
evidence.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ROOTING AGAINST THE GOOD GUYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dangerously, we are one game away from a new Era of Good
Feeling. This is why we have to root for Tennessee Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If Kurt Warner leads the St. Louis Rams to a Super Bowl victory,
we will be informed Sunday night that the good guy won and sports
has turned a corner, that we are back in the afternoon sunshine of
the late 1950s. By Monday, someone may actually say, This time,
sports fans, Johnny Unitas beat Joe Namath.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurt Warner Story, posted in every mailroom, fast-fry
kitchen, loading dock and computer sweat shop in America is simple
enough; the overlooked, under-regarded dreamer, married, three kids
(one brain-damaged) never took his eye off the prize as he stacked
groceries and kept his game alive on the fringes until the leading
man dropped and gave him his shot. He was ready, Freddie, to win,
kiss his wife, and thank the Lord. UB2.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rams win, you can forget everything that made the last
quarter of the 20th century so special, the Nike Air-Felony Boot,
the Samaranch Sleaze, the McEnroe-Connors Syndrome, the Charlie
Hustle, the Iron Mike Bite, the Rocker Sound Bite, the new thrill
of sports as an edgy exercise in testing moral limits, a sort of
Lawrence Phillips run along the sideline, a half step from being
out-of-bounds, and in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the police reports grew longer than the injury
lists, hope was hiking over the horizon. Star Ball, the Next
Generation, was strolling in. Here comes Derek Jeter, no matter how
many millions you force him to take he will stay sweet; Adam
Graves, in touch with his inner puck; David Robinson, who says nice
guys can't finish, and the forever twins, Sammy McGwire and Mark
Sosa, one of whom set a record of some kind, but that wasn't the
point at all. Right. The optimists saw a positive trend, the cynics
applauded a correction in the marketing.
</P>
<P>
   This is not new. God and the Devil are the role models of a
campaign that was commercialized in 1889 when Jake Kilrain,
promoted as the good Irishman (family man, humble) defended his
heavyweight title in a bare-knuckle match against the bad Irishman,
John L. Sullivan (drank too much, beat his wife). Historians think
the subtext of the promotion was about keeping immigrants in line.
Sullivan won and became very good because he wouldn't risk the
title against black fighters. Then came Jack Johnson, very bad.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you read the Bible, you watch ESPN, you know as much as I
do.
</P>
<P>
   The '60s confused us, Floyd Patterson was good, Sonny Liston was
bad, Cassius Clay was better but Muhammad Ali was very bad until he
became very good. Then, in the third Super Bowl, Namath, very bad
(long hair, sex before games, drank without shame), said he would
beat the Baltimore Colts, epitomized by Unitas, very good (a Kurt
Warner-be, gritty sandlotter, crew-cut). Unitas was barely a factor
by then, so it was good that Namath turned out to be very good
(loved his mom, loyal to his teammates, played hurt).
</P>
<P>
   The '70s were worse. Biochemistry took over football, basketball
and the Olympics, while the tennis brats, presumably high only on
their own neuroses, were so bad it was good to remember that we
didn't raise them. Since it takes a village, the blame has to go to
the mayors, Ted Turner, Marge Schott, George Steinbrenner, and all
the coaches and owners who thought they could tame bad boys, make
them attack pets.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s gave us a Mets championship team that made the frat
boys in Animal House seem restrained. Doc Gooden and Darryl
Strawberry never quite recovered, and while no longer the young and
the restless, they are still at all my children.
</P>
<P>
   This was the afterburn of the climate that nurtured the talents
of Tyson and Rocker while allowing their self-destructive
tendencies to flourish as well. Far worse, it also produced Bobby
Phills, the Charlotte Hornet who accidentally killed himself and
injured two other motorists in a boys-will-be-boys drag race after
basketball practice, and Rae Carruth, the Carolina Panther charged
with murder and conspiracy in the death of his pregnant girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are at the first Super Bowl of the new century with a
lovable good guy who seems nothing more or less than a 19th-century
hero. Unless we get lucky (it is revealed that he slipped LSD into
those cereal boxes he was stacking), Kurt Warner will turn out to
be as solid a family man, churchgoer and team player as the
gibberish rising from Atlanta claims. Does he at least have a
tattoo? A recording contract? A concealed old pot bust? And is he
really our only problem? What if Tennessee wins?
</P>
<P>
   Consider Steve McNair, who was drafted out of a small college,
who returned from back surgery. Although he is only the second
African-American quarterback in the Super Bowl, he is emblematic of
an emerging generation of talented black quarterbacks who have been
able to resist management's custom _ a more subtle but far more
dangerous form of Rockerthink _ of switching them to defensive
back. Very good.

 &HT;    McCain suggests Bush not ready for `prime time'
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHAM, N.H. _ Republican Sen. John McCain questioned Saturday
whether Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is ready to be president as
the rivals raced toward Tuesday's primary here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, campaigned with his father and mother, part of
a last-minute blitz of the state. Bush is still hopeful of a
victory in New Hampshire that would effectively end McCain's
long-shot campaign for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said on Friday he had ``a very good chance''
of winning Tuesday. But whatever happens, Bush told reporters,
``I'm in it for the long pull,'' with a campaign well organized in
primary states beyond New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he sensed growing momentum in the campaign's final
days here, but his stepped-up rhetoric against Bush suggested his
campaign is locked in a tight duel.
</P>
<P>
   Amid criticism of Bush on taxes and campaign finance reform,
McCain told large crowds in several New Hampshire towns that he
would ``not need any on-the-job training'' as president.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, he told reporters that Bush's recent comparison of
McCain and President Clinton ``gives rise to the view of some that
perhaps ... he's not ready for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he does not share that view, ``but I could certainly
see why people would say that.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain could not keep a straight face when he insisted that
his repeated recitation of his qualifications to lead the country
on defense and foreign policy was not meant to suggest that Bush is
lacking in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will judge us by our qualifications, our experience and
our vision,'' he said outside the high school in Raymond, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The final days of McCain's long campaign in New Hampshire have
included more frequent references to the shortcomings of Bush's
positions on campaign finance reform and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a warm, crowded cafeteria at the Windham Middle School,
McCain said that, on the topic of money in political campaigns,
Bush is ``defending this system which has corrupted America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes McCain's proposal to ban unlimited contributions to
political parties known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   On taxes, McCain again said that Bush was giving the wealthy too
large a share of his proposed $483 billion tax cut and not setting
aside enough money for the Social Security retirement system or
reduction of the $5.6 trillion national debt.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dr. Audra Stinchcomb says she has never smoked
marijuana, but that does not prevent colleagues at the Albany
College of Pharmacy from inquiring about her ``pot patch'' or
``doobie derm'' whenever they can.
</P>
<P>
   Her two-year effort to research and develop a medical marijuana
patch that would release the drug's active ingredients through the
skin has inspired more one-liners than she can recall. The patch is
intended to be used by cancer patients for relief from nausea,
vomiting and other side effects of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody always comes in and has a new joke for me,'' said
Stinchcomb, 34, an assistant professor at the pharmacy college and
a leading researcher on the ways that chemicals are absorbed
through the skin. ``I can't help it. It's amusing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stinchcomb's research is being taken seriously by doctors
and scientific researchers as evidence increasingly suggests that
chemicals in marijuana have health benefits. A report last year by
the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of
Sciences, concluded that the chemicals, called cannabinoids,
relieve pain and nausea, although the report warned that marijuana
smoke was even more toxic than tobacco smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Stinchcomb's proposal for a marijuana patch
was awarded a $361,000 grant from the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a bold step for us,'' said Don Distasio, the
cancer society's chief operating officer in New York and New
Jersey, who acknowledged that the proposal was controversial but
said it had been screened by three panels of doctors, scientists
and staff members as part of the application process.
</P>
<P>
   The project has also been approved by the Drug Enforcement
Administration, which regulates experiments with illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The patch would use synthetic cannabinoids created in a
laboratory and is years away from being tested on people. But it
has piqued interest because it offers a compromise of sorts in the
long-running battle over whether to legalize marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in seven states and the District of Columbia have
endorsed the medical benefits of marijuana through referendums, but
many government officials balk at making the drug more accessible,
which they say would be the first step in making it available for
general use.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Voth, chairman of the International Drug Strategy
Institute, an organization in Omaha, Neb., that reviews drug
policies, said the patch could pass along the therapeutic effects
of marijuana without making the drug itself available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no more a marijuana patch than a nicotine patch is a
tobacco patch,'' Voth said. ``I'm all for trying to find pure,
reliable medicine, but I do not support the idea of smoking weed
for medicinal purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to legalize marijuana also see the benefit of
developing a patch. ``It is yet another acknowledgment, even if it
is somewhat muted, by the government that marijuana is a valuable
medicine,'' said Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb prefers to stay clear of the political debate. She
describes her research on cannabinoids in clinical terms, often
referring to charts and models to make her point. ``There's an
extremely serious side to this, because it's treating cancer
patients,'' she said. ``I want the project to be perceived that
way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stinchcomb said she became interested in testing cannabinoids
after reading medical literature that suggested their potential
health benefits. She had already received a $100,000 grant from the
National Institutes of Health to research a patch for another drug,
naltrexone, which blocks the effects of opiates and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stinchcomb continues to work on both patches, only the
marijuana patch has garnered widespread interest. She has received
a stream of e-mail from pharmaceutical companies offering equipment
and chemicals, and phone calls from cancer patients pleading for
help from a marijuana patch.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview in her office, Stinchcomb paused in
midsentence to answer one such plea from a caller. She explained
that the patch was still being developed and referred the person to
the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad there is nothing that I can do personally yet,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in Stinchcomb's work is unusual for her school,
which is often overshadowed by larger institutions. The Albany
College of Pharmacy, founded in 1881, has just 660 students in one
building.
</P>
<P>
   Elated school officials have been busy collecting news articles
about Stinchcomb from around the country and responding to e-mail
from proud alumni.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the attention came more jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Her colleagues have already picked out a shape for the patch (a
marijuana leaf) and suggested hiring President Clinton as the
pitchman because, after all, he did not inhale. As Eric Hobson, a
professor of humanities and social sciences at the college, put it,
``It's perfect monologue material.''

BRADLEY SEES SELF AS LEADER; OTHERS DISSENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ He casts himself as a Franklin D. Roosevelt for
the 21st century, a daring leader who would ``liberate our
democracy'' from the tyrannies of dollar-driven politics, child
poverty, and handgun violence.
</P>
<P>
   No ``nickel and diming,'' Bill Bradley says from the barrios of
Southern California to the white-steepled villages of New
Hampshire. No ``nibbling around the edges.''
</P>
<P>
   From revolutionizing the health care system to bridging the
racial divide, Bradley envisions ``big things'' for the country,
``bold things,'' and says he harbors the presidential leadership
skills to achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its grandeur, Bradley's self-portrait as a titan of
leadership puzzles many former colleagues and congressional
analysts who witnessed his 18 years as senator from New Jersey. The
Bill Bradley they remember displayed flashes of leadership but
largely dwelled in the shadows, more detached than driven, more big
thinker than big doer.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mystery of Bradley's candidacy: whether an outsider who
cultivated relatively few allies in the political establishment
during his lengthy service can convince voters he would have the
ability as president to build the consensus and coalitions he would
need to fulfill his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is a fascinating, intelligent figure with a special
quality of celebrity and intrigue about him,'' said Thomas E. Mann,
a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution who has
tracked Bradley's political career. ``But he is not one who
naturally uses the bully pulpit. Nor is he one who has worked
consistently to reshape public opinion and build broad
coalitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann said Bradley's proudest leadership moments in the Senate
are not ``the stuff of FDR.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and his supporters said his critics are confusing
leadership with conventional political success. As an outsider who
rose to the Senate from professional basketball rather than the
traditional route up the political ladder, Bradley never strived to
be a conformist, a back-slapping, favor-swapping baron of
incremental legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bradley stalked big goals from the start of his
political career, his allies said. And they argue that his greatest
victory, the 1986 overhaul of the tax system, proves that when
Bradley embraces a challenge, he throws himself at it with the kind
of vigor and stamina he tapped to make himself into a basketball
Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley labored for six years on the tax issue to overcome stern
opposition in Congress and indifference from the Reagan
administration. In the end, he forged an alliance with Ronald
Reagan and convinced Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill that
reducing tax rates made economic and political sense if the cuts
were offset by closing loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the largest overhaul of the tax code in a
generation. ``What you see with Bill is somebody who is so smart
and has so much integrity that once he puts himself into an issue
and reaches a conclusion, you may not agree with it, but you know
he has thought it through so well that he is apt to be right,''
said Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who served on the
Senate Finance Committee with Bradley and supports him.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic senators recall Bradley more as a passive
participant than a leader. And only three senators and seven House
members who served with him have endorsed him, though many have
been pressured by Democratic leaders to stand by Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of Bradley's former congressional colleagues from
New Jersey, the politicians who should know him best, has risked
any political capital to back him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of leadership, most of his colleagues would scratch
their heads a little bit,'' said a Democratic senator who served
with Bradley throughout his tenure and is backing Gore. ``He always
seemed to be fairly distant from the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Newark Mayor Sharpe James, who supported Bradley until his final
Senate term, was more blunt. Like several other New Jersey
officials, Sharpe said Bradley disdained the involvement in state
and local politics that is vital to building grass-roots consensus
and coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill saw the US Senate as a chance to write books, deal with
theory, and lecture about foreign affairs,'' said James, who backs
Gore. ``He never got involved with local affairs that affected
people's lives. He just wouldn't deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a number of other New Jersey leaders are supporting Bradley,
as are a group of liberal House members from New York to
California.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the House members said they backed Bradley for his
compelling speeches on behalf of the disadvantaged, his fights
against harsh welfare provisions, and his stands against racial
bias. Others, such as Representative George Miller, a California
Democrat, cited specific examples of Bradley's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after Bradley's tax victory, Miller watched with a
measure of awe, he said, as Bradley posted one of his few other
major leadership triumphs in Congress. As chairman of a Senate
Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee, and with an eye on a
future presidential run, Bradley took on California's Republican
governor, Pete Wilson, and the Bush administration in trying to
reallocate the state's scarce federal water supply for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   The water had long been controlled by powerful landowners,
backed by corporate and political leaders. But Bradley wanted to
make the water more accessible for cities, businesses, and
environmental purposes, and he started in 1990 by reaching out to
Miller, who had long struggled for the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I stopped laughing, I told him, `You don't understand;
all the politics on this is going the other way,' '' Miller said.
``I figured I'd never hear from him again and it would never
happen. But the guy worked on it for two straight years, and in the
end, he made it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also has been widely credited for playing key roles in
creating the framework for the General Agreement on Trade and
Tariffs and helping to establish the North American Free Trade
Agreement. And his aides relish noting that Bradley helped coach
Gore on NAFTA before Gore's 1993 debate with Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley watchers in Washington describe his major
legislative victories as less than convincing evidence that he
could match the leadership prowess of Roosevelt or President Lyndon
B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Every day on the stump, Bradley presents himself as a leader in
the mold of Roosevelt, who created the Social Security system, and
Johnson, who established Medicare. ``In that same spirit,'' Bradley
tells his audiences, ``what we must do today is take a national
problem, turn it into a public issue, mobilize the idealism of the
American people, and solve the problem. Doing big things, that's
what leadership is.''
</P>
<P>
   But just when Bradley might have matured as a leader, he entered
his third and final term in Congress in 1990 more concerned about
his personal, political wounds than a vision for the future. He had
suffered a devastating near-defeat that year, barely edging
Christine Todd Whitman, then a political neophyte.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like he basically quit after that,'' said a
Democratic senator who largely shared Bradley's political
philosophy and is backing Gore. ``He was uninvolved and
uninspired.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledged as much in his 1996 memoir, ``Time Present,
Time Past,'' writing that his poor showing in the 1990 election
``hung over me like a bad dream.'' Calling the election ``a
terrible blow,'' Bradley said he considered the outcome
``essentially a rejection of me'' and recalled that he ``began to
shy from contact.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Bradley said, the experience was ``the best
thing that ever happened to my political career.'' He said the
near-loss forced him to confront his weaknesses and ``freed me to
share what was in my gut as well as in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of Bradley's former colleagues remain skeptical, he
has impressed enough voters to help him bolt from nowhere in the
Democratic primary to a position of strength in New Hampshire, if
not nationally. And some of Bradley's supporters detect a hint of
Roosevelt in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, FDR in our house was like Jesus Christ
in most houses,'' said Neil Vauthrin, a retiree in Cedar Rapids,
Iowa. ``Rather than a cross on the wall, we had a picture of FDR.
Bradley reminds me of Roosevelt. He has the same sincerity.''

   NEW YORK _ Would this act bring down the house?
</P>
<P>
   Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, the executive and artistic director of
Carnegie Hall, watched intently on Jan. 18 as an iron column the
size and color of a tree trunk was extracted from its place under
the main auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the morning after a recital by the violinist Anne-Sophie
Mutter, and crews had begun dismantling the structural framework
that held up the floor of the main hall for 110 years. Taking its
place is temporary steel shoring that will permit an extraordinary
project to unfold between now and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing less than an entirely new theater, seating up to 688
people, will be built under the main auditorium. In some spots, its
ceiling will be only 10 feet below the parquet level seats.
</P>
<P>
   Ohnesorg was on hand to watch the removal of the first column,
bundled against the subterranean cold, looking as dapper as a man
can in a hard hat. (A bow tie helped.) Asked how he felt at that
suspenseful moment, he said simply:
</P>
<P>
   ``In between heaven and earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a more southerly latitude suggests itself, for the
scene under Carnegie Hall these days is truly infernal, as workers
excavate 8,000 cubic yards of Manhattan schist and debris _ enough
to fill 363 New York City garbage trucks _ to make room for the
theater, which is replacing the Carnegie Hall Cinema but will be
far greater in volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mining operation,'' said John L. Tishman, chairman of
Tishman Construction Corp., the construction managers of the
project, and a member of the Carnegie Hall board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no choice, said James Stewart Polshek of the
Polshek Partnership, architects of the new theater. ``If St.
Peter's was out of space and had to build a chapel for 600 people,
they wouldn't go across the Tiber,'' he said. ``They'd excavate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for the rock removal is that a performance hall has
to have volume. The secret to any hall where unamplified music is
played is volume. We couldn't go up. So we had to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless they pass by the construction staging area on Seventh
Avenue, however, concertgoers may be unaware of the unearthly realm
below.
</P>
<P>
   With all 12 cast iron columns removed, the floor of the main
auditorium is held up by 45-foot-high steel pipe columns, 12 inches
in diameter, atop of which are 24-inch steel I-beam girders topped
by thick pads of Neoprene, a rubberlike synthetic that acts as a
kind of cushion.
</P>
<P>
   James D. Nomikos, director of operations at Carnegie Hall, said
there had not been a single comment about acoustics in the 10 days
since the shoring took up the load.
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a performance space under the main
auditorium. Originally called the Carnegie Recital Hall, it was
opened in 1891 by pianist Franz Rummel. It next became the Carnegie
Lyceum, for student dramatic productions, then the Carnegie
Playhouse, for off-Broadway productions and classic movie revivals.
In 1960, it was converted to a commercial cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Nomikos told Judith Arron, who was then the
executive and artistic director, that the cinema's lease was about
to expire.
</P>
<P>
   Nomikos modestly suggested that the space could be used for
badly needed storage. Or perhaps a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or,'' Ms. Arron replied, ``we could turn it into a theater
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the moment, Nomikos said: ``I'll never forget her
look. Her eyes lit up. Her face lit up. It was almost like a follow
spot came on.'' Although, as a practical-minded man, he confessed
that his first thought was, ``There goes my storage space.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (The performance space within the new hall is to be named the
Judith Arron Auditorium, in honor of Ms. Arron, who died in
December 1998. The overall hall will be named after Judy and Arthur
Zankel, who gave $10 million toward the estimated $50 million
construction cost.)
</P>
<P>
   A team was assembled with Robert Silman &AMP; Associates as
structural engineers, Flack &AMP; Kurtz as mechanical and electrical
engineers, Jaffe Holden Scarbrough as acousticians, and Auerbach &AMP;
Associates as theatrical consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The Polshek firm and the Tishman company were responsible for
the 1986 renovation that restored the architectural luster to
Carnegie Hall but, to many discerning ears, diminished its fabled
acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, it was reported that a layer of concrete had been
discovered under the stage floor, 1 to 4 inches thick. The floor
was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Nomikos said what was widely described as concrete was a fill
material, ``a loose kind of mortar that existed in the original
design.'' The loss of resonance listeners noticed, he said, was
more likely attributable to the new stage floor, a combination of
tongue-in-groove maple and two layers of laminated plywood.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said: ``Polshek and Tishman for too long took an
unfair beating on this. They need to be exonerated. Carnegie Hall
never blamed anybody. We have the utmost faith in the capability of
John Tishman and Jim Polshek.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that acoustics in the main hall, now known as
Isaac Stern Auditorium, were of no concern. In fact, maintaining
the sound and structure of that room was initially the chief
preoccupation of the designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest point was to make sure there were no acoustical
implications for the main hall,'' said Charles M. Griffith, the
project architect, who is working with Polshek and Richard Olcott,
the partner in charge of design for the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern was whether construction vibration might bring
down the ceiling in the main hall. ``It's a heavy building, but
some of it is very fragile,'' Tishman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to go out and find mining experts, tunneling
experts,'' he said. That led to Schiavone Construction Co. of
Secaucus, N.J., builders of the 63rd Street subway tunnel, among
other projects.
</P>
<P>
   The construction team studied many methods of excavation and
removal, including shipping the debris out on subway trains,
Tishman said.
</P>
<P>
   What they settled on was a variety of methods, said Michael J.
Goldstein, vice president for New York construction at Schiavone:
sledgehammers, picks, shovels, rams, robotic rock splitters and a
chemical compound that is poured into holes in which it expands,
cracking the stone as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Blasting will also be used as a last resort, with the consent of
the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which designated Carnegie
Hall in 1967. The chairwoman, Jennifer Raab, said, ``We were
convinced of their argument that it's safer to do short blasting
than continuous drilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomikos said there were sure to be outcroppings of bedrock
``where you could drill for eight hours and get three wheelbarrows
of rock out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By blasting, you're eliminating a lot of drilling,'' he said,
``and drilling causes a lot more vibration over a longer period of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the Carnegie Hall interiors are designated
landmarks, Ms. Raab asked that as much as possible of the remaining
19th-century decorative plaster and ironwork be salvaged from the
old recital hall and cinema. Some of it is now in the commission's
storehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Other archaeological finds have come to light, like plasterwork
reinforced with marsh reeds. ``You're not going to see that
again,'' said Roy Barnaby, the project superintendent for Tishman.
``We're half builders, half explorers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arron Auditorium, which is to open in the spring of 2002,
will be 96 feet long and 30 feet high, encircled by an elliptical
concrete wall that will carry the load of the floor above,
permitting a column-free space.
</P>
<P>
   The floor of the new hall will be composed of nine sections,
each 45 feet wide, on independent lifts that can be raised or
lowered to create a stage at the end with raked seating, a stage
and orchestra pit, a stage in the center or a completely flat
floor. Seats will be mounted on movable wagons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do educational work in the morning, change it in the
afternoon and be ready for an evening performance,'' Ohnesorg said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his office, he pondered the nerve-racking engineering
feat that was going on downstairs by recalling the Empire Theater,
which was rolled 170 feet along West 42nd Street in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you change, there is always a certain risk,'' Ohnesorg
said. ``But technology is so advanced. When you realize you can
move an entire building from one place to another place, that shows
you can trust these people.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE JORDAN-FALK RELATIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Falk held up his hand, as if to stop the onrushing verbal
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking,'' said Falk, the powerful agent. This was 11
days ago, when Falk's top client and moneymaker, Michael Jordan,
announced his return to basketball by purchasing a piece of the
Washington Wizards and becoming the president of basketball
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Falk is still not talking, preferring not to field questions
about his revamped relationship with Jordan, which had its final
details hammered out in Falk's Washington office. Now, in addition
to Falk's continued role in marketing Jordan, which benefits the
SFX Sports Group, of which Falks is the chairman, he, and SFX, will
be negotiating the contracts of Wizards players with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But there are questions, such as whether Jordan should recuse
himself from negotiating with anyone from SFX, which agreed in 1998
to pay Falk up to $150 million for his firm. Or should Jordan
recuse himself only if Falk is personally representing a player
whom the Wizards are trying to sign? Two of the Wizards' best
players, Juwan Howard, who is in the midst of a seven-year, $105.5
million contract, and Rod Strickland, are Falk men.
</P>
<P>
   But steering clear of Falk's clients seems unlikely for Jordan,
because Falk represents some of the National Basketball
Association's best players, a power base that he has used to wield
considerable behind-the-scenes power in the league. In all, SFX
represents 78 NBA players in contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   No other team executive in the NBA is in such an unusual and
potentially awkward position. The Knicks' Scott Layden and the
Nets' John Nash do not have to worry about these issues. They are
not former $33 million-a-year players who chat with Tweety Bird and
Bugs Bunny in MCI Worldcom commercials. Few general managers own a
piece of the clubs they run or transact business with the agents
who represents them in their off-the-court business.
</P>
<P>
   It is a clear conflict, and there are no rules governing how to
deal with it. And there may be more examples of this in the future,
said Leigh Steinberg, the agent-lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're turning out a generation of athletes whose wealth is
inestimable, who'll walk away from the game with 60, 80, 120
million dollars,'' Steinberg said. ``We'll see a wave of players
entering ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steinberg does not think the potential conflict presents an
insurmountable or even difficult problem. The possibility of a
conflict depends, he said, on whether the player-turned-owner
continues a business relationship with his agent, as Jordan has.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is a conflict? ``I might have another lawyer in the
office handle his business,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan seemed unconcerned last week about any conflicts. He
said, in fact, at his Wizards' coronation, that he looked forward
to receiving future advice from Falk.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is looking at the unusual relationship, but here is a
near-certainty: Because it involves Jordan, the most favored son,
the NBA will be genteel in assessing whether his new connection to
Falk requires any monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The only rule that covers the Falk-Jordan tie is in the by-laws
of the National Basketball Players Association; it bars agents of
players from negotiating the contracts of general managers and
other team officials.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some threshold questions for judging the Jordan-Falk
connection: Is anybody being hurt? Are they negotiating as fiercely
as possible or are they doing less than their best because of their
previous connections?
</P>
<P>
   For instance, does Falk steer top draft picks or free agents to
Washington for less money than they might be worth elsewhere to
embellish Jordan's status and elevate himself in his continuing
power struggle with David Stern, the NBA commissioner?
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan is a powerful selling tool for any franchise,''
Steinberg said. ``No question, when a player considers free agency,
the fact that Michael's running a club is a heavy incentive for a
player to sign, even for less money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the naturally adversarial relationship between a team
executive and an agent will develop seemed to be on Jordan's mind
on Jan. 19. ``I'm sure people think David Falk and his whole agency
will run the team,'' he tartly said. ``But he works for me; I don't
work for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Falk literally works for Jordan, can he simultaneously
and fairly work for another player and negotiate a contract for him
with Jordan? It remains to be seen if Jordan, by putting Falk in
his place so publicly, was issuing his declaration of executive
independence.

 &HT;    `Monday' telecasts give ABC a leg up
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More than 125 million viewers are expected to watch
ABC's telecast of the Rams and Titans in the Super Bowl by
announcers Al Michaels and Boomer Esaison and reporter Lesley
Visser.
</P>
<P>
   But the names of the two men primarily responsible for the
pictures of that account will go largely unnoticed, unless there's
a gaffe or two of super proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the lives of director Craig Janoff and producer Ken
Wolfe, whose roles are like offensive linemen, whose benchmark of
brilliance is based on anonymity. When you hear the name of an
offensive lineman during a game, that usually means he has done
something harmful to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Not to suggest Janoff and Wolfe have labored in total obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Their mantels are adorned with a total of nearly 20 Emmy awards.
And though the announcers would bear the brunt of their missed
assignments like a sacked quarterback, Michaels' voice had not a
trace of doubt when he said, ``in terms of how we do the game
technically and its production, I'm not worried. The biggest fear
is a blowout. I don't want to be in the first quarter with Team A
24 and Team B zero.''
</P>
<P>
   The tandem at the helm of ``Monday Night Football'' since 1988,
Janoff and Wolfe long ago realized that each telecast is a
mini-Super Bowl, especially with 20 or more cameras the norm and
not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innovations are not something we look for,'' Janoff said.
``But the matchups in this game are very challenging, because there
are two teams that people have not seen a lot. We'll go after this
journalistically but do what we normally do every night.''
</P>
<P>
   However, every Super Bowl telecast is pumped up with extra
equipment. Even Monday Night Football can't buck that trend. So
Janoff and Wolfe will have 39 cameras and 30 tape machines at their
disposal. The critically acclaimed ``first-and-10'' line will be
used in the Super Bowl for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have augmented cameras, but that's only to give us a few
more isolation shots on linebackers, wide receivers and
cornerbacks,'' Wolfe said. ``Craig is not going to force 10 new
cameras into his cut. That would be like the teams trying to change
their offense in one week.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the TV analysts are predicting a close game, and, if
they're right, it will be particularly helpful for Esaison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer brings us candor, and Al brings us clarity,'' Visser
said. However, Esiason was not that impressive in the first half of
the season, and speculation about the need for a third party was
raised well before such coaches as Mike Ditka and Jimmy Johnson
became available.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I took this job is because of its high-profile
nature, and I don't worry about all that stuff,'' Esaison said.
``If you listen to our telecast, a lot of information comes out of
the booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels said, ``We had much better games in the second half of
the season. Early on were the worst kind of games, when we had road
routs, meaning one-sided games with the road team winning. By the
fourth quarter, the atmosphere was just dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have the right combination. Boomer is a lot more
comfortable, and Lesley does a tremendous job. However, when you're
on a show like Monday Night Football, everybody takes shots because
we're real easy targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Come Super Bowl Sunday, make that a bull's-eye.

 &HT;    Right place, time for Martz
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Almost every assistant football coach has a wild story
to tell. It is a vagabond's job, a job of often nonsensical twists
and turns. But few can top Mike Martz's story.
</P>
<P>
   He was fired from his previous offensive coordinator's job, at
Arizona State. He got his first NFL job only after offering to work
free for a year. He was fired, along with the rest of the Rams'
assistants, when Dick Vermeil came in as head coach. Two years
later, he was rehired by Vermeil, and now he is the league's
reigning offensive genius and the Rams' next head coach.
</P>
<P>
   You got all that? A guy fired when Vermeil came in will take
over when Vermeil goes out.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-3 record, a franchise-record 529 points, an MVP award for a
former Arena League quarterback _ all of that will do wonders for
an offensive coordinator's career. Tonight, in the Super Bowl,
Martz's fast-break offense gets its biggest stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think people would be getting tired of hearing about
Mike Martz,'' Martz said. ``I know I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight years old and silver-haired, he is humble, befitting
a guy who coached at Bullard High in Fresno, Calif., Mesa Community
College, San Jose State, Santa Ana College, Fresno State, Pacific,
Minnesota, Arizona and Arizona State before getting his first NFL
job _ sans pay _ with the Los Angeles Rams in '92.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of funny,'' he said, referring to all of that
coming to all of this. ``You talk about a guy being in the right
spot at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   He almost wasn't in this spot. After two seasons as Washington
Redskins quarterbacks coach, he was set to join the Chicago Bears
as offensive coordinator until the Bears botched the hiring of Dave
McGinnis as head coach last January. So, Martz rejoined the Rams,
who welcomed him by acquiring Marshall Faulk and handing over
videotape of a certain Arena League quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember (Vermeil) came in one day and gave me a tape and
said, `I want you to look at this guy. I'm thinking about him as a
backup (to Trent Green),' '' Martz said. ``I asked him who the guy
was, and he said `Kurt Warner,' and I said, `Who?' ''
</P>
<P>
   They've come so far since then, Warner and Martz, that it was a
shock when the Rams scored only 11 points in last week's NFC title
game. Martz admits that he got ``too conservative.'' He doesn't
expect to repeat the mistake against the Titans.

A RARE TRIFECTA 
REMEMBERING GAHERIN 
MOVING THE SALARY BAR 
ROSE'S PEOPLE MEET SELIG'S PEOPLE 
 (WITH BBO-ST.LOUIS)
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Atlanta Braves distinction is on the line Sunday. The St.
Louis Rams can join them as the only teams in professional sports
to have won championships in their leagues in three different
cities. The Braves did it in Boston in 1914, Milwaukee in 1957 and
Atlanta in 1995. The Rams won the NFL title in Cleveland in 1945
and in Los Angeles in 1951. They could have put themselves in
position to eclipse the Braves, but they failed to win a title
during their 16 years in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering Gaherin
</P>
<P>
   The man the owners should have listened to died last week. John
Gaherin, who in 1967 became management's first labor negotiator,
died of Parkinson's disease on Cape Cod at the age of 85.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gaherin who tried to tell the owners in December 1975,
that they should negotiate free agency with the players union
rather than let the arbitrator, Peter Seitz, rule on the Andy
Messersmith grievance. Seitz had hinted strongly to Gaherin and his
players counterpart, Marvin Miller, that he was about to rule for
Messersmith and urged the two sides to negotiate an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners and their corporate lawyers said let him rule;
they would go to court and win there. Gaherin could only shake his
head and await the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My most lasting memory is that it didn't need to happen; it
didn't need to happen in the way it happened,'' Gaherin said years
after the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he added: ``I felt we should never arbitrate this
issue. We should work it out across the table. I was convinced then
and I am convinced now there were times when Marvin was very, very
amenable to a better agreement than we got after the Seitz
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller basically confirmed Gaherin's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could see the handwriting on the wall, but he couldn't make
anyone else see it,'' Miller said. ``I felt we were going to win
the case, but you couldn't be positive, so I was willing to
consider what they would offer in a negotiated settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller called Gaherin a ``professional who recognized the job we
had to do and wanted to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The most frustration he had was with the people on
his side keeping him from doing the job he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving the Salary Bar
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers may be in the process of doing George
Steinbrenner a favor. If, as baseball officials believe _ and
neither side is saying _ the Tigers have offered Juan Gonzalez an
eight-year contract worth $140 million, Steinbrenner would be able
to complete his signing of Derek Jeter without battling his
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter had been expected to sign a seven-year, $118.5 million
contract last week, but the New York Yankees' owner became
concerned that the deal would establish a new salary standard,
exceeding Kevin Brown's seven-year, $105 million contract with Los
Angeles. Steinbrenner didn't want his fellow owners glaring at him
for raising the salary bar.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gonzalez were to sign for an average annual value of
$17.5 million, it would exceed the average of the Jeter contract
and the Yankees would be setting no precedents.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, on the other hand, have offered to make Mariano
Rivera the highest-paid closer at $36 million for four years,
exceeding Trevor Hoffman's $32 million for four years. Rivera,
however, is seeking close to $10 million above the Yankees' offer.
If all else fails, they have an arbitration hearing date, Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's People Meet Selig's People
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose's people wanted a meeting, so Commissioner Bud Selig
told his people to have a meeting. Rose's people and Selig's people
had the meeting last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 years after Rose initially had the opportunity to
present evidence in his defense but opted not to, his people
presented what they said was evidence that contradicted Major
League Baseball's finding that betting slips were in Rose's
handwriting and bore his fingerprints. The forensics expert Rose
hired did not explain why Rose voluntarily accepted a lifetime
suspension if he was so innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Books have been written and academic studies conducted about the
Rose case and the investigation of Rose by John Dowd, a Washington,
D.C., lawyer. For each one that concluded that the Dowd probe was
flawed, there was one supporting Dowd's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's defenders criticize what they maintain was a one-sided
investigation of Rose's gambling in 1989. But Dowd never
interviewed the sports reporters who covered Rose and have
acknowledged that they were aware of what he was doing or those who
were close enough to Rose that they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's people plan to submit additional information to Selig's
people in an attempt to get Rose reinstated from the suspension
agreement he willingly signed. Selig, however, was not moved by the
spontaneously raucous reception Rose received at the World Series
last October, he has not been moved by the continued public
campaign to get Rose into the Hall of Fame (he has to be reinstated
first), and he is not expected to be moved by Rose's ``new
evidence.''

SHARPTON VOWS PROTESTS AT DIALLO TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: With NY-DIALLO-TRIAL)  
(jw) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The weather in Albany will be ``hot,'' the Rev. Al
Sharpton told 200 supporters Saturday, declaring that he would be a
rambunctious and daily presence at the trial in the killing of
Amadou Diallo, which begins there Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said moving the trial 140 miles north to the capital
was a ``scheme'' to diffuse his effectiveness, but he promised
headline-grabbing protests at the courthouse there, beginning with
a human prayer chain for justice.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton's supporters packed the House of God, his Harlem
headquarters at 1941 Madison Ave., for his weekly radio broadcast
Saturday. The slain immigrant's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, was
also there.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton told the energetic crowd that while the news media had
depicted him as being unwanted in Albany, he had ``secret'' support
akin to that of the Underground Railroad. And with a flourish that
brought a standing ovation, he said that he had had a tete-a-tete
with the dead heroine of the Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman,
who told him, ``Head north, young man, young woman, stand up for
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tubman also told him, he said, that in her day, she had to
travel by herself without modern conveniences. ``We didn't have fax
machines,'' he quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Lacing his exhortation with talk of King David, Sharpton told
his audience that long-distance trials were good for long-distance
runners. ``I walked to Albany once,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the war of public opinion, he claimed an early victory and
said that the judge's decision on Tuesday to allow cameras in the
courtroom was a direct result of Sharpton's meeting with 20 top
members of the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to have eyes on the courtroom, he said, which
can hold only 80 people. But, he added, ``cameras in the courtroom,
federal observers there, it is not enough.''

NEW YORK STATE'S AMBITIOUS PLAN TO GRADE HOSPITALS REMAINS STALLED
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., Pa.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The failings of hospital care have suddenly become a
hot issue. In November, a much-cited report said that 44,000 to
98,000 patients nationwide died each year because of hospital
errors. President Clinton, major corporations and health insurers
have seized on that news to call for a major effort to raise the
quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   But an important step toward improving hospital performance is
to measure it _ a complex, politically charged undertaking _ and in
this, New York was far in front just a few years ago. A 1996 state
law on hospital financing commissioned ``report cards'' on
hospitals, assessments that would tell consumers how safe it was to
have, say, an appendectomy, or a Caesarean section, at any hospital
in New York. Nowhere else had such a thing been attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Almost four years later, and 18 months after the deadline the
law set for issuing the report cards, they do not exist. The task
force that was advising the State Department of Health on the
project has disbanded. A plan to hire a consultant to help the
department make sense of mountains of raw data has been more or
less abandoned. And a law that was passed last month, taking the
place of the 1996 law, makes no mention of measuring hospital
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department insists that the project is not dead and
that the administration remains committed to it.
</P>
<P>
   But people who were involved in lobbying for and shaping the
effort now predict that there will not be any report cards _ or
that they remain several years away, at the pace the department is
moving. And many of them say that is at least in part because the
administration never liked the idea in the first place, and had
hoped it would slip quietly away. Some also point to the
Legislature when casting blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think the Health Department dragged its feet, but they
weren't alone,'' said Elliott A. Shaw Jr., director of government
affairs for the Business Council of New York State, a lobbying
group that mainly represents major corporations. ``I think the
outsiders who pushed for it, like us, were the most serious about
it. It did seem that the people in government were not serious.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether there would be report cards, a spokesman for
the department, John Signor, said, ``We're reviewing it.'' The next
day, he called a reporter back to say, ``The department will move
forward with hospital report cards,'' but he could not say when or
in what form.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the growing national debate about the quality of medical
care, the experience of New York shows how daunting a prospect,
politically and technically, it is to somehow gauge how well
hospitals provide care. In the places where such measurements have
been tried on a limited basis, there has been fierce debate over
the methods used to make valid comparisons, and hospitals have
tended to lobby against the efforts from start to finish, for fear
that they will appear near the bottom of the lists.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has made for some odd allies. Both here and
nationally, the largest corporations and labor unions _ the biggest
buyers of health insurance _ along with consumer advocates, have
found a common interest in letting the public know how well
hospitals perform.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, hospital organizations, a powerful lobby among both
Republicans and Democrats, and the Medical Society of New York, the
main doctors' group, opposed it. The Medical Society lobbied
successfully to have the law prohibit the release of
doctor-by-doctor evaluations, as well, something the consumer
groups had sought.
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of a handful of states that publish survival
rates for cardiac surgery and angioplasty, at each of the 30
hospitals where the procedures are performed, and for each surgeon.
Pennsylvania has the most ambitious such project, producing reports
that look at a few dozen procedures, by hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience here and in Pennsylvania is that when you start
publishing the data, the mortality rates go down,'' said Blair
Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest
Research Group, a consumer group that was a leading advocate of the
report cards. ``There's a public outcry, there are competitive
pressures, and it forces the hospitals to re-examine their
practices.''

DAY-CARE VOUCHERS LIKELY TO COME UNDER SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever since New York City reaped a windfall of $44
million in new funds for affordable child care, parents and
child-care advocates across the city have waited anxiously for the
city to distribute day-care vouchers to needy parents. The need,
they know, is acute, with the number of poor or working-class
families waiting for these coveted coupons having tripled in the
last two years _ to 35,000 at last count.
</P>
<P>
   But the new money has languished in city coffers for months, as
officials continue to deliberate on how to spend it. A spokeswoman
for the city's Administration for Children's Services, Leonora
Wiener, said last week that the money would be released soon and
some of it would be used for new vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   When those vouchers are distributed, though, they are certain to
come under rare scrutiny, as new details emerge on who received the
most vouchers two years ago, when they were last awarded in
significant numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The city conceded last week, after a published report, that a
little more than half of the 10,000 vouchers handed out in 1997
were concentrated in four needy but politically powerful Brooklyn
neighborhoods with a large number of Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers are, in effect, coupons worth up to $215 a week that
can be used at any day-care center. But the largest number of them
are not necessarily going to the neediest areas. Even neighborhoods
where great numbers of families are supposed to have top priority
for vouchers _ those with children in foster care, for instance _
are not the biggest beneficiaries of the vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Administration for Children's Services said
that they did nothing illegal in the awarding of vouchers two years
ago, and that the city's Department of Investigation was looking
into whether anyone from the Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods had done
anything improper in securing and distributing the vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, they said it appeared that just over half
the vouchers citywide went to four neighborhoods because of astute
organizing by a tight-knit, well-organized community that signed up
needy parents as soon as vouchers became available.
</P>
<P>
   According to the city's records, more than half of the 12,700
vouchers in circulation today have gone to the four Brooklyn
neighborhoods. Entire neighborhoods of working poor families, even
in areas with long waiting lists, have received few, if any.
</P>
<P>
   Child-care advocates say the geographic imbalance points to the
flaws in the city's first-come, first-served system of distributing
vouchers: Those who were organized enough to get on the waiting
list first were rewarded with vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers are especially coveted by some parents because they can
be used to pay for day care anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Wiener said that in preparation for voucher distribution this
time, city officials have been combing through the current waiting
list to determine who still needs a voucher and who should get
priority. They have winnowed the list to 35,000 children, from
57,000 a few months ago.

MONTANA AND LOTT LEAD WAY INTO HALL

 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is easy to understand why Joe Montana and Ronnie
Lott were such good friends, their closeness extending beyond
winning four Super Bowls together with the San Francisco 49ers.
They appreciated that both were perfectionists on the field. There
were some practices in which Montana was quarterbacking and the
football never hit the ground. If Lott blew a coverage scheme, it
made the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 passing yards later for Montana and eight Pro
Bowls at three different positions later for Lott, the two men
stood and hugged each other Saturday after being told they had just
been elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   This was about as much of a mystery as the end of a ``Columbo''
rerun. Both were first-time nominees, and there was little doubt
that they would be chosen. Montana may have been the best football
player ever, and one could easily argue that Lott was the toughest
and most skilled defensive back to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I'll most take from all my years _ and I was on some
great teams,'' Montana said, ``but the thing I'll remember the most
are my friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame added three more members. The two additional
players are Howie Long, who played 13 seasons with the Oakland
Raiders and had 84 career sacks, and Dave Wilcox, who played 11
seasons with the 49ers and was considered by many to be the best
outside linebacker of his day. Also voted in was the Pittsburgh
owner Dan Rooney, one of the classiest men in football, who has
spent 45 years in various capacities with the team. His father,
Art, who died in 1988, entered the Hall of Fame in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame panel consisted of 38 writers and broadcasters,
and election required 80 percent of the vote. Inductions will take
place July 29 in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there were debates about both the players who got in
and the ones who did not. A minority in football wonders if Long is
truly Hall of Fame material, despite making it to eight Pro Bowls.
The former Giants middle linebacker Harry Carson, who is one of the
best run stoppers in team history and who played in nine Pro Bowls,
was shut out for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest argument centers on Lynn Swann and John Stallworth,
the former Pittsburgh stars. Swann, in his 13th year of
eligibility, played nine years with the Steelers, winning four
Super Bowls and catching 53 touchdowns. Stallworth, in his eighth
year of eligibility, also won four titles and had 63 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Few receivers have put up those kinds of numbers, especially on
a team that had two great pass catchers; still, they continue to be
shut out. Part of the reason may be that the voters do not feel
that both should go in; since both players were close in ability,
the votes are most likely being split.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any doubt with Montana and Lott. Montana played
through a variety of injuries, and despite his model-like
appearance, he was one of the tougher quarterbacks to play the
game. His best attributes were an incredibly accurate arm and
coolness under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Montana's eight Pro Bowls remains a record for quarterbacks, and
several of his drives are legendary, especially the one in Super
Bowl XXIII, when he led his team 92 yards in the final minutes to
beat the Cincinnati Bengals. In all, Montana directed 31
fourth-quarter comebacks, and he holds six Super Bowl passing
records, including 11 touchdowns and 357 passing yards. Lott was
the epitome of a defensive back: He was able to cover the swiftest
receiver while playing cornerback but could make a devastating hit
from the safety spot. Lott made the Pro Bowl at cornerback as well
as at free and strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   No one was tougher. In the final game of the 1985 season, Lott
seriously damaged his left pinky. Doctors told Lott that he needed
surgery immediately or he could lose the finger.
</P>
<P>
   That operation would have required him to miss the coming
playoff game against the Giants. So Lott made a decision that
demonstrated how much football meant to him.
</P>
<P>
   He told the doctors, ``I'm going to have to let that finger
go.''
</P>
<P>
   It was amputated, and Lott played against the Giants.

BRADLEY STEPS UP ATTACK ON GORE

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ With his harsh attacks on Vice President Al
Gore, his use of the contentious issue of abortion and a forceful
appeal to women, Bradley's campaign Saturday seemed to be engaging
more than ever in the kind of traditional political warfare the
insurgent has railed against during much of this race.
</P>
<P>
   While the new strategy may be energizing his core supporters _
many of whom felt his campaign had grown listless _ it also carries
the risk of appearing desperate, political analysts said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks churlish,'' said Fred Siegel, a professor of history
at the Cooper Union for Arts and Sciences in Manhattan. ``He's like
a boxer who, in the seventh round, had a shot at getting the guy
down on the canvass but missed it, and now, in the 15th round,
throws a flurry of wild punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew E. Smith, director of surveys for the University of New
Hampshire, said Bradley needed to shake up his campaign here
because, according to many polls, he was losing support,
particularly among independents voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith contended that Bradley's new-found aggressiveness
might have been more effective weeks ago, when the Gore campaign
was constantly criticizing his Senate record and his sweeping
health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with just three days to go before New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary, the candidates have switched roles,
with Bradley suddenly looking like the attack dog and Gore seeming
to float above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has been effective at painting Bradley as negative,''
Smith said. ``This is not likely to drive people back to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But it remains unclear what impact Bradley's new assertiveness
is having on voters. Daily polls by the University of New Hampshire
have shown almost no movement in the race, with Gore maintaining a
double-digit lead. But daily CNN-USA Today-Gallup surveys show
Bradley has cut Gore's lead from 16 to 8 points over the past three
days, within its margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Hewing to their theme of the week _ that Gore is a dishonest
candidate who would make an untrustworthy president _ Bradley and
his surrogates hammered at the idea Saturday that the vice
president had been less than honest about his ``evolution'' from
abortion opponent to abortion supporter.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgent Democrat and his surrogates also accelerated their
assault on Gore's integrity, arguing that the vice president should
explain his ``journey'' from opposing federal financing of some
abortions while a congressman from Tennessee to his staunchly
abortion-rights position of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an issue that you can straddle,'' Bradley said
this morning before 250 supporters at a YWCA in Concord, using a
line from a television commercial his campaign began running in New
Hampshire Saturday. ``This is not like changing your position on
whether taxes should go up from 10 cents to 15 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign also distributed to reporters copies of
letters Gore wrote to constituents in the 1980s declaring his
opposition to abortion. ``It is my deep personal conviction that
abortion is wrong,'' Gore wrote in one of those letters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley contends that he voted for abortion rights 100 percent
of the time during his 18 years as a senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley even picked up some unsolicited help from Gary Bauer, a
conservative Republican presidential candidate, who told reporters
Saturday that he once considered Gore a strong opponent of abortion
rights. He added that he ``almost fell off my chair'' when Gore
declared that he had always supported abortion rights during
Wednesday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign responded by recruiting Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of
New Hampshire and Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York to defend Gore's
record on abortion and demand that Bradley stop raising a
potentially divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
   While letting his surrogates do much of the attacking Saturday,
Bradley focused on touting his record on women's issues, from
sponsoring legislation requiring hospitals to let mothers stay for
at least 48 hours after childbirth, to being one of the first
senators to hire a female chief-of-staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where talent is,'' he told the group.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used rallies and a taped interview for a cable
television network to describe his wife's battle with breast cancer
and his experience as a ``house mom'' caring for their daughter
several nights a week while serving in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview for the Lifetime Television, a cable network
aimed at women, Bradley argued that his proposal to extend health
insurance to nearly all Americans would benefit women even more
than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``My program really is a woman's program,'' he said.

   MEXICO-GARCIA _ MEXICO CITY _ She's diminutive, soft-spoken and
genteel. She's also an ardent feminist and one of Mexico's most
powerful political figures. Amalia Garcia, 47, is the first woman
to be elected president of a political party in this country where
machismo still generally rules. She was born one year before
Mexican women won the right to vote in 1953. She was deeply
involved in politics by 1975, the year when Mexico finally erased a
law declaring that husbands could forbid wives from working outside
the home. Today Garcia leads the Democratic Revolution Party, or
PRD, a leftist party that fiercely opposes Mexico's Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has controlled Mexico's federal
government and most state governments for 70 years. Garcia is
considered the brains behind a PRD strategy to gain power by
softening its left-wing image and forging electoral coalitions with
other Mexican opposition parties. Last year her party won, for the
first time, not just one governorship but five. (Ferriss, Cox News

   CHANDLER _ Marijuana kingpin David Ronald Chandler of Piedmont,
Ala., stands to be the first man executed by the federal government
in more than 30 years. But did he really commit the murder for
hire? On Feb. 1 in Miami, the entire 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals will hear arguments on his case. Late last year, the court
reinstated the death penalty against Chandler, deciding to
reconsider a three-judge panel ruling that ordered a new sentencing
trial because Chandler's trial lawyer failed to call dozens of
witnesses who could have testified about numerous good deeds
Chandler did in the community. (He bought shoes for poor children
and groceries for hungry families and built a fellowship hall for
his church, among other things.) This is also the case where the
government's star witness - the actual killer in a murder-for-hire
- has recanted his testimony. (Rankin, Atlanta

   INMATE-RIGHTS _ The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considers
a Georgia case involving a lawsuit filed by a state prisoner who
was forced, during a prison shakedown, to disrobe and have a full
body cavity search in front of female guards in order to humiliate
him, his lawyers say. At issue is the Prison Reform Litigation Act,
passed in 1996, which bars lawsuits by inmates who claim to have
suffered mental or emotional harm unless they can show they also
have been physically harmed. The law has been upheld by a
three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit, but two other circuit courts
(the 2nd and 9th) have ruled to the contrary, saying Congress has
no right to take away constitutional claims from anyone. (Rankin,

INDEPENDENT VOTE NOT SO DECISIVE, OBSERVERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXETER, N.H. _ Richard Goss, a letter carrier, has a front-porch
view of the presidential campaign, as evidenced by his mail sack
bursting with political literature. But as an independent, he is
also one of the more important players in the political drama,
saying in classic New Hampshire style that he will make up his mind
``when I walk into the voting booth.''
</P>
<P>
   A block away, speaking at Exeter High School, is a candidate who
could win or lose depending on what lever independents like Goss
pull. The candidate, Senator John McCain, has a ``maverick''
campaign, as he calls it. It seems scripted to appeal to
independents, but McCain has concluded that he must win within the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Like many political analysts, the Arizona senator thinks that
far fewer independents will vote than will party members.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason for McCain's conclusion. While Democrats and
Republicans are expected to turn out at a rate approaching 70
percent to 80 percent, Secretary of State William Gardner said last
week that he expects only 30 percent of the 275,000 independents to
participate. And McCain says the independent turnout will be even
lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't be independent if they were real likely voters,
so the percentage of their turnout will be much lower,'' McCain
said in an interview after addressing an enthusiastic crowd of
nearly 1,000 people. While he stressed that he is actively courting
independents, he said he is focused on the idea that ``we are going
to win with Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very helpful to get the majority of that vote,''
McCain said of the independents, ``but we have to recognize the
slice of it is not that big.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's statement put a note of contrarian caution on the
conventional wisdom that Tuesday's outcome will depend on whether
he or Bill Bradley, the Democrat challenging Al Gore, win the
independent vote. Bradley has stepped up his effort to woo
independents, announcing the endorsement of one of the nation's
leading independent figures, former Governor Lowell H. Weicker Jr.
of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, with tight races among both the Democrats and
Republicans, even a slight edge among the independent voters could
determine the winner, and no campaign is discounting their
importance. But as primary day approaches, the candidates are
coming to the conclusion that the independent factor is being
overemphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dal Col, the campaign manager for Steve Forbes, said that
most polls conducted by the media exaggerate the influence of
independents. The Forbes campaign conducts internal polls in a
different manner than most media. Their surveys focus on those who
voted in the last primary. When that method is applied, the number
of independents drops dramatically, as does support for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Under that method, Dal Col said, 18 percent of the voter sample
is independent, while he said some media polls have a much higher
number. Forbes's polling found that he is running much stronger
than in some media surveys, including one conducted jointly by The
Boston Globe and WBZ-TV.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Globe/WBZ-TV poll put Forbes at third place, with 12
percent, while the Forbes campaign poll puts him at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the media polls too high on independents versus who
actually votes,'' Dal Col said. But he does not dismiss the
importance of independent voters, saying they ``could clearly have
an impact on a tight election.'
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Chervinsky of KRC Communications Research, which does
polling for the Globe and WBZ-TV, agreed that media polls include
too many independents, but added that``our polling screens very
tightly.'' The Chervinsky poll includes about 20 percent
independents.
</P>
<P>
   Under New Hampshire law, independents are allowed to register
either as Democrat or as Republican before they step into the
voting booth, and then re-register as independents when they walk
out. Thus, there could be a last-minute push toward any candidate,
which explains why New Hampshire races often defy the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Spiliotes, a professor of government at Dartmouth
College, said the school's recent polling had found that the
much-hyped suggestion that independents would go for either Bradley
or McCain is exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest ways this is overblown is this idea of a
large bloc of independents sitting around trying to decide between
McCain or Bradley,'' Spiliotes said. ``Most independents lean
toward one party or the other. The interesting thing is they move
around within the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiliotes said that Dartmouth-Associated Press surveys have
found that ``the independents who lean Democrat and were flirting
with Bradley now are moving back to Gore. On the Republican side,
they pretty much have been streaming to McCain the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goss, the letter carrier, is an independent looking closely
at both McCain and Bradley, partly because they trail the national
front-runners, Gore and George W. Bush, the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ignoring the front-runners because I think they came into
the campaigns thinking they had a lock on the electoral process,''
Goss said. ``I feel they should be given a wakeup call to say there
are other people. That is the Democratic process.''

<P>
   In many ways, the worst was yet to come, but at the moment what
Jim Washburn saw most clearly was the end of his 13-year career as
a football coach.
</P>
<P>
   He had just been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges
related to steroid use by players at the University of South
Carolina, he had quit his months-old position as an assistant at
Purdue and to top it off his hopes of finding some temporary relief
among the folks back home had been dashed moments earlier when his
flight out of Indianapolis was canceled. Washburn retreated to the
nearby Holiday Inn, took stock of the career's worth of football
tapes, playbooks and notebooks that he was lugging with him and
then heaved them all into a Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   How was he to know _ how could he have dared to dream _ that in
a little more than 10 years he would run across that Dumpster
again, this time on his way to the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   But there he was two weeks ago, the first-year defensive line
coach of the Tennessee Titans, on his way out of Indianapolis
again, now in triumph after his team had defeated the favored
Indianapolis Colts, 19-16. And there was that same Holiday Inn,
with a trash bin just where he remembered it from that day in the
spring of 1989 when he had symbolically said farewell to the sport
he loved.
</P>
<P>
   Titans fans are fond of calling the team's charge to Sunday's
Super Bowl ``the Music City Miracle,'' but Washburn said: ``The
real miracle is I'm here. It's pretty humbling.''
</P>
<P>
   In a business that promotes power and glamour, the 49-year-old
Washburn represents neither.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Shelby, N.C., he played football at Gardner-Webb
University and majored in physical education. Coaching football was
the only job he wanted _ and not the stand-in-a-tower kind of
coaching. He wanted to be a hands-on coach, ``an old-fashioned,
grab you, shake you kind of guy,'' as he put it last week.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people wanted him, though, after a former University of
South Carolina player named Tommy Chaikin wrote in Sports
Illustrated in 1988 that Washburn and other coaches at the school
had either ignored the widespread use of steroids or encouraged it.
Washburn and two other assistant coaches were eventually convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn had moved on to Purdue before the charges were handed
down, but quit as soon as the grand jury made its decision. ``It
ain't exactly cool to have a guy as a coach when he's been indicted
by a federal grand jury,'' he said in typically plain-spoken
fashion last week.
</P>
<P>
   He does not deny his guilt in the South Carolina case. Although
maintaining he was motivated by the notion of trying to help a
player get steroids from a safe source, he said: ``I made a
mistake. I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   After initially facing a possible sentence of four years in
prison and fines of $301,000, Washburn pleaded guilty to one
misdemeanor charge of importing steroids into South Carolina and
was sentenced to three months in a halfway house and three years of
probation. Then he got about the business of resurrecting his
career and helping his wife, Sandy, raise their two sons and
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   He credits his father with teaching him the necessary approach _
in the wake of another storm. Assigned the task of cutting up a
tree that had fallen in their yard, the young Washburn would saw
for a few minutes, then look up to check his progress. Finally, his
father said, ``Son, keep your head down and just keep sawing.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn put his head down and began to pursue his career again.
His first job was with the Arena Football League's Charlotte
Barons, whose offices, he noted, were on the inauspiciously named
Little Hope Road. From there it was on to the NFL's European league
and back to the Arena League before returning to the colleges in
his specialty _ defensive line _ first at Arkansas and later at
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, last year, the Titans went looking for a new defensive
line coach and Washburn's name came up. ``I guess a lot of people
must have said no to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his interview with coach Jeff Fisher, Washburn said:
``He asked me if I wanted to be a head coach and I said no. He
asked me if I wanted to be a defensive coordinator and I said no.
He asked if I wanted to be the best defensive line coach in NFL,
and I said, `No, I want to coach the best defensive line in the
NFL.'''
</P>
<P>
   If not the best, the Titans' line is certainly among the best.
Helped in no small measure by the arrival this year of the rookie
Jevon Kearse, the unit helped the team record 55 sacks this season,
third in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim has done a great job of pushing all the right buttons with
that group,'' the defensive coordinator, Gregg Williams, said.
``This is the first time since I've been here that we're setting
the tempo up front.''
</P>
<P>
   The run to the Super Bowl has paid other dividends for Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   With the money the Titans won by beating Jacksonville in the
American Football Conference championship game last week, Washburn
said that his wife told him they would at last be able to pay off
the debts that had built up over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, while the Titans were receiving the AFC
championship trophy, Washburn finally paused to look up for a
moment. ``I just stood off to the side and thought about where we'd
been and where we've gotten to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His voice quaked and a hint of a tear formed in his eyes _ and
then in a blink, he started telling a new story, one he had learned
on the football field.

MCCAIN PURSUES BUSH ON TAX LOOPHOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Senator John McCain said Saturday that
Governor George W. Bush's refusal to discuss closing tax loopholes
perpetuates ``an egregious situation'' that protects special
interests in Washington as well as Bush's contributors in the
Republican Party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in an interview, said that his proposal to eliminate
provisions in the tax code that enable corporate investors to write
off billions of dollars in deductions had ``met with fierce
opposition'' from big-money interests. And, as he presses the case
against loopholes in his campaign, he said the mood in that monied
``establishment has gone from concern to fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the interview, McCain's staff provided the Globe with
documents detailing what they call clear connections between Bush
and businesses that are sheltered by loopholes McCain wants to
eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush is believed to have enjoyed tax benefits in the
past from loopholes affecting the oil and gas industry and
professional sports teams, McCain said he did not deliberately
target these enterprises. ``It was just the best list we could come
up with, the loopholes we thought ought to be closed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday night's debate here, McCain challenged Bush to
identify ``what corporate loopholes you would close.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded by suggesting that McCain visit him in the White
House. ``You can outline all the different corporate loopholes you
think are wrong and we can pick and choose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we have to wait,'' McCain asked Saturday, ''to address
an egregious situation that is the glaring example of the influence
of special interests?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Bush objected to the tax proposal in order to protect
his own interests and those of his major contributors, McCain said,
``I don't know that to be true. But I'm frankly surprised that he
wouldn't address loopholes that make the tax code 44,000 pages long
and everybody agrees is a cornucopia of good deals for special
interests and a nightmare for average citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to McCain's remarks, Bush's communications director,
Karen Hughes, said the governor ``is willing to take a look at
loopholes in the tax code. But his first priority is to give every
single taxpayer in America a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain ``have a fundamental difference in approach when
it comes to taxes,'' Hughes said. She said she did not know why
McCain was raising the issue three days before the New Hampshire
primary. ``I think he's realized _ as he's acknowledged himself _
that his tax cut is too small and too close to President Clinton's
for the Republican nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign objected to several features of the McCain
proposal earlier this month in a detailed dissection of the plan.
Bush objected to putting an end to the exemption for investment
income of trade associations by noting that groups such as chambers
of commerce use the funds for scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's complaint is not the first time Bush has been drawn
into controversy regarding tax loopholes. A Dallas televison
station, WFAA, and the Austin American-Statesman newspaper reported
in 1995 that the Texas governor and a group of his wealthy Dallas
friends were aided by a special break on local property taxes at a
1,100-acre retreat called the Rainbo Club in east Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rainbo Club, where Bush has a home, lost a tax
exemption granted as a result of its claim that it operated a tree
farm on the land, the group applied for a new break in 1991 on the
grounds that the property was used for recreational purposes. As a
result, Bush and his associates are taxed at one-eighth the rate of
other property owners in the area, according to new reports at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Head, a populist Democrat and onetime member of the Texas
legislature, said in a telephone interview that he had been trying
to call attention to the discrepancy for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Henderson County are paying higher school taxes
because Mr. Bush and his friends are availing themselves of a tax
break,'' said Head, now a lawyer in Athens, Texas, near the site of
the Rainbo Club.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, when he faced questions about the Rainbo Club four years
ago, explained that the tax ``exemption is not targeted for a
specific group of people. This is a set of laws that say we value
land based upon its use. I pay whatever I am assessed. This was not
purchased for a tax break. It was purchased as a place to be able
to go fish, which I love to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign document is designed to show how the Arizona
senator's plan for federal taxes would affect Bush's backers.
According to the research paper, McCain has targeted ``a number of
special oil and gas tax loopholes that are dear to the hearts of
the oil and gas industry that has contributed so heavily to George
W. Bush's campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas interests accounted for $1.2 million in
contributions to the Bush campaign, according to a review of last
fall's Federal Election Commission reports by the Center for
Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Another McCain initiative would prevent trade organizations,
such as the American Bankers Association, from enjoying tax-free
investments on interest-bearing savings accounts. ``Banking groups
have been significant contributors to George Bush's campaign,'' the
McCain documents say, citing $843,000 in donations from banking
interests.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also targeted tax-free bonds that subsidize stadium
construction projects for professional sports teams. At the same
time, McCain proposes to eliminate business write-offs for skyboxes
in these new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ownership role with the Texas Rangers major league
baseball team ``was a perfect example of taking advantage of
loopholes,'' said Howard Opinsky, McCain's campaign spokesman. ``He
turned a $1 million investment into $15 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Rangers soared after a new stadium was built
for the team, with the bulk of the cost borne by the city of
Arlington, Texas. When the Rangers were sold in 1998, Bush received
$15 million for his share of the team. According to news accounts,
Bush orginally paid $606,000 to become a partner in the team.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said there was a ``direct relation'' between his tax
proposal and his efforts to limit special interests' influence in
campaign finance. ``These people,'' he said, ``clearly have
excessive, inordinate influence.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief benefactors for the Bush campaign are wealthy
businessmen from the oil and gas and banking industries. They are
known as ``pioneers,'' and they have pledged to raise at least
$100,000 each for the campaign. Asked if his proposal to eliminate
tax loopholes had been embraced by any of the pioneers, McCain
laughed. ``I kind of doubt they would, but I haven't had a chance
to ask them.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sunday is Super Bowl Sunday, an orgy of commercialism
with a championship football game between the Tennessee Titans and
the St. Louis Rams squeezed in.
</P>
<P>
   But for 3,000 students at Alcorn State University in Lorman,
Miss., and for 13,553 at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar
Falls, Iowa, this is a day when two revered alumni step onto an
improbable national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McNair, the Tennessee Titans' quarterback, became a legend
in a four-year career at Alcorn State. Kurt Warner, the St. Louis
Rams' quarterback, is a hero at Northern Iowa. But his lore came
after college, when he played in the Arena Football League and NFL
Europe, and then worked as a stockboy for a Hy-Vee store, on the
way to being the NFL's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention being showered on McNair and Warner, the
impact of their success on their colleges is equally compelling.
From the respective school presidents, to former coaches to student
bodies, McNair and Warner underline the lessons of perseverance and
determination. But at a time when many individuals feel dwarfed by
billion-dollar mergers and takeovers, when roads to success become
narrower, McNair and Warner reinforce the fading sense that
anything is possible, that the American Dream is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams have great human-interest stories,'' said Dr.
Clinton Bristow Jr., the Alcorn State president. ``McNair is
special because he comes from a small town, Mount Olive, Miss., a
small university and a small state. It's great motivation for our
students: you don't have to live in Chicago, Detroit or Washington,
don't have to attend major football programming in order to be
recognized and achieve big things. You have to work hard and strive
for excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dr. Robert D. Koob, president of Northern Iowa, Warner's
success is less a metaphor for possibility than a confirmation of
another alumnus who is doing well. ``We're very proud,'' Koob said.
``I'm sure we will brag a lot about what Kurt has done. We want our
students to do everything well, succeed at whatever level they
choose. Kurt is our most recognized example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn State's Bristow declared Super Sunday ``Steve McNair
Day'' at the historically black university. Students will gather at
Union Hall to have pizza and soft drinks and watch McNair and the
Titans battle the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Bristow will address the students. ``We'll pray
and we will recommit to core values we stress _ competence, work
ethic, citizenship and the idea that failure is not an option,''
Bristow said. ``Our motto for the day is `Achieve Like Steve.'''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's former coach at Alcorn State, Cardell Jones, left the
university, in what Jones said was a ``mutual parting of the
ways,'' two years after McNair graduated. Jones is coaching a
semipro team in Jackson, Miss. ``Just good to know that I had
something to do with his success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Allen, who coached Warner at Northern Iowa, is the now the
coach at Kansas. Allen has done as much explaining as celebrating.
He kept Warner on the bench for three seasons, finally starting him
in his fifth year. The man whom Allen played ahead of Warner, Jay
Johnson, is the Kansas quarterbacks coach. ``We're all happy for
Kurt,'' Allen said. ``He was patient, and he worked hard, and when
his time came he produced.''
</P>
<P>
   What do McNair and Warner mean to their respective institutions?
</P>
<P>
   Bristow hopes contributions to the endowment fund will increase
and Alcorn State will come into broader view. ``We don't get this
kind of national and international publicity every day,'' Bristow
said. We've got to take advantage of the national exposure to build
our endowment.''
</P>
<P>
   Koob says Northern Iowa enjoys Warner's success from a distance.
``We don't want to exploit his success. This is Kurt's moment. We
are pleased and proud. We're not trying to parlay his success into
anything for the university,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koob said that only recently has the news media even paid
attention to Northern Iowa when recounting the Warner fairy tale.
``We started calling ourselves `The University of Nowhere,' because
so many said Warner came out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Like McNair and Warner, the university presidents, Bristow and
Koob, took circuitous routes to reach their own Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bristow was born in Ramere, Ala. He left the state to attend
Northwestern University, where he graduated in 1971, earned a law
degree in 1974 and his Ph.D. in 1977. He served as dean of the
business college at Chicago State from 1981 to 1995 and as
president of the Chicago Board of Education from 1990 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from Alabama and an all-black high school, I want to
give and build,'' Bristow said. ``I feel fortunate to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Koob was born in Graettinger, Iowa, a town of less than 1,000.
He didn't plan to attend college, ``My father died when I was 10,''
he said. There really was no money in the family.'' A classmate of
his father's who sat on a board at Northern Iowa arranged for him
to attend the school and provided him a small scholarship. Koob
graduated from Northern Iowa in 1962 and received his Ph.D. from
Kansas in 1967. He worked at North Dakota State from 1967-88, at
California Polytechnic State-San Luis Obispo from 1990-95, and
returned to Northern Iowa as president in 1995, the first alumnus
in the school's 174-year history to serve as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very in touch with the university; I believe deeply in
the university,'' Koob said. ``The difference between the have's
and have-not's is the amount of education. Lives have been changed
because they have had an opportunity to attend college. This
country is a world leader in educating all of our people in a
public way.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bristow, Sunday is a time to gather his students and
meditate. ``In life you have to pause and reflect on every positive
thing that happens for your institution,'' he said. ``If he wins
that becomes a bigger step, that brings us closer, that connects us
to the next level of achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hero may emerge Sunday night at Super Bowl XXXIV, but
not in Lorman, Miss., not in Cedar Falls, Iowa. The McNair and
Warner show.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a place like New York where you have 10 million people,
this is a blip,'' Bristow said. ``This is big-time news for us!''

ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL, POLISHED PAGEANTRY VS. ONGOING SEMINAR
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ It took Gov. George W. Bush all of 17 minutes
Saturday morning to share his optimistic, can-do vision for a
better America with the crowd of people at Yoken's restaurant here.
It took 101 minutes more for him to get out of the banquet room.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the roughly 1,000 people in attendance formed a
protean sea around Bush, engulfing him, jostling to be near him,
posing for pictures with him or handing him objects to sign: a cap,
a shoe, a picture of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Sen. John McCain was finishing up a
campaign event of his own, at a high school in Raymond. He too
mingled extensively with adoring voters. But he also spent about an
hour fielding detailed, probing questions from his audience of 300
people and giving them reflective, sometimes somber answers.
</P>
<P>
   Why, asked one woman, were so many children moved to violence? &QL; 
``I think that children today are being exposed to influences that
are both pernicious and very destructive,'' said McCain, not the
least bit reticent about such tidings of doom.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush and McCain began the final weekend before the New
Hampshire primary, they exhibited some of the stark differences to
wooing the state's voters that have been hallmarks of their efforts
from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems to enjoy glad-handing and mugging more than prolonged
and wide-ranging discussions; McCain likes to talk and talk and
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Bush's events have a more staged aura to them while
McCain's have a slightly shaggy, less predictable feel.
</P>
<P>
   When voters choose between them, it will be in part a verdict on
the power of polished pageantry versus the appeal of an ongoing
seminar.
</P>
<P>
   The way the candidates went on to spend the rest of day was a
case in point. Bush headed from the restaurant to an indoor soccer
arena, where he strode out onto the field, briefly took the
position of goalie and let a squad of boys try to get the ball past
him. It was made for television.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon Saturday he attended a country-western concert
that his campaign had set up, featuring the music of the Bellamy
Brothers and a visit from Bush's father and mother.
</P>
<P>
   Their appearance was in perfect keeping with a campaign that has
frequently relied on political star wattage. Bush had only one
question-and-answer session on his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It was a non-stop talkathon for a man who seems never to tire of
that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some variations on the theme over the past week.
Bush has packed multiple question-and-answer sessions into a busy
morning or long afternoon. For his part, McCain often needs as much
time as Bush does to mingle individually with supporters at the end
of an event. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But by and large, McCain's events have tended to be less formal,
while many of Bush's were either starched, subdued or enveloped in
a sense of grand ceremony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the lavishly financed favorite of most of the Republican
establishment, tends to hold his encounters with voters in large
rooms at prominent local businesses. And he is much more likely
than McCain to stage carefully choreographed images that work well
in quick video segments. On Thursday, for example, Bush devoted a
hefty chunk of time to an appearance at an elementary school in
Nashua, where he alternately smiled broadly or tapped one of his
feet as schoolchildren read him compositions they had written,
performed a skit and danced to a song by Gloria Estefan.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he visited a snowmobile store in Hooksett, hopped
onto one and did several laps around a field by the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better than a press conference,'' he exulted, somewhat
tellingly, as television crews and newspaper photographers recorded
his testosterone-rife shenanigans. ``It's exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who campaigned in many different states while McCain
focused his time and energy in New Hampshire, was slow to fully
embrace the kind of town-hall-style meetings that have long been
the staple of McCain's campaign here.
</P>
<P>
   By late last year, some campaign aides in New Hampshire were
publicly grumbling that Bush was bound to lose the state if he did
not reform his ways.
</P>
<P>
   To a significant extent, he has. On Thursday, he matched the
intensity and duration of McCain's schedule, starting early, ending
late and conducting five question-and-answer sessions, although one
was with the schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways that their styles overlap. Both love to rib
reporters. Both have mischievous expressions and streaks. Both tap
an innate talent for coming up with little jokes on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at a public forum in Plaistow, a woman who
identified herself as ``a recovering Democrat'' asked McCain a
question about legalizing hemp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' he said, ``you're not quite totally recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was told by a reporter that Gov. George W. Bush travels
with his own pillow, McCain gestured at his wife, Cindy, and said,
``So do I.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking at an insurance company in Portsmouth on Friday,
had the pitch-perfect response when one of the employees, intending
to ask Bush how he would promote diversity in this country,
committed a possible slip and said ``company.''
</P>
<P>
   Her colleagues roared with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how you feel,'' Bush said, a self-effacing reference to
his own bulging tote board of verbal miscues. ``Some of the best of
us mispronounce words.'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   And both men often find themselves veritably mobbed by voters at
the end of events.
</P>
<P>
   But the dynamics diverge. McCain's fans approach him as an
American hero; many of Bush's seem to see him as a political
celebrity, and their cuddly picture-posing has the air of a visit
with a department store Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has no security detail around him; Bush has several
extremely visible guards with fancy ear pieces, dark jackets and
somber miens. They stand, rigidly, as something of a metaphor for
the slightly greater distance that Bush, in comparison with McCain,
keeps between himself and chance encounters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain travels in the same bus as many of the reporters assigned
to him. He rarely holds news conferences, because there is no need.
He spends his whole day talking.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's principal contact with reporters is at official ``media
availabilities'' that place him at a lectern. He rides in his own
bus, with senior aides or political allies, with reporters trailing
in two other buses.
</P>
<P>
   And these days he is more likely to be escorted to events or
joined there by political bigwigs, some of them making a showy, big
deal about throwing an endorsement his way.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it was Jack Kemp, the 1996 vice presidential
nominee. On Friday, it was John Sununu, the former governor of New
Hampshire and President Bush's onetime chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, there was no splashy new supporter to introduce,
but Bush did have his father and the Bellamy Brothers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain was left to joke about such an embarrassment of riches,
as when he referred Saturday to another prominent endorsement that
Bush had attracted this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say right now,'' McCain told reporters, ``that Orrin
Hatch is off my short list for postmaster general.'' &QL;

DYNASTIES FADE IN NEW NFL 
KEARSE IN DEMAND 
TAGLIABUE'S CHALLENGES 
FLAG-THROWING REVIEW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when dynasties ruled the NFL? And the National Football
Conference dominated its counterpart, causing league executives,
players and the sports media to wonder when the American Conference
would ever win another Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Those days are long gone. In fact, they may never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985 to 1997, the NFC won 13 consecutive Super Bowls,
humiliating the AFC and causing football to wonder what needed to
be done to end the streak and make the Super Bowl more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Well something did happen. Free agency among players, a rigid
salary cap and movement among head coaches forever changed the
landscape of professional football. Now, the league is full of
teams that are evenly matched. Dynasties can no longer flourish
because players change teams quickly and the salary cap prevents a
club from keeping players who give a team depth.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants won Super Bowl XXV with both Phil Simms and
Jeff Hostetler on its roster. These days, because of the cap, it is
almost impossible to keep two players of such quality at the same
position on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the talent is thinned out across the league, which leads
to parity, and the end of great teams that dominate the sport for
years. ``The days of the dynasty are over,'' the ESPN football
analyst Joe Theismann said. ``Free agency and the salary cap have
ended it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to see teams get on top and stay there for a
lot of years,'' he continued. ``Players jump around too much now,
breaking up the great teams and opening the way for somebody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Theismann added: ``This Super Bowl is a perfect example. Who'd
have thought at the start of the season that St. Louis or Tennessee
would be here? The reason they are is because of the parity around
the league.''
</P>
<P>
   During the NFC's streak, San Francisco won three Super Bowls,
Dallas three, Washington two and the Giants two. It was not until
free agency began to take full effect after the 1997 season that
Denver broke the streak by beating Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The salary cap also means that teams can come crashing to the
ground faster than ever. One injury can devastate a franchise, such
as when running back Jamal Anderson was lost for this season with a
knee injury and the defending NFC champions crashed and burned.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is losing a player of Anderson's caliber a terrific
blow, but teams also do not have the salary-cap room to afford a
replacement player who approaches the injured player in ability.
The same thing happened to Denver this season when running back
Terrell Davis was also lost for much of the year with a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``As hard as it is to get on top,'' Floyd Reese, Tennessee's
general manager, said ``it's even harder to stay there.'' The
Titans and Rams may soon find that out for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse in Demand
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, Tennessee's rookie defensive lineman
Jevon Kearse came into coach Jeff Fisher's office with a long face
and big problem. As he became one of the star talents in the
league, eventually being named the defensive rookie of the year,
people began clamoring for his time, especially the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse is one of those players who cannot say no. He is too
nice. But he was becoming frustrated, and the attention he was
receiving began to affect him on the field. So Kearse, Fisher and
the Titans' public relations staff worked out a strict schedule for
Kearse. It allowed him to have more of a normal life and to
concentrate more on football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an educational process for Jevon,'' the defensive
coordinator, Gregg Williams, said. ``He's a great kid. He doesn't
like to say no. He's going to have to learn to manage his time.''
</P>
<P>
   This week was particular busy for him. Along with the usual
clamor for tickets from friends and family members, he also posed
for a Sports Illustrated cover.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't being asked for something, he mostly stayed in
his hotel room, lying low.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole experience has been wonderful, but a little
overwhelming,'' Kearse said of Super Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for Kearse will only increase, especially if he
dominates Super Bowl XXXIV against St. Louis. And as talented as he
is, that is entirely possible.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue's Challenges
</P>
<P>
   When Commissioner Paul Tagliabue looks to the immediate future
of the NFL, he sees two challenges that could alter what is now the
lush landscape of professional football. The sport is doing
incredibly well, but two things that have the commissioner's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   First, he wants to secure an extension of the collective
bargaining agreement, which expires in 2002. Tagliabue and Gene
Upshaw, the executive director of the players association, have a
good relationship, so there is little chance that negotiations
between the players and the league would be bitter. Still, there is
increasing frustration among some of the younger, lower-profile
players who feel that their needs are not being met. They are cut
from teams with impunity, and the disparity in salaries between
them and the stars is growing. They may want to flex their muscle
in the next agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Tagliabue thinks football needs to dig deeper into the
Internet. More fans are getting news, and watching games and
highlights, from cyberspace. The Internet, Tagliabue said, ``is
going to transform how fans see the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Flag-Throwing Review
</P>
<P>
   This off-season the competition committee will review if changes
are needed in the way officials throw their flags, in light of
Cleveland Browns offensive lineman Orlando Brown's being hit in the
eye with one this season, and his subsequent attack on the official
who tossed it. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue later suspended Brown
indefinitely. Tagliabue had a telephone hearing with Brown two
weeks ago and will decide on the exact length of the punishment
after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But a player's getting hit in the face with a flag, or anywhere
on his body for that matter, is a fluke. The NFL says that 2,500
flags a year are thrown in the direction of a foul, and none of
those, aside from the one that hit Brown, has caused injury.

COMMENTARY: TRIBAL JUSTICE? THEY'D SETTLE FOR SYRACUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ONONDAGA INDIAN NATION _ When representatives of the Onondaga
Nation met with New York state officials last year to identify land
that they say was illegally taken from them, they mentioned one
eye-catching parcel: a piece of ground commonly known as the city
of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Syracuse, 160,000 people,'' Chief Irving Powless
said the other day in his large log home on rural Onondaga land
just south of Syracuse. ``It's in total violation.''
</P>
<P>
   Consternation and hostility over Indian land claims are boiling
in central New York. The Onondagas' announced plans to sue
asserting theft of the state's fifth-largest city is hardly
lowering the flame.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of who owns Syracuse is not just about land,
since few debate who was here first. Like the other land disputes,
it is also about time.
</P>
<P>
   To the white landowners, the Indians are living in the past.
``To claim the whole city of Syracuse, it's mind-boggling,'' said
Mary Teelin, a Syracuse nurse. Said Leon Koziol, a lawyer for the
landowners, ``It is an excellent way to raise large amounts of cash
on the backs of taxpayers to settle a 200-year-old wrong that could
never be corrected in modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Indians, the past is inseparable from the present. They
say the white landowners see history as a commodity, easily
discarded and left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Powless and another Onondaga chief, Oren Lyons, grew up hunting
and fishing together in the rolling hills and streams of their
7,000-acre nation. Powless is 70 and Lyons is a few months younger,
but full, smooth faces and ponytails hide that. They were raised on
the story of stolen land and a debt owed by the descendants of
European invaders. Now they are trying to collect it.
</P>
<P>
   The old treaties are alive to them. ``I was there,'' Powless
said. ``My relatives were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian land disputes, settled in many states, rage on in New
York. In 1985, the Supreme Court found that the state violated
federal law 200 years ago by buying Indian land without federal
approval. George Washington had vowed to protect Indian land in
exchange for peace.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury in Syracuse is now considering how much the state
owes the Cayuga Indians for 64,000 acres taken illegally. A claim
of 250,000 acres by the Oneida Indians is being negotiated. The
Onondagas' claim is the most dramatic, seeking land and
compensation for some of the most valuable property in this part of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The moment is precarious for the Onondagas. ``The potential for
failure is high,'' Lyons said. Once a claim is resolved, recouping
more land will be difficult, and their legend of the unpaid debt
will be forever altered.
</P>
<P>
   The job of the modern Indian chief is to uphold the traditions
without fumbling the present. The chiefs have their eye on both.
They want land around Syracuse's polluted Onondaga Lake, sacred
ground to Indians, and they want the lake cleaned up. They'll seek
no evictions of private landowners. ``We were chased all over the
state of New York,'' Powless said. ``We'd never do that.'' They
might settle for land elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs see themselves weathering a continuum of hostility
from Gov. DeWitt Clinton, who they say obtained land illegally, to
Gov. George Pataki, who they say is resisting settling claims.
Their goal, they say, is their nation's survival. To show their
enduring tradition, Powless, with a turquoise earring dangling from
his left ear, sings an ancient Indian song. The background music is
a fax machine whirring on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't live in the past, they do live with it. And it
gives them purpose, especially now.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, an American studies professor at State University of New
York Buffalo, said that when he graduated from Syracuse University,
Powless' father took him fishing in a boat. The older man asked the
new graduate if he now knew who he was. The young man said his name
and his Indian name. But there was silence and he knew his answer
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned around and pointed to a bluff and pointed to a pine
tree,'' Lyons said. ``He said: `You're just like the pine tree.
You're anchored to the earth. Earth is your mother. You're not
going to get away from it.'''

   Leon Smith looked at his right arm, then at his left. As he
awoke in a hospital after a suicide attempt, he asked a doctor why
only the left arm still had an intravenous line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach said to take the IV out of your right arm,'' she
said. ``He said that's your shooting hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith wondered why a team that did not want him around would
make sure that his shooting hand was spared. The coach, the Dallas
Mavericks assistant Bill Peterson, said later that he could not
think of any other way to help _ besides offering a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Smith semiconscious that day last November at Parkland
Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Peterson was no longer observing the
big, strong 19-year-old with vast athletic potential, a
6-foot-10-inch, 240-pound Chicago schoolboy star who was selected
in the first round of the NBA draft last June. Smith was now a
deeply troubled soul who had tried to end his life by ingesting a
half-bottle of aspirin, approximately 250 tablets' worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't instruct the doctor to take the IV out, I just
mentioned it,'' Peterson recalled. ``People can look at that the
way they want, but at least I got in there to visit him. Where was
everybody else when Leon needed help?''
</P>
<P>
   The question has haunted, if not defined Leon Smith from the
very beginning. Abandoned by his father and removed from his
mother's custody when he was 5, Smith grew up a ward of the state
of Illinois. He moved from group home to shelter, forced sometimes
to rummage through Dumpsters for food with his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   But he could play the game. At Martin Luther King High School in
Chicago, he dominated opponents routinely enough to be considered
one of America's top hoop prospects. He had his mind set on
following the path of other prep superstars who skipped college and
went right to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But if Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett are models of players who
were mature enough athletically and emotionally to make that huge
jump, Leon Smith's sad and tumultuous basketball odyssey is a
cautionary tale _ one that is forcing the NBA to rethink how to
decide which teen-agers are capable of going right from high school
to the pros and what to do with those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   Smith stormed out of the gym during his first practice with the
Mavericks last summer. He fired two agents in three months. He was
arrested twice, had his contract suspended and spent 31 days in a
Dallas psychiatric center after his suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unfair to call Leon a poster child for anything
but Leon,'' David Stern, the NBA commissioner, said. ``All of these
young men are individuals. But I remain convinced, in a broader
context, that we need to disincentivize players who have other
options from coming into the NBA too young.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is in Houston now, living in a two-bedroom apartment with
a childhood friend. He is working out daily, hoping to earn another
shot in the league. The Mavericks are expected to waive him within
days, agreeing to pay Smith his full $1.45 million salary over 10
years. He is expecting to work out for two teams next week, but it
is unclear whether he will return to the NBA this season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and the people around him understand there are more
important hurdles to clear. And while many people who were close to
Smith in Chicago are busy assigning blame, Smith says he is ready
to accept responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it on myself,'' he said before a recent workout in
Houston. ``When I was in the hospital, I had time to grow up. I sat
in my room and I cried. I sat in there and thought about what I
did, and realized that things didn't have to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the executive director of the National Basketball
Players Association, and Purvis Short, the union's director of
player programs, have spent the past two months helping Smith put
his life back together. He still attends counseling sessions in
Dallas and Houston, and he has been off all medication for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family from Chicago have painted the Mavericks as an
organization not equipped to deal with such a sensitive situation.
Smith, though, bears no strong resentment toward anyone. Not even a
system that caters to impressionable teen-agers who happen to play
basketball well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did the best they could even when they didn't know to
help me,'' he said. ``I don't hold grudges. And I don't feel sorry
for myself. I'm here now. That's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had long dreamed of playing in the NBA, and he had no
shortage of elders and peers to help nurture the fantasy. In
elementary school, he once blocked 27 shots in a single game. In
his freshman year in high school, Smith says, he decided he wanted
to become a pro some day. He had grown nearly 5 inches over the
previous summer, to a gangly and uncoordinated 6 feet 9 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my teammates were teasing me, saying, `You can't block a
shot, you can't even dunk,''' he said. ``I couldn't. My knees hurt
so bad. But Kevin Garnett had just come out of high school the year
before. So I was, like, `Man, I bet you I go straight from high
school to the NBA'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After his junior year in high school, Smith attended Sonny
Vaccaro's prestigious ABCD camp at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
The camp is a showcase for many of the country's top high school
stars. Vaccaro approached Smith after the camp ended, asking him if
he wanted to be drafted in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Smith said, his voice thick with excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a done deal,'' Vaccaro told him.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Bauer, whose mother runs a group home where Smith lived for
eight years, said the conversation was a watershed. ``Once Sonny
confirmed it, Leon became obsessed with making it,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Competing for space on the wall of Smith's room were posters and
pictures of nearly every current NBA player who skipped college and
turned pro. Kobe Bryant, sailing in for a dunk. Kevin Garnett,
scowling while harnessing a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Smith led nationally ranked King High to the Chicago public
school championship his senior year, averaging 25 points, 15
rebounds and eight blocked shots a game. He briefly explored
enrolling at Fresno State and Rhode Island, but he feared that his
poor grades would force him to sit out a year to become eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be on TV,'' he said. ``That's all I wanted to be.
I wanted to get out of the projects. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith acknowledged that he made his decision without much
consultation. ``A lot of these kids have families, and their
families could show them how to handle themselves in certain
situations,'' he said. ``I didn't have a family. They can put it on
me, but if a child decides he wants to come out of high school and
play in the NBA, that's his decision. And if the teams feel like
he's ready, then I think he should do it.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Smith's first agent, Dan Fegan, said, ``Look, Leon wanted to do
this. No one was going to tell him he couldn't. People may have
given him ideas about turning pro, but he wasn't pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was selected with the final pick of the draft's first
round last June. The Mavericks had not met him or worked him out.
The following month, Smith flew from Chicago to Dallas with his
only possession, a bag of dirty laundry. He moved into an
unfurnished, upscale apartment. With loans, he bought two beds, a
television and stereo equipment.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just threw him a little bit,'' said Doris Bauer,
the woman who ran the Lydia Home, where Smith lived from age 5 to
13. ``He was used to coming home to people, and all of a sudden
he's got a big, empty apartment with nothing. Leon was alone
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's first practice with the Mavericks ended with him
storming off the floor in front of television cameras. Another
player had been slow running sprints, so Donnie Nelson, an
assistant coach, told the group to run again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go run the sprints,'' Smith told Nelson, who asked Smith
to repeat himself because he was so stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson, the team's coach and general manager (and Donnie
Nelson's father) soon decided that Smith was too disruptive to be
allowed around the team. He assigned Peterson and Kiki Vandeweghe,
another assistant coach, to work with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, there was just a lot of frustration,'' Smith
said. ``When they first drafted me, they were telling me I had to
go somewhere else to get my game. I felt like they were cheating me
out of my opportunities. I put my name in the NBA draft, because I
felt I could play in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks decided that Smith was not ready to play in the
league, and told him that one way to improve his raw game was to
play for a year with a minor league team in St. Louis. Smith
resisted. His heart was set on following his heroes by going right
into the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson felt Smith's presence was so disruptive that he pleaded
with Smith's new agent, Matt Muehlebach, to make sure his client
did not attend the Mavericks' season opener Nov. 2 _ Smith's 19th
birthday. Undeterred, Smith paid for his own plane ticket from
Chicago and bought a ticket to the game from a scalper. The
Mavericks contend that a season ticket-holder gave Smith the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt him more than anything,'' said Short. ``The team not
wanting him around really set him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and the Mavericks have been accused of gross negligence
in their handling of Smith, especially by Smith's supporters in
Chicago. ``They treated him like a piece of meat,'' said Sonny Cox,
Smith's high school coach. ``Dallas did that boy wrong. They talk
about a support system, but they're trying to save their own
behinds at this point. They segregated Leon from everyone instead
of truly trying to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson defended the team's actions and insisted that there
was a support system for Smith. But he also conceded that he had
drafted Smith for one simple reason: Nelson and other Mavericks
officials were very worried that the Lakers were going to use the
first pick in the second round to acquire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the lack of big, talented people in the NBA, and
in college basketball, and if we didn't take him someone else would
have,'' said Donnie Nelson. ``That was the worst draft in 10 years.
If you're going to take a risk, the rule of thumb is, take it on a
big guy with some potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't delve into Leon's medical records, but we knew
about the issues and the challenges. It just goes against any
grain. You do not cut or trade talented young players, unless it's
for fantastic reasons. Leon had a 7-foot-5 wingspan. Looking back,
maybe you sometimes get blinded by talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Said one high-ranking league official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, ``They can defend themselves all they want, but how do
you draft a player without ever talking to him?''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure built on Smith. Friends kept calling him for money.
He felt the Mavericks did not want him around. Then he and his
girlfriend, Cassie Pondexter, a 16-year-old basketball star in
Chicago, broke up.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 14, Smith swallowed the aspirin tablets and was found by
a friend, passed out on the floor of his Dallas town house, with
green war paint smeared on his face. After being released from the
hospital, he returned two weeks later to Chicago, where he was
immediately arrested twice within two days for threatening
Pondexter and damaging her mother's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to tell anymore that I was hurt, because I
was,'' Smith said. ``When you care for somebody, you want to see
them. I had to get past that.''

</P>
<P>
   People in the NBA are struggling with the lessons of Leon
Smith's saga.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just lay this off on the league and say it somehow
failed him,'' said Gregg Popovich, the coach and general manager of
the San Antonio Spurs, who had actually drafted Smith with the
intention of trading him to the Mavericks in a prearranged
deal.``They've got numerous programs to help them. But if we're
going to draft these young kids, individual teams are going to have
to install the proper support systems. Economically, emotionally,
psychologically or whatever, they need more support than we're
currently giving them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, the NBA commissioner, said, ``This is an area we and the
players have to look at again.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This isn't an expertise that we come to easily, but
we're determined to do whatever is necessary to ease the transition
of these young men.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Smith is trying to learn from his experience. On this day in
Houston, he looks at the rim and down at his feet behind the
3-point line. He is going one on one with Ashley Hunter, a mature
20-year-old with whom Smith grew up and who lives with him on the
recommendation of the players association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottoms up!'' Smith says as he releases a rainbow jump shot
from 25 feet away on the left baseline.
</P>
<P>
   The ball passes gently through the net at the Westside Tennis
Complex, where the Rockets practice in the morning and a
19-year-old trying to make a comeback practices in the afternoon.
Hunter retrieves the ball and tosses it off the backboard for his
friend, who leaps high and tomahawks it through the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm ready to play on this level,'' Smith says, pausing
between shots. ``I'm just working as hard as I can, just in case
somebody calls me up. I'm in Triple-A right now. I'm trying to make
it to the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Smith grabs the ball, turns and fires another 3-pointer.
All net. All better. At least for now.

IN MIAMI, DUELING DEMONSTRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS third demonstration at end, fully identifies police
department in 5th graph.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ About 200 women, mostly Cuban-American, dressed in black
and white, with white ribbons attached to their shirts and carrying
white roses, stopped traffic Saturday in the heart of downtown
Miami as they marched and prayed in memory of Elizabet Brotons, who
drowned while fleeing Cuba in November with her 6-year-old son,
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty blocks north, along a poorer stretch of Biscayne
Boulevard, nearly as many men and women demonstrated beside the
Miami offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to urge
the Clinton administration to wrest the boy from the great-uncle
who is keeping him here and to return him promptly to his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sizes of the demonstrations were similar, little else
was. About 50 police officers held the marchers seeking the boy's
repatriation behind barricades to keep them off Biscayne Boulevard
and largely out of sight beside a shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, a half-dozen police cars blocked traffic to permit the
marchers seeking to keep Elian in Florida to proceed unimpeded and
relied on the women themselves to control their troops. No
crowd-control officers were in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Dade Police Department, asked about its different
handling of the two marches, said Saturday that no one was
available this weekend to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cristina Ruiz, an advertising executive, who organized and
led the Mothers' March for Human Rights downtown, said the rally
was not a political demonstration fanning the Cuban exile
community's 41-year feud with the government of Fidel Castro but
one ``in honor of Elian's mother and any mother who has lost her
children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very American,'' Ms. Ruiz said over the blaring horns
of the disrupted traffic in front of the Miami Intercontinental
Hotel, a Biscayne Boulevard landmark. ``This is a women's march.''
</P>
<P>
   But anti-Castro posters peppered the air above the marchers,
along with portraits of Ms. Brotons, who was divorced from the
boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. A child in a stroller carried a
sign reading, ``Love is great. Freedom is greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, in demonstrations like these, the image of Elian as a
refugee from tyranny has been evolving into a miraculous creature
of God, described as having survived three days in the ocean
because dolphins encircled him to protect him from sharks. Mothers
and children held posters depicting Elian cradling a ceramic baby
Jesus. ``Elian knows Christ but is being denied,'' the words on it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Far up Biscayne Boulevard, demonstrators favoring the boy's
return to his father assembled by the Interreligious Foundation for
Community Organization, which is also known as Pastors for Peace,
wore lapel buttons with portraits of Elian. The picketers' mission
was wholly different.
</P>
<P>
   Their target is neither Castro nor Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's
great-uncle in whose house the boy is living here, but Attorney
General Janet Reno and the Clinton administration. For more than a
month, the administration has declined to enforce the immigration
service's repatriation order so Lazaro Gonzalez and the Cuban exile
community can make a case in the courts to take custody of him
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guilt is in Washington,'' one sign said. Marchers chanted,
``The INS needs to know. Send Elian home! Janet Reno needs to know.
Send Elian home!'' A poster read, ``Rip child from father? This is
family values?''
</P>
<P>
   On the picket line, Richard Becker of San Francisco, western
region coordinator for the International Action Center, a liberal
organization founded by former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, said
he believed most Americans shared his view that the government
should both end the embargo on trade with Cuba and give custody of
the boy to his father there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for the majority voice of this country to
be heard in this community,'' Becker said. ``There's a minority
here, Cuban-American, that uses tension and intimidation against
those who want to see an end of the hostility and the blockade
against Cuba. Those voices dominate despite the fact that they are
extreme right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another demonstrator, Andres Gomez, who is Cuban-American and
national coordinator of an anti-embargo group here, said: ``We want
a normalization of relationships. We have been working for that for
20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian,'' said a poster, ``is a metaphor for the madness of the
embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   In another protest, organized by the Miami Based Democracy
Movement, which wants Elian to stay in Miami, more than 50 boats
cruised around Biscayne Bay later in the afternoon as passengers
waved both Cuban and American flags and held signs reading ``Elian
we will fight for your rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask America to search for the truth,'' Ramon Saul Sanchez,
one of the organizers, said. ``We are oppressed and we want to be
free.''

ARTHUR MCMANMON, 90; PLAYED FOR ROCKNE AT NOTRE DAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur T. McManmon of Westwood, the last surviving starter for a
Notre Dame football team coached by the legendary Knute Rockne,
died of a heart attack at Norwood (Mass.) Hospital on Thursday. He
was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McManmon was born on his family farm in Dracut, Mass. He
graduated from Notre Dame in 1931, where he started at right tackle
on two consecutive undefeated national championship teams that were
the toast of the sports world under Rockne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train would stop and people would gather around. People
would come in and get autographs,'' he said in a Globe interview
two years ago. ``There would be a couple of hundred people there.
It was the typical thing.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Mr. McManmon went to Hollywood and
participated in the production of two movies about the life of his
coach, ``Knute Rockne, All American'' and ``The Spirit of Notre
Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McManmon came back to New England and attended Harvard
Busness School and had a long career with Donnelly Advertising, the
East Coast's largest billboard company, rising to general manager.
He then became president of the Brockhouse America Corp. and of the
legendary Indian MotocycleCo. of Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McManmon was a golfer and a longtime member of the Charles
River Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves two sons, Thomas A., of Chestnut Hill, and Peter D.,
of Newton Center, Mass.; two daughters, Maura Collins of Darien,
Conn., and Alecia Kindgren of Tempe, Arizona; and 11 grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With Russian soldiers dying again in Chechnya, Galya A.
is ready to do anything to keep her gangly 18-year-old son, Ruslan,
from doing his compulsory two-year military service.
</P>
<P>
   If she could, she would bribe her local draft board. But on the
paltry $25 pensions she and her disabled husband get each month, it
would take them another lifetime to save up the going price, which
ranges from $2,000 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   She could try to dramatize Ruslan's list of childhood ailments,
but none is serious enough to warrant a coveted medical exemption.
</P>
<P>
   So at a time when draftees are going to war just six months
after they learn to fire a gun, what is a desperate mother to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Divorce, my dear,'' said Ludmila Obraztsova, a volunteer for
the Soldiers' Mothers Committee who conducts a weekly seminar on
ways to dodge the draft legally, held oddly enough in a central
Moscow veterans club. ``You can live together with your husband,
you do whatever you want together, but if you want to get your son
out of the draft, your best chance is divorce.'' In that way, Mrs.
Obraztsova said, Ruslan could legally argue that he was the only
able-bodied person available to support his 63-year-old pensioned
father, a certified invalid.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of blunt if convoluted advice that Mrs.
Obraztsova has been giving since 1990 when she, herself a mother of
two sons, joined the Soldiers' Mothers Committee, an advocacy and
support group that sprang up during the war waged by Soviet troops
in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Obraztsova, 53, a researcher at a medical-technical
institute, has counseled thousands of mothers on how to get their
18-to 27-year old sons out of Russia's twice-yearly draft, guiding
them through the maze of draft laws, past a hostile military that
has resisted the concept of alternative service, and around the
increased pressure created by two bloody wars in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the mothers who come to the sessions, scribbling copious
notes, would come anyway, but the latest war _ while broadly
popular as a move to keep the Russian state intact _ has added
urgency to their quest. ``Who would want to give up their son to
such a war?'' said Tanya Knyazina, who came on behalf of her
19-year-old son. ``As my son says himself, if it were a question of
fighting for the motherland, of defending Moscow, he would gladly
serve, but why should he go and fight, and die, for Chechnya?''
</P>
<P>
   Getting out of the Russian draft is, in many ways, similar to
unraveling other Russian bureaucratic tangles: It takes intimate
knowledge of arcane rules and regulations, and a readiness to
juggle family, residence and more to avoid a direct conflict with
the authorities. If all else fails, you can try to buy your way out
of a situation _ provided that you have the means.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who can afford to pay bribes don't come to our Monday
meetings,'' said Mrs. Obraztsova. ``We counsel the middle class,
the ones who can't pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, Mrs. Obraztsova's suggestion made
perfect sense to Galya A., a 56-year-old pensioner who asked that
her last name not be used. Since she has two sons by a previous
marriage, the family could not argue that Ruslan was the only
able-bodied breadwinner. But if Galya divorced Ruslan's father,
then Ruslan could easily get a deferment as his father's only means
of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``A divorce is nothing, you just show up and do it,'' she said.
``Of course, we don't want to do it, but with this war going on,
what else can we do? He is our last, and only, son. Without him, we
would both probably die of hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   For other young men, the solution could be, for instance,
adoption. A single father of a child under 3 gets an automatic
exemption, prompting some young couples to file for a divorce. The
father can also get an exemption if the mother is under 18, or
considered unfit to cope alone. Mrs. Obraztsova herself used one of
these loopholes several years ago to get her younger son out of the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of ours had a daughter who was pregnant out of
wedlock, and didn't want anything to do with the father,'' she
said. ``They knew our situation and asked me if my son wanted to be
the adoptive father. Of course, he does, I said. It worked, and I
often pass on the advice to others. How many take it, I can't
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in peacetime, even in the Soviet Union prior to the Afghan
War, many families go and have gone to extraordinary lengths to
keep their sons out of an army notorious for its brutal treatment
of conscripts. Suicides, hazing and deaths by beating are regular
occurrences. They are the subject of periodic investigations and
reports, but rarely of criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable figures on Russian draft dodgers, although
the Defense Ministry last spring claimed their number in 1998 had
been halved, to 20,000 from 40,000 nationally. According to the
Moscow city draft board, an estimated 1,500 Muscovites are avoiding
military service, but according to a draft board spokesman, many of
these are students from other cities, whose registration is tossed
back and forth between draft boards.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring draft last year, a presidential decree called for
168,776 men to be drafted, of which 120,900 were destined for the
armed forces. The rest were sent to other quasi-military units like
the border guards and the Railway Ministry troops. With each draft,
about 25 percent of the armed forces' personnel is replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to get out of the army is to study. Indeed, the
incentive of avoiding the draft often encourages a sudden devotion
to studies among 17-year-old males. In Moscow, for instance, where
an estimated 50,000 young men were due to be processed last fall,
an estimated 52 percent of draft-age men were exempted because they
were enrolled in institutes, and technical colleges where they sign
up for military courses that put them on an officers' track.
</P>
<P>
   A student deferment can be prolonged indefinitely provided the
student is accepted at bona fide institutions that will keep him
enrolled until he is 27, when he is no longer eligible for the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Medical deferments provide an increasingly popular way out.
According to recent statistics, more than 30 percent of draft-age
men are excused for medical reasons. The high rate is usually
explained by the deteriorating health of Russia's male population
generally, but it may also be due to efforts by people like Mrs.
Obraztsova.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your own checkup before your son is called up to the
medical commission,'' she said at a recent seminar. ``Please,
please, remember, if he has any medical complaints, get them
documented _ send him to as many clinics as you can. I know what
they will say at the draft board _ they will say that he is
healthy, that you bought the medical records. Believe me, I know
plenty of doctors who want to send your sick son into the armed
forces.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There is not a disease, ailment or injury that Mrs. Obraztsova
cannot peg to an article in the draft law. ``Hepatitis,'' she said.
``A, B, C, it doesn't matter: six months. Spinal disorders. I am
glad somebody mentioned that. If it is a third degree, then it can
be a deferrable disease. Migraines? Accompanied by fainting? Get it
checked. It can be deferrable. Ulcers? Beware of radical imported
medicines. They are so effective they can clear away the scar
tissue, and you don't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   A mother came up to her with a medical card showing that her son
suffers from a serious disease. ``Very good,'' said Mrs.
Obraztsova, nodding sagely, before she stopped herself. ``I mean,
of course there is nothing good about it at all, except in these
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Obraztsova is a stickler for the law, which she arguably
knows better than most draft board officials. She constantly
reminds mothers, and the few fathers and sons who occasionally
attend the meetings, how to stand up for their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember you have a right not to agree with the draft board,
but do not lose your temper, keep your voice quiet, just stick a
copy of the law under their noses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they won't listen, don't bother with them, write out your
complaint in a letter and mail it. But keep a copy. Little mothers,
always, always, keep copies of all your documents. One mother came
to me, and said the draft board had kept her medical file, and
wouldn't return it. I said to her, my darling, my little swallow,
who do you think you are dealing with?''
</P>
<P>
   For some Russian men, the yearly drafts _ from April to June and
from October to December _ may be times to get out of town, and
perhaps hide out at the family dacha, or country house.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, draft boards have been asking the police to
hunt down stragglers. Late last December, Moscow residents reported
that their buildings had been surrounded by police officers waiting
for young men to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cases when parents think that their children have
been kidnapped,'' said Valentina Melnikova, a spokeswoman for the
Soldiers' Mothers Committee. ``They come home and their sons are
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic sang-froid, Mrs. Obraztsova has advice for
parents who find the police at their door, looking for their son.
``Tell them he went away with a girl,'' she said. ``Tell them you
yourself are horrified, but there's nothing you can do. That one
usually works.''
</P>
<P>
   To parents whose sons are now abroad, her advice is simple: Keep
them away. ``If they tell you they want to come home, tell them
that an undeclared war is going on here, and that our boys are
being killed.''

REAL ESTATE: A COMPLEX PLAN'S AIM IS SIMPLER ZONING RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what may be the single boldest zoning proposal
since 1961, New York City's planning chief, Joseph B. Rose, says he
wants to simplify the rules governing the size of new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But even a simplified zoning proposal is not simple. Groups as
sophisticated as the Real Estate Board of New York and the
Municipal Art Society have had to hire zoning consultants to help
them figure out what the amendment will do.
</P>
<P>
   It is meant to curtail ``tower in a park'' zoning that yields
buildings vastly out of scale with their neighbors, too tall and
set apart on barren plazas from the street wall formed by older
structures. The new zoning would impose height limits from 35 to
720 feet in most areas outside mid-Manhattan and lower Manhattan.
And it would encourage buildings closer to the street wall.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, current zoning rules impose no height limits.
Buildings can rise as high as necessary to accommodate the floor
area permitted on the site. For example, in R7 districts of small
apartment houses, current rules encourage buildings of 14 to 16
stories, set back from the street line. The new rules would require
a building with more of a street wall, rising no more than 80 feet,
or seven to eight stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does,'' Rose said, ``is give the comfort and
security that buildings like this Trump thing aren't going to pop
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trump World Tower at First Avenue and 47th Street to which
Rose was referring will be 856 feet tall, where the new rules would
impose a 495-foot cap. It covers only 13 percent of the merged
zoning lot from which it derives its development rights, where the
new rules would require a minimum coverage of 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And it uses the development rights from one kind of zoning
district (C1-9) to build in a different district (C5-2) _ a
transfer that the new rules would prohibit.
</P>
<P>
   Another project allowed under current zoning that would have
been affected by the amendment is the Regal Cinemas multiplex and
Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore that Forest City Ratner is building at 100
Court St. in Brooklyn, which rises to 195 feet. Under the proposal,
it would be capped at 140 feet. And the 50-story Madison Belvedere
at 10 East 29th St. would not have benefited from a 20-percent
development bonus for providing a plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, at the beginning of his seventh year as chairman of
the City Planning Commission and director of the City Planning
Department, Rose will formally send out the amendment for review by
community planning boards. It is expected to reach the City Council
by summer.
</P>
<P>
   Both the real estate industry and civic watchdogs have
tentatively given Rose and his colleagues an A (or at least a B
plus) for effort. But just as instructive, neither side has
wholeheartedly embraced the proposal, partly to give themselves
maneuvering room and partly because they are really not sure what
land mines are buried, even inadvertently, among the 536 pages of
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they talk about the devil being in the details, he's
really hiding in this one,'' said Councilman Walter McCaffrey,
D-Queens, who heads the zoning subcommittee. ``On the other hand,
Joe is being very bold, and I say that in a very positive sense, in
trying to address this. He has to be lauded for the scope of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose insists there is no hidden agenda masked by arcana. ``There
are assumptions that you need to pore over it to see where the
Trojan horse is,'' he said. ``There are no Trojan horses in this
document.''
</P>
<P>
   But even he admits, ``It's not 1 plus 1 equals 2.''
</P>
<P>
   A broad amendment of the 1961 zoning resolution is long overdue,
said Norman Marcus, former counsel to the planning department and a
member of the zoning committee of the American Planning
Association. ``We're dealing with a document that's nearly 50 years
old and is carrying the intervening years on its back the way a
whale carries barnacles,'' he said. The new rules, he said, will
produce a ``more predictable, no-surprises kind of development.''
</P>
<P>
   The Municipal Art Society is still studying the fine print, but
its president, Kent L. Barwick, applauded the spirit of the
proposal. ``The need to rezone New York is paramount,'' he said.
``Therefore, we're appreciative of the Giuliani administration's
willingness to take it on.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the savviest zoning experts in the city, Michael
Kwartler, confessed to doubts about the ``19th-century format'' of
regulations that try to anticipate every possible condition in
advance. But he said generally about the proposal: ``It's a step in
the right direction. It puts to rest the `tower in a park' and
that's a real plus. It takes the view that the city is a mature
place and we ought to pay attention to that identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Real Estate Board, meanwhile, is scrambling to understand
the practical implications of the zoning amendment. ``We're still
in the process of digesting,'' Michael Slattery, the senior vice
president for research, said last week. ``In some ways, this is
kind of like a blueprint. You have to see how it works in
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In an advertisement earlier this month, Steven Spinola, the
president of the board, was quoted as saying, ``We see this as more
positive than negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the positive points, at least for the real estate
industry:
</P>
<P>
   _ The exemption from many of the new rules, including height
limits, of most of mid-Manhattan between Third and Eighth avenues,
40th and 58th streets, and much of lower Manhattan below Chambers
Street.
</P>
<P>
   _ The elimination of a formula known as ``packing the bulk'' in
high-density residential districts, which requires that 55 percent
of the floor area on a zoning lot be located below 150 feet.
Intended to curtail the transfer of development rights, this rule
is despised by developers. (Ever see a condominium ad boasting
third-floor views?)
</P>
<P>
   _ A rezoning of downtown Brooklyn that would preserve the right
to build towers up to 495 feet in areas around Metrotech, Flatbush
Avenue and Livingston Street where there would otherwise be a
140-foot limit. It would increase by up to 74 percent the allowable
residential density in a nine-block area between Court and Smith
streets. A rezoning along Lexington Avenue, from 54th to 57th
Street, would permit slightly taller buildings than are now
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A generous limit of 720 feet (fewer than 30 buildings in New
York reach this height) for zoning district C5-3, which is mapped
in the Court Square area of Long Island City, Queens, and might be
used elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Among the negative points for developers is the abolition of the
20 percent bonus granted as a matter of right for plazas in
high-density residential districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residential plazas, even when well designed, have by and large
not been a success,'' Rose said. ``We're uninterested in providing
bonuses for non-amenities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One of the last projects in the pipeline with such a plaza is
the Madison Belvedere near Madison Square. The developer, Adam R.
Rose, president of Rose Associates, is the planning chief's cousin.
But he said that as a matter of family policy, he and Joseph Rose
never discuss public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza at the Madison Belvedere has been designed by Thomas
Balsley Associates, Adam Rose said, and will be a boon to the
neighborhood, including residents of the former Prince George
Hotel, now a supportive housing project by Common Ground Community,
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the problems of some plazas, Adam Rose said:
``The new ones really are maintainable and manageable. New York has
never had enough green space. It's hard not to like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Buildings like the Madison Belvedere, Trump World Tower and 100
Court St. that are under construction will not be affected by the
new zoning. Neither will those that have a building permit and
completed foundations when the measure is voted on by the City
Council.
</P>
<P>
   This would presumably include the Alexander's site at Lexington
Avenue and 59th Street, which would otherwise be subject to a
495-foot height limit, quite a bit shorter than the tower
envisioned by the developer Steven Roth.
</P>
<P>
   The Con Edison property south of the United Nations would have
to be rezoned in any event. Rose said that a 495-foot height limit
is contemplated on that site.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry wonders what will happen to projects caught in
zoning limbo. ``Grandfathering could be a serious issue,'' said
Samuel H. Lindenbaum of Rosenman &AMP; Colin, the dean of the land-use
bar and author of the zoning strategy that allowed Trump World
Tower. ``You have some buildings that have been designed, where
people have spent enormous sums on architectural plans and the
financing is in place, but for some reason they can't get their
foundations in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility of an intermediate
``grandfathering'' period in which buildings could conform to past
zoning rules if it suited them better, Joseph Rose replied simply,
``What grandfathering?''
</P>
<P>
   That is not say the planning chairman is ignoring objections
raised by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the rules as first drafted, the 120-foot height
limit on community facilities like schools, medical centers and
cultural institutions in medium-density districts such as R7 would
have made it practically impossible to build double-height floors
for an auditorium, cafeteria or gymnasium without sacrificing some
of the overall floor area allowed on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said last week that the height limit would be adjusted to
140 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The ease with which the adjustment was made, he said,
underscored the appeal of the system. ``If you want to limit
height, you don't need a complex formula,'' Rose said. ``You only
need a simple number.''
</P>
<P>
   Although height limits have received much public attention, the
control that most worries the real estate industry may be the
requirement that a tower occupy at least 33 percent of the total
merged zoning lot from which it draws development rights.
</P>
<P>
   This is intended to prevent the harvesting of air rights up and
down a block for the purpose of piling up bulk on a single site, as
was done in the case of Trump World Tower.
</P>
<P>
   A merged zoning lot includes the parcel owned by a developer on
which the new building will rise and those adjacent parcels owned
by others from whom the developer has purchased unused development
rights, which represent the difference between the size of the
existing building and the maximum size that zoning would permit on
the site. A 10,000-square-foot church on a site where a
100,000-square-foot tower could be constructed would have 90,000
square feet of unused development rights to sell.
</P>
<P>
   But the Real Estate Board's zoning consultant, H. Thomas O'Hara,
calculated that on a 20,000-square-foot merged zoning lot, half of
it occupied by an existing building, the setback requirements would
yield a tower with floors of 6,450 square feet _ or 32 percent of
the lot _ which is below the allowable minimum of 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very large church may not be able to transfer its
development rights'' under the 33 percent rule, said Paul D. Selver
of the law firm Battle Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   One example is the Roman Catholic Church of St. Paul the Apostle
at Columbus Avenue and 60th Street, which sold its air rights to
the Brodsky Organization, developers of a 41-story tower next door
at 2 Columbus Avenue. ``That tower was nowhere near 33 percent of
the zoning lot,'' said Peter Claman of Schuman Lichtenstein Claman
Efron, the architects of 2 Columbus Ave.
</P>
<P>
   Claman said the 33-percent rule ``definitely would affect the
value of the property that the archdiocese has.''
</P>
<P>
   And Slattery asked, ``Do you need 33 percent if you have a
height limit?''
</P>
<P>
   Rose seems unconvinced by such entreaties. ``It comes as no
surprise to us that the industry would like to get rid of things
that complicate their life and have as few substituting restraints
as possible,'' he said. ``We're aware of their desire to build
ever-taller buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does 33 percent have an implication for the transfer of air
rights? Yes. Does it prevent them? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of multiple-lot development addressed by the new
rules are sites that straddle more than one zoning district. The
current rules are ``indecipherable,'' said Sandy Hornick, deputy
executive director of the planning department.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they can be manipulated in such a way that a
developer gets the benefit of the more liberal provisions from one
district to build in another. The new rules would clarify which
districts would be regarded as interchangeable. ``A Talmudic
massaging of the zoning resolution shouldn't yield different
answers for the same piece of property,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce S. Fowle, the co-chairman of the zoning task force of the
American Institute of Architects, said, ``The concept of going to
minimum lot coverage and height limits is a good one as far as
controlling zoning lot mergers is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what really scares me is that we're saying that every
building on the Upper East Side is going to be the same height and
go straight up with a 33 percent lot coverage, have a flat top on
it and be ugly as sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, the planners respond. There is room within the
prescribed envelope for variety and there is a special permit
process to encourage exceptional architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Height limits, lot coverage requirements and setback rules could
all be modified by the planning commission and the City Council for
a project if it ``exhibits superior design quality,'' in the
language of the zoning text, and the modification ``significantly
enhances'' the relationship between the new building and its
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The new building would also have to be designed in a way that
``maximizes sunlight on public parks and playgrounds'' nearby and
permits ``adequate access of light and air to surrounding streets
and properties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that people want to do things that go beyond the
box, let architects be the ones to earn it for developers, not
lawyers,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   How will superior design quality be determined? With the help of
a seven-member advisory panel appointed by the planning director
and composed of ``persons with knowledge and experience in the
areas of architecture and urban design.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an area where additional professional input could be
beneficial,'' said David Karnovsky, counsel to the planning
department. Rose said neither the commission nor the Council would
be bound by the recommendation of the proposed panel.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said he is certain this process will be used. ``We've
already had requests from potential applicants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are less sure that good architecture will result or that
developers and lenders, keenly conscious of time equaling money,
would voluntarily undertake a discretionary review procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great designs do not come out of committee sessions,'' said
Costas Kondylis, the architect of Trump World Tower. ``Also, I
think it's going to be an unpredictable process and most developers
will shy away. It will take six months to a year, without any
certainty of outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   As a ``ticket to something outside zoning,'' the notion of an
advisory panel concerns the community group Civitas. But overall,
said its president, Genie Rice, the proposed amendment is a
``wonderful initiative and very, very welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Her words were echoed by Barwick. ``The spirit of it is exactly
right,'' he said. ``We'd like to support this package.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new manifesto, ``Zoned Out,'' the society outlined its
greatest concerns with the regulations as they now exist: the
proliferation of overscaled towers and lifeless plazas;
unrestricted zoning lot mergers; an allowance that permits
educational, medical and cultural institutions to build structures
in rear yards and the exemption of mechanical space from zoning
calculations, even though it can add enormously to a building's
bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions it has raised about the zoning proposal is
whether it might increase the development pressures in Midtown and
downtown Manhattan, since they would not have height caps, while
peripheral areas would be regulated. ``If you push the edges down,
you may be pushing the middle up,'' Barwick said.
</P>
<P>
   The planning department said that height limits would
effectively cap the amount of unregulated mechanical space at about
10 percent. But Barwick said the Bear Stearns headquarters now
rising on the block at Madison Avenue and 46th Street, which has
more than twice that much mechanical space, would not have been
affected since it is in a district without height limits.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Rose does not want to try to regulate mechanical
space too closely. ``You tread in this area at a great risk of
standing in the way of technological innovation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there will be much maneuvering in coming weeks, on and
off stage. ``The hope,'' Lindenbaum said, ``is to get a proposal
that each side will find better than what we have today.''

   Arthur T. McManmon of Westwood, the last surviving starter for a
Notre Dame football team coached by the legendary Knute Rockne,
died of a heart attack at Norwood (Mass.) Hospital on Thursday. He
was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McManmon was born on his family farm in Dracut, Mass. He
graduated from Notre Dame in 1931, where he started at right tackle
on two consecutive undefeated national championship teams that were
the toast of the sports world under Rockne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train would stop and people would gather around. People
would come in and get autographs,'' he said in a Globe interview
two years ago. ``There would be a couple of hundred people there.
It was the typical thing.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Mr. McManmon went to Hollywood and
participated in the production of two movies about the life of his
coach, ``Knute Rockne, All American'' and ``The Spirit of Notre
Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McManmon came back to New England and attended Harvard
Busness School and had a long career with Donnelly Advertising, the
East Coast's largest billboard company, rising to general manager.
He then became president of the Brockhouse America Corp. and of the
legendary Indian MotocycleCo. of Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McManmon was a golfer and a longtime member of the Charles
River Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves two sons, Thomas A., of Chestnut Hill, and Peter D.,
of Newton Center, Mass.; two daughters, Maura Collins of Darien,
Conn., and Alecia Kindgren of Tempe, Arizona; and 11 grandchildren.

<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ The night before Lindsay Davenport faced
Martina Hingis in the Australian Open final, she sat in her hotel
room applying ice to her sore leg. Davenport was watching a men's
singles semifinal when the television cameras briefly cut away to
show Hingis practicing on an outside court.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis works on her strokes nearly every day, but what made this
unusual was that she was working on her strokes after losing a
long, tiring women's doubles final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gosh,'' Davenport said. ``I started laughing. I kind of
knew then that she was feeling she needed to practice a little
harder or do something extra maybe. That surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprise is nothing new to Davenport in Grand Slam events. When
she won her first major singles title in 1998 by defeating Hingis
in the U.S. Open, she looked stunned by her straight-set victory.
And when she won her second by defeating Steffi Graf in straight
sets at Wimbledon last year, she looked overwhelmed again by the
fact that she had managed to find her footing and timing on grass.
</P>
<P>
   But what was striking about Davenport's 6-1, 7-5 victory over
Hingis here on Saturday was that the element of surprise was
missing. Despite her strained leg muscle, Davenport looked
confident and comfortable from the start, and though Hingis saved
face by temporarily erasing a 1-5 deficit in the second set,
Davenport looked confident and comfortable at the end, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``At your first Grand Slam final, you're like, `Oh gosh,' and
it's all new,''' the 23-year-old Davenport said. ``But going out
there I knew that obviously I could win, and that it was my match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so much more mature,'' Davenport added. ``I think the
biggest thing for me was mentally just believing I should win these
tournaments, and that I'm good enough. I've overcome that, and I
mean I feel every time I go out there that it's up to me now. A
couple of years ago, I was petrified. I would never think that.''
</P>
<P>
   After her 27-match winning streak at the Australian Open came to
an end, Hingis said: ``I've been playing some great matches, some
great tennis here in the beginning of the week; it's just right
now, I see Lindsay in front of me. OK, she might be the No. 2
player right now. I probably have been more consistent over the
last two or three years. But right now, for me, she's the player I
have to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, still ranked No. 1, has been more consistent than
Davenport, who missed several tournaments last year with a wrist
injury, and Hingis has been a lot more consistent than their two
other rivals for supremacy: Venus and Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss teen-ager has reached the final in five of the last
six Grand Slam events. Davenport has reached the final in three of
the last six, but unlike Hingis, she has maximized her chances. She
is 3-0 in major finals, 4-0 if you count her victory at the Summer
Olympics in Atlanta and 7-0 if you count her three victories at the
season-ending tour championships in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just always feel like when I get to the final, all the
doubts are gone,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   That was not always the case this year in Melbourne. After
Davenport's 6-4, 7-5 victory in the second round over fellow
American Marissa Irvin, her coach Robert Van't Hof told her that it
was one of the worst matches he had seen her play in recent years.
That same evening, she, not Hingis, was the one practicing with her
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit from like 8:15 to 9:30 and got it back in the groove,''
Davenport said. ``And the next few days we worked really hard, and
it came around with the match against Kournikova in the fourth
round. I felt that was the big match in the tournament for me; the
one where I got over the hump of feeling negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport beat 11th-seeded Anna Kournikova, 6-4, 6-3, but there
would be some bad news, too, because she would strain the same
upper leg muscle she strained last year at the Chase Championships.
The injury would cause her considerable pain in the opening game of
her semifinal victory over Jennifer Capriati on Thursday, and that
night she retired from the doubles semifinal against Hingis and
Mary Pierce when she and Corina Morariu were down, 0-5. It was the
first time Davenport remembers retiring from any match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have stopped if it wasn't hurting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport would apply ice to her leg three times that night,
practice very gingerly for 45 minutes on Friday and then ice it
four more times that night. ``If I'd had to play Hingis on Friday,
it would have been tougher,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she made it too tough on Hingis, defeating her for the
fourth consecutive time in straight sets. All four of those
victories have come on quick courts, which helps explain the
lopsided results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to beat Martina is to overpower her; you're never
going to see Arantxa or Conchita beat her,'' said Davenport in
reference to Hingis' seeded Spanish victims earlier in this
tournament: Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Conchita Martinez. ``I mean
that was like a dream draw for her. It might have helped me,
because she wasn't used to pace when we went out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis clearly needs to serve better and bigger if she wants to
change her luck against Davenport. She also needs to find a way to
put Davenport off balance earlier in rallies and to fight through
that rarest of conditions for Hingis: an inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsay is just no compromise,'' Hingis said. ``You get a
shorter ball: bang, boom, there. It like line, line. Against some
other players, it would be a little short or something happens,
like not such a great return. But she's like, no compromise. She
kills you right away. No mistakes, not today.''
</P>
<P>
   When the match ended and they were both waiting for their turn
at the microphone at the post-match news conference, Hingis turned
to Davenport and according to the American said, ``I just can't
play you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean she's so confident and so good that that's the best
compliment you could ever get,'' Davenport said.

130 NATIONS AGREE ON RULES FOR ENGINEERED FOODS
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Word change in lead. Adds to fourth graph, new fifth and

 By ANDREW POLLACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Delegates from more than 130 nations Saturday adopted
the first global treaty regulating trade in genetically modified
products, setting up an international framework for the
increasingly heated and divisive debate about foods made with
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   The biosafety treaty, forged after a week of intense
negotiations that often pitted the United States against almost
everyone else, allows countries to bar imports of genetically
altered seeds, microbes, animals and crops that they deem a threat
to their environment.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually all of the proposed provisions that Washington had
feared would cripple world food trade and endanger billions of
dollars a year in American farm exports were watered down or
eliminated. This led some European delegates and environmentalists
to complain that the accord had been unduly weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the treaty heightens consumer concern or helps to ease
it, the controversy surrounding genetically altered food is sure to
continue. European consumers, in particular, are wary of risks to
human health and the environment and have become increasingly
militant in their rejection of American food that contains
genetically modified grains or soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   About half the soybeans and one-third of the corn grown in the
United States last year contained foreign genes making the crops
resistant to herbicides or insects.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about genetically altered food has also risen in the
United States, where the Food and Drug Administration held public
hearings on the subject recently and some members of Congress are
calling for food with genetically modified ingredients to be so
labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continuing controversy, when the biosafety protocol
was finally approved around 5 a.m., weary delegates from all sides
stood up and applauded and hailed it as a significant achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``By reaching an agreement today, I hope we have taken an
important step toward depolarizing the debate about
biotechnology,'' Frank E. Loy, U.S. undersecretary of state for
global affairs, said Saturday. ``Conversely, failure to reach an
agreement today would have exacerbated tensions over this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Chee Yoke Ling of the Third World Network, an environmental
group based in Malaysia, said that the treaty had ``a lot of
holes.'' But she added, ``I think it's historic in the sense that
international law is recognizing that GMO's are distinct and have
to be regulated separately.'' GMO stands for genetically modified
organism.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology company executives said the new treaty could
actually help the industry by countering a perception that
biotechnology is not adequately regulated. ``I think it will give
some members of the public a stronger feeling that there is
appropriate amounts of oversight,'' said Steven J. Daugherty,
director of government and industry relations at Pioneer Hi-Bred
International, the huge seed company.
</P>
<P>
   But no one thinks the controversy will go away. Indeed, the
treaty could make consumers even more aware of the issue, raising
more concerns. Delegates said the treaty represented a rare recent
success in balancing environmental protection with free trade,
interests that are often difficult to reconcile.
</P>
<P>
   At the World Trade Organization meeting late last year in
Seattle, talks on these topics broke down and huge protests were
held by environmentalists, foes of biotechnology and others.
</P>
<P>
   The biosafety talks themselves broke down a year ago in
Cartagena, Colombia, when the United States and a handful of other
big agricultural exporting nations blocked a treaty agreed to by
virtually all the other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Montreal demonstrations were small and peaceful. And
the atmosphere in the negotiating halls was far more positive than
in Cartagena, as all nations realized that the rising controversy
over bio-engineered foods made it important to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, early Saturday morning, it appeared that history might
repeat itself. The United States and Canada refused to agree to a
requirement _ supported by virtually all the other countries _ that
shipments of genetically altered commodities like corn or soybeans
contain identification of the specific variety. The two countries
said such a requirement would be unworkable, requiring different
strains that are now intermingled to be segregated and tracked from
field to dock.
</P>
<P>
   A tense standoff with the European Union ensued for hours and
threatened to scuttle the entire treaty. Finally, frowning and
grumbling, the Europeans backed down. Instead of requiring
identification of the particular strain of genetically engineered
crop, the treaty requires stating only that the shipment ``may
contain'' genetically modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said genetically modified crops would not
have to be segregated from others. But the treaty might encourage a
trend that is already under way _ segregating crops free of genetic
modification.
</P>
<P>
   The new treaty will be known as the Cartagena Protocol on
Biosafety and will go into effect after being ratified by 50
countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several years in the making, the protocol is an outgrowth of the
Convention on Biological Diversity forged in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, in 1992. Because the United States never ratified the
biodiversity convention, it cannot become a party to the biosafety
protocol. But American industry will still have to comply with the
rules when exporting to countries that are parties. And federal
officials here said the government would honor the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The new biosafety protocol is mainly concerned with protecting
the environment from the consequences of genetic engineering. For
instance, genes that make crops herbicide resistant could spread by
pollination to weedy relatives, creating super-weeds. Or fish given
genes to make them grow faster might out-compete the native
population for food or mates.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol is not really aimed at risks to human health from
food made using biotechnology, although it does contain some vague
language saying that such risks should be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty also does not address whether food containing
genetically altered ingredients, like corn flakes made with
bio-engineered corn, should be labeled as such on store shelves. It
deals only with labeling commodities like wheat or corn during
international shipments.
</P>
<P>
   The key requirement of the treaty is that exporters must obtain
permission in advance from the importing country before the first
shipment of a particular ``living modified organism'' meant for
release into the environment, like seeds, microbes or fish to be
put in a river.
</P>
<P>
   But advance notice and permission will not be required for
exports of agricultural commodities meant for eating or processing
rather than for release into the environment. Washington had argued
that requiring such advanced notification would have tied up food
trade in red tape.
</P>
<P>
   According to the compromise in the treaty, when a crop is
approved for commercial use in one country, that country must send
information about that crop to a central clearinghouse. Other
countries can then decide whether to prohibit imports of that crop
based on their own legislation. Countries that do not have their
own legislation, however, can use the protocol to bar imports.
</P>
<P>
   There are other deletions from the protocol that American
industry cheered but that some environmentalists said weakened the
accord. The treaty, for instance, does not apply to human
pharmaceuticals. And advance permission is not required for
shipments of genetically altered organisms intended for what the
protocol terms ``contained use,'' such as a vial of cells for use
in a research laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, as well as delegates from Europe and
developing countries, said the most significant achievement was
inclusion in the treaty of perhaps the strongest formulation to
date of the ``precautionary principle.'' This principle states that
a nation can take action to protect itself _ in this case by
barring import of a genetically modified organism _ even if there
is a lack of scientific certainty that it would be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The United States fears Europe will use this principle as a
pretext for trade barriers. But Washington did win language
assuring that the biosafety protocol will not relieve a nation of
its obligations under World Trade Organization rules. So if a
nation does ban a crop, it could be subject to challenge under
trade rules.

ABORTION TOPS ISSUES AS N.H. CAMPAIGNING NEARS END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ While the two Democratic presidential
candidates continued their feud over who is the stronger supporter
of abortion rights, Republican George W. Bush for the first time
campaigned here beside his father, former President Bush, whose
bruising 1992 primary is still a painful family memory.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Boston Globe/WBZ-TV tracking poll showed that former
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey has cut slightly into Al Gore's
lead, with the vice president now ahead in the Democratic race by 7
percentage points. The Republican contest remains statistically
tied between Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion issue continued Saturday to be the top issue
between the Democrats. Bradley once again attacked Gore for having
said as a congressman in 1987 that abortion was ``the taking of a
human life.'' While Gore insisted he was strongly in favor of
abortion rights, Bradley's attack was intended to raise questions
about Gore's overall credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who said in Wednesday's debate that he has always
supported abortion rights, said in an interview Saturday that his
position on federal funding of abortions, which he initially
opposed in Congress, has ``evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Gore retracted his 13-year-old statement equating
abortion with the taking of a human life. Said Gore: ``Yes, my
position has changed. I strongly support a woman's right to choose
and if (Bradley) disputes that, then he is making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in an interview aboard his bus during a rare trip to
northern New Hampshire, said the Gore campaign has gone into hiding
amid Bradley's criticism of his abortion record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic P.R. technique,'' Bradley said. ``Whenever
there's bad news, you go into hiding. Or whenever you're confronted
with the bad news, you just deny it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also questioned whether Gore had the strength to stand
up to his counterattack. ``I've seen a lot of guys who gave elbows
and couldn't take them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, told the Globe that Bradley is practicing ``old
politics'' and shrugged off the darts. ``It's probably just a
coincidence _ the timing of it _ coming just before the election,''
Gore said drily.
</P>
<P>
   The five Republican candidates, meanwhile, criss-crossed the
state in a furious round of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, which has frequently been asked by the media
why the candidate's father hasn't turned up here, arranged for many
members of the Bush family to accompany the Texas governor
Saturday, led by the former president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even from far away in Texas, you get the feeling things are
moving here and moving well,'' former President Bush said. ``I'm
proud to be here, I'm proud of our son. ... This boy, this son of
ours, is not going to let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded by dismissing Bush's ability to get ``celebrity
endorsements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only celebrities I'm interested in are the people in this
room and the voters in the state of New Hampshire,'' McCain told an
audience at Windham Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   At town hall meetings in Raymond and Windham, McCain made sure
to highlight the differences between him and Bush. Bush, he said,
would be unable to criticize the vice president on campaign finance
in a debate as well as he, who could ``beat Al Gore like a drum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is standing there in that debate and he's got
nothing to say, because he's defending the system,'' McCain said.
``He's got nothing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Bush's appearances were sparsely attended
and brought few cheers, and the candidate, suffering from a cold,
seemed tired. But Saturday, he sounded energized. After receiving a
standing ovation from more than 1,000 Republicans at a breakfast in
Portsmouth _ nearly three times the number that showed up at an
event in the same restaurant last week _ Bush told the crowd:
``This really makes me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited. I'm excited about our chances,'' he said. ``I
like the feel in this state. I like the fact that there are a lot
of folks who were undecided who are starting to come on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his vow to cut taxes, raising the central issue in
his debate with McCain. But his real target Saturday was Clinton.
The State of the Union address, which heralded the explosion of the
new economy, was a display of arrogance on Clinton's part, Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's strategy is to remind Republican primary voters that the
goal is to remove the Clinton administration from the White House,
and they must vote for the GOP candidate most likely to beat Gore,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, meanwhile, weighed into the abortion issue as
well, saying that both Gore and Bradley should be opposed because
they favor abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Mr. Gore chose to abandon his compassion for the
unborn to climb the greasy pole of liberal Democratic politics,''
Forbes said in Laconia.
</P>
<P>
   The other two GOP candidates, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, also
campaigned throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, continuing to hammer away at Gore on the abortion
issue, circulated letters that Gore wrote to constituents in the
1980s affirming his opposition to abortion and to federal funding
for the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my deep personal conviction that abortion is wrong,''
Gore wrote to a constituent in 1984 when he was representing
Tennessee in the House. ``Let me assure you that I share your
belief that innocent human life must be protected and I have an
open mind on how to further this goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign also began airing a television ad that
subtly attacked Gore by identifying Bradley as the only candidate
among the seven seeking the Democratic and Republican nominations
who ``has been pro-choice for everyone _ all the time.'' The ad is
titled, ``Always.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning on the streets of Milford, dismissed
complaints that he has been less than candid about his abortion
rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he still believed what he wrote in a 1987 letter
to a constituent, that abortion is ``the taking of a human life,''
Gore parsed his words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't write that,'' Gore said. ``I used the word `arguably'
before the words `the taking of a human life,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not use that phrasing today,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore is half right. In a letter written to another
constituent in 1984 and released by the Bradley campaign Saturday,
Gore indeed said abortion was ``arguably the taking of a human
life.'' The phrase gives him rhetorical wiggle room on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore also told the constituent, ``It is my deep personal
belief that abortion is wrong. I hope some day we will see the
currant(sic) outrageously large number of abortions drop sharply.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically whether he personally opposed abortion, while
believing in a woman's right to have the procedure, Gore skirted
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a woman,'' the vice president said Saturday's
interview. ``And I believe that it's wrong to have the government
arrogate to itself the power to order women to make a decision that
politicians decide is correct, regardless of the circumstances
faced by that individual woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the question that has to be answered. And once you
answer that question, then your other question is one that can only
be answered by the woman herself,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   While the subject of abortion has only just now popped into the
Democratic primary, it has dogged Republicans McCain and Bush over
the last several weeks. The subject is one that neither Republican
emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Boston Globe/WBZ-TV tracking polls shows a race that
remains hotly competitive in both primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore continues to hold onto to a modest lead over Bradley, but
the poll suggests that Bradley may have arrested the recent trend
in Gore's favor. Gore holds a 48 percent to 41 percent advantage,
with the remainder undecided, according to the poll, which sampled
voter opinion on Friday and Saturday. The previous day's poll
result showed Gore with a 10-point advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-McCain race remains a statistic deadlock, with McCain
up 38 percent to 35 percent. The previous day's poll result had the
race even closer, with McCain up a single percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The other GOP contenders continue to run well behind. Publisher
Steve Forbes drew 11 percent; former Ambassador Alan Keyes, 5;
former Reagan administration aide Gary Bauer, 4; the remainder
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also suggests that Bradley's assault on Gore over his
truthfulness may be having some effect. Likely Democratic voters
deem Bradley, by a 41 percent to 32 percent margin, as the
candidate more generally truthful about his own record and in his
descriptions of his opponent's record. Those polled were also
inclined, by a considerable margin, to hold Gore to account for
claiming last week to have ``always'' supported abortion rights,
even though, early in his political career, he opposed federal
funding for abortions. Gore has long since changed that position
and is now a firm backer of abortion rights, across the board..
</P>
<P>
   But among likely Democratic voters, 34 percent said that the
apparent gap between Gore's claim and his record would make them
less likely to vote for Gore. Four percent say it makes them more
likely to back Gore. The rest say it will have no effect, or had no
response to the question.
</P>
<P>
   Based on sampling of 400 likely voters in each party primary,
the poll has a margin of error of 5 percent.

FBI PROTECTION OF MOBSTERS COST MANY LIVES, EX-WITNESS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DICK LEHR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the closing days of 1978, federal prosecutors in
Boston worked feverishly to put the final touches on an indictment
to bust open a horse race-fixing enterprise that had amassed
millions of dollars in illegal profits while operating in eight
East Coast states.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the biggest organized crime cases in years, and
prosecutors had an ace in the hole: The master race-fixer himself,
Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Ciulla, was on board to testify as their star
witness.
</P>
<P>
   But a band of Boston FBI agents was far from ecstatic about
that: Two of the government's targets were James J. ``Whitey''
Bulger and Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, newly minted informants
enlisted to help the FBI go after the Boston Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, Ciulla, the witness whose testimony
eventually helped win a slew of convictions, has broken his silence
to talk about the time when Bulger and Flemmi could have been
prosecuted _ but were not _ and the consequences of that decision.
``Start counting the bodies from '78 on, from Stevie and Whitey,''
says Ciulla.
</P>
<P>
   In the ongoing investigation of Bulger and Flemmi, authorities
now believe the pair was involved in the murders of at least eight
people since they were dropped from the race-fixing case. Two weeks
ago, the decomposed bodies of two men and a woman were recovered
from a makeshift grave in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people?'' asks Ciulla, a hulking, 6-foot-4-inch,
gravelly voiced gambler who has never lacked for bravado and whose
exact whereabouts remain a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about buckets of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Indicted in early 1979 in the historic race-fixing case were
gang boss Howard T. Winter and 20 others _ gangsters, Las Vegas
casino executives and jockeys, but not Bulger and Flemmi. ``I had
them dead to rights,'' Ciulla says about his readiness more than 20
years ago to testify against the two, if they had been charged with
the others.
</P>
<P>
   But that never happened. The maneuverings by former FBI agents
John J. Connolly Jr. and John Morris to protect Bulger and Flemmi
have since been exposed, mostly during federal court in 1998 that
revealed FBI wrongdoing in an alliance with the gangsters that
began in 1975 and lasted two decades. Under oath, Morris has
admitted working to get Bulger and Flemmi out of the race-fixing
case. Connolly, in interviews, has said he and Morris believed
their informants' insistence that they were not involved in the
gang's scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ciulla is talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a critical moment,'' he says, ``the inception of the
feds doing them a big favor.'' If Bulger and Flemmi had not been
dropped from the case, he says, ``a lot of people, families, kids
would have fathers, husbands, brothers, whatever. It makes me want
to vomit. That's the bottom line. They should have been indicted.
They were as guilty as everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the 70-year-old Bulger remains a fugitive on the FBI's 10
Most Wanted list, the public unraveling of his underworld reign,
and of the wrongdoing by Boston FBI agents associated with him, is
now six years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   It started with Bulger and Flemmi's racketeering indictment in
1995 and extended through the federal court hearings overseen by US
District Judge Mark Wolf. Last month, Bulger's former FBI handler,
Connolly, was indicted on racketeering charges, including tipping
Bulger to his indictment so that he could flee. Morris, under a
grant of immunity, has confessed to illegally taking money from
Bulger. Wolf ruled that to protect Bulger and Flemmi, Connolly,
Morris and others would warn them repeatedly during the 1980s about
investigators' plans to wiretap or target them.
</P>
<P>
   But the race-fixing case was different. The probe had originated
in New Jersey in 1977 and was first taken up by FBI agents based in
Lowell, not Boston.
</P>
<P>
   During one lengthy FBI debriefing in Sacramento in early 1978,
Ciulla gave agents a ``recap of the overall scheme,'' according to
the FBI report of that session. He told how jockeys were bribed to
throw races, and how the gang collected thousands of dollars in
wagers made at tracks and with bookmakers. He named Bulger and
Flemmi as two of the seven key Winter Hill gangsters who managed
the scheme. He broke down how the illegal profits were split up _
``50 percent to Howard Winter and his six aforementioned
associates.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, during a state trial against jockeys in New
Jersey, Ciulla took the witness stand and was told to name his
Boston partners. Like an actor setting up his best lines, he
hestitated. ``Your honor, I have been in front of federal grand
juries with these names,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are here now,'' replied the judge, unimpressed. He ordered
Ciulla to answer the question. Ciulla did. He then named Howie
Winter and, for the first time publicly, other partners: ``Whitey
Bulger. Stephen Flemmi.''
</P>
<P>
   In November of 1978, Ciulla was the subject of a cover story in
Sports Illustrated under the headline ``Confessions of a Master
Fixer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the federal case was too far along for Morris and
Connolly to give Bulger and Flemmi a heads-up. Indeed, as 1978
wound down, it looked like Bulger and Flemmi were certain to be
indicted. But then the agents paid a visit to Jeremiah T.
O'Sullivan, the lead prosecutor on the New England Organized Crime
Strike Force. They explained that Bulger and Flemmi were an
investment they wanted to preserve as part of the FBI's war on the
local Mafia. The meeting achieved the hoped-for result. Bulger and
Flemmi were not charged.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to con me,'' says Cuilla, now 56, referring to the
reasons he says O'Sullivan gave him to explain Bulger and Flemmi's
absence from the indictment. ``I went in and had big beefs with
them.'' Having described Bulger and Flemmi's participation to FBI
agents and identified the two under oath during a state trial,
Cuilla says he was angry and incredulous when told the federal case
in Boston would not include the pair.
</P>
<P>
   Ciulla, formerly of Stoneham and the son of a fish merchant,
admits his outrage was not based on some high-minded devotion to
justice. It was self-preservation. ``I didn't want to leave them
out there,'' he recalls. ``You got to remember the more of them
left on the street, the more likely I get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan, says Ciulla, sought to play down Bulger and Flemmi's
culpability. ``He tried to justify Stevie's not being in the
indictment by the fact he was a little bit on the lambrooskie,''
says Ciulla. Flemmi had returned to Boston in 1974 after several
years on the lam in Canada. ``Then he was saying, `We couldn't
correlate certain dates' '' of fixed races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That is not true.' And Whitey was there all the
time.'' Ciulla says Bulger helped round up Boston-area bookmakers
to unwittingly take bets on fixed races. After suffering huge
losses, the bookies found themselves indebted to _ then controlled
by _ the Winter Hill gang.
</P>
<P>
   Ciulla says Bulger and Flemmi were ``very disciplined guys'' who
eschewed the partying, which he says included snorting cocaine,
that might begin in the gang's headquarters at Marshall Motors in
Somerville and run deep into the night. ``Did I hang out with
him?'' he says about Bulger. ``Socialize after the day's business?
Go with him to Southie? No. But he was always there. There was
always the money for him and for Stevie.''
</P>
<P>
   During the months leading to a trial that ended up running into
the summer of 1979 and lasted 46 days, Ciulla says, he was still
complaining about the failure to indict Bulger and Flemmi. He says
he asked O'Sullivan, ``Why are these guys being left out? They are
no more or less guilty than the others. They were partners. They
were part of the conspiracy. Why would you leave them out when I
had direct dealings with them?''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan, now in private practice at the Boston firm of Choate
Hall &AMP; Stewart, did not return a call seeking comment.

<P>
   From O'Sullivan, Ciulla says, he always got double-talk. From
FBI agents, he says, he finally got the truth. ``They had to tell
me,'' says Ciulla, ``because I was going nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the FBI told him Bulger and Flemmi had given their word
they would not go after him, a pledge Connolly has mentioned in
interviews. ``I wasn't OK about Stevie and Whitey, but I had to
swallow that load. You know what I mean? That's how it was.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prosecution overseen by O'Sullivan, Ciulla proved his
worth. Howie Winter and seven codefendants who remained in the case
(some had fled and others had pleaded guilty) were convicted in
July of 1979 after a 10-week trial. Ciulla testified for 17 days.
Winter was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Even before the trial
began, Morris had filed internal FBI paperwork cleaning up the
crisis as far as Bulger was concerned, and he resorted to the spin
that has since been exposed as commonplace in the FBI's files about
Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Morris wrote to FBI headquarters that Bulger was clear because
``no prosecutable case developed against source in the opinion of
Strike Force attorney handling the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Wolf did not mince words in ruling about Morris's
report. ``This was not true,'' he concluded. ``Rather, Bulger and
Flemmi were not prosecuted in the race-fix case because Connolly,
Morris, and O'Sullivan had decided that their value as informants
outweighed the importance of prosecuting them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pending case against Bulger and Flemmi assembled by a new
generation of prosecutors and investigators, the two crime bosses
are charged in the race-fixing scheme as one of their many acts of
alleged racketeering _ the same charge O'Sullivan chose not to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ciulla has spent the intervening years in and out
of the federal Witness Protection Program, and lives today under a
new identity at an undisclosed location. His last public appearance
in Boston was in mid-1995, when he was whisked into town to testify
at the bail hearing of John Martorano, the hitman for the Bulger
gang who had been a fugitive until his arrest that year.
</P>
<P>
   Ciulla says his decision to grant an interview was prompted
mostly by the latest sensational news in the Bulger case _ the
discovery Jan. 14 of the three buried bodies in Dorchester.
Authorities believe the three were killed by Bulger and Flemmi or
their underlings during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm telling you, listen, the three bodies they found . .
. that wouldn't have happened'' if Bulger and Flemmi had been
prosecuted in the race-fixing case, Ciulla says.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that FBI agents in 1979 had no idea of possible
murders to come. But agents did brush aside reports from other
informants at the time indicating Bulger and Flemmi's criminal
activities were growing and expanding into cocaine trafficking,
loan sharking, and extortion. In his recent ruling, Wolf wrote:
``Connolly and Morris were well-aware that he (Bulger) and Flemmi
remained involved in a range of criminal activity . . . The FBI
neither investigated nor disclosed such information to any other
law enforcement agency.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dead were what was on Ciulla's mind when he was
interviewed last week. He ticked off the names of others now
believed to have been killed either by Bulger and Flemmi, or on
their orders. ``Those things were impossible to happen if they went
along with it, if they were in the indictment,'' he says. ``Didn't
Howie (Winter) get 10 years? They would have been in jail. It would
have been the downfall of all that.''

 &HT;     McCAIN CHALLENGES BUSH'S EXPERIENCE AS TEXAN RALLIES FAMILY  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHAM, N.H. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain, pressing his
differences over Texas Gov. George Bush three days before New
Hampshire's Republican presidential primary, declared Saturday that
he does not need ``on-the-job training'' to lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain touted his populist campaign at three question-and-answer
sessions as Bush canvassed southern New Hampshire with his famous
family in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush
joined their 52-year-old son on the campaign trail, as did former
Cabinet officer Elizabeth Dole, who dropped her own quest for the
Republican presidential nomination last fall and endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy, this son of ours is not going to let you down,'' the
former president told more than 1,000 cheering, placard-waving
supporters gathered for a country music concert staged by the Bush
campaign at an indoor tennis complex in Milford.
</P>
<P>
   The former president, who lost his re-election bid in 1992 to
then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, told the crowd his son is ``going
to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor spoke for barely one minute to the crowd,
including families who had been waiting for up to two hours to hear
the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel something in the air; we're on our way because of
you,'' Bush said as he introduced his parents. Following brief
remarks by his mother and father, Bush added: ``Thank you all for
coming. Work hard. Knock on those doors. Shake those hands. And
we're going to love Tuesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire primary, the first of the 2000 campaign, is
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brief remarks left at least one member of the audience
perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well that was anti-climactic,'' complained Ron Pieterse, 40, a
dump truck driver from Peterborough who attended the rally with his
five-year-old daughter Sabina. ``I came to learn something. I guess
I'll have to go on the Internet to find out his positions on things
I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Pieterse said he planned to vote for Bush on Tuesday because of
his enduring loyalty to the former president. ``I've got that
bumper sticker, `Don't blame me, I voted for Bush,''' Pieterse said
as he walked to his car with his daughter, who was holding her doll
Sophie.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign issued a statement that cited the benefits of
his proposed tax cut. Bush said his plan would help ``those who
live on the outskirts of poverty'' as well as ``knock down the
tollbooth to the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said McCain's more modest tax cut included a provision to
tax the benefits paid employees by their companies. Bush said in
the statement: ``That's going to hurt working people.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spoke to voters in Windham several hours earlier,
cited Bush's use of his legendary family during the final weekend
of the hard-fought New Hampshire campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The celebrities that I'm interested in are the people in this
room and the people of New Hampshire,'' McCain told several hundred
people packed into the auditorium at a junior high school in
Windham, home of the ``Windham Wildcats.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added, at his 109th town hall meeting n the campaign:
``You are the celebrities that are important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three public opinion surveys released on Saturday showed McCain
leading Bush. The margin ranged from one percentage point in a
CNN-USA Today survey, 36 percent to 35 percent, to eight percentage
points in a University of New Hampshire-WMUR-Fox survey that showed
McCain leading Bush 41 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, a pollster based in Utica, N.Y., said the Republican
race could be ``very tight,'' adding: ``Bush may have the superior
organization to get out the vote and that could be critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Bush appealed for supporters to help turn out
the vote in a GOP field that includes three other candidates who
have notnot won elective office before _ magazine publisher Steve
Forbes, talk show host Alan Keyes, and former Reagan administration
official Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain devoted 25 minutes of remarks to his audience in Windham
to highlighting differences with Bush over the size of their
proposed tax cuts, action to close corporate tax loopholes, the
breadth of their backgrounds, steps to protect the fiscal soundness
of Social Security and proposals to overhaul the way campaigns are
financed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Bush was relying too heavily on support from the
wealthy to wage his campaign _ which has raised some $74 million _
while he was fighting to ``get big money out of Washington and give
the government back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ``Governor Bush is out there raising money. I'm
going to be out there raising hell.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain emphasized that he would not wage a negative campaign
against Bush, who is a ``good man.'' But the senator sought to
emphasize his experience over Bush, who first won elective office
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the life experiences; I have the legislative
experiences; I have knowledge of the grass roots issues,'' said
McCain, 63. ``I want you to know that I am fully prepared to be
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizonan served 22 years in the Navy, including five years
as a prisoner of North Vietnam, and has served 17 years in the
House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need any on-the-job training. I am fully prepared to
handle these responsibilities,'' McCain said.

   Scott Johnson, 32, a farmer whose family owns one of the last
two farms in Windham, near the Massachusetts state line, said he
initially planned to vote for Bush but now intends to vote for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Bush talks in sound bites. He doesn't seem to think on
his feet. McCain gives you a straight answer. For me, that is the
No. 1 absolute minimum requirement.''

REAL ESTATE: SMALL-TOWN LEGACIES OF LOUIS SULLIVAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Wis., Iowa, Ill., N.Y., Ind., Ohio)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT SHAROFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sullivan banks are some of the most written about and
analyzed buildings of the 20th century _ as well as some of the
most obscure.
</P>
<P>
   All are in out-of-the way Midwestern towns such as Owatonna,
Minn., Columbus, Wis., and Algona, Iowa. The largest is about 4,600
square feet, the smallest well under 1,500 square feet _ or not
much bigger than many Starbucks locations. None cost more than
$125,000 to build.
</P>
<P>
   They are the coda to a legendary career _ that of Louis H.
Sullivan, the turn-of-the-century Chicago architect best known for
coining the defining phrase of modern architecture, ``Form follows
function.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, notoriously grandiose and difficult, was the designer
of such landmark structures as the massive Auditorium Building and
the Carson Pirie Scott department store in Chicago; the Guaranty
Building in Buffalo, N.Y., and the Wainwright building in St.
Louis. The latter, which was finished in 1891, is often called the
first artistically successful modern skyscraper.
</P>
<P>
   By 1906, however, Sullivan, then 50, was down on his luck.
Unable to swing commissions in Chicago or other major cities, he
accepted an offer to design a new headquarters for the National
Farmers' Bank in Owatonna, a small farming town about 60 miles
south of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting structure was so extraordinary that he basically
spent the remainder of his career designing variations of it. The
building is often described as resembling a jewel box or strongbox
because of its imposing but surprisingly modern facade and lavishly
ornamented interior.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Pelli, former dean of the Yale University School of
Architecture as well as the designer of the World Financial Center
in New York, Canary Wharf in London and the Petronas Towers in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the tallest buildings in the world, calls
the Owatonna bank ``a masterpiece'' and ``one of the most beautiful
things Sullivan _ or any architect _ has ever designed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Weingarden, author of the book ``Louis H. Sullivan: The
Banks,'' says, ``You feel like you're walking into a cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan went on to design seven other banks, the last in 1920.
They are the main work of his later years. He died bankrupt in
1924.
</P>
<P>
   Today, five of the buildings are still being used as financial
institutions. They are the National Farmers' Bank in Owatonna and
the People's Saving Bank in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, both now owned by
Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.; the Purdue State Bank in West Lafayette Ind.,
now owned by Bank One; the Farmers and Merchants Union Bank in
Columbus, Wis., and the People's Savings and Loan Association in
Sidney, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Two others _ the Merchants National Bank in Grinnell, Iowa, and
the Adams Land and Loan Office in Algona _ are leased to the
chambers of commerce of those communities. The eighth, the Home
Building Association in Newark, Ohio, is now an ice-cream parlor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their continuing value as commercial structures,
the banks are much visited by architecture-minded tourists.
``People come from all over the world to see the building,'' said
Dennis Hanson, a regional president for Brenton Bank, owner of the
Grinnell bank. ``We have been featured on Japanese television and
on the cover of a Russian magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on our staff has tour director attached to their job
description,'' said John Pratt, vice president of Farmers and
Merchants Union Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The banks vary in their conditions. Some, such as the ones in
Owatonna, Columbus and Sidney, have been meticulously maintained
over the years. Others have endured successive waves of modernizing
and renovating but remain basically intact.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst maintained, until recently, was the Adams Land
and Loan office in Algona.
</P>
<P>
   The structure _ a 1,300-square-foot brick shoebox of a building
_ is one of the simplest Sullivan ever designed. Its defining
features were a series of 12 large stained glass windows on the
front and side facades along with a pair of terra cotta urns that
originally flanked the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, apparently, was even simpler, though no one is entirely
sure what the place looked like when it opened. The original plans
have disappeared, as have any photos that might have been taken at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   What does exist is a series of drawings done by an associate of
Sullivan's for an addition that was never built, showing the
approximate layout of the building. Aside from a beamed ceiling and
a mosaic tile floor, nothing of the original interior survives.
</P>
<P>
   The late Hugh Morrison, who wrote the first biography of
Sullivan in the 1930s, thought it was one of the architect's best
buildings. ``It is so obviously a direct statement of the problem,
and that problem was so simple, that it needs little comment,'' he
wrote. ``Few buildings of that period, however, either in this
country or in Europe, match it in quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seems to have gone right for the Adams building from the
very beginning. It was built to be a bank in 1913, but the owner
never received a charter. Instead it became a real estate office
and then the headquarters for Pharmacists' Mutual Insurance Co.
Then, in the '70s, it became a haberdashery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the store went bankrupt and the owner sold the windows
and the urns to a salvage dealer in Minneapolis. Shortly
thereafter, the windows _ which are bluish green with jewel-like
gold diadems in the center _ were bought by First Chicago Corp.,
now Bank One, for $7,000 to $9,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the windows are currently in the bank's executive dining
room in downtown Chicago. The other three are at Bank One's offices
in the Equitable Building on 51st Street in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   As for the urns, they were bought by Thomas S. Monaghan, the
founder of Domino's Pizza, who displayed them in a gift shop he
operated at Domino's headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich. He later sold
them, but a spokeswoman for Monaghan said he could not recall the
buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Adams building was acquired by the
Sullivan Building Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded for
the purpose of saving and restoring it. The price was $71,500,
quite a bit less than the windows commanded. The foundation also
found a tenant _ the local chamber of commerce, which pays $475 a
month in rent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, the foundation, headed by Paul Johnson,
a local banker, has raised $160,000 from grants and local donations
to restore the building's exterior and start work on the interior.
Johnson estimates that $50,000 more is needed to finish the job.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The architect for the project is Michael Emerson of VOA
Associates in Chicago, who is doing much of the work for a reduced
fee. ``This may be the most important building I'll ever work on,''
he said. The idea, he added, is ``to recreate the way it looked the
day it opened.''
</P>
<P>
   To do this, the foundation found a clay artisan in Des Moines to
hand-make the 1,200 bricks needed to repair the facade. In the next
few months, work will begin on the interior.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is the windows. ``We need them,'' said Emerson.
``The windows are where Sullivan spent his budget. They are the
thing that makes the whole building work.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the window openings are covered by plywood and clear
glass. The foundation has so far been unsuccessful in raising the
money to buy the originals back. An alternative the foundation is
considering is offering the bank replicas of the windows in
exchange for the originals. A spokesman for Bank One said the
company would have no comment until a formal offer is received.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a rural town in Iowa,'' said Johnson. ``And while we
have a lot of good attributes, we don't have very much in the way
of cultural things and institutions. That's why this building is so
important. It gives the downtown a little more uniqueness.''

JUST BARELY SETTLED IN, GROH HOLDS JETS' REINS

 (ATTN: Va., Mass.)  (rk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his first week on the job as the New York Jets'
coach, Al Groh quickly understood the immediacy of the role he
inherited under unsettling circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people that need a lot of direction,'' Groh
said. ``They are looking to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not mean that he is indispensable, but that he had to be
in charge, had to show the direction the team is going, had to make
clear his vision of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   When gently chided about the papers and files and memos that
have not yet been put in their place in his new office, Groh said,
``One of my projects was to come in here and start being the coach
and put everything in place, not to have a decorator.''
</P>
<P>
   His office is the one used by Bill Belichick, who had been his
colleague going back to their Giants years, but who will now be a
coaching rival with the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   But who knows how far down the hall Groh's next office will be?
And how soon?
</P>
<P>
   For all signs point to Bill Parcells retiring from the Jets in
July as chief of football operations, just about the time the team
begins training camp. Two longtime friends of Parcells say he will
quit then. Robert Wood Johnson IV, the new owner, said the two will
talk in midsummer about Parcells' role.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Groh may be filling that role as well as the head
coach's post.
</P>
<P>
   Groh already has the final word on personnel matters: the draft,
free agency, the hiring of coaches and the support people who make
up a football operation. It is believed the Jets had contacted
experienced personnel executives to assume the role of an
operations director.
</P>
<P>
   But since Parcells is remaining in that job for now, helping to
guide Groh through free agency, which starts in less than two
weeks, and the April college draft and the putting together of
minicamps and training camps, it is possible that Johnson might
eventually feel comfortable with Groh doing it all.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has not wanted a transition feel to the team, and the
very first conversation Groh had with the owner he told him: ``I am
not your transition coach. I'm the coach for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is familiarity with Steve Gutman remaining as
president. But asked about his contract, the affable Gutman said:
``I have the same contract I have always had with the Jets. It's
over at sundown every day. I never had a contract with Leon Hess
and I don't have one now.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his freshman orientation, Groh said, ``I've been immersing
myself in free agency and doing a study of the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   He was a commerce major at the University of Virginia once upon
a time, and now he is trying to put the theory into practice.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, his daily classes with the team's salary-cap expert, Mike
Tannenbaum, as well as with Parcells, both of whom he describes as
``getting me up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also spending the weekend interviewing coaching candidates
about defense. The staff should be complete before the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Groh's offense was settled within a few days of his ascension
last week. He quickly cut Charlie Weis, the offensive
coordinator/receivers' coach, and the defensive assistant Eric
Mangini. Both were just as quickly picked up by Belichick with
little contract haggling. A lot of people seemed to know for a long
time where they would be heading.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as the daily grind of getting this Jets thing
together again, Groh said: ``I feel good. There's not much about it
that has surprised me and that's the way it should be.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The coaching staff of the Tennessee Titans spent much
of Super Bowl week buried in a bunker watching films, analyzing
scouting reports, drinking coffee and devouring pizza. George
Henshaw, the assistant head coach, looked like a man cramming for a
bar exam, his nose deep in a playbook. His job: make sure running
back Eddie George has lots of gorgeous holes in the St. Louis Rams'
line to scamper through.
</P>
<P>
   Henshaw, one of the most dedicated coaches in pro football,
slept a total of about 10 hours between Sunday and late Tuesday
night, helping to put the game plan in place. He spent a
significant amount of time reviewing in his mind a single play, one
the Titans will run over and over.
</P>
<P>
   The play is called Unit Right-14 Gut. If the Titans get their
bread-and-butter play cranking, they can control the game and the
clock, and, most important, keep the vaunted St. Louis offense off
the field. If the Rams shut George down, it could be bombs away for
St. Louis and a high-scoring contest, something Tennessee does not
want.
</P>
<P>
   Henshaw is in charge of Tennessee's running game, and has helped
transform the Titans into one of the most prolific rushing units in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to establish the running game,'' Henshaw said,
``and that is one of our best plays. It will be the key for us.
Most of the teams we watched play the Rams, by the end of the first
quarter, the Rams were playing with a two-touchdown lead. We don't
want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher was more blunt. ``In order for us to
win this ballgame,'' he said, ``Eddie must have an MVP type of
game. There's no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When George falls into a deep sleep the night before a game,
visions of 14 Gut are dancing in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he likes to put the pressure on me,'' George said of
Fisher. ``I'm just looking to do my job and put the offense in
position to score some points. If I put up MVP-type numbers, so be
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few teams in pro football run their base running play with the
kind of precision and discipline that the Titans do. With a
powerful, veteran offensive line that can handle the most
complicated blocking schemes, a power runner in the 6-foot-3-inch,
240-pound George, who has great vision and can skip from hole to
hole, and not to mention wide receivers that are outstanding
blockers, it is no wonder that 14 Gut is so formidable.
</P>
<P>
   George just completed his best regular season as a pro, carrying
the ball 320 times for 1,304 yards, averaging 4.1 yards a carry. He
joined Barry Sanders, Eric Dickerson and Earl Campbell as the only
backs to gain at least 1,200 rushing yards in each of their first
four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A chunk of those yards came from 14 Gut. The team's favorite
rushing play starts up front with the skilled linemen, who mostly
use a zone-blocking scheme. Tennessee linemen don't block specific
players, instead blocking a certain area. Zone blocking is much
more difficult than one on one, and few players can master the
technique, but the Titans pull it off to near perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Part of 14 Gut designates which hole George is supposed to run
in and the appropriate blocking scheme. This is where George can be
dazzling. When a hole opens up, George usually attacks it with an
uncommon ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was on defense, Eddie would scare me to death,'' said
Bruce Matthews, the 17-year guard. ``Here is this 240-pound back,
all muscles, high-stepping right at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rams defensive lineman Kevin Carter: ``We've seen film
where he has just flat-out run guys over. Defensive linemen,
linebackers, whatever. He has a lot of power. We're going to make
sure we wrap up on tackles and hit him hard. Because that
tackling-at-the-ankles stuff won't work with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But George is also great at bouncing outside and possesses a
modicum of speed and quickness. In fact, George has two options on
14 Gut: he can go directly between the center and right guard, or
if that gap is closed, bounce left between the center and left
guard.
</P>
<P>
   When the Titans beat the Rams on Halloween, George had 68 yards
on 17 carries, not great numbers, but several of his cutback runs
went for key first downs. He slowly wore down the St. Louis
defense, and when the Rams stacked the line with eight and nine
defenders to stop George's runs, it was then that George became a
receiver, catching a 17-yard touchdown pass from Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw eight- and nine-man fronts all season long,'' George
said. ``But we do well against them because we run our base plays
well and we stick with them. I'm just patient and wait for things
to open up.''
</P>
<P>
   Another basic Titans running play helped get them to the Super
Bowl. It is called 17 Switch and is a version of the Washington
Redskins' old countertrey play, in which a guard and tackle pulled
and George burst through the hole up the middle. It produced a
68-yard touchdown run early in the second half of the playoff game
against the Indianapolis Colts that broke the game wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage George and Titans. Good blocking up front, strong
running by George and a critical block by wide receiver Yancey
Thigpen in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee will run a number of running plays against St. Louis,
but the offense will always fall back on its main course, 14 Gut.
No one on the Tennessee team would have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we might see that play a few times,'' McNair said,
smiling. ``Just a few.''

MARGARET HART FERRARO, QUEEN OF BURLESQUE AND SOCIETY, DIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., Calif., Mass.)   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margaret Hart Ferraro, a New York stripteas dancer, who went on
to become a savvy real estate investor, political wife and society
matron in Los Angeles, died on Wednesday after a long illness. She
had habitually refused to give her age, but friends said 84 might
be close.
</P>
<P>
   She was married to John Ferraro, the Los Angeles City Council
president, and had become a vivacious participant in the city's
life. ``Margaret was one of the funniest, most outrageous and
loving women I ever met,'' Mayor Richard Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ferraro won fame under the name Margie Hart, and was billed
as ``the poor man's Garbo.'' A line in the song ``Zip!'' in Lorenz
Hart's ``Pal Joey'' refers to her: ``Who the hell is Margie Hart?''
Danny Kaye immortalized her in a song that talked about farmers who
``used to utterly utter when Margie Hart churned her butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although in 1985 Mrs. Ferraro told The Los Angeles Times that
her costumes were less revealing than modern bikinis, a
contemporaneous burlesque dancer and rival, Sherry Britton,
disagreed. ``She was the reason that Mayor La Guardia closed up
burlesque here,'' she said in an interview. ``She was the first one
to go without her G-string.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Britton said that in 1939, she was working at Minsky's
Gaiety, then a theater at 46th Street and Broadway, with Margie
Hart, and Miss Hart was dating a detective who warned her when the
censors were coming to give her time to slip on a G-string. When
she started dating someone else, the warnings stopped and Miss Hart
was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Miss Hart, who was known for her flaming red hair and
statuesque figure, married Seaman Block Jacobs, a comedy writer for
Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, George Burns and others, and switched to
legitimate theater. She appeared in two traveling productions of
Broadway shows, ``Light Up the Sky'' and ``Cry Havoc,'' and
received good reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The couple moved to Los Angeles in 1947 and divorced in 1955.
She joined the Los Angeles social circuit, holding large parties in
her Bel-Air house. She met John Ferraro, a former All-American
football player at the University of Southern California and a City
Council member, in the 1970s. They married in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved people and they loved her,'' Ferraro said in a
prepared statement. ``She was very intelligent, enjoyed her own
unique views of Los Angeles and the world of politics, and didn't
mind sharing those views.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ferraro was born on a farm in Edgerton, Mo., and was raised
with seven sisters and one brother. She ran away from home and
joined a chorus line in Chicago, Jacobs said. Soon, she was on the
burlesque circuit, traveling the Eastern and Midwestern United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a very great stage presence,'' Ms. Britton said.
``Very sexy, gorgeous body.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also liked to show off her mind. At a time when the
first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, was writing a column titled ``My
Day,'' Miss Hart was writing one with a significantly different
slant called ``My Night,'' published sporadically in show business
publications.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, she demonstrated a keen intelligence, fixing up
old buildings in the Hancock Park area and selling them at a
profit. She was president of Screen Smart Set, a support group for
the Motion Picture and Television Home in Woodland Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered an aneurysm and a stroke that left her partially
paralyzed shortly after she married Ferraro, but continued to
attend charity events in elegant, sometimes flamboyant fashions.
She insisted on leaving her wheelchair at home, relying instead on
a fashionable cane.
</P>
<P>
   Her death is another mark of a closing era. Last year, two
famous ecdysiasts, the word Mencken coined for striptease artists,
Lili St. Cyr and Ann Corio, died. Neither revealed her age, but
most people thought they were in their 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ferraro is also survived by a son, Thomas Jacobs of Salem,
Mass.; a daughter, Morgan Most of Agoura Hills, Calif.; and five
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jaffee, Mrs. Ferraro's publicist for many decades, once
asked the membership requirements of a women's luncheon group
called ``great old broads'' that she attended. Mrs. Ferraro laughed
and said it took years to qualify. ``First, you have to be a great
young broad.''

BUSH'S PARENTS JOIN HIM AT RALLY AS PRIMARY DAY NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, N.H. _ Pulling out all the stops as the days until this
state's primary dwindle, Gov. George W. Bush made the personal
political Saturday afternoon and staged a rally at which he brought
out his two closest and most enormously popular allies: his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had done virtually no public campaigning with his parents
since he formally announced his candidacy in June, a sure sign of
his sensitivity to any impression that he was trading heavily on
his famous surname and political pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   But with Tuesday's contest looming and Bush locked in a fierce
battle with Sen. John McCain, it was time for the biggest of guns,
and they appeared on a stage at an indoor tennis center here to a
thunderous roar from more than 1,600 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting in Washington,'' former first lady Barbara
Bush said, ``and we said, `We've got to go up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush then chimed in, but, like Mrs. Bush, spoke
only a few sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even from as far away as Texas, you get the sense that things
are moving up here and moving well,'' Bush said. ``This boy _ this
son of ours _ is not going to let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Their son stood beaming at their side, surrounded by three of
his four siblings _ Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was not there _ and by
prominent political allies like Elizabeth Dole, the former
president of the Red Cross, and Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Texas governor spoke for only a minute or two, and the
prominent assemblage onstage dispersed and disappeared almost as
soon as it had materialized. But they were there just long enough
for photographers and television crews to record their presence.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign drew supporters and other voters to the event
by promising a free concert by the country singer Travis Tritt.
When Tritt could not travel here because of bad weather, he was
replaced at the last minute by the Bellamy Brothers, whose old hits
include the song ``Redneck Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   They played a brief set, then paused around 3 p.m., so that Sen.
Judd Gregg, the chairman of Bush's campaign in New Hampshire, could
begin summoning the impressive lineup of Bush family members and
prominent political allies.
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas governor took the stage, the cheers were robust.
</P>
<P>
   Then they were absolutely wild, signaling the crowd's surprise _
when his parents joined him.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, many of Bush's supporters cite his heritage as one
of the main reasons they like him. Their memories of President
Bush, whom they constantly cite as an honorable man, seem to have
grown ever fonder as their disillusion with President Clinton's
behavior in office increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes your parents have a great influence on you,'' said
Gonnar Trenoweth, an engineer from Peterborough who attended the
event. ``And if he can be half the person his father was, he'll do
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the former first lady and the former president had been
doing more and more campaign appearances for their son over the
last two weeks, as the beginning of the primary season neared, but
they had not joined him at a campaign event during that time.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the three appeared at an event connected to the
Texas governor's campaign for the presidency was in September, when
they attended a fund-raiser in Brookline, Mass., that was not open
to the news media. Never before in the course of this campaign had
so many members of the immediate Bush family come together in
public.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd that greeted them in Milford was the second impressive
turnout Saturday for Bush, whose allies in the state seem to be
bringing more and more political muscle to bear on his race here.
In the morning, nearly 1,000 people had attended a breakfast speech
he gave at a restaurant in Portsmouth.

EDITORIAL: HOT POLITICS IN THE SNOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Jan. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Much about the political scene in New Hampshire is comfortably
familiar this year. Buses carrying the main Republican and
Democratic contenders and scores of parka-clad reporters grind
across a snowy landscape. Candidates used to addressing hundreds or
thousands at big-city fund-raisers face pods of school kids and
senior citizens in small-town opera houses. The state's television
stations are battening on nonstop political ads. In a familiar
quadrennial exercise, the staunchly Republican Manchester Union
Leader fiercely attacks GOP candidates suspected of being
insufficiently right-wing. This year Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
labeled ``Governor Smirk'' in a front-page editorial on Friday, is
getting the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat less obvious is the fierce definitional contest being
played out before the state's Democratic and Republican voters, not
to mention its much-wooed independents, in the run-up to Tuesday's
primaries. For the winnowing process is also a multilayered process
of sorting for the voters and self-invention on the part of the
candidates. The voters signal, by their questions and applause at
town-hall meetings, the qualities they will accept or reject in a
presidential nominee. The candidates, through their stump
performances, must present their political personas even as they
try to guess exactly what the voters want this year. It is the open
intensity of the process and the combative mix of candidates that
has given the 2000 primary election in the Granite State a
distinctive flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The process of self-invention is most obvious on the Republican
side, since the main candidates, Bush and Sen. John McCain, are
newcomers to presidential politics, and both are trying to slide
toward the middle on their signature issues while giving lip
service to Reaganite doctrine. Bush talks about economic fairness
for 22-year-old single mothers and federal aid to education. McCain
rails like an old-time populist against the special interests that
finance his party.
</P>
<P>
   But at the definitional level, both men are running against
unanswered questions about themselves. New Hampshire voters will
decide if Bush is smart and seasoned enough to be president. They
will also judge whether McCain has depth and stability to match his
charm and heroic resume. Neither can ignore the appeal of the
undiluted anti-tax rhetoric of Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes as a
factor in the voting on Tuesday. But it really is a two-person
contest when it comes to who could be a viable national candidate
in the general election. The Bush people are subtly urging
commentators to look beyond the New Hampshire vote, figuring they
can absorb a loss if they have to and grind down McCain in the
later primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The drama on the Democratic side comes from the palpable
antipathy between Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill
Bradley of New Jersey and from the peculiar needs of each
candidate. Bradley needs to show that he has the legs to continue
into the later primaries, and Gore needs to prove that he can stir
more devotion than irritation among swing voters. Each man is
presenting himself as the true guardian of the Democratic
social-welfare tradition. At the level of defining the opponent,
their depictions are veering toward mutual destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore portrays the senator as a chronic complainer
who cannot distinguish between a policy debate and personal
criticism. When Bradley asserts that Gore represents ``old
politics,'' he wants to be understood as calling Gore a panderer
and a liar. But to date, Gore has done the greater damage by
painting Bradley as more comfortable with the inner ceremonies of
his own personality than with a gritty fight for the presidency.
What neither man knows is how much tolerance the public has for
their slanging match, a key question for Bradley since his trailing
position may require him to bludgeon Gore on the Clinton
administration fund-raising scandals.
</P>
<P>
   While the personal and ideological intensity of this contest on
both the GOP and the Democratic sides may be dispiriting to some
voters, we see the competitiveness and the discussion of pressing
national issues such as health care and gun control as positives.
The real shame is that neither national party has designed a
primary system that would allow more states to play host to a week
of the kind of riveting political theater now playing in New
Hampshire.

MARSHALL C. ENGLAND, HEALTH ADVOCATE FOR POOR, DIES AT 67
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., Ala., Ill.)   (jw) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marshall C. England, who left a job as a
schoolteacher in the racially segregated South of the 1950s and
eventually became an influential advocate for the poor and working
class of New York City, died on Jan. 22 in Manhattan. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   He died at Bellevue Hospital Center of complications from a
recent stroke, said his companion, Judy Wessler.
</P>
<P>
   England, a familiar figure among Manhattan community advocates,
was known for his command of health care issues affecting the poor,
as well as his turtleneck sweater, khaki pants and two
always-present grocery bags bulging with government reports, legal
pads and budget analyses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never known anyone who knew more about the minutiae of
health care,'' said the Rev. Diane Lacey Winley, a Presbyterian
minister on the Upper West Side and a board member of the New York
City Health and Hospitals Corp., who had known England for more
than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   England's most recent victory was one of his most notable, Ms.
Winley said. In March, New York State's highest court decisively
ruled against the Giuliani administration's efforts to privatize
New York City's public hospitals, specifically a plan to lease
Coney Island Hospital to a private company. England had helped
prompt the litigation as well as to organize public demonstrations
against the plan, which he contended would hurt the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Perennially late for appointments because passers-by would seek
his advice, England alarmed friends when he was invited to
Istanbul, Turkey, several years ago for an international conference
on homelessness. True to form, he was still in the process of
getting his passport two hours before his flight and left without
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Cleveland England was born on Oct. 27, 1932, in
Thomasville, Ala., the son of the Rev. L.T. England and Daisy
England, a schoolteacher. After getting a degree from Alabama A&AMP;M,
England taught and was the football coach at an all-black middle
school in Linden, Ala. In the late 1950s, he went north to Chicago,
where he worked in construction, and later to New York, where he
was a youth counselor to gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Something about the counseling experience kindled a fierce
commitment to expanding opportunities for the poor in employment
and health care. England helped found and was executive director of
the League of Autonomous Bronx Organizations for Renewal, or Labor,
a private community-action agency in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   While heading Labor much of his career, he also volunteered as a
senior official in a dizzying number of organizations from the
1960s until his death, including the Congress of Racial Equality;
the antipoverty agency Haryou-Act, or Harlem Youth-Associated
Community Teams; the Harlem Alliance for Comprehensive Health
Planning; the Coalition for Health Care Services; and the
Commission on the Public's Health System.
</P>
<P>
   England is survived by two sisters, Rose Cameron of Tuscaloosa,
Ala., and Jean Clayton of Thomasville.

 McCAIN CHALLENGES BUSH'S EXPERIENCE AS TEXAN RALLIES FAMILY  
 (EDs: SUBS lede to add `W' to Bush reference; pickup: McCain
touted)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHAM, N.H. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain, pressing his
differences over Texas Gov. George W. Bush three days before New
Hampshire's Republican presidential primary, declared Saturday that
he does not need ``on-the-job training'' to lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain touted his populist campaign at three question-and-answer
sessions as Bush canvassed southern New Hampshire with his famous
family in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush
joined their 52-year-old son on the campaign trail, as did former
Cabinet officer Elizabeth Dole, who dropped her own quest for the
Republican presidential nomination last fall and endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy, this son of ours is not going to let you down,'' the
former president told more than 1,000 cheering, placard-waving
supporters gathered for a country music concert staged by the Bush
campaign at an indoor tennis complex in Milford.
</P>
<P>
   The former president, who lost his re-election bid in 1992 to
then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, told the crowd his son is ``going
to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor spoke for barely one minute to the crowd,
including families who had been waiting for up to two hours to hear
the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel something in the air; we're on our way because of
you,'' Bush said as he introduced his parents. Following brief
remarks by his mother and father, Bush added: ``Thank you all for
coming. Work hard. Knock on those doors. Shake those hands. And
we're going to love Tuesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire primary, the first of the 2000 campaign, is
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brief remarks left at least one member of the audience
perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well that was anti-climactic,'' complained Ron Pieterse, 40, a
dump truck driver from Peterborough who attended the rally with his
five-year-old daughter Sabina. ``I came to learn something. I guess
I'll have to go on the Internet to find out his positions on things
I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Pieterse said he planned to vote for Bush on Tuesday because of
his enduring loyalty to the former president. ``I've got that
bumper sticker, `Don't blame me, I voted for Bush,''' Pieterse said
as he walked to his car with his daughter, who was holding her doll
Sophie.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign issued a statement that cited the benefits of
his proposed tax cut. Bush said his plan would help ``those who
live on the outskirts of poverty'' as well as ``knock down the
tollbooth to the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said McCain's more modest tax cut included a provision to
tax the benefits paid employees by their companies. Bush said in
the statement: ``That's going to hurt working people.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spoke to voters in Windham several hours earlier,
cited Bush's use of his legendary family during the final weekend
of the hard-fought New Hampshire campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The celebrities that I'm interested in are the people in this
room and the people of New Hampshire,'' McCain told several hundred
people packed into the auditorium at a junior high school in
Windham, home of the ``Windham Wildcats.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added, at his 109th town hall meeting n the campaign:
``You are the celebrities that are important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three public opinion surveys released on Saturday showed McCain
leading Bush. The margin ranged from one percentage point in a
CNN-USA Today survey, 36 percent to 35 percent, to eight percentage
points in a University of New Hampshire-WMUR-Fox survey that showed
McCain leading Bush 41 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, a pollster based in Utica, N.Y., said the Republican
race could be ``very tight,'' adding: ``Bush may have the superior
organization to get out the vote and that could be critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Bush appealed for supporters to help turn out
the vote in a GOP field that includes three other candidates who
have not won elective office before _ magazine publisher Steve
Forbes, talk show host Alan Keyes, and former Reagan administration
official Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain devoted 25 minutes of remarks to his audience in Windham
to highlighting differences with Bush over the size of their
proposed tax cuts, action to close corporate tax loopholes, the
breadth of their backgrounds, steps to protect the fiscal soundness
of Social Security and proposals to overhaul the way campaigns are
financed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Bush was relying too heavily on support from the
wealthy to wage his campaign _ which has raised some $74 million _
while he was fighting to ``get big money out of Washington and give
the government back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ``Governor Bush is out there raising money. I'm
going to be out there raising hell.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain emphasized that he would not wage a negative campaign
against Bush, who is a ``good man.'' But the senator sought to
emphasize his experience over Bush, who first won elective office
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the life experiences; I have the legislative
experiences; I have knowledge of the grass roots issues,'' said
McCain, 63. ``I want you to know that I am fully prepared to be
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizonan served 22 years in the Navy, including five years
as a prisoner of North Vietnam, and has served 17 years in the
House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need any on-the-job training. I am fully prepared to
handle these responsibilities,'' McCain said.

<P>
   Scott Johnson, 32, a farmer whose family owns one of the last
two farms in Windham, near the Massachusetts state line, said he
initially planned to vote for Bush but now intends to vote for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Bush talks in sound bites. He doesn't seem to think on
his feet. McCain gives you a straight answer. For me, that is the
No. 1 absolute minimum requirement.''

LEE ROBERT BOBKER, 74, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y., Maine)  (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee Robert Bobker, a documentary filmmaker whose work won three
Academy Award nominations and an Emmy nomination, died on Dec. 28
at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. He was 74 and lived in
Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Bobker did his best-known movie work in the 1960s, directing
three films that became candidates for Oscars: ``Psychiatric
Nursing''; ``The Odds Against,'' about the correctional system, and
``The Revolving Door.'' He also made a film about censorship, ``The
First Amendment,'' for the American Library Association.
</P>
<P>
   His Emmy nomination came for ``I, Leonardo,'' a PBS series about
the life of Leonardo da Vinci. In the early 1990s he turned to
cable television and made the critically acclaimed biographical
film ``Isaac Stern, a Life.'' Altogether, his work garnered about
300 honors at national and international film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Bobker also had a career as a writer. He contributed to
professional and general periodicals and wrote two textbooks about
filmmaking and its aesthetics. The first, ``Elements of Film''
(1971), went through four editions and remains in print. The other
was ``Making Movies: From Script to Screen'' (1973).
</P>
<P>
   He wrote 500 scripts and served as associate producer of ``David
and Lisa,'' a 1962 drama about two disturbed adolescents. Starting
in 1956 he also taught at New York University's film school, where
he gave an introductory course on filmmaking for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Bobker was born in Belle Harbor, N.Y. He served as a combat
infantryman in World War II and earned a Bronze Star for bravery
during the Omaha Beach landing in Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he enrolled at New York University as a premed
student but switched to film and graduated in 1949 to join a
production company as a writer and director of documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he formed his own company, Vision Associates, and
served as its president until he dissolved it in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Bobker, who styled himself a liberal Democrat,
bucked the loyalty oath requirement of the Directors Guild of
America. He and a handful of colleagues took the guild to court
after it denied them membership because they had declined to take
the oath. A federal appeals panel unanimously knocked out the
guild's requirement, ruling that it was ``inherently vague.'' The
plaintiffs won the case when the U.S. Supreme Court, in December
1966, refused to review that unanimous lower court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Bobker is survived by his wife, the former Kate Gene Russell;
two daughters, Gene Ellen Spieler of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and
Laurie Beth Mahler of Bedford, N.Y.; a son, Dr. Daniel H. Bobker of
Brunswick, Maine; and seven grandchildren.

JESTER HAIRSTON, ACTOR AND EXPERT ON BLACK CHORAL MUSIC, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Calif., N.C., Pa., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By MEL WATKINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jester Hairston, a veteran character actor and a conductor and
arranger who was praised as one of the leading authorities on black
choral music, died Jan. 18 in Los Angeles. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   His acting career extended even into his 90s, as gained the
attention of a new generation of fans with his role as Rolly, the
wily, wisecracking deacon on the television situation comedy
``Amen,'' from 1986 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Hairston came to Hollywood in 1935 as the assistant conductor
for the Hall Johnson choir, which had been hired to sing in the
black-cast film ``The Green Pastures.'' His musical break came when
he met the composer Dimitri Tiomkin while conducting the Johnson
choir as it recorded the background score for the movie ``Lost
Horizon'' (1937). When a producer questioned the ability of black
singers to perform in Russian, Tiomkin reportedly said, ``I don't
see color. I hear music,'' and assured Hairston, ``If I come back
to Hollywood, you are my choral conductor and arranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiomkin did return, and during the next 20 years, Hairston
worked with him on films including ``Red River,'' ``She Wore a
Yellow Ribbon,'' ``Duel in the Sun'' and ``Land of the Pharaohs.''
He established himself as one of Hollywood's most respected choral
arrangers and directors.
</P>
<P>
   He continued working as a musical arranger after the partnership
with Tiomkin ended. He was best known for his work in ``Lilies of
the Field,'' for which he composed and arranged the song ``Amen''
and dubbed the singing for Sidney Poitier. He composed or arranged
more than 300 choral spirituals.
</P>
<P>
   Hairston supplemented his income as a conductor by accepting bit
parts in Hollywood films and appearing in several Tarzan movies as
an African.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always picked me for the Tarzan films because my skin was
so black,'' he told an interviewer. He was harshly criticized for
accepting stereotypical roles like that of Jethro, the slave of Jim
Bowie in the 1960 film ``The Alamo,'' who, when freed by his
master, insisted on remaining at his side.
</P>
<P>
   And although he played the part of Henry Van Porter, a
well-dressed, self-styled socialite who ridiculed the other
characters on the ``Amos 'n' Andy'' television show, he and other
members of the cast were excoriated for demeaning depictions of
blacks. Civil rights groups forced the show off the air after the
1953 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a hard time then fighting for dignity,'' he said later.
``We had no power. We had to take it, and because we took it, the
young people today have greater opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hairston's wife, Isabelle Margaret Swanigan, died in 1986. He is
survived by a stepdaughter, Jeanne-Marie Swann; three
grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Hairston was born on a plantation in Belews Creek, N.C., in
1901. The family moved to Homestead, Pa., where his father was a
steelworker. After graduating from high school in 1921, Hairston
went to the Massachusetts Agricultural College to study landscape
design. When his church scholarship ran out, he had to leave.
Later, he enrolled at Tufts University, where he studied music and
graduated in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that I wanted to make my mark in folk songs because
my grandparents were slaves,'' he said. ``I wanted to keep that
music alive.'' Hairston received an honorary doctorate in music
from Tufts in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Like his mentor, Hall Johnson, he was dedicated to preserving
the authenticity of the rural black voice: the way black people
sang in church or while working in the fields. Their collaboration
affected all of his later work.
</P>
<P>
   In working with the Johnson choir, Hairston said, ``I got a very
good break.'' He explained, ``My job was to teach the choir
Johnson's arrangements as assistant conductor and prepare the choir
_ that is, his choir.''
</P>
<P>
   During his later years, he was a prime mover behind the national
Hairston clan, a family organization that traces its lineage to
pre-Civil War America and sponsors reunions for both black and
white family members throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jester Hairston was a great believer in family and
reconciliation,'' said Henry Wiencek, author of ``The Hairstons: An
American Family in Black and White'' (1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``He never let go of his anger over slavery, but he also
forgave. Still, he insisted that you should never forget your
history.''

VICTORIA FROMKIN, 76, INTERPRETER OF ORAL MISCUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By MARGALIT FOX   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Victoria A. Fromkin, an internationally renowned linguist who
gathered the flotsam of human discourse _ slips of the tongue,
mishearings and other speech errors _ and used it to illuminate the
way in which language is organized in the mind, died on Jan. 19 in
Los Angeles. She was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said officials at the University of
California at Los Angeles, where Dr. Fromkin, an emeritus professor
of linguistics, had taught since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to publishing many articles on psycholinguistics,
Dr. Fromkin and Robert Rodman wrote ``An Introduction to Language''
(Harcourt Brace), now in its sixth edition and regarded as the
seminal undergraduate textbook in the field. As Dr. Fromkin was
gleefully aware, everyday speech contains many a slip 'twixt the
brain and the lip. While earlier scholars had noted the theoretical
usefulness of these errors, she was the first to gather them in
quantity, colleagues said, building a collection of linguistic
inadvertencies like spoonerisms (``speech production'' coming out
as ``preach seduction''), semantic substitutions (``That's a horse
of a different race'') and slips of the ear (``All of the members
of the group grew up in Philadelphia'' heard as ``All of the
members of the group threw up in Philadelphia'').
</P>
<P>
   To know Dr. Fromkin was to be accustomed to having every verbal
lapse transcribed for scientific posterity in a notebook she
carried.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fromkin used the collection, which grew to more than 10,000
examples, to offer evidence of the unconscious knowledge of
language structure that people draw on whenever they speak. A
person who means to say ``bridge of the nose'' but says ``bridge of
the neck'' instead, she explained, was furnishing concrete, if
unwitting, evidence that the words ``nose'' and ``neck'' are stored
near each other in some sort of mental lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fromkin was born Victoria Alexandra Landish in Passaic,
N.J., on May 16, 1923. She received a bachelor's degree in
economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1944.
She married Jack Fromkin in 1948. A son, Mark, died in an
automobile accident at age 16.

AMERICA ONE BEATEN IN MANY WAYS

   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ For the America's Cup hopeful Paul
Cayard, it was one of those days. On a wild afternoon in a howling
breeze that topped off at better than 30 knots, Cayard and his crew
aboard America One succumbed to Italy's Prada Challenge Saturday to
fall behind, 2-1, in the best-of-9 finals for the Louis Vuitton
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will take on Team New Zealand in the America's Cup
match beginning Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard started quickly, but it all went downhill very fast.
Before the race was through, America One looked as if it had been
involved in demolition derby, not a yacht race. ``We had a little
trouble keeping control of the boat,'' Cayard said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when it was over, Cayard and his team actually had
reason to be thankful. As the day wore on America One's mast began
to give way, a development that eventually forced the San
Francisco-based crew to withdraw on the fourth of the race's six
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We damaged it pretty severely,'' Cayard said. ``It was
degenerating pretty rapidly at the end, and we decided it was
probably better to finish with it vertical rather than wrapped
around the keel.''
</P>
<P>
   Both boats executed superb starts, hitting the line in unison
with Prada positioned slightly to windward of America One. From
there, it was strictly a battle of boat speed. Like two
heavyweights standing toe to toe in the center of the ring, neither
would concede an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaving their way to weather in a steady 20-plus-knot northerly
breeze funneling down the Hauraki Gulf _ their bows occasionally
submerged in the larger of the building seas _ Cayard and Prada's
Francesco de Angelis displayed superb helmsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The early boat speed advantage belonged to Cayard. After a
heated, bumpy drag race to the left side of the course, Prada
tacked for the top mark. America One immediately followed and, when
the breeze clocked a tad to the left, took a slight tactical
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   As the wind began to build and the tide turned about an hour
into the race, the stacking waves grew even more spectacular. One
drenched America One crewman kept busy bailing bucketfuls of ocean
out of the cockpit. But the Americans capped an outstanding first
leg and rounded 14 seconds ahead of the Italians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty encouraged about how our boat was going,''
Cayard said.
</P>
<P>
   Both boats executed bear-away spinnaker sets. And the first half
of the run toward the leeward mark was business as usual, with
America One maintaining a slight edge.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as it converged on Prada under port jibe _ meaning it
was obliged to stay well clear of the starboard-jibed Italians _
America One lost any semblance of composure.
</P>
<P>
   As the yachts closed together, it was clear that America One
would be unable to cross Prada's bow and have to jibe away to avoid
a collision. When Cayard spun the wheel to make his turn, hell
broke loose on America One's foredeck.
</P>
<P>
   Careening downwind and barely in control, America One's crew
botched the sailhandling maneuver and allowed its spinnaker to
brush Prada's, an automatic penalty that would require an
exonerating 270-degree turn. Meanwhile, Prada carried on to take
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my guilt trip of the day,'' Cayard said. ``It looked
like we were going to cross, but Prada got on a nice wave. I should
have known better than to try.''
</P>
<P>
   The penalty was the least of America One's worries. Before
rounding the bottom mark some 23 seconds behind Prada, America One
lost command of its spinnaker, which drifted into the water, and
continued without a headsail.
</P>
<P>
   On the next upwind leg, America One suffered a halyard problem
that left the crew members unable to properly hoist and trim their
headsail. Prada applied a loose cover and extended its lead at the
next mark to 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Prada rounded and again hoisted its spinnaker. America One
followed but, halfway down the leg, the San Franciscans stuffed
their bow into a mighty wave and, as their boat came to a
standstill and a loose sail was washed over the side, watched in
amazement as their spinnaker exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was lucky that it broke the sail,'' Cayard said.
``Otherwise, it might have broke the mast.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were noises of renting carbon fiber emanating from the
spar, and soon after Cayard made the decision to drop the sails and
withdraw. Prada sailed the remainder of the course uncontested to
record its second victory.
</P>
<P>
   America One still had one bit of drama to withstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the tow in, the inch-and-a-quarter towing hawser snapped
and almost killed my sail trimmer, Moose McClintock,'' Cayard said.
``It was a full recoil. Luckily it hit him in the back and he's OK
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to hope that tomorrow is a better day.''

gives communion at St. Clement Catholic Church in Fort Lauderdale.
Rausch kept quiet about his HIV status for years after learning
that he had the virus. ``All my fears were just unfounded,'' says
Rausch. Many of today's priests, whose average age is about 60,
entered the seminary in the 1960s, the age of ``free love'' and
sexual experimentation, not HIV awareness. The church hasn't
abandoned its priests who have HIV or AIDS, some say, and often
celebrates their accomplishments. (Rich Sugg/The Kansas City Star)

Washburn has helped mold one of the NFL's most effective defensive
lines in his first year on the Tennessee Titans coaching staff.
Washburn a 13-year coaching veteran has staged what many would call
a coaching resurrection in Nashville. In 1988, Washburn and two
other assistant coaches at the University of South Carolina were
convicted of ignoring the widespread use of steroids and even
encouraging it amongst players. Although maintaining he was
motivated by the notion of trying to help a player get steroids
from a safe source, he says: ``I made a mistake. I was wrong.''

excavation for a 688-seat theater. The project is to be completed
in 2002. The basement was originally called the Carnegie Recital
Hall and was opened in 1891 by pianist Franz Rummel. It next became
the Carnegie Lyceum, for student dramatic productions, then the

however, whether he will return to the NBA this season. Smith
stormed out of the gym during his first practice with the Mavericks

Smith, who jumped from high school in Chicago to the Dallas
Mavericks, running ``The Hill'' at the Houston Rockets training
center. Smith's sad and tumultuous basketball odyssey is a
cautionary tale - one that is forcing the NBA to rethink how to
decide which teen-agers are capable of going right from high school
to the pros and what to do with those who are not. Smith a deeply
troubled soul for many years, tried to end his life by ingesting a
half-bottle of aspirin. He is now recovering in Houston and is
hoping to earn another shot in the league. (Phillippe Diederich/The

George W. Bush greeting supporters at Yoken's Restaurant in
Portsmouth, Saturday. For Bush, the 2000 presidential campaign has
been a linguistic minefield. Bush was musing recently about growing
up at the height of the Cold War. The words tumbled out, a mishmash
of disconnected pronouns and strangled syntax. ``When I was coming
up, it was a dangerous world and you knew exactly who they were. It
was us versus them and it was clear who them was. Today we are not

Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes speaking at the
Merrimack Republican Women's Club Dinner in Nashua, Saturday.
Forbes' central challenge in the campaign, it seems, is not money,
not ideas and, after his strong second-place showing in Iowa, not
momentum. It is the charisma question, the problem that he is so
far from a natural politician that some audiences are left
wondering what self-image distortion ever put him at the lectern.

President Al Gore gives some children a chance at polishing their
media skills while campaigning in Milford, Saturday. Gore retracted
his 13-year-old statement equating abortion to ``the taking of a
human life'' as he scrambled to keep the issue, a traditional
stumbling block for Republicans, from tripping him up against
Democrat Bill Bradley. ``Yes, my position has changed,'' Gore said.
``I strongly support a woman's right to choose and if Bradley
disputes that, then he is making a mistake.'' (Paul Hosefros/The
New York Times)

   (NYT9) MILFORD, N.H. -- Jan. 29, 2000 -- GORE-1 -- Vice
President Al Gore campaigning in Milford. Questioned Saturday about
whether he still believed abortion was the taking of human life,
Gore was quick to assert that he had qualified that thought 13
years ago. ``I used the word arguably, and yes my position has
changed,'' he said. Then, when he was asked whether he stood by the
idea that abortion was ``arguably'' the taking of a human life,
Gore added, ``I would not use that phrasing today.'' Echoing his
commercial, Bill Bradley said of Gore's position on abortion,
``It's not an issue you can dance around, that you can nuance.

<HEADLINE>
DAVID WILLIAMS JR., INDUSTRIALIST, DIES AT 78 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Okla., Calif., S.C., Conn., Ohio)  (jw) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David R. Williams Jr., an industrialist and
engineering innovator whose companies built and operated oil and
gas pipelines in North and South America and the Middle East, died
Jan. 15 at his home in East Hampton, N.Y. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his son, David R. Williams III.
</P>
<P>
   David Williams Jr. was a co-founder in 1949 of Williams
Brothers, a family company, based in Tulsa, Okla., that became the
Williams Cos., the largest pipeline company in North America, in
the 1960s. In 1971, he bought the Williams Brothers Engineering Co.
unit, which he had organized, and gave up his posts as executive
vice president and chairman of the executive committee of the
Williams Cos. Through a series of mergers, another unit of the
parent company later became MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   A division of his company managed the Naval Petroleum Reserve in
Elk Hill, Calif., and the Johnston Island bomb-testing site in the
Pacific for the Atomic Energy Commission. By 1980, after a number
of acquisitions and a name change to the U.S. Filter Corp., it was
one of the largest American engineering companies. U.S. Filter was
sold to Ashland Oil in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also supported research and the development of clean
coal and coal slurry pipelines. The Black Mesa Pipeline, a unit of
Williams Technologies Inc., supplies coal to Southern California
Edison.
</P>
<P>
   His other ventures included a role in reorganizing Canadian
Hydrocarbons Ltd. in the late 1950s and reorganizing Knox Glass
Inc., a bottle maker that was merged into the Norton Simon Corp. in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil shortages of the 1970s, Williams was active in
analyzing the relationship between energy and economic trends. He
represented the United States at the Dartmouth Conference, which
sponsored meetings of American business executives and Soviet
officials. He was also a participant and trustee of the Hudson
Institute, a research group.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was born in Tulsa and grew up at Mulberry Plantation
outside Camden, S.C. He was a graduate of Culver Military Academy
and the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University, where he
was on the varsity polo team. During World War II, he flew P-51
Mustangs over Europe with the 8th Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   He married Pauline W. Bolton of Cleveland in 1944. She died in
1988. In 1990, he married Anne Wright Kerr of East Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife and son, David, of Boston; two
daughters, Pauline W. Lampshire of Camden, S.C., and Rachel W.
Zebrowski of Tulsa; a stepdaughter, Anne Wright Baxter of Port
Reyes, Calif.; two sisters, Martha W. Daniels of Camden, S.C., and
Kate W. Tabor of Washington, D.C.; a brother, Joseph W. Williams of
Spring Island, S.C.; four granddaughters; a step-granddaughter; and
a step-grandson. &QL;

idea that abortion was ``arguably'' the taking of a human life,

<P>
   ORLANDO. Fla. _ John D. Rockefeller Sr. may rarely have drilled
a gusher quite like that hit by lawyers in his
great-great-grandson's divorce.
</P>
<P>
   And it shows no sign of drying up soon.
</P>
<P>
   With their clients looking on, attorneys for George and Amy
O'Neill on Thursday once again mined the former Lake Wales couple's
crumbling marriage in preparation for trial, which is expected to
take place in May and last four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And Amy O`Neill explained publicly for the first time why she
granted a controversial interview to Vanity Fair magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned that this article would be written only about
the scandal and the breakup of the marriage,'' O'Neill testified.
``I knew one day my children would read it, and I wanted them to
know that I loved their father, and we were very happy in the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy O'Neill testified in response to her husband's request for a
gag order on communication to the press by anyone involved in the
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County Circuit Judge Jay Cohen later denied the gag order
sought by George O'Neill's attorney, John Frost of Bartow.
</P>
<P>
   But he sternly cautioned both sides that using the press to hurt
each other with intimate details could backfire when child custody
decisions are made.
</P>
<P>
   It was the well-being of the couple's five children, who
currently live with Amy O'Neill in Delray Beach, that Cohen invoked
at more than one point during the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point,'' Cohen said early on, ``somebody's got to
remember that these are children and not inanimate objects.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of their 10-year marriage, George O'Neill Jr., 48, and
the former Amy Whittlesey, 32, daughter of Ronald Reagan's
ambassador to Switzerland, lived in the exclusive Mountain Lake
community, just north of Lake Wales in central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Since divorce proceedings began in 1997, the couple has fought
in court over everything from money to the education of their five
children.
</P>
<P>
   Material on the case fills at least a dozen large file folders
at the Orange County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's four-hour hearing, the sides argued a string
of motions, including over production of Rockefeller family trusts
and other documents that George O'Neill wants to keep hidden from
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen did not rule on the issue of trusts, preferring to wait
until after thelawyers from both sides attempt to find common
ground on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   As the volume of revelations in the O'Neill divorce has grown,
so has press coverage, culminating in a blistering portrait of the
marriage and divorce in the January issue of Vanity Fair magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the argument Thursday focused on the 10-page article,
which featured interviews with Amy O'Neill and a picture of her
with her youngest daughter inside their Delray Beach home.
</P>
<P>
   Citing court papers, the article alleged infidelity by George
O'Neill and told of a bizarre household in Mountain Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanity Fair piece outraged George O'Neill and his lawyers,
who deny accusations of philandering by O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   They accuse Amy O'Neill of trying to embarrass her husband into
a settlement. They also claim that the article and pictures exposed
the O'Neill's children to threats like kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   But Amy O'Neill's lawyer, Mark P. Rabinowitz of Orlando, said
most of the information for the Vanity Fair story came from public
documents filed by George O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Amy O'Neill said she allowed Vanity Fair the picture of her
youngest daughter to prove that George O'Neill was the girl's
father.
</P>
<P>
   George O'Neill, at one point, questioned whether the child was
his but has since acknowledged paternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks just like him,'' said Amy O'Neill, who became
emotional discussing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyers said she opposes the gag order because she fears the
Rockefeller resources could be brought to bear on public perception
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer not to have any publicity at all, and that's
why I filed here in Orange County,'' she said. ``But now that there
is, I think that it's important that they know the truth.''

OFFICER INVOLVED IN SHOOTING WAS ACADEMY CLASSMATE OF VICTIM

<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ A Providence police officer involved in the
shooting of Officer Cornel Young Jr. early Friday was a police
academy classmate of Young's three years ago and was also involved
in the shooting of an unarmed man outside a nightclub last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Police are not identifying the two officers who allegedly fired
at Young, who was clad in plain clothes and a baseball cap as he
bolted from the Fidas restaurant with his gun drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokesman Major Martin Hames said both officers have
been placed on paid leave during the investigation of the fatal
shooting, which is being conducted by Providence police and the
state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is definitely going to a grand jury, no question,''
Hames said. ``Someone died, someone's charged with felony murder,
and the officers fired their weapons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several sources confirmed that Officer Carlos Saraiva and his
rookie partner, Michael Solitro, answered a 911 call about a
disturbance at the restaurant at 1:40 a.m. Friday. Saraiva and
Young were part of the same 25-member police academy class three
years ago, Hames said. Solitro joined the force just two weeks ago,
several sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Police shared no new information Saturday about the sequence of
events surrounding the shooting, which occurred outside the
restaurant, which is frequented by off-duty officers.
</P>
<P>
   According to police and witness accounts, the events unfolded as
follows:
</P>
<P>
   The properietor ordered fighting patrons to leave the restaurant
after one broke a glass to use as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In the parking lot, one of the women involved in the fight
called on a male friend in a nearby car to pull a gun. The
uniformed officers arrived to find Aldrin Diaz, 30, of Providence,
waving a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz obeyed the officers and dropped the gun just as Young told
everyone inside the restaurant to get down. Young pulled his gun
and went outside. Several witnesses have reported hearing him say
he was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Next, both officers fired their weapons and Young was hit in the
head, chest, and stomach. He died after massive blood loss at Rhode
Island Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz is being held on a charge of felony murder on the legal
theory that he initiated the violent series of events that resulted
in Young's death, even though he did not shoot him.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Diaz protest his being blamed for Young's death and
point to the track record of Saraiva, who shot an unarmed man in
both legs last September.
</P>
<P>
   Saraiva said he shot Rafael Nunez, 25, in self-defense after
Nunez punched him in the face. The state attorney general's office
accepted his account over that of Nunez, who said he was shot after
asking Saraiva for his badge number to file a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez's girlfriend, Jasmin Tejada, 22, took exception to
Saraiva's version of events Saturday and said that authorities
should have looked into the previous incident more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the second time he's hurt someone,'' Tejada said. ``I
don't think it should take a person to die so people in the
community can be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tejada said that she and Nunez had left 30/30, a nightclub on
Westminster Street after midnight on Sept. 18, and ordered food
from a sidewalk vendor parked across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Then Saraiva appeared and ordered everyone to leave, she said,
turning to squirt pepper spray in the face of a man talking on a
cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez and Tejada drove off, then returned to get Saraiva's badge
number, intending to file a complaint about the pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   But Saraiva said he did not have to give his badge number and
ordered them to leave, according to Tejada.
</P>
<P>
   As they walked away, she said, the officer got out of the car,
pushed her to the ground and shot at her feet. Nunez, she said,
came to her aid, and Saraiva shot him in the thigh. After Nunez was
already on the ground, Saraiva shot him in the other leg, his calf,
Tejada said. Then Saraiva ordered her boyfriend to get up and walk,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of assaulting a police officer are still pending against
Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   Saraiva maintained that he was attacked from behind by Nunez and
said he feared that he would lose consciousness and be shot with
his own gun.
</P>
<P>
   Saraiva was limited to desk duty for three months while the
attorney general's office investigated the matter and cleared him
of wrongdoing.

Rausch kept quiet about his HIV status for years after learning

Rausch. Many of today's priests, whose average age is about 60,
entered the seminary in the 1960s, the age of ``free love'' and
sexual experimentation, not HIV awareness. The church hasn't
abandoned its priests who have HIV or AIDS, some say, and often

columns are moving in, and the old cast-iron columns with their
peeling paint are being removed from beneath Carnegie Hall during
excavation for a 688-seat theater. The project is to be completed
in 2002. The basement was originally called the Carnegie Recital
Hall and was opened in 1891 by pianist Franz Rummel. It next became
the Carnegie Lyceum, for student dramatic productions, then the
Carnegie Playhouse, for off-Broadway productions and classic movie
revivals. In 1960, it was converted to a commercial cinema. (Angel

however, whether he will return to the NBA this season. Smith
stormed out of the gym during his first practice with the Mavericks
last summer and since then has fired two agents in three months,
was arrested twice, had his contract suspended and spent 31 days in
a Dallas psychiatric center after a suicide attempt. (Phillippe

center. Smith's sad and tumultuous basketball odyssey is a
cautionary tale - one that is forcing the NBA to rethink how to
decide which teen-agers are capable of going right from high school
to the pros and what to do with those who are not. Smith a deeply
troubled soul for many years, tried to end his life by ingesting a
half-bottle of aspirin. He is now recovering in Houston and is
hoping to earn another shot in the league. (Phillippe Diederich/The

been a linguistic minefield. Bush was musing recently about growing
up at the height of the Cold War. The words tumbled out, a mishmash
of disconnected pronouns and strangled syntax. ``When I was coming
up, it was a dangerous world and you knew exactly who they were. It
was us versus them and it was clear who them was. Today we are not
so sure who the they are, but we know they're there.'' (Stephen

Forbes' central challenge in the campaign, it seems, is not money,

far from a natural politician that some audiences are left
wondering what self-image distortion ever put him at the lectern.

his 13-year-old statement equating abortion to ``the taking of a
human life'' as he scrambled to keep the issue, a traditional

President Al Gore campaigning in Milford. Questioned Saturday about
whether he still believed abortion was the taking of human life,
Gore was quick to assert that he had qualified that thought 13
years ago. ``I used the word arguably, and yes my position has
changed,'' he said. Then, when he was asked whether he stood by the
idea that abortion was ``arguably'' the taking of a human life,
Gore added, ``I would not use that phrasing today.'' Echoing his

``It's not an issue you can dance around, that you can nuance.

SHOOTING OF OFFICER SPOTLIGHTS LINGERING RACIAL DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF AND BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ When Bennie Y. Fleming went shopping with white
friends recently on this city's fashionable East Side, a store
clerk mistook the black retired school administrator for a maid.
</P>
<P>
   When Harold ``Cap'' Smith was watching last year's Memorial Day
parade, the first black president of the South Kingstown Town
Council noted sadly that all the young marchers were white. ``There
are no `brownies' in the Brownies,'' he said to himself.
</P>
<P>
   And when Brown University psychologist Fayneese Miller began
studying friendships across racial lines among young people in
Rhode Island, she quickly found that such relationships are no more
common here than among youths she studied in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Into that world of segregation by fact, if not by force, strode
the Youngs _ first, Major Cornel Young Sr., the son of migrant
parents from Alabama who rose to become the highest-ranking black
officer in the history of the Providence police.
</P>
<P>
   And right behind him came 29-year-old Officer Cornel Young Jr.,
bearing both his father's name and what friends and fellow officers
say was his father's commitment to bridging the gap that separates
the communities they served.
</P>
<P>
   But now Cornel Young Jr. is dead, shot early Friday allegedly by
two fellow officers who mistook their off-duty colleague for an
armed suspect when he tried to help them break up a fracas. The
loss is being seen both as a tragedy for the black community and,
possibly, a painful reflection of a world the Youngs were trying to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the son not just of Cornel Senior, but a son of the
whole minority community,'' said Joseph Almeida, a state
representative and former Providence police officer who co-founded
the Rhode Island Minority Police Association with the elder Young.
``We will carry on our cause in his name. This is not going to go
away in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, questions about the shooting _ and what it says
about the state of race relations in Rhode Island and beyond _ are
focusing on the fact that Young and one of the officers who shot
him were in the same police academy class before joining the force
three years ago. Classes number about 25 cadets, small enough
presumably for all members to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   Some wondered whether Young's academy classmate, Officer Carlos
A. Saraiva, recognized him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't care about or interact with someone who is
different, then those people don't exist,'' said Miller, an
associate professor at Brown who is director of the Center for the
Study of Race and Ethnicity in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as though Cornel Young was invisible,'' she said. ``It
seems this officer did not know Officer Young, had not established
a relationship with Officer Young in a way that would have allowed
him to recognize Officer Young out of uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and others said the near-invisibility of minorities in
Rhode Island reveals a paradox about the tiny state with barely 1
million inhabitants, 91 percent of them white. Though founded as a
haven for outcasts, the wealth of some of its oldest families was
built on the seagoing slave trade. Only last week, lawmakers were
discussing racial profiling during traffic stops and whether to
drop the word ``plantation'' from its official name: State of Rhode
Island and Providence Plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people came here because they thought they would have
a good life and be able to prosper and not have to deal with the
negative behavior of other places,'' Miller said. ``But some
unfortunately come here and realize that, in terms of being a safe
haven, that does not necessarily apply to you. You're still an
outcast because you do not fit what is seen as desirable in this
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Although blacks have played important roles in the state's
history _ a Rhode Island regiment raised in the Revolutionary War,
for example, was composed of black soldiers _ recognition of black
Americans as equal partners with the white majority continues to
lag, said Joaquina Bela Teixeira, interim executive director of the
Rhode Island Black Heritage Society.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks are underrepresented in the government and public safety
agencies of a constricted state where xenophobia plays a corrosive
role in cross-cultural relations, she said. And although racial
profiling and disproportionate imprisonment are evident throughout
the country, she said, that fact makes their presence in Rhode
Island no less disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the achievements of the Young family had been such a
symbol of hope in Providence. ``When you see someone who resembles
you, you're more apt to build trust,'' Teixeira said.
</P>
<P>
   Almeida echoed that sense of the Youngs' importance. For Almeida
and hundreds of other blacks in Providence, the rise of Cornel
Young Sr. from grocer's son to police major, and the shining
potential of his son, were inspiring examples of success on
previously foreign ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through a lot of hell in the '70s and '80s,'' Almeida
said of Young and their minority police organizing efforts. That
work continued. Only recently, Young met with the state attorney
general and the local director of the NAACP on racial profiling
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cornel Senior was the first black everything,'' Almeida said.
``First black juvenile detective, first black major, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   As commander of the community police division, Young helped in a
visible way to bridge the gaps between races and neighborhoods.
And, in perhaps the best reflection of the esteem Young generated,
the son chose to emulate the father _ even setting for himself the
goal of one day becoming a police major.
</P>
<P>
   Teixeira recalled the warming sight of father and son at a City
Hall event two weeks ago. ``They were beaming in their pride in
each other, and I made a comment about the apple not falling far
from the tree,'' Teixeira said. ``This young man had a bright
future ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning Young on Saturday were the neighbors who saw him grow
up from a happy, respectful young man who played ball on the street
to a proud patrolman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, he was a perfect kid,'' said Linda Washburn,
52. ``He always avoided trouble, and always told his grandmother he
was gonna be a cop like his dad. He wasted all his heart and soul
just to be what his father was.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who went by the nickname ``Ji,'' was smart,
``happy-go-lucky,'' and eager to bring home good grades from the
police academy to please his family, Washburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Benton, 47, grew up playing pickup football with the elder
Young at a time when black youths hated and feared the police so
much they would run from officers on sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major Young was one of us, so he has made the community have
faith in the system,'' Benton said. ``It was such a wonderful thing
that he was elevated to major. It makes me proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors on Burnside Street fondly remember the corner store
the Young family operated until about a year ago, when the elder
Young's father died. The senior Young's mother was ``Miss Liz'' to
everybody in the neighborhood, a sort of universal grandmother who
turned the community into an extended family, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women gathered daily at the Burnside Market to drink
coffee and chat, and to buy fried chicken or fish on Fridays. The
Youngs were always willing to help out a local family who didn't
have money to pay for groceries some days, said neighbor Norman
Washburn, 55, Linda's husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good people, they'll help anyone,'' Norman Washburn
said. ``You don't meet too many good families around anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Liz'' now works as a crossing guard at a nearby school,
but the neighborhood isn't the same without the market, Washburn
said. He believes the Young family helped keep the area free from
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The family was so tight-knit, neighbors said, that the elder
Young frequently came to the market on his lunch breaks, and his
son made it part of his patrol route.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all he wanted to be, an officer just like his father,''
said Gertrude McDonald, 56, another neighbor. ``He tried to help
people _ that's what got him killed, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of white and minority Rhode Islanders living
disconnected lives was heard repeatedly during discussions of the
tragedy Saturday, even as police officials sought to downplay race
as a factor in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically still live in separate communities,'' said Smith,
the former Town Council president who also served as affirmative
action officer at the University of Rhode Island. ``And when you
live in separate communities, the so-called community schools
naturally represent the community, and you don't end up having the
interaction you'd like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think that officer would have been shot if he were
white? I don't,'' Smith added. ``The mindset is, black guys carry
guns, and black guys cannot be police officers. That's dangerous,
and when you have people of color living separate lives from white
people, that doesn't change.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and several others emphasized that they do not believe
Rhode Island is unique in terms of racial tensions or its failure
to successfully integrate its residents. Their disappointment, they
said, stems from the missed opportunity to use the state's size to
its advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else do you go where you know the mayor and he knows
you, where you know the governor well?'' said Fleming, who until
her retirement 3 1/2 years ago was supervisor of science programs
in the Providence schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's so small, it shouldn't be so hard to develop real
positive race relations, and it shouldn't be that difficult for
those who serve the community to get rid of their stereotypes. But
that hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Those stereotypes have been at the forefront of local discussion
in recent weeks about racial profiling, spurred in part by Almeida.
The General Assembly is considering a bill that would require the
State Police to keep track of the ethnicity of motorists they stop,
to help answer whether a disproportionate number of nonwhite
drivers are detained.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, William Spiner, 33, has been stopped by police
as he drives his Jaguar along the upscale East Side, home to Brown
University. ``I'm a school teacher. But because I'm black they
assume I'm a criminal,'' he said. ``In this liberal bastion of
tolerance, there is little tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Davey Lopes Recreation Center in struggling South
Providence, Ron Robinson on Saturday wore a black armband and black
ribbons on his white leather jacket to commemorate Young's death.
The elder Young was a frequent visitor to the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of questions and shock,'' said Robinson, 46.
``I'm wearing the black ribbons and this band around my arm to show
that we support a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Benton, a high school coach, said he worries that the
incident will discourage young black men from becoming police
officers. He said police, Mayor Vincent ``Buddy'' Cianci Jr., and
the attorney general's office must provide answers to a wary
minority community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let this die,'' Benton said. ``We can't let this go
away.''

CYBER BOWL: RAMS EARN A BRUISED THUMBS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE DONDONEAU 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CYBER STADIUM, ATLANTA _ My thumb is killing me.
</P>
<P>
   I've taped it, taken two aspirin, iced it, and I still think
it's going to explode.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the official term for this injury would be called
``cyber thumb,'' a condition brought about by repeatedly pushing
the jump button when I want to pass, somehow diving when I want to
run, and simply running off the stupid screen when I want to tackle
Tennessee's bowling ball of a running back, Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, Sony PlayStation NFL Blitz 2000 video game: It can be
one of the best simulators of today's Super Bowl XXXIV matchup, or
it merely can be another way to watch Marshall Faulk do a karate
kick and then just stand there during a kick return. It all depends
on your cunning, experience and dexterity, not to mention your
ability to realize that pushing the wrong button _ over and over
and over and over _ doesn't make Isaac Bruce run any faster.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know there are 22 ``basic'' moves on NFL Blitz 2000?
Mere up-down-left-right arrows no longer do justice to the players'
ability on the screen. Nowadays, you need to hit the analog button
to set off the thumb-controlled, 49-direction moving joystick. You
need the L1 and R2 buttons on the front of the control panel for
turbo speed, and you need the L2 and R2 buttons for blitz-read
passing. You need to hold down L1 while pushing the triangle on top
of the control panel to power tackle. You need to sack Steve McNair
not once, but twice, so you can get ``on fire'' and really kick
some butt.
</P>
<P>
   And to think hyper-spacing in Asteroids used to be a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with all this knowledge and technology, ``Star-Telegram''
assistant sports editor Cody Bailey and I played a simulated Super
Bowl XXXIV Friday night. What's more, Bailey also got the makers of
Blitz 2000 to simulate the game and send us a tape of how their
computer played out the Super Bowl. Both times, albeit with
different levels of competence and beauty, the St. Louis Rams came
out on top.
</P>
<P>
   Without further ado, our findings: We feel quite comfortable in
stating that our research shows the Rams will win either 102-98,
52-49 or 20-15, take your pick. (Editor's note: The 102-98 was a
practice game with long quarters, but we thought we'd throw it in,
just for kicks).
</P>
<P>
   The keys in both our ``real'' simulated games were actually
quite similar: The Titans held slim halftime leads but failed to
score in the third quarter; St. Louis capitalized on Tennessee's
missed field goals (three in our game, two in the computerized
version); and in both games Rams defensive back Todd Lyght had
interceptions at crucial junctures to turn the game in St. Louis'
favor.
</P>
<P>
   In our game, Tennessee jumped to a 14-0 lead behind George's
running and some cutback passes to Yancey Thigpen. However, I
attribute some of this early success to the fact that: (A) I was
trying to pass by hitting the run button, and (B) I was so
overwhelmed with early completions that I forgot to move my
joystick forward. Another time, I tried to pick off a McNair pass
to Kevin Dyson and ran right off the screen.
</P>
<P>
   But ... the Rams' offense is potent, even on PlayStation. So,
when in doubt and in feeling nothing but desperation, I went to a
three-wideout play called ``Da Bomb.'' Simply put, I'd have the
Rams' quarterback drop back and scramble until either Isaac Bruce
or Ricky Proehl got behind the defense, and pray to hit the right
button to throw it deep. Sure, I'd throw an odd stiff arm or two
when nobody was around, and yes, I'd often leap for no apparent
reason. But the bottom line is this method of madness worked. The
Rams scored, and some friends who came by to laugh, err, watch,
joined me in a few St. Louis end-zone shuffles. (Not as easy as it
looks).
</P>
<P>
   The computerized version, while much more clean, was a yawner.
St. Louis scored four field goals and forced McNair to pass on the
run.
</P>
<P>
   In both games, it was obvious you couldn't give the quarterbacks
time to read the defenses. The Rams were best served with one- and
two-man blitzes, mostly running a mid-zone defense. Tennessee,
meanwhile, needs to be aggressive on defense and pressure the
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   So that's it, I guess. The only thing left for today's viewing
pleasure is the commercials. Rams win, Titans lose. Dick Vermeil
cries.
</P>
<P>
   In the Super Bowl, it all comes down to simply pushing the right
button one more time than your opponent. Right, Cody?

A MERE 4 MINUTES ARE ENOUGH FOR TYSON TO DISPATCH FRANCIS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, England _ Mike Tyson made an explosive debut in his
first bout in Britain and perhaps erased some of his own doubts
about his abilities. But then again, Julius Francis, the British
heavyweight champion, did not provide much resistance to the former
undisputed heavyweight champion before a sellout crowd of 21,000
here at the MEN Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Looking as ferocious as he promised, Tyson scored five
knockdowns over two rounds, the fifth one a devastating right
uppercut to the chin that begged for referee Roy Francis (no
relation to Julius) to stop the bout at 1 minute 3 seconds of the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Though Tyson's defense was not as stellar as it should be for
major competition, his offense was superb. Nearly everything he
threw connected with Francis' body. And it was a clean performance
for Tyson, who was kicked out of boxing for 19 months after his
Nevada boxing license was revoked because Tyson bit Evander
Holyfield's ears. His last bout ended in a no contest after he hit
Orlin Norris after the bell. The blow was ruled an accidental foul,
but Norris said he could not continue, because he injured his knee
in falling as a result of the late blow.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Francis spent a lot of time on his knees, but he
kept getting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised he kept getting up,'' Tyson said. ``I hit him
with some good body shots. Of course, this is what I want to do
every time out. Francis showed a lot of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Lennox Lewis, the undisputed heavyweight
champion, Tyson said: ``I have a few fights before I fight him.
When I do, I'm sure I will be victorious. I've got a long way to
go, but I'm still trying. My next couple of fights will be in
Europe. I'll fight whoever Shelly Finkel wants me to fight,'' Tyson
said, referring to his adviser.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted one round longer than anyone thought it would and that
was because Francis, who earned $560,000, kept getting up. Francis
(21-8) gets to keep his British heavyweight championship, but he
probably lost the respect of the British boxing fans, who cheered
more for Tyson (47-3) when he entered the ring than they did for
Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very powerful,'' Francis said. ``What surprised me were
those short punches inside. All those punches hurt me. I went in
thinking I had it right to fight Tyson, but you don't always get it
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few boxers will stand up to Mike Tyson. Losing is not
acceptable, but I got in some shots and Tyson knows that I hit him.
There aren't very many boxers willing to go toe-to-toe with Mike
Tyson for two rounds and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, who trained at Aldershot Army Base outside of London,
entered the ring with a military escort. Tyson entered to an air
raid siren, an ominous sound for those Londoners old enough to
remember World War II. And as is his custom, Tyson dressed all in
black, while Francis was decked out in white trunks with gold trim.
By the time Francis was staggered by the first right hand, he
needed all the protection the British Army could have afforded him.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson opened with two solid lefts to the side of Francis' head.
Francis nailed Tyson with a nice jab, but then Tyson showed Francis
a sign of things to come when he hurt him with a left hook to the
body. Then Tyson landed another left hook to the body that stung
Francis again, and staggered him with a jab. Tyson dropped him with
a right uppercut and he was up at nine. Tyson decked him again with
a stiff jab, and the bell rang while Francis was down. He was up at
the count of seven and staggered back to his corner, but it was
clear he was not going to last much longer.
</P>
<P>
   As the second round started, Francis staggered Tyson with a
right hand to the body. But Tyson came back with a left hook to the
body that dropped Francis, who again was up at nine. Tyson then
dropped him with a right uppercut, but Francis got up at the count
of eight. Tyson dropped him again with a right uppercut and Roy
Francis called a halt to the bout at that knockdown, waving his
arms.
</P>
<P>
   After Tyson's foray to the Manchester airport on the eve of his
bout against Francis, there was some question as to whether he was
going to show up for Saturday night's bout. Tyson threw a scare
into his handlers when he became upset and bolted for the airport a
couple of hours before the scheduled weigh-in on Friday afternoon.
Reports by British television and newspapers said that Tyson had
inquired about getting a flight back to America. But Shelly Finkel,
Tyson's adviser, said that the former heavyweight champion never
considered doing anything that would jeopardize the fight. After
walking around for a while, Tyson bought some magazines at the
airport, and his handlers convinced him to return to the hotel for
the weigh-in. He was an hour late.
</P>
<P>
   It was a weird turn of events and offered some insight into the
fragile psyche of the 33-year-old Tyson. How could he be willing to
ditch a $10 million to $12 million payday against a 35-year-old
journeyman with a 21-7 record?
</P>
<P>
   It was the most bizarre turn of events in the 10 days that Tyson
had spent in England leading up to the fight. He trained diligently
and went on well-publicized shopping sprees. Although some
politicians and women's groups had protested his entry into the
country because he was convicted of rape in 1992, Tyson was
generally well received by boxing fans and the general public.
Thousands of fans camped outside his hotel in downtown Manchester
each evening hoping to get a glimpse of Tyson. Access had to be
restricted to guests and members of the media after the first night
Tyson hit town.
</P>
<P>
   The people of England had gone gaga over a boxer whose veil of
invincibility had been lifted almost 10 years ago in Tokyo when
Buster Douglas knocked him out to take the undisputed heavyweight
championship of the world. But they had not seen him in person and
they thought this was their opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Francis was hoping to steal a page from Douglas' fairy tale and
shock all of the 21,000 people in the MEN Arena who had come to see
Tyson send him to the canvas early. The only problem for Francis is
that he lacks the skills that Douglas had when he entered the ring
in Tokyo that fateful night in 1991. Francis has slow hands, slow
feet and his straight up style makes his chin an inviting target
for big bombers like Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Francis had guaranteed that the advertising logo of The Daily
Mirror newspaper on the soles of his shoes would not be visible
this night. But no one believed him. Francis said that the only
thing he needed was to land one good punch on Tyson and he could
change the whole script for the evening. &QL;

AVERTISERS TRY TO STAND OUT ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Battling brides, a
singing sock puppet, a philosophizing director and a smart-alecky
computer icon are some of the characters populating the ads set to
be shown between football plays in today's Super Bowl XXXIV.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The game is being dubbed the dot-com bowl by some because of the
glut of Internet companies throwing lots of money _ and some say
lots of caution _ to the wind to get their names and messages out.
For many sites it's make-it-now-or-never time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ABC, which is pulling in $135 million for airtime sold,
is making most of the dot-com advertisers pay up front, whereas
most advertisers pay for spots after they have run.
</P>
<P>
   Many advertisers think the Super Bowl is the place to be seen.
Even though viewership has declined, it was still an estimated 135
million last year. With so many ads, however, it can be a dizzying
experience for the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are pretty overwhelmed,'' said Edward Boches, chief
creative officer for the Mullen advertising agency, which has two
clients advertising in the Super Bowl. ``Certainly the majority of
it cannot be connecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if any advertisers, dot-coms or otherwise, are
concerned about the match-up between two small-market teams, the
St. Louis Rams and the Tennessee Titans, they aren't saying so.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some are comforted because the Rams, 4-12 last year, are
a Cinderella team. In fact, their victory a week ago scored the
highest audience rating for a playoff game in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year only two dot-coms, Monster.com and HotJobs.com, both
job-search sites, advertised on the Super Bowl for $66,666 a
second. But this year half of the Super Bowl advertisers are either
pure dot-coms or otherwise related to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And the price this year has gotten considerably steeper, with
some paying up to $3 million per 30-second spot, a hundred grand a
second.
</P>
<P>
   The average price being paid, however, is $2.2 million for a
30-second spot, still an astounding $73,333 a second.
</P>
<P>
   For that kind of money, the trick for any Super Bowl advertiser,
dot-com or not, is to cut through the clutter.
</P>
<P>
   The tightrope is to get the viewers' attention, entertain and
inform them, let them know what your company does and leave a
lasting impression, all within 30 to 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Some go for lots of sizzle, some for humor, others for serious
images and messages.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Britannica.com showcases director Francis Ford
Coppola in an arty black-and-white spot waxing on about sports,
with dialogue such as, ``So sports becomes the alternative, where
you are really seeing something alive, that hasn't been
prepared...and you don't know how it's going to turn out,''
followed by its tagline: ``What's On Your Mind?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are others, such at Pets.com. It features Mr. Sock
Puppet singing a warbly rendition of Chicago's ``If You Leave Me
Now'' as Beano, a forlorn dog, watches as his master leaves to go
get pet supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The spot takes a shot at mimicking a slew of other ads,
including a quick cut of a reptile that looks suspiciously like
Anheuser-Busch's Louie the Lizard shedding a tear.
</P>
<P>
   OurBeginning.com, a Web site that provides personalized
stationery, is aiming its marketing guns at young,
just-starting-out couples.
</P>
<P>
   One spot titled ``Angry Brides,'' informally called ``Brides
meet WWF,'' was initially rejected by the censors at ABC. The
company's agency went back and tweaked the spot to satisfy the
censors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another dot-com, Lifeminders.com, proudly boasts that it
expects to have the worst spot on the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, says Tim Hanlon, vice president of marketing and
communications for Lifeminders, is that the company did not commit
to the Super Bowl until Jan. 11, at which time its agency told the
company it was way too late to produce anything of any quality.
</P>
<P>
   So Lifeminders.com decided to go it alone. As viewers listen to
a pathetic rendition of ``Chopsticks,'' crude type on the screen
explains what the company does and why people should log onto its
site: because ``We're information experts (geeks).... But we don't
know diddly about making ads.''
</P>
<P>
   And while other advertisers, including competing dot-coms, are
spending $1 million, $2 million, even $3 million to create ads,
Lifeminders spent $4,800.
</P>
<P>
   Back for the big game, as always, is Anheuser-Busch, which this
year isn't saying a lot about what it is running on the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   One ad that has been produced and which may be shown is a heart
tugger featuring a tuxedoed veterinarian on New Year's Eve, a
Clydesdale foal and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Another Anheuser-Busch ad that may be shown is said to have
ruffled the ABC censors. That spot involves a man shot from a
cannon becoming a suppository for an elephant when his partner
becomes distracted by a Bud beer vendor.
</P>
<P>
   Also back for the big game is 7Up with a series of new
commercials featuring its fictional spokesman, Orlando Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, Orlando encourages the team to douse the coach with
a bucket of 7Up after a big victory. Enthusiastically they do so,
except the soda is still in the cans. ``Ooh,'' says a wincing
Orlando, as the coach lies on the ground groaning.
</P>
<P>
   Both Monster.com and HotJobs.com, the dot-coms from last year,
are back for another go around. In the 24 hours after the game last
year, Monster.com saw hits on its Web site soar 450 percent, which
almost shorted out its systems.
</P>
<P>
   Most dot-coms are taking a page from that experience and making
sure they are set to handle the hoped-for hits.
</P>
<P>
   So why has the Super Bowl become the venue for so many
advertisers, particularly the dot-coms?
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Johnson, founder and chief executive officer of
HotJobs.com, explains it: ``Last year we were the smallest company
in the history of the Super Bowl to advertise. Fox (network)
rejected our commercial, people said I was crazy...but it paid off
in spades _ it made us look like geniuses.''

PLUNGE IN NATION'S WELFARE ROLLS APPEARS TO BE SLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONNA McGUIRE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An unprecedented
plunge in America's welfare rolls has stretched at least 51 months,
the numbers sloping downward like a long, slippery slide.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But if recent experiences in Missouri, Kansas and some other
states are an indication, the free fall may be ending.
</P>
<P>
   Declines slowed to a trickle in Kansas last year. Rolls
increased slightly in recent months in Missouri. Numbers have
stabilized in South Carolina, increased in Arkansas and surged in
New Mexico. They have gone up and then down in Oregon and leveled
off somewhat in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to gauge how much the nation's overall welfare
caseload decline has slowed, because the latest U.S. figures are 6
months old. As of last June that caseload was still dropping almost
2 percent a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New York and California will drive things down for
probably another six months,'' said Jack Tweedie, who tracks
welfare issues for the Denver-based National Conference of State
Legislatures. ``It wouldn't surprise me to see national caseloads
bottom out then, if patterns hold.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal welfare reforms of the mid-1990s helped spur
the record caseload reductions. Experts cite different reasons for
why the downturn may be ending.
</P>
<P>
   Some states added rules that allow adults on welfare to collect
benefits longer.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Arkansas last year quit dropping welfare
families who refused to seek jobs, the rolls climbed 12 percent in
six months. New Mexico's rolls jumped after a court challenge
resulted in the state adopting more liberal rules in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some state are running low on ``employable'' welfare parents,
with a large percentage of clients now exempt from seeking work.
Surges in new applicants are affecting some states. A lack of jobs,
transportation or child care in rural areas makes it tough to
further reduce the rolls in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   After years of being masked by larger caseload declines,
cyclical increases in welfare rolls, such as when seasonal jobs
end, also are reappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Though far from nationwide, these caseload trends are drawing
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's troubling to policy-makers on one level,'' Tweedie said.
``Right now welfare policy is in a real strong position. Caseloads
are low, so states are not paying much out in cash benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   If caseloads rise, Tweedie said, more money will revert to
paying benefits instead of being available for child care,
transportation and other support programs, such as a Colorado
program that helps grandparents raising grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's governor recently asked Human Services Commissioner
Kevin W. Concannon how far Maine was from hitting bottom. Concannon
did not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody forecast the level of reductions in caseloads that
already has been achieved,'' he said. ``We don't know how close we
are, because we've exceeded the estimates we had ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expected the rolls to drop to zero. Though federal
reforms limit adult benefits to five years, states can exempt up to
20 percent of their caseloads from that requirement. Plus families
in which only the children receive welfare benefits are not subject
to the time limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will always have a population that will need us,''
said Marge Randall, who oversees the Division of Family Services
welfare programs in Jackson County. ``What we have to worry about
is for how long? Is it permanent or is it temporary?''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that caseloads will return to the record levels
of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes about welfare have changed too much for that to
happen, Tweedie said. States now stress work and self-sufficiency.
Welfare is to be temporary. Families have gotten that message, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, caseloads will rise again, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question none of us is real good at answering is, how
much?'' Kansas
</P>
<P>
   Retired state government employee Willa Morrison spends 20 hours
a week as a ``senior mentor'' helping Wyandotte County welfare
parents find and keep jobs.
</P>
<P>
   She recently coached a welfare client who had been unemployed
two years. Morrison searched job openings for possible matches with
the woman's skills. In minutes the woman had a list of places to
call.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison feels many clients still can find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure (caseloads) will go down more,'' she said. ``Welfare
is changing so much. It's never going to be like it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyandotte County is one area where caseloads continue to
decrease, dropping 14 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clients are staying on welfare for shorter periods, the job
market remains strong, and some families previously exempt from
seeking work now are being asked to find jobs, said Peggy Kelly,
who oversees the county's welfare office.
</P>
<P>
   Caseloads also continue to decline in Topeka and Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rolls have stagnated in Johnson County and leveled off or
risen in other areas, such as Garden City, Emporia and Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The result: no more double-digit annual decreases like Kansas
experienced in 1997, when rolls dropped nearly one-third. The
caseload fell less than 6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare leaders also say that a greater percentage of the
caseload now is troubled by mental or medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does take a longer time to work with those individuals,''
said Candy Shively, who manages welfare programs for the Kansas
Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services.
</P>
<P>
   Fluctuations in the economy also play a role. For example,
people converge on western Kansas seeking work in five packing
plants in Dodge City, Garden City and Liberal. Some dislike the
physical work; others lose their jobs when the plants reduce
production. As a result, welfare rolls rise and fall often, said Jo
Windholz, who oversees welfare in the Garden City area.
</P>
<P>
   This is true in Johnson County, where rolls have hovered in the
low 400s after reaching about 750 families in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if in Washington, they would look across the
country at the tremendous gains that have been made and say,
`That's enough for now,' &UR; '' said David Wayne, who supervises
welfare in the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services
office in Johnson County. ``Let's have an open-ended program for
now and see if we can help the few remaining people who have
problems. It's not like this program has failed. It's done
amazingly well.'' Missouri
</P>
<P>
   After 48 consecutive months of declining rolls, Missouri hit a
bump last September. Caseloads increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Small increases continued in October, November and December.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Missouri's rolls still declined 7.6 percent for the
year, but the drop was less than half of 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in seasonal employment, a benefit change and a push to
get poor children signed up for health insurance may have
contributed, said Denise Cross, who heads the Missouri Division of
Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to point to one specific factor when there are
so many things that impact people's lives,'' said Cross, who thinks
rolls will start dropping again.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri asked school districts to help distribute information
about the children's health-insurance program during enrollment
last fall. Welfare applications jumped at that time, possibly
because families learned that they also were eligible for cash
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The state last year raised the level of income families could
have and still receive some benefits.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 Jackson County parents are retaining benefits under
that new rule. If they left the rolls, Jackson County's caseload
decline would be more pronounced. Instead, rolls leveled off late
in 1999, about 8,300 families, after being as high as 13,000 in
early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds leave welfare each month in Jackson County, but
hundreds of other families are applying for help.
</P>
<P>
   Randall would like to know where they are coming from. She
suspects that some are drawn to welfare offices after hearing that
transportation, child care, job placement programs and other
assistance can be found there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority have not been on (welfare) before,'' she said.

 &HT;    FBI employees dispute federal explanation for moves at Mount
Carmel
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ FBI employees dispute the government's official
explanation for ripping apart the Branch Davidians' gym as detailed
in the Department of Justice's 1993 report on Mount Carmel,
according to depositions taken for the wrongful-death lawsuit filed
by surviving members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Justice Department gave two reasons why a
Combat Engineering Vehicle (CEV) _ described as a modified Patton
tank _ tore through the back of the Davidian compound, causing the
gym to partially collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Escape routes were being opened for Davidians to flee Mount
Carmel and the gym was being opened for the eventual insertion of
tear gas, according to the ``Report to the Deputy Attorney General
on the Events at Waco, Texas: February 28 to April 19, 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   But an FBI agent riding in the CEV that plowed through the gym
said in a recent deposition the crew was ordered to try to find a
way to get to a tower at the back of the compound, where
supervisors apparently believed the Davidians had retreated to
escape the tear gas attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were not ordered to breach the rear side of the building
to create escape openings,'' plaintiffs' attorney Mike Caddell of
Houston asked in the deposition. ``You were ordered to clear this
path to the tower, correct?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Correct,'' said the CEV passenger, identified only as FBI
witness No. 7 to comply with the order by U.S. District Judge
Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco not to divulge the identities of
government witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the purpose of this path if it was cleared, or when
it was cleared?'' Caddell asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``To effectively deliver gas to that tower area of the building
where it was believed we were not getting gas,'' the CEV passenger
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department did not answer the Waco Tribune-Herald's
request for an explanation of the discrepancy between the testimony
of FBI agents and its report.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993 report on Mount Carmel, the Justice Department
emphasized the purported forging of escape routes on the compound's
backside. In one instance, the report noted that after the CEV
toppled a wall in the gym, FBI negotiators broadcast: ``David, we
are facilitating you leaving the compound by enlarging the door.
David, you have had your 15 minutes of fame. Vernon is no longer
the Messiah. Leave the building now.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Howell was David Koresh's name before he legally changed
it.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI agent piloting a surveillance plane over Mount Carmel
testified in his deposition that the people flying with him
remarked that the Davidians would have to flee their compound
because it was being demolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall some remarks that were made while, you know, 'People
were going to have to get out pretty soon because it's going to,
you know, the things are being kind of, during the penetrations,
being taken away from them ...','' the FBI pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell accused the FBI of speeding up its plan to demolish the
Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report stated that if after 48 hours the
FBI's tear-gas assault failed to drive the Davidians out of Mount
Carmel, a modified CEV was to begin demolishing the building. The
demolition would continue until all the Branch Davidians had been
located, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were systematically demolishing the gym bit by bit,''
Caddell said to the CEV passenger. ``You were tearing it down,
weren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we were not destroying the building,'' the CEV passenger
said. ``We were very ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't call that building destroyed?'' Caddell asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portions of it,'' the CEV passenger said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI witness No. 13, who drove the CEV, testified in his
deposition about the modified CEV that he said the FBI had rigged
up to demolish Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was another CEV that had basically, what had been done was
a railroad, a stanchion of railroad was welded to the blade itself,
extending three feet on either side of the blade, and it was going
to be used to drive along the side of the building, basically
cutting the studs away and the sheetrock away, so we could actually
see into the front sides of the building in hopes that they would
come out when they were in plain view at that point,'' the CEV
driver said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked, ``How would the gym have looked any different if
you had attacked it with the railroad CEV as opposed to the CEV you
had?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' the CEV driver said. ``We never got to that
part of the plan. I mean, in hindsight, it could have very well
been the exact same result. But my plan at that point was not to
destroy the gymnasium.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent riding in the CEV said the FBI could have quickly
destroyed the entire compound if that was its plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in no time at all the collateral destruction that you
see on the empty gymnasium area would be the entire compound,'' the
CEV passenger. ``I mean these are large powerful vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked the agent if he remembered advising the FBI's
Hostage Rescue Team, ``CEV working black (or back) side. It's
coming down.''
</P>
<P>
   The CEV passenger said no.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked if that transmission wasn't more consistent with
``disassembling'' the building rather than clearing a path to the
tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say if somebody was talking about a structure that was
in their path, the fact that it was coming down would indicate that
it was no longer being an obstacle to the forward movement, so I
don't think it necessarily follows what you are saying,'' the CEV
passenger said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked the agents why the CEV eventually backed off
trying to muscle its way to the tower.
</P>
<P>
   The CEV driver said he could see the tops of 55-gallon drums at
the end of the gym, indicating a drop-off to him. He testified that
he didn't approach the drums for fear of getting stuck. Saying
there was no drop-off, Caddell asked if the CEV driver had not
known that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that for a fact because I never got back there,''
the CEV driver said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied Caddell's assertion that the holes made by the CEVs
could have served as openings for agents on foot to enter the
compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had told them we weren't going to make entry into the
building, and we didn't,'' the CEV driver said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked if the CEV entered the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vehicle did,'' the CEV driver said. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you were inside the vehicle, weren't you?'' Caddell
asked.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger in the CEV told Caddell that he didn't think the
Davidians would see the FBI's actions as hostile and start firing
weapons _ which led to the FBI escalating its insertion of tear gas
into Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually very surprised when we were shot at,'' the CEV
passenger said. ``I mean, you've got to keep in mind we were here
50 some days and there had been no exchanges and no shooting. And I
especially felt with the notification and the negotiators talking
to them and explaining what was going on, that they would not
shoot. Didn't see where that would be the logical step.''

BRADLEY PUTS GORE ON DEFENSE ABOUT ABORTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN, N.H. _ Bill Bradley, battling Al Gore's steady polling
lead the weekend before the New Hampshire presidential primary,
cast himself Saturday as superior on women's issues and launched a
new television ad alluding to the vice president's checkered record
on support of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley renewed his challenge to Gore's repeated claim that he
had always supported the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortion. Bradley cited a 1984 letter in which Gore, then a U.S.
House member, said: ``It is my deep personal belief that abortion
is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign circulated copies of the Gore letter, as well
as ones from 1980 and 1987, to reporters as the candidate asked:
``If women can't trust a candidate to tell the truth in a campaign,
how can they trust him as president?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the national Democratic front-runner, responded personally
and with testimonials from prominent women supporters, including
Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, the Granite State's first woman chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly support a woman's right to choose. If he disputes
that, then he's making a mistake,'' Gore told reporters in Milford.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1987 letter Gore wrote that he opposed federal funding of
abortions, which he said ``is arguably the taking of a human
life.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not use that phrasing today,'' Gore said when
questioned about the letter. Gore said that in making a decision to
have an abortion, ``I think the woman involved is the only person
who should make that decision'' and that the government ``can't
judge the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who until recently had led Gore in most New Hampshire
surveys, has slipped behind the vice president over the last two
weeks. The Boston Globe-WBZ tracking poll published Saturday gave
Gore a 10 percentage lead and a clear majority _ 51-41 percent. The
CNN-USA Today-Gallup tracking poll showed Gore with an even bigger
lead, 51-43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys have shown Gore with proportionally bigger lead
over Bradley among women, which Bradley has blamed on his being
better known among men _ a result of his years in professional
basketball before being elected to the U.S. Senate from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley launched his renewed appeal to women in an appearance at
the YWCA in Manchester before flying to the wintry North Country
for a final appeal in the sparsely populated region before
Tuesday's voting in the first primary of the 2000 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, Bradley tried out a little French for the
Franco-American community, saying he was a man of ``grandes idees''
(big ideas), also a central theme of his campaign in English.
</P>
<P>
   Gore traveled the state with daughter Sarah and actors Ted
Danson and Mary Steenburgen. He visited with patrons at the River
House Cafe in Milford, knocked on doors in Concord and answered
questions from undecided voters in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In his major address of the day, Bradley promised as president
to safeguard abortion rights, expand health insurance opportunities
for women, provide health clinic funding for breast cancer
screening, increase the income tax deduction for child care
services and expand the law that requires companies to give workers
time off for medical care and related family needs.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley took pains to note that his campaign manager and former
staff chiefs from his U.S. Senate days are women. He also mentioned
that during several years in the Senate, he was the primary care
provider for his daughter in Washington, D.C., while his wife,
Ernestine, taught at Montclair State University in New Jersey three
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not only paid respect (to women) but I know where talent
is,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's defense was seconded by Shaheen, who said:
</P>
<P>
   ``On issues important to New Hampshire and important to women in
New Hampshire _ from keeping our economy strong, to improving our
schools, expanding health care and protecting a woman's right to
choose _ Al Gore will fight for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley most recently raised Gore's record on abortion rights in
a New Hampshire debate on Wednesday night. Gore contended he had
only ever had question about whether abortion should be government
financed.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's comments Saturday were timed to coincide with his
latest campaign commercial
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the seven men running for the president, only one candidate
has been pro-choice for everyone all the time,'' says the female
voice reading the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley then says: ``This isn't the kind of issue that you can
straddle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Straddle'' is a highly charged word in the context of a New
Hampshire presidential campaign. In 1988, then-Vice President
George Bush pummeled Bob Dole in the final days of the primary race
with a now-famous television ad pointing up Dole's flip-flop on
several issues. The ad was titled ``Senator Straddle.'' Bush scored
an upset victory and went on to win the nomination and the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley already was out-spending Gore on television advertising
time in New Hampshire and Boston, where stations broadcast into the
heavily populated southern tier of the Granite State. For the final
week, however, Bradley is pulling even farther ahead in the outlays
for TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has booked time costing $734,520 on major channels in
the final week compared to $499,265 for Gore, the Boston Globe
reported Saturday.

BUSH THE PRESIDENT JOINS BUSH THE CANDIDATE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, N.H. _ The New Hampshire primary marked the beginning
of the end of President Bush's 1992 re-election campaign, but Bush
returned Saturday to boost his eldest son on the road to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even from far away in Texas, you get the feeling that things
are moving up here and moving well,'' the former president said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is locked in an increasingly tight race for Tuesday's New
Hampshire primary with U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona. McCain has
been leading the Granite State polls for weeks, but this weekend
the two have been tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of our whole family. And this boy, this son of ours,
is not going to let you down. He is going to go all the way and
serve with great honor all the way,'' Bush said at the Hampshire
Hills Event Center.
</P>
<P>
   The former president has hosted fund-raisers for Texas Gov.
George W. Bush and made campaign appearances in Arizona, Iowa, New
York, South Carolina and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's gathering marked the first time father and son
have made a public campaign appearance together since June, when
they stood together on the lawn of the family's Kennebunkport,
Maine, compound the weekend that the governor officially launched
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's four siblings and his mother, Barbara, had
campaigned in New Hampshire in recent weeks, and the whole family,
minus Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, were there Saturday. But campaign
aides said they were keeping the former president out of the state
for ``strategic reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire voters gave President Bush the first hint of his
eventual re-election defeat when they delivered 37 percent of the
vote to critic Pat Buchanan in 1992. The president said he had
heard the ``message of dissatisfaction'' over breaking his 1988
``read my lips, no new taxes'' promise.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush, who has previously campaigned in New Hampshire for
the governor, said she felt the need to come to the state once
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just sitting in Washington and said we've got to go
up,'' Barbara Bush said. ``Thank you for all you are doing for my
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said it is no surprise the
former president is backing his son. Opinsky said McCain believes
New Hampshire voters backed Bush in previous elections because of
his experience and will decide to back McCain for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaigned Saturday on the message that he was the best
prepared for the White House job, taking a swipe at Bush by
suggesting that he himself will not require ``on-the-job training''
and that Bush may ``not be ready for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, who needs a win in New Hampshire to
continue a credible presidential campaign, said he was not trying
to draw a distinction between himself and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But it was obvious that McCain was trying to renew doubts about
Bush's experience, particularly in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying I don't need any on-the-job training. I think
people will judge us by our qualifications, our experience and our
vision,'' McCain told reporters after first raising the
``on-the-job training'' issue at a town hall-style meeting with
about 250 people in Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making any distinction. I am touting my credentials
and my ability and my proven vision and experience to lead the
nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's message on Saturday reinforced a claim that he began
promoting in a television ad in New Hampshire earlier this week.
The ad, which reminds voters that McCain was a Navy pilot and
prisoner of war in Vietnam, claims that he is the only presidential
candidate ``who knows the military and understands the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign bus on Saturday, McCain said Bush's attempts to
compare him to President Clinton ``gives rise to the view of some
that he (Bush) is not ready for prime time.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see why people would say that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would be the ``steady hand on the tiller'' on
foreign policy and national defense issues.
</P>
<P>
   McCain once again also criticized Bush for not supporting his
proposal to crack down on so-called ``soft money'' contributions to
political parties from businesses and other special interests.
</P>
<P>
   The maverick senator said that was one reason Bush had been
endorsed by the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment obviously is in a state of extreme distress,
if not panic, because they know that I will break the (special
interest) iron triangle of money, lobbyists and legislation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their very futures are at risk here because I will not have
anything to do with soft money. I don't know why Governor Bush will
continue to defend a system that has led to the loss of American
national security and a system that has destroyed the confidence of
young Americans.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has raised a record $70 million, has said he opposes
McCain's plan because he believes it will leave the Republican
Party at a disadvantage.

   The most recent statewide figures show that districts on average
use 88 percent of the more than $700 million generated annually by
the lottery for salaries, with only a small percentage dedicated to
such one-time-only expenses as textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Unified School District, which suffers from a
well-documented book shortage, typically uses nearly 100 percent of
its lottery windfall for wages and benefits, as does Long Beach
Unified, interviews and records show.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Education has issued repeated
advisories that the money should be used for one-time expenditures.
The department warns districts that even if Californians' interest
in the state lottery declines, the school districts will still have
to pay salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is a fiscally unsound practice that could
leave districts holding the bag,'' said Susie Lange, manager of the
Department of Education's Office of Financial Accountability and
Information Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically in other states, lottery funding was real
erratic. And in fact, California has done the same thing, with
funding going up and then going way down.''
</P>
<P>
   State education officials concede there is almost no policing of
the lottery funds, and that they have no authority to make school
districts comply with their guidelines. Although voters were told
in 1987 that lottery funds would improve education directly, limits
on how the money was spent were not written into the law.
</P>
<P>
   And there has been little political will in the face of the
powerful education lobby to change the rules.
</P>
<P>
   A measure on the March 7 ballot, introduced by Assemblyman Tony
Cardenas, D-Panorama City, would require that 50percent of future
growth in lottery funds go toward textbooks. And others are seeking
a thorough examination of the lottery, including how schools spend
the funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to take the lottery by the ankle and give it a good
shake -- there needs to be an audit,'' said state Sen. Don Perata,
D-Oakland, a former teacher who chairs a state committee that is
charged with overseeing the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, schools have received more than $11billion in
lottery funds, representing about 2percent of a district's total
budget. Over the years, the amount to districts has fluctuated
greatly, with a per-pupil amount as low as $76.52 and as high as
$178.63. This year's funding is expected to hit $120.
</P>
<P>
   By law, at least 34 percent of lottery ticket sales goes to
schools, 50 percent goes to prize money and the remaining 16
percent goes to the Lottery Commission to cover administration and
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials shrug off the state warnings, saying
they believe funding teachers' salaries is so crucial and money is
so tight that they are willing to take financial risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the state's concerns, but we have a very severe
teacher shortage -- and we've consciously chosen to use the money
to bring salaries up,'' said Richard Van Der Laan, a spokesman for
Long Beach Unified School District. ``We believe the benefit of
bringing in a qualified teacher will benefit students for years,
much longer than any book.''
</P>
<P>
   At the LAUSD, the district has used its lottery funds to pay for
a series of raises for its teachers. Although students suffered a
severe textbook shortage, little went toward classroom materials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997-98, the LAUSD spent $81 million in lottery funds, almost
all of it on salaries and benefits. The district allocated only a
small fraction -- $85,654 -- for textbooks. In that same year, the
district left $12.8 million in lottery money unspent.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the LAUSD applied almost all of its $101.8million
in lottery funds to salaries. It originally allocated $1.3 million
for textbooks, but actually spent only $211,506. This fiscal year,
the district has budgeted to spend $234,102 on books and supplies
out of $87 million in lottery revenues.
</P>
<P>
   At Long Beach Unified, the district spends 100 percent of its
lottery money for teachers' salaries, to help raise the pay for
entry-level, certified teachers to $37,000, a spokesman said. The
state average is $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale Unified School District uses about 80 percent of its
lottery funds for salaries, 10 percent for books and 10 percent for
other services, said Steve Hodgson, assistant superintendent of
Business Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we're concerned about fluctuations in the lottery
funds, but we look carefully at estimates and projections before
creating our budget,'' Hodgson said, adding that unions have made
it clear that the money should come back to pay for salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's Perata contends that there has been a clear failure
of promises made to voters that the lottery money would be used for
such ``extras'' as textbooks and lab equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money was never intended to go toward salaries, and it's
an embarrassment that school districts are so desperate that they
have to resort to using it to that end,'' Perata said. ``It was
sold to voters on one premise and now is operating on another.''
</P>
<P>
   The only information generated on how schools spend their
lottery money is an annual report prepared by the Department of
Education for the Legislature. A sampling is used of 100 local
education agencies. The report uses data supplied by the districts
and no independent audit is used.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent report, issued on May 15, 1999, the state
found that during the 1997-98 school year smaller districts
generally spent less of their lottery funds on salaries than did
larger districts. And the report noted that the state ``continues
to recommend that districts use lottery funds for nonrecurring
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lange said the state has no authority to make the districts
follow its guidelines because it's a matter of ``local control.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, the Northeast Valley assemblyman, authored Proposition
20, which allows a base amount of $780 million in lottery money for
any use but would require that half the revenue above that go
toward textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state sends almost $600million from its non-lottery
coffers to districts with the requirement that it be spent on
instructional materials, Cardenas notes that California is still
ranked 47th out of 50 states in textbook spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have atrocious conditions; kids still need books,''
Cardenas said. ``This proposition would make sure that money is
spent on textbooks, because the districts aren't doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Teachers Association, an opponent of the
proposition, maintains that school districts know best how to spend
the money, and it should come without strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why it shouldn't go toward salaries if they
are looking for money and have a teacher shortage,'' said Tommye
Hutto, a CTA spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes that local control, without any oversight, leads
to problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it appears that school districts are violating the law
by failing to detail each year how they spent the funds -- as is
the case at Antelope Valley Union High School District and the
Lancaster School District -- no action is taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if we even have any authority to do anything,''
said Kathy Matthews, an analyst for the Department of Education's
Office of Financial Accountability.

LAKERS BEAT UP ON STRUGGLING TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A 34-9 record is testament enough to the Lakers'
progress. It takes a closer inspection of those losses, though, to
see how far they've really come.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, they don't lose to the NBA's have-nots anymore. To
paraphrase Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers beat the teams they're
supposed to beat, more consistently than ever.
</P>
<P>
   They have lost only twice to sub-.500 teams -- and both defeats
happened in November, when Kobe Bryant was injured. One loss was at
Denver, the other at home against today's opponent, the Houston
Rockets. But Bryant and O'Neal (serving a suspension) both missed
that Nov. 12 contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers haven't lost to a bad team since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a new attitude and approach to the lower teams,'' Glen
Rice said. ``Those are, in most cases, the most dangerous teams.
That's whereyou have the mental lapses, and we're trying to stay
focused and take care of those teams as quick as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the NBA's elite teams, only the Lakers have maintained
that standard.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few weeks, the Miami Heat has lost to the Rockets
and Vancouver Grizzlies. The Portland Trail Blazers lost
back-to-back games to the Rockets and Dallas Mavericks. The Indiana
Pacers lost to the Clippers and the Chicago Bulls. The Utah Jazz
were beaten by the Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's parity in the NBA, in a lot of ways,'' said coach Phil
Jackson,``and from our standpoint it's that we just get the
business done with the teams you've got to get the business done
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams that are high-ranked teams, top-of-the-league
teams...you're going to have games that are tossup games. And
that's the kind of thing you hope you have homecourt advantage for
in the playoffs. But this time of the season, you want to play
about .500 against those teams and you want to really take care of
business against the teams that you're suoposed to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers recently struggled through a 2-4 spell, but the
losses were all to playoff teams -- the Pacers, Seattle Sonics,
Blazers and Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   And they have no shortage of motivation to get up for today's
game against the 16-27 Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe them,'' Rice said. ``They came in here and they beat us
on our floor, and we're going to go in there with a lot of
intensity, very aggressive and try to return the favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant All-Star: Jackson hasn't veiled his distaste for the
All-Star game, but when the Lakers' victory Friday clinched a spot
for him as coach of the Western Conference team, he was all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy to be going,'' he said sarcastically, drawing
laughs. ``I think it's such a great venue for the league, that they
can show off and showcase the players. I hope to be able to do that
for the players too. ... I'll play (Tim) Duncan 40 (minutes).''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA selects the All-Star coaches from the teams with the
best record in each conference, based on records through today's
games. The Lakers' victory over the Milwaukee Bucks ensured they
would not be caught by second-place Portland.
</P>
<P>
   LAKERS vs. ROCKETS
</P>
<P>
   Tipoff: 11:30 a.m., Compaq Center
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: KNBC-Channel 4; KLAC-AM (570)
</P>
<P>
   Lakers (34-9) update: After today's game, they travel to San
Antonio for their last two road games before the All-Star break.
The Lakers' pre-break schedule concludes with home games against
Utah, Denver and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets (16-27) update: Led by explosive rookie Steve Francis,
the Rockets recently put together a season-best six-game winning
streak, incuding upsets of Portland and Miami. But they've lost
three straight since then, including a 104-98 loss at Denver on
Friday. Francis leads all NBA rookies with 18.2 points and 7.2
assists per game.

PUTTING THE KNIFE TO LAKERS SCRIPT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The script doctor, who couldn't prevent ``Any Given Sunday''
from flat-lining, has another shot at redemption, one more
opportunity to dodge that malpractice arrow.
</P>
<P>
   His scalpel is aimed at the most-recent Tinseltown tale
involving the Lakers. And this script was a dandy.
</P>
<P>
   Fade in:
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson has taken the Lakers from Boyz II To Zen. They look
invincible - if you manage to avoid gazing at their hole at backup
center. But, on cue, Shaquille O'Neal is working overtime, the team
is acting dangerously mortal and Michael Jordan has arrived in D.C.
with big contracts to unload.
</P>
<P>
   The first contract, according to league scuttlebutt, is that of
center Ike Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Mike, according to the script, don't like Ike.
</P>
<P>
   And he thinks even less of his contract, a sweet deal that will
pay Austin about $11 million more scoots in the two seasons
following this one.
</P>
<P>
   How about Austin, Phil? Fine, says Phil.
</P>
<P>
   Cut, says the script doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan wants to unload salaries, meaning the player he receives
in trade must be in the final year of his contract. When this
season is over, the player is not re-signed and the Washington
Wizards inch down toward the salary cap limit.
</P>
<P>
   But the only Laker in the final year of his deal is Glen Rice,
who earns almost $2 million more per season than Austin. Since both
teams are miles beyond the cap limit, the Wizards would be required
to send another player whose salary - when combined with Austin's -
comes within 10 percent of Rice's $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would go for this, but the Lakers can't be expected to
swap their third offensive option (Rice) for a backup center (psst!
Austin doesn't rebound and he lost he starting job in Washington to
Jahidi White) and still contend for the title.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the 945 Laker general managers who also draw paychecks
as L.A.-area reporters, suggest the Lakers offer a draft pick for
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Cut.
</P>
<P>
   Such a maneuver would require them to take on Austin's salary
without clearing any space. The league would vote thumbs-down.
</P>
<P>
   So what do the Lakers do? Forget Austin, and either find a big,
capable CBA-type player (good luck), or inhale deeply (and hold it)
when Shaq requires a few minutes on the pine.
</P>
<P>
   But the script doctor doesn't completely forbid a Rice trade.
Chicago's Toni Kukoc, according to league sources, remains a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as there's a little Bull involved, don't be
surprised by any transaction Jackson browbeats the Lakers into
exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Jump street
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, in our non-negotiable opinion, was the greatest player
in the history of players. But although he's in the team picture,
MJ was not the greatest dunker.
</P>
<P>
   Who's the greatest non-law-enforcement dunker we've ever seen?
</P>
<P>
   It's not Julius Erving, although he may be first runner-up. We
probably should reserve a spot at the reunion banquet for Toronto's
Vince Carter, whose combat slams make him the favorite to
annihilate the field in the NBA dunk contest at Oakland on All-Star
Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the contemporary skinny.
</P>
<P>
   Many of you could use a lesson in retro ``ups.''
</P>
<P>
   According to longtime NBA observers such as Elgin Baylor, who
was required to walk 12 miles through the snow just to reach old
school, the greatest leaper he's seen in the NBA was Johnny Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumpin''' Johnny Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do all the fancy dunks,'' Baylor said, ``because
guys didn't practice dunking in those days. But he could get up
higher than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   History lesson: Green was drafted by the New York Knicks in
1959. He hopped around with several NBA teams, retiring after
averaging 11 points per game over 14 seasons. The four-time
All-Star's shooting range was point-blank; at 6-foot-5, he led the
NBA in field-goal percentage for two seasons - 1969-'70 (.559) and
1970-'71 (.587).
</P>
<P>
   According to urban legend, the highest riser of them all might
have been New York City playground monster Herman ``The
Helicopter'' Knowings.
</P>
<P>
   The mightiest slammer we've ever seen? Former Banning High
forward Joey ``Brother of Dennis'' Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   New (and improved) Mavericks owner Mark Cuban scored more points
than his players Thursday by having them delivered safely to
Reunion Arena in limousines. The Mavs, in front of about 4,000
citizens who survived the icy Dallas thoroughfares, rewarded Cuban
by spanking the Clippers, 99-90. ... Before the Clips' bus could
make a post-game getaway, it was boarded by rap music king Percy
``Master P'' Miller. Even though Clipper Derek Anderson is one of
several NBA players rumored to be in the process of dropping the
representation of Miller's No Limit Sports, Master P came in peace.
According to the latest spin, Miller isn't exactly wild about the
agent biz anymore. ... And Jeff Malone isn't exactly wild about
Miller's game. Malone, an ex-deadeye NBA shooting guard (Bullets,
Jazz), has succeeded Smokey Gaines as coach of the IBL's San Diego
franchise. Miller, who's been sidelined by a bum ankle, was one of
the Stingrays' guards - until Malone took over. ...
</P>
<P>
   While Marty Blake, the NBA's Director of Scouting, gushes over
6-11 Vanderbilt ``small forward'' Dan Langhi, people who actually
are responsible for drafting players have a few reservations.
Here's one: can the kid guard anybody in the NBA? While Langhi is
agile, versatile and deadly away from the hoop with the ball in his
mitts, he lacks the sinew for post defense against power forwards,
and may have a deficit in quickness necessary to defend most NBA
``3-men.'' After cuffing Langhi around, we should add that he'll
probably play in the league for a while. ... There are few alleged
NBA prospects in the Big West Conference, but the guy most scouts
tout as an eventual pro is Terrance Green, a freshman shooting
guard at Nevada and nephew of the Lakers' A.C. ... Bill Walton
Broadcast Quote of the Weak: ``He shot that right in the face of
the arm of Keith Closs.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Ex-UCLA Bruin J.R. Henderson (who had a few swallows of coffee
as a Vancouver Grizzlies rookie last season) is averaging 24 points
per game for the Las Vegas Silver Bandits of the IBL. ... Guard
Rashad Phillips (5-11), who averages 24 points per game for the
University of Detroit, is the cousin of Clippers forward Maurice
Taylor. One NBA observer thinks Phillips is a cinch to play in the
league. That observer is Taylor. ...NBA suits will have plenty to
say in the matter (prediction: ``No!''), but if and when Dennis
Rodman becomes a Dallas Maverick, he plans to wear jersey No. 69.
Considering his flair for extracurricular excess - demonstrated
last year at a restaurant in Newport Beach - a more appropriate
number might be 86.

FAULK HARD TO PIN DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the Tennessee Titans are able to hold St. Louis
running back Marshall Faulk to a combined 50 yards or so Sunday,
even Rams coach Dick Vermeil has conceded the point: ``We're not
going to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened last week. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were able to
grab and hold _ and most important of all _ see Faulk. Few ever see
Faulk clearly, either on or off the football field. Even fewer can
pin him down.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans will try to hold him down Sunday, just as the Bucs
held him to a paltry 49 yards. But Faulk is elusive, a back with an
apparent sixth sense that tells him the whereabouts of would-be
tacklers. Marshall Faulk is very elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am aware of what's going on on the field,'' is how
Faulk explained that elusiveness. ``I know a lot about football and
what everybody is supposed to be doing. And that helps me be more
relaxed out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Wilbert Montgomery, his running back coach, put it,
``Marshall has what all of us other backs never had: eyes in the
back of his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk was a good back with Indianapolis, perhaps a very good
back. But the Colts traded him to the Rams before the 1999 draft,
when Rams president John Shaw had a hunch that Indianapolis would
let Faulk go, and only the timing mattered for the trade to become
a reality. The Colts were about to pass up Ricky Williams and draft
Edgerrin James when Shaw made the pitch to Colts president Bill
Polian.
</P>
<P>
   That can be pinned down. Faulk got to St. Louis because of good
timing.
</P>
<P>
   But Faulk was unhappy about leaving the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was coming to a 4-12 team,'' he said, ``and I didn't
understand exactly what they had.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, the team he was leaving, had promise, and Faulk knew
that. The Rams had that losing record.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you saw this year in Indianapolis was a couple of players
mature in Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison,'' said Faulk. ``Last
year, when I was there, Marvin was starting to come around until he
hurt his shoulder, and it was Peyton's rookie season. As a rookie
he handled it well, but coming back this year he had an even better
season than he had last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk had been with the Colts since 1994 and had seen countless
players come and go. So while he acknowledged, ``It was tough''
being traded to the Rams, he recalled the words of players who had
left the Colts through free agency or who had been cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys'd tell me, `Marshall, regardless of what happens,
this is a business,' '' recalled Faulk. ``I've always remembered
that. It's a business.''
</P>
<P>
   So Faulk reported to St. Louis. He went to minicamp, even though
he didn't have a contract with the Rams. This was unusual business,
Faulk doing what few free agents ever do _ practice without a
contract. He did it, he said, ``because I wanted to get to know
these players on this new team of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, Faulk got to know the Rams. Soon enough, he saw
that this new offense coordinator Mike Martz had installed ``would
be fun.'' Soon enough, he saw there were many fast, quick, and
talented offensive players on the Rams. And Marshall Faulk
blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   He also knew exactly why. He was not the only threat on the
offense. He was not the ``go-to'' guy. He did not have to carry an
offense on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a luxury,'' he said. ``Being in an offense with guys
like (wide receivers) Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt, Ricky Proehl,
Az-Zahir Hakim, I don't have to be the `go-to' guy. It's not like,
`You have to do this' or `You have to do that' in order for us to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   That can be pinned down. Faulk is one of the Rams' many weapons.
No longer surrounded by weeds, he has been able to bloom and grow
and stupefy the NFL with his production.
</P>
<P>
   But what can't be pinned down is the Marshall Faulk off the
football field. Good man _ virtually everyone says that _ but hard
to know. Even his high school coach, mentor, and father figure, who
has spoken to Faulk every day for the last seven years, told the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch he doesn't truly know Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say very mysterious, very strange, but in a good
way,'' said Wayne Reese, Faulk's coach at Carver High School in New
Orleans. Faulk, he said, was ``the type of kid you never knew.
Mysterious, intriguing, because he always keeps you wondering,
`What's he thinking? What's he going to do next?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk grew up in the housing projects of New Orleans, where five
older brothers had succumbed to the evils of the inner city.
Gunshots flew around the projects. Drugs. Broken windows. An
unholy, unhappy place where even police feared to enter. Faulk was
hungry and virtually homeless during his school years when his
mother became ill. He first moved in with a sister and then slept
at a friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, but no tougher than any other housing project,''
said Faulk. ``I learned a lot of things. It was an experience. I
can't explain it to you, but it prepared me for other obstacles in
my life that I had to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to say I was an angel, but I did make some
right decisions along the way that got me where I am today.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those decisions was to stick to the position on the field
he loved. Even though he was small as a boy, with several
nutrition-related illnesses that brought him to a hospital, Faulk
was an outstanding football player at quarterback, cornerback, and
running back. And if Nebraska, Miami, LSU, and other high-powered
football schools wanted him, only one wanted him as a running back.
And that was San Diego State.

   The Aztecs wanted to redshirt him his freshman year, but by the
end of preseason practice, Faulk had moved up from fifth string to
second string. After the starter got hurt in the second game of the
season, Faulk promptly became the first freshman ever to lead the
nation in rushing. And when coach Al Luginbill and his staff at San
Diego State were fired after Faulk's junior year, Faulk headed to
the NFL, where he was the second player selected in the 1994 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get to experience anything at some point in your
life, it helps you to move on,'' Faulk said of his odyssey from the
projects of New Orleans to Sunday's Super Bowl. ``Some of the
things I had to live through in life, it makes dealing with
football easy because football is a game. When you are dealing with
life, that's life. You live or you die. You either make it or you
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   That can be pinned down. Faulk has made it. And he has learned
from his journey just how relative a Super Bowl win can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone has to win and someone has to lose,'' he said. ``There
is something to be lost, but the price isn't as high as what life
may cost you.''

ORLANDO BANKING ON RIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was cold last Wednesday in Orlando. Newspapers devoted plenty
of space to the ``Big Freeze'' and residents were urged to bring
their pets and plants into the house for the night. There was a run
on space heaters.
</P>
<P>
   How cold was it?
</P>
<P>
   It was so cold that Doc Rivers looked at the schedule, saw the
Celtics were coming to town, and said, ``Whew.'' As he later put
it, ``It's a good thing Boston doesn't have any free agents we
want. It might be a hard sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Celtics do have Danny Fortson and Pervis Ellison, but
it's a safe bet that neither is on Orlando's ``A'' list. The Magic
are aiming higher. Much higher. Orlando will drive the market this
summer and make what one GM calls a ``full-fledged assault'' until
Aug. 1 for the express purpose of reeling in Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Orlando has that no one else has: cap space, draft
picks, (usually) warm weather, no other real professional
competition, no state taxes, nitwit fans, and plenty of golf
courses. And it also has the indomitable Rivers, who, you get the
feeling, could talk a dog off a meat wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a franchise with a tremendous upside,'' said Celtics
general manager Chris Wallace. ``You've got all those things and an
attractive, young coach.''
</P>
<P>
   What do they have? Depending on what happens between now and
Aug. 1, they could have as much as $18 million in cap room. ``An
interesting number,'' Rivers suggested. That's because $9 million
represents the maximum that Duncan, or Tracy McGrady (a Florida
native), or Eddie Jones (a Florida native), or Grant Hill would
command.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic have three first-round draft picks. All three could be
lottery picks, as the selections originally belonged to Golden
State, Denver, and Orlando. Those might not necessarily translate
into rookies. They could also be chips at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free agents and draft picks. We can get a double whammy,''
said Rivers. ``It'd be like being at Duke, except that after we
recruited the guys, then we could draft three more. That'd be
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando doesn't really want all three, and Rivers is determined
that only two of them be lottery picks. Unlike Chicago, for
instance, which is deliberately tanking it, and the Clippers, who
make it an annual thing in spite of themselves, the Magic are
trying to, as GM John Gabriel put it, ``wear a nice dress to the
dance.'' They compete. They work hard. Almost everyone plays. It's
almost like a yearlong audition.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic have only seven players under contract for next
season, and three of them _ Mike Doleac, Matt Harpring, and Pat
Garrity _ could probably be deemed expendable in a deal that would
also rid them of Chris Gatling or Derek Strong. The only
untouchables, if there are such things, would be Corey Maggette and
Darrell Armstrong. They do have some free agents who will require
cap holds (Bo Outlaw, Ben Wallace, Tariq Abdul-Wahad), and the
draft picks go on the cap as soon as they're made. But there still
will be cash. Lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have put a lot of good things in place,'' said Rivers. ``We
have money and draft picks. After this summer, I'm hoping we have
no money. It's a very important summer for us. We've got some nice
pieces right now. We have the role players. Now, we're going after
the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one can say anything publicly, it's clear that the
supernova in the crosshairs is Duncan. He and Rivers have a
relationship from their time in San Antonio when Rivers was a team
broadcaster. The Spurs are an aging team and Duncan will likely do
one of two things: Re-up for the short term in San Antonio or head
to Orlando, which is a lot closer to his hometown of St. Croix.
</P>
<P>
   Those watching this from the outside feel if anyone can get
Duncan out of San Antonio, it's Rivers. They wonder why Duncan
didn't re-up with the Spurs. The Magic are going to get somebody
good, that seems like a lock. The land of Waffle Houses, outlet
malls, and theme parks may again be an unavoidable stop in May and
June.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't, it won't be for lack of trying.
</P>
<P>
   About those picks
</P>
<P>
   The NBA announced the starters for the All-Star Game this
weekend and the extras will be added by the coaches this week. The
Celtics have a shot with Paul Pierce getting a coach's vote, but
their record may work against the selection. Given that the
starters will be via fan vote, we will simply list the players who
deserve to be there. Each conference has four guards, four
forwards, two centers, and two wild cards. Starters are listed
first.
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   C: Alonzo Mourning, Dikembe Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
   F: Grant Hill, Vince Carter, Dale Davis, Glenn Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   G: Allen Iverson, Eddie Jones, Stephon Marbury, Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   WC: Sam Cassell, Paul Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: This is a very tough conference for forwards, as
opposed to the West, which is overloaded at the position. Toughest
omissions have to be Jerry Stackhouse, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen,
Latrell Sprewell, and Shawn Kemp. It was tempting to put Allen in
there; he's simply caught in the guard glut and the Bucks already
have two representatives. There are no other center options.
Period. (Elden Campbell?) And if he hadn't missed so many games,
Toni Kukoc would have warranted serious consideration given the way
the Bulls have played since he returned. Pierce gets the
sentimental vote here. As noted last week, his numbers are quite
comparable to Carter's. Is it his fault he doesn't dunk as well?
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   C: Shaquille O'Neal, David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   F: Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Karl Malone, Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   G: Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, Kobe Bryant, Michael Finley.
</P>
<P>
   WC: Rasheed Wallace, Cliff Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: It was tempting to put Wallace at backup center, given
that Robinson wins the spot by default. (The Admiral isn't scoring,
but he still is in the top echelon of rebounders and shot
blockers.) The four forwards are non-negotiable. All are playing
superbly. Same goes for the first three guards. Finley gets a nod
for the fourth spot because he plays hard and in a versatile
fashion every night for Dallas. Sometimes, it's all night. He gets
the nod over John Stockton, at least for the All-Star Game. (We
have a feeling Stockton won't mind.) Cliff Robinson has been
terrific all season for the Suns, ``our best defender, by far,''
said the Suns' Cotton Fitzsimmons. Someone has to represent
Portland, and the ultra-talented Wallace gets the nod over Scottie
Pippen. Still, we're leaving off a couple studs in Shareef
Abdur-Rahim (who has to understand by now) and Antonio McDyess
(ditto). There are only so many sympathy spots, and Finley gets
this year's.
</P>
<P>
   Walker shopped around
</P>
<P>
   One general manager reports that the Celtics are still looking
for a way to move Antoine Walker. Walker's tradeability is hindered
by the complicated base-year clause in the salary cap rules. But
one team that might surface as a power broker is Indiana, which,
you may recall, talked about a Walker-Dale Davis deal last summer.
The reason the Pacers might entertain such a deal is the $4.5
million trade exception they have. But they also have several free
agents, ranging from Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson to Austin
Croshere and Jalen Rose. Walker would be a good fit in Indiana
mainly because the Pacers have some veterans who would be unafraid
to keep him in line. The Celtics have no such player, nor have they
had one since Walker has been in town, save for the nanosecond that
Frank Brickowski was around. Now, it's too late . . . If Duncan
does go to Orlando, that would not only be a boon for Hooterville,
it also would help level the playing field between conferences. The
West clearly is the dominant conference, which is no big surprise.
Charlotte, Cleveland, and New Jersey are only the latest of the
Eastern teams to go out West and get smoked. The Celtics' turn will
come next month. Meanwhile, you have Vancouver completing a 4-1
Eastern swing with victories at Miami, Boston, New Jersey, and
Toronto. The Suns were 14-2 against Eastern teams going into the
weekend. In fact, in games through Thursday, the top eight teams in
the West had an 85-38 record against Eastern Conference teams. The
top eight teams in the East had a 64-52 record against Western
Conference teams. The East may be more evenly balanced, but the
balance is among mediocre teams . . . Rick Pitino thinks referees
these days are getting much more abuse than they were 10 years ago.
He's right. According to one official, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, the lack of respect is leaguewide and it's due mainly
to the young players. In addition, the NBA is bringing in younger
officials who may not have the maturity to handle hot spots . . .
Indiana GM/president Donnie Walsh says he continues to be surprised
that his team has risen above the numerous potential distractions,
such as having a lame duck coach and the above-mentioned free
agents. ``I thought it would be a problem,'' Walsh said. ``I have
to credit Larry (Bird) and the players. I know some of the players
(Miller and Jackson) might be mad at me, but they're still playing
hard and trying to win.'' Walsh said he is getting many calls about
the coaching job. As for Bird's future, he feels he'll join the
front office, but said he has not heard that directly from the man
himself . . . So Pat Riley, what do you think about all the
nonsense that goes on during games? ``I think it's ridiculous,'' he
said. ``I don't care who started it. I don't care where it came
from. It's not a part of the NBA. I'm embarrassed by it. I've told
my players that. There's nothing like a good, hot rivalry. But come
on, get away from that stuff. I know there's going to be talking.
But when it goes over the top and it shows a lack of mutual
respect, then I think it's gone too far.'' Having said all that,
it's hard to believe Riley is president of a franchise that allows
eardrum-piercing fireworks before every home game . . . While we're
on the topic of noise, here's history professor Joseph Scionti of
UMass-Dartmouth, who says he's a longtime Celtics season
ticket-holder and wrote to the team about what he calls the
``disgusting sideshow'' at the FleetCenter. He called the ``game
presentation'' an ``appalling cacophony'' and suggested a
compromise: ``Let's allow all the barbarisms that have nothing to
do with basketball to take place during the timeouts and at
halftime. This will satisfy the 10-year-olds and the halfwits who
want to see their kissers on the scoreboard. After all, bad taste
rules the world. Why should we expect Boston to be exempt?'' . . .
On the other hand, Patrick Kelly of Riverhead, N.Y., writes to
thank the Celtics for a special treat the team gave to his
7-year-old son, Michael, in December. The boy, who lost his mother
to cancer in April, was a special guest of the Celtics for their
shootaround that morning and was given autographs, high-fives, and
smiles all around. ``Too often, we hear of the athlete who snubs a
little kid,'' Kelly writes. ``I feel these kinds of stories need to
be told, also.''

LOTT, MONTANA TO BE INDUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't think it came about by luck that Joe Montana and
Ronnie Lott will be inducted into the Hall of Fame in July on the
same weekend their former team, the San Francisco 49ers, will be
playing the Patriots in the exhibition opener.
</P>
<P>
   Montana and Lott, two of the greatest players in San Francisco's
glorious run of Super Bowls, will walk into the Hall in Canton,
Ohio, with Howie Long of the Oakland Raiders, owner Dan Rooney of
the Pittsburgh Steelers, and linebacker Dave Wilcox, the veterans
candidate, who also played with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney, joins his father, the late, great Art Rooney, as the
second father-son team enshrined. Wellington Mara of the New York
Giants and his father, Tim, share that honor.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, considered by many the greatest quarterback ever, won
four Super Bowls and was named the Most Valuable Player in three of
those games.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who played cornerback and safety in a 14-year career with
the 49ers, Raiders, and New York Jets, is best remembered as the
heart and soul of the great San Francisco championship defensive
units.
</P>
<P>
   Long was twice chosen NFL Defensive Player of the Year in his
13-year run with the Raiders, and was named All-Pro five times. He
was regarded as perhaps the most versatile defensive lineman ever.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney was not only the architect of the four Pittsburgh world
championship teams, but he has been one of the game's great owners,
working on many committees, and has been a leader in many of the
NFL's successful collective bargaining agreements with the union,
because of his friendship with executive director Gene Upshaw. The
two have worked closely to bring a long period of labor peace to
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox was a rough-and-tumble linebacker with the Niners before
their glory days. He was named all-league five times, and is
regarded as one of the best outside linebackers ever.

CELTICS SAVED BY THEIR DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ The Celtics are not an intimidating defensive team in
the traditional sense. Their inside players are not extraordinarily
physical and the team is second to last in the NBA in blocked
shots. But the Celtics are able to disconcert the opposition enough
below the rim to negate low-post opponents.
</P>
<P>
   They did so effectively in taking a 91-88 win over Phoenix
Friday, and coach Rick Pitino is hoping for a similar performance
at Indiana Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we go to Indiana we will be 100 percent for the
first time this year, with the exception of Eric Williams, who is
on the injured list,'' Pitino said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have achieved some balance recently as Paul Pierce
recovers from a left hamstring strain. Pierce, who leads the team
in steals and is the best shot-blocker among the starters, has
combined with Antoine Walker to give the Celtics a formidable
scoring threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Paul and Antoine we are scoring enough points,'' Pitino
said, ``so that if our defense is good we can be in every game. We
couldn't score enough points (when Pierce was injured). It's like
baseball _ now, we don't have to pitch a shutout every time to win.
When you have scorers, things can go wrong and you still can win
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot went wrong against the Suns. The Celtics went long
stretches without scoring. They were shut out for the first 2:39 of
the game; Pierce's 3-pointer was their only field goal of the first
6:38 of the final quarter; they converted only two field goals of
the final 4:03 of the game. Some equally spectacular defensive
accomplishments, though, salvaged the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is one of the better defensive teams in the league,
but their offense is what makes them go,'' Pitino said. ``And to
hold them to 38 percent shooting was special for our defense. That
was a big win for us because we have a very difficult month coming
up, a killer road trip, and we need any wins we can get before the
All-Star break. I thought we would win some games once we got
healthy, and now we are only two games behind Detroit, who are
falling because of Grant Hill's injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have been able to dictate the tempo at home, and
reached the halfway point in the season with a 15-6 record at the
FleetCenter. They are on a pace to win 39 games, which should keep
them in playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest weakness is the 4 and 5 spots,'' Pitino said.
``Teams like San Antonio and New York are very athletic at those
spots. We have good basketball players, but we are not athletic at
those spots and by that I mean shot-blocking, strength, quickness.
So, we rely on five guys rotating and you need cohesiveness to make
that go. Paul is a big part of that, and it's important that he is
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The game against Phoenix was decided in the final seconds, and
the Suns were prevented from even one realistic field goal attempt
on their final two possessions. Kenny Anderson stole Jason Kidd's
pass, then Adrian Griffin and Doug Overton double-teamed Rex
Chapman into a wacky launch that ended up behind the backboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to switch to another guy but they had gone to
Rex the last three times and I decided to stay on him,'' Griffin
said. ``He had already hit one big shot and I would rather have a
big man shuck up a 3-pointer than Rex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to our success is defense. I have confidence in our
offense and the only time our offense looks bad is when we aren't
playing any defense. We have had an up-and-down season, with one
guy in and one guy out. But once we get everyone healthy, we can
hold them on defense.''

ELDEST FAXON ONE OF GAME'S CLASS ACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His long and splendid life took shape during a time of
tremendous suffering as he bore witness to The Depression and a
bloody world war. Perhaps that helps explain why Ray Faxon is not
afraid to express that priceless human quality called gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   At 92, Faxon still delights with a sharp mind, a terrific sense
of humor, and old-school manners that make it easy for him to say
thank you. That he was able to do the latter with a generous gift
to the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund shows that he also possesses
a memory that he cherishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf has been very good to me. Very good to the Faxon family.
I'm very happy to do this,'' said the patriarch of one of New
England's most famous golfing families. ``I've been wanting to do
this for a while, and I'm happy to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   What he did was present the Ouimet Fund with the largest single
gift in its 50-year history: $230,000, to endow scholarships for
Ouimet Scholars from Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wonderful moment for us and the Faxon family,'' said Walter
Lankau, president of the Ouimet Fund, though the gentleman who
shrugged off bone-chilling weather to make the trip from his Cape
home to the group's offices in Weston deflected such praise. It was
the least he could do, said Faxon, whose name may sound familiar
because his grandson Brad is a well-known member of the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far different world when Faxon was a boy in Mattapan in
the 1920s. He attended Boston Latin and loved hockey, but stumbled
into golf the old-fashioned way: ``My father started me in golf. I
loved it from the first time I picked up a club.''
</P>
<P>
   The passion only intensified after two summers at the
Hyannisport caddie camp. Still, if not for a stroke of good fortune
while thumbing a ride on Cape Cod, Faxon may not have had the life
he has had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thumbing to Wianno (another stately private club) when a
guy named Forrest Norris picked me up,'' he recalled. ``We struck
up a conversation about golf. I told him I wanted to start a caddie
camp at Wianno, and he told me he was building a golf course in
Osterville.'' It led to a job offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `They said 20 trucks went in with loam, but I only
saw 12. I need you to keep count,' '' said Faxon, laughing
heartily. ``So that's what I did all summer: I counted trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he also witnessed the creation of a Donald Ross gem _
Norris's course was Oyster Harbors _ and it reinforced his desire
to run a caddie camp.
</P>
<P>
   The vision was realized the next summer at Woods Hole, and
within a few years, Faxon and his brother George had camps at
Wianno and Coonamesset (now called Cape Cod Country Club). It was a
glorious time, a part of his life he wouldn't trade for anything.
In fact, at one point he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Faxon was just out of Boston University, working as a ``board
boy'' for a Boston brokerage firm, carrying numbers in an apron and
posting them as stock prices were announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked if I could have the summer off to go to the caddie
camps,'' said Faxon, who laughs when he recalls the response. ``My
boss looked at me and said, `You're either a stockbroker or you're
not.' So I quit and got a job teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   With summers off, he was devoted to his caddie camps (by now
Wianno was his base) until the 1930s gave way to the 1940s and
World War II. Faxon was drafted into the Navy and though he didn't
know it at the time, there would be no more caddie camps to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war, golf carts were more prominent,'' he said, a
hint of sadness in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   With no reason to have summers off, Faxon returned to being a
stockbroker, an occupation that afforded him a comfortable life,
thanks to his gift for numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through golf,'' he said, ``I made so many wonderful contacts,
people who wanted to see me do well. I joined Woods Hole and got a
lot of help from the members.''
</P>
<P>
   He settled in Milton and made sure he introduced his children
(Brad Sr., Linwood, and Jane) to the game that had enriched his
life. Each child went on to win a club championship at Woods Hole
(Jane Welch is the reigning women's champion) and all of them
embraced the game. Grandchildren Brad Jr. and Tracy Welch (1998
WGAM Association champion) have made their names as well, but Faxon
will take no credit for Brad's success on Tour. His only advice to
his grandson? ``When he went to college (Furman), I told him to
take a course in economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Faxon laughed at the recollection. ``He listened, too. He's
a good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   From pretty good stock, it seems, for Ray Faxon is proof that
some people understand the notion of giving back to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Playing favorites
</P>
<P>
   For a group that is renowned for its conservative manners, the
US Golf Association got rather liberal with its invitations to this
summer's gala at Pebble Beach. The special exemptions into the US
Open read like a Who's Who of pro golf (Tom Watson, Curtis Strange,
Greg Norman) until you get to the name Aaron Baddeley. Pushing the
18-year-old amateur from Australia past go and right onto the first
tee is a surprising move, and not a fair one, it says here.
Granted, he won his country's Open championship two months ago.
(Prediction: In a short time, Baddeley will be a more polished
player than Sergio Garcia, two years his junior.) A spot in the
Masters is one thing because the event is an invitational and will
forever be linked to amateur golf thanks to Bobby Jones. But the US
Open is quite another. Only one other amateur (Jay Sigel, 1980) has
received a special exemption into the US Open, so the invite to
Baddeley is eye-opening. None of the PGA Tour winners last year who
must still face a grueling 36-hole June qualifier to earn an Open
spot can be seeing this as a good thing . . . The USGA isn't the
only golf group dishing out invitations to players barely removed
from Saturday morning cartoons. Twin sisters Aree and Naree
Wongluekiet have accepted sponsor's exemptions into the LPGA Tour's
Nabisco Championship March 23-26. The phenoms from Thailand live in
Bradenton, Fla., train and go to school at the David Leadbetter
Golf Academy, and dominate the girls' junior golf scene in the US.
And they won't turn 14 until May 1. They have combined to win 7 of
10 American Junior Golf Association events since last May (Aree is
the reigning US Girls' Junior champion) and though they perhaps are
ready to test LPGA Tour waters, the situation is not without its
concerns. GolfWeek reported that Nabisco tournament officials
received a letter on IMG stationary that said the twins would be
interested in exemptions to the event, a situation that, while not
an infraction, makes many uncomfortable. Agents lining up
13-year-olds? . . . Word surfaced late Thursday that Michael Jordan
had asked out of next week's AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, an
event in which he would have most certainly been paired with Tiger
Woods. It would have been a circus atmosphere, no doubt, but the
show goes on as Woods attempts to win his sixth straight PGA Tour
event. Apparently Jordan thought it would give the wrong impression
if he were to jump into such a high-profile golf event right after
becoming part-owner of an NBA franchise . . . For the second
straight year, the Ouimet Fund's annual dinner will feature as
guest speaker the US Ryder Cup captain. Ben Crenshaw did the honors
last winter; this year it will be Strange, who will lead the US
squad at The Belfry in September 2001. Strange will receive the
Francis Ouimet Award for Lifelong Contributions to Golf March 23 at
the Boston Marriott/Copley Place Hotel. For information, call

ADAMS ENJOYING BUD BOWL I 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He strode purposefully across the dais to the podium .
. . oops, he almost stumbled into it, as if one last cruel, random
misstep were going to stop him just shy of the goal he had pursued
for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   He disappeared from view momentarily, then stood at the
microphone for almost an hour, never once removing his overcoat and
scarf, as if he were an interloper in hostile territory, expecting
to be ordered to leave any second.
</P>
<P>
   He still didn't quite get it, still didn't quite comprehend what
the National Football League finally was telling him after all
these years:
</P>
<P>
   This, Bud, is for you.
</P>
<P>
   This entire hotel function room, this entire city, this entire
week he thought he might never see from the inner sanctum, belong
to him. At 77, Bud Adams isn't at the Super Bowl, he's in the Super
Bowl. When his Tennessee Titans clash with the St. Louis Rams in
the Georgia Dome, it will mark the 34th rendition of the NFL
championship game _ and the first one Adams hasn't experienced
vicariously.
</P>
<P>
   One of the founding fathers of the American Football League in
1960, he is no longer its only floundering father. He's the last of
the eight AFL originals _ who through various permutations have
come to be known as the New England Patriots, New York Jets, San
Diego Chargers, Kansas City Chiefs, Denver Broncos, Buffalo Bills,
Oakland Raiders, and Titans _ to reach the summit since the upstart
league reached a truce with the NFL (1966) and eventually was
absorbed into it (1970).
</P>
<P>
   It has taken Adams four decades, three cities, two states, two
nicknames, six stadiums, millions in litigation, sundry mistakes,
and incalculable aggravation to get it just right.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing was clear when he flew in from his Houston base
four days ago to relish this monument of excess firsthand. He's
still an original, still an iconoclast, still the swashbuckler
whose daring and directness helped coopt the NFL's sovereignty.
Perhaps the maverick package is best symbolized by the shaggy black
and mostly white coiff that blankets his ears and descends to his
neck. To heck with appearances and convention, it seems to say. I'm
going through a bad hair life because that's what I want to do. And
by golly, I'm going to have fun along the way, no matter how much
it irritates you. Or me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my voice sounds a little harsh,'' he croaked into the
microphone Thursday, ``I think with all the excitement, I picked up
a little Houston virus.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that's an improvement over the Houston plague he never
quite got over.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Homing in
</P>
<P>
   He founded the AFL almost the same way he found Houston _ as a
lark. Kenneth Stanley ``Bud'' Adams is one-fourth Cherokee Indian
but mostly blueblood. He grew up in a world of privilege, the son
of Oklahoma oil man Boots Adams. But he was never idly rich. He
played football at the University of Kansas, served as an aviation
engineer in World War II, and soon after being discharged in 1946
found his plane grounded by fog in Houston. And he never left,
diversifying his portfolio into an empire that now encompasses 15
businesses and establishing roots with his wife, Nancy, by
purchasing a house in 1952 where the couple still lives. In the
more than half-century since he decided, what the heck, he was
going to stay right where his plane touched down in the nation's
fourth-largest city, he has acquired a reputation as a wine
connoisseur, an art collector, a tycoon, a philanthropist, and an
infidel.
</P>
<P>
   That blemish is an outgrowth of the flier he took on football.
In 1959, he invited another thirtysomething child of wealth, Lamar
Hunt, over from Dallas, and in the basement of Adams's River Oaks
home, the two decided, ``Say, why don't we give this football gig a
try?'' They threw in $25,000 each for franchises _ Hunt for the
Dallas Texans, Adams for the Houston Oilers _ and eventually
rounded up six other partners to do likewise. Those included fellow
scions like Barron Hilton, whose family was into hotels, and Ralph
Wilson, whose family was into cars. They also found room for the
hoi polloi, such as Boston fuel company executive Billy Sullivan,
for whom $25,000 represented a fortune in risk. They took their
chances of toppling the NFL monolith so seriously that they gave
themselves two nicknames _ the Foolish Club and the Crazy Eights.
</P>
<P>
   The first AFL draft was held in Minneapolis _ which was supposed
to join the new order but instead accepted an NFL expansion
franchise _ and it was such a sophisticated enterprise, Adams
recalled, ``that we took Street &AMP; Smith's, cut out the listings of
players by position, put them into a hat, and drew the names.
Really. That was how we drafted. That was how we got Blanda.''
</P>
<P>
   George Blanda, that is, the ancient quarterback who turned the
Oilers into an instant power. In historical hindsight, that fact is
often overlooked. While much has been made of Adams's Super Bowl
drought, the oil driller hit gushers right away as an owner. His
Oilers won the first two AFL championship games and lost the third
in overtime to Hunt's Texans, who celebrated their supremacy by
resurfacing the next season as the Kansas City Chiefs _ with none
of the grief Adams would encounter when he took the Oilers to
Tennessee some three decades later.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the oranizations weren't as structured as we were,''
said Adams. ``I'd hired a personnel man, John Green of the St.
Louis Cardinals, before the first draft, and we were a bit ahead of
everyone else. I think that's what helped us. But parity came
pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Adams proudly recounts a litany of AFL success that
didn't end: ``In 10 years, we were in the playoffs five times,
played in four championship games, and won two of them.''
</P>
<P>
   And eventually helped beat the NFL into capitulation by engaging
in industrial espionage _ hiding players from the competition,
stashing them in hotel rooms for negotiations in the middle of the
night _ and improvising a survival plan. Whatever it took, the AFL
would try it. The times may have been lean, but they were always
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more fun,'' said Adams, ``because you could do more
things. There were no restrictions _ and no agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Guile was the major wherewithal in negotiations. Adams recalls
that in his office, he had a large desk, and in one of the drawers,
he'd keep stacks of $1 bills, each topped by a lone $100 bill.
During contract talks with a prospective recruit, he'd open the
drawer, pretending to look for something, and the bug-eyed player
would peer over his shoulder, spot the apparent riches, and say,
``I want some of that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Adams would sit up and reply, ``Well, that's what we're here
for. Let's talk contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The coin of the realm was relative. ``Whatever they wanted in
order to sign,'' he said. ``Cattle . . . girls . . . cars . . .
We'd give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little loose with that word,'' said the man who either
slept through or more likely ignored the political correctness
movement. ``If they wanted dates, we'd find them. But these were
good girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the merger, and the split into the American and
National Football Conferences, and the lawyers and the agents and
the big business.
</P>
<P>
   And the dry wells in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Close but . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers' endeavors weren't a complete waste, but that only
made the frustration more gnawing. Houston made it to the brink of
the Super Bowl twice, reaching the AFC Championship game in 1979
and '80, only to be eclipsed by the Pittsburgh Steelers'
juggernaut. Then it reached the playoffs seven straight years,
1987-93, ``and in four of those years,'' said Adams, ``I thought we
were going to make the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers, of course, came up empty every time, reaching their
nadir with a 41-38 overtime loss to Wilson's Buffalo Bills in the
1992-93 wild-card round as they suffered the worst collapse in
playoff history, squandering a 35-3 third-quarter advantage. There
was one last gasp, a 28-20 loss to Hunt's Chiefs in the divisional
round the following season, ``and then we were rebuilding,'' said
Adams.
</P>
<P>
   So that was it for the Oilers. And eventually, that was all for
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bags packed
</P>
<P>
   For all his derring-do, Adams wasn't in football as a charitable
writeoff. As the NFL's popularity, income, and salaries
skyrocketed, he found himself stuck with what he considered
inadequate homes in his adopted hometown.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was never more than a tenant _ first at a municipal
high school field, Jeppesen Stadium, then at Rice University's
stadium, and for 29 fruitless years, 1968-96, in the Astrodome,
which was owned by the baseball Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rented from that baseball guy,'' Adams said. ``At one time,
we had the smallest stadium in the league _ 40,000 for baseball,
50,000 for football.''
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't going to get to the Super Bowl with that
arrangement. He needed revenue from parking and signage and
concessions to compete in the marketplace, and he discovered that
Houston just wasn't going to give it to him. He pitched for a domed
stadium of his own to Mayor Bob Lanier, offered to put up $50
million and then $85 million of his own money. But the mayor said
Houston wasn't interested in another dome and he wouldn't support
it, wouldn't even put it to a vote among the Harris County
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Adams was concerned, that gave him carte blanche to
begin checking the real estate ads, and he eventually settled upon
Nashville. But the city was leery, having just built an arena in
hopes of luring a pro hockey or basketball franchise, then being
used as leverage by the New Jersey Devils, who got a better deal to
stay at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Mayor (Phil) Bredesen of Nashville,'' said Adams. ``I
said, `This is Bud Adams, and if you build us a stadium, I'll move
down there.' He said, `You're not Bud Adams and I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't play these pranks.' And he hung up. Thirty minutes
later, he called back and said, `Bud, I apologize. I just wanted to
make sure it was you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That exchange might be apocryphal _ Bredesen doesn't recall it
that way _ but the former mayor does concede, ``I was somewhat
skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   With typical swagger, self-righteousness, and disregard for
public sentiment, Adams openly courted Nashville. In accordance
with Bredesen's wishes, he signed an agreement of exclusivity Nov.
16, 1995, guaranteeing that the Oilers would not negotiate with any
other city _ including Houston _ while Nashville built him a
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   That sold Bredesen on Adams's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, we didn't know if the deal would or wouldn't
get done,'' said Bredesen, ``but it was clear they were dead
serious about relocating.''
</P>
<P>
   And dead meat in Houston. Adams's public posturing may have been
admirably straightforward, but it put him and the Oilers through
hell.
</P>
<P>
   Win-lose situation
</P>
<P>
   `Houston tried to sue me,'' said Adams. ``They hired John
O'Quinn, one of those boot-heel lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams won in court. But his team suffered on the field, playing
before 15,131 fans _ a typical crowd in its farewell season _ on
Dec. 15, 1996, its Astrodome finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a free agent that offseason,'' said left guard Bruce
Matthews, who has been with the franchise for 17 years. ``I didn't
talk to other teams because I wanted to stay in Houston. Three or
four days after I signed, I found out we were moving. I really
resented that. But I came to appreciate it as the best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL wasn't so easily persuaded. Alarmed that the Oilers were
leaving the nation's 11th-largest television market for what now
ranks as the 30th, and that two years earlier, the Rams had fled
Los Angeles (No. 2) for St. Louis (No. 21), commissioner Paul
Tagliabue took steps to keep the big cities in the big picture. Now
the league will help subsidize up to 50 percent of new stadiums for
large-market franchises to stay put. Adams endorses the plan, even
if it's too late to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to keep up with the Joneses,'' he said,
``you'd better get a new stadium built.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams finally did this year as Nashville unveiled 67,000-seat,
$285 million Adelphia Stadium, a sparkling companion piece for the
Titans' $80 million practice palace. But during the construction
process, the Tennessee Oilers weren't much more eagerly embraced
than their Houston forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Adams obliged Gov. Don Sundquist, a Memphis native, and
played his home games in that city's Liberty Bowl. He hadn't
counted on the resentment factor that lingered after FedEx chairman
Fred Smith lobbied vigorously _ and futilely _ for an expansion
team in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I called and told him of our intentions,'' said Bredesen,
``there was the longest silence on the phone I've ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Adams learned a painful geographical lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee is a hell of a long state, I'll tell you,'' he said.
``I used to think Beaumont to Houston was long. It's not as long as
Knoxville to Memphis.''
</P>
<P>
   It was so long to Memphis after one dismal year. In 1998, the
Oilers got closer to the gold mine when they used Vanderbilt's
Dudley Field in Nashville as their base.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at last, has come a season of wholesale change and success.
Adams gave the team a new nickname because he found that ``Oilers''
was a hard sell in Tennessee, new uniforms, and plush new
accommodations. The most crucial element in the Titans' turnaround
after three straight 8-8 seasons, he believes, is the support of
the fans who weekly fill Adelphia and have been voted the best in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to congratulate the fans in Tennessee,'' he said, ``and
the fans in Houston who support us. The (Houston) Chronicle ran a
poll that asked if people wanted us to win, wanted us to lose, or
didn't give a damn; 70 percent supported us.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams should know, because he still picks up the Houston paper
every morning on his doorstep. One thing he hasn't changed is his
address. And he finds he can get around without a bulletproof vest
_ not that he'd wear one if he needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press treats me like a pariah,'' he said, ``but I'm not
afraid to walk around anywhere in town. People come up to me and
say, `Hi, Bud.' I think, generally speaking, the fans have been
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   In two years, Adams will return the favor. That's when the NFL
returns to Houston, which has received an expansion franchise _ and
the promise of a $366 million domed stadium _ now that Lanier is
out of office. The total cost for new owner Bob McNair, including
expansion fees and payroll, will be in excess of $1.2 billion.
Adams would still be around if the city had come up with $146
million.
</P>
<P>
   The expatriate expresses no grudges and in fact said he'll buy
tickets to the newcomer's games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to see them get a football team,'' said Adams. ``Bob
McNair paid a lot of money. I don't have that myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He was joking, of course, laughing all the way to the jackpot.
His initial $25,000 investment has appreciated several
thousandfold. And last week after a 33-14 upset at Jacksonville, he
received something priceless _ the Lamar Hunt Trophy, presented by
his co-conspirator of four decades ago, which is awarded to the AFC
champion.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time, Adams figured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said, `We're going to get there someday,' '' he said,
``but I'm getting up there in years. I was hoping I wouldn't have
to wheel up to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't, but he'll still be riding high. On his terms, of
course.

NASCAR AWAITS DEBUT OF EARNHARDT JR. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR will unveil its 2000 season when the green flag drops on
the Daytona 500 Feb. 20 at Daytona International Speedway. While
there will be much anticipation over the new cars, new teams, and
new drivers, there will be a palpable buzz over the long-awaited
arrival of Dale Earnhardt Jr. for his rookie campaign on the NASCAR
Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Earnhardt attended the Busch Grand National
awards banquet in Beverly Hills, Calif., where he collected a
series-record $1,680,598 for his second consecutive series title,
driving the No. 3 AC Delco Chevrolet owned by his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a couple of years ago when they were talking to me
about driving the 3 car, and I just couldn't wait to get the
opportunity,'' said Earnhardt Jr. ``I knew if I got the
opportunity, I could make everybody real proud of me. Everyone in
this sport should be proud of the NASCAR Busch Series, and the
opportunity it presents in the world of auto racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr., 25, became only the fourth driver in Busch Series
history to win back-to-back titles. He earned the praise of his
father, who will field the No. 8 Budweiser Chevrolet for his son to
drive this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sleeps half the day and stays up half the night working on
his computer, but damn, he sure can drive a race car,'' said
Earnhardt Sr. ``What can a dad say about his son? I'm proud of you.
You're carrying on the Earnhardt name.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. has had his clashes with Busch competitors,
including an on-track incident with Todd Bodine that knocked
Earnhardt's car out of last year's race at Pikes Peak, Colo.
Afterward, a fuming Dale Jr. called the balding Bodine a ``cue
ball-headed fool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go up there next year in Winston Cup,'' said Bodine,
offering Earnhardt a bit of advice, ``you've gotta be careful what
you say, because those bald-headed fools over there ain't quite as
nice as I can be about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Winston Cup is a whole new ballgame for me than the Busch
Series,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``So I don't know really what to
expect. In that sense it's hard to say how we'll do, but we're
ready to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin on the mend
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin continues his rapid recovery from back surgery (a
lumbar fusion) Nov. 22. Known as perhaps the toughest driver on the
Winston Cup circuit, Martin endured excruciating pain to complete
his run last season in the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus. Now eight
weeks into his recovery, Martin made his first public appearance
last week in Winston-Salem, N.C., and said, ``I feel like a
brand-new person. My strength is coming back, my stamina is coming
back, I'm pain-free, and I'm really excited about what my future
holds for me. I had no idea I was in as much pain as I was and how
much it was really ruining the quality of my life, so I'm feeling
good and excited.'' As for his plans for Daytona? ``I don't have to
be in the race car until Feb. 11 (for Bud Pole qualifications), and
this is something that will affect me for the rest of my life, and
that's why I followed doctor's orders. I didn't have a choice when
I broke my knee this summer, I kept digging, and I'll have a bum
knee forever because of that, but I'm not going to do it with my
back.'' . . . Earnhardt Sr. also is on the mend after back surgery
Dec. 17. His recovery was expected to take six weeks, leaving car
owner Richard Childress to employ substitute drivers Jim Sauter and
Mike Dillon to help shake down the 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
``The most important thing is that Dale Earnhardt gets 100 percent
healthy,'' Childress said. ``He knows that we want him back in the
race car as soon as he is ready, but not before then.'' . . . Buddy
Baker, a former driver turned TV analyst, proved he still has it
when he posted the fastest lap of the day (188.708 miles per hour)
during a recent Ford testing session at Talladega, Ala. Baker was
summoned by Team Penske to substitute for Rusty Wallace, who had a
schedule conflict. ``For a team like Penske and Rusty Wallace to
give you a call to come down and test their car, it helps me in the
television end of what I do,'' Baker said. ``It also makes you feel
a lot younger to get out there and run and know that you can still
be competitive.'' . . . The Indy Racing League got under way
yesterday with its season-opening Delphi Indy 200 at Walt Disney
World Speedway in Orlando, Fla. Robbie Buhl, starting far back in
the 22d slot, won the race, which marked the reunion of former CART
driver Al Unser Jr. and IRL car owner Rick Galles, who will field
an IRL entry this season for the two-time Indy 500 winner. ``This
team has been running in the IRL now for three years, and they
definitely know the system,'' said Unser, whose first Indy 500
victory in 1992 came with Galles Racing. ``I think that is to my
benefit, and I feel very comfortable with the overall organization
of our program.''

DAVENPORT TOO MUCH FOR HINGIS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ Arrest that woman!
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis should have dialed 000 for the cops Saturday
afternoon and reported Lindsay Davenport for breaking and entering.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe dialing M for Murder would have been a better idea. Alfred
Hitchcock, who made a movie on that theme, would have been
delighted by what unfolded in Rod Laver Arena.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, Hingis has regarded the principal
tennis pen of Australia as ``my home,'' its green asphalt floor
``my back yard.'' She felt safe and secure in this Melbourne abode
beside the Yarra River, and invincible, having shooed 27 straight
potential troublemakers away from her doorstep while putting three
Australian Open championship cups on her knickknack shelf.
</P>
<P>
   No one had owned this habitat so completely, although Evonne
Goolagong set up championship housekeeping three straight years,
1974-76, on the grass floor at since-abandoned Kooyong. Goolagong
and rangy Margaret Court, the champ seven straight years (1960-66),
are Aussies. Hingis of Switzerland has been the prime alien tenant,
last evicted in 1996, a quarterfinalist, and then she was a toddler
of 15.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ogre named Davenport didn't even bother to knock.
She began busting up the joint immediately, violating the sanctity
of Hingis's castle, breaking in and burgling the crown jewels in a
6-1, 7-5 title triumph. Davenport had flames in her eyes,
reminiscent of the old saloon-wrecker Carry Nation. But instead of
an ax such as Carry wielded to smash doors and splinter
furnishings, Davenport swung a racket. She swung as though it were
a sledgehammer _ and the kid Hingis, who has drank the elixir of
victory for years, was scared of this prohibitionist, trying to
pound her dry.
</P>
<P>
   Dare we call Long Lindsay, 6 feet 3 inches of firepower, an
ogre? A bit rude, perhaps, for a well-bred, generous, and sporting
lady of 23 who has actually graduated from high school, and whose
California dreaming has resulted in US Open (1998), Wimbledon
(1999), and now an Australian championship, all three on the loss
of zero sets.
</P>
<P>
   But ogre she is in the mind of Hingis _ and she occupies a very
large place in that otherwise highly confident mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to play you,'' Hingis offered along with the
congratulatory handshake. The kid feels like Macaulay Culkin in
``Home Alone,'' with the barbarians at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Everything she said about Davenport could be translated as ``You
intimidate and worry me'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsay kills you right away, no mistakes . . . no compromise
. . . bang boom, she hits line, line . . . she doesn't give me
chances . . . it is very nervous playing her . . . mentally she is
very tough . . . she's taller, bigger, everything . . . she pushes
me, she pressures me like nobody else . . . she hits winners even
off my first serve . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But how would you feel if somebody about a foot taller and twice
as strong was throwing knockout punches at you constantly _ husky
groundies that explode at your baseline _ and moving very well even
with a gimpy left leg, serving 100 m.p.h. when she needs it?
</P>
<P>
   Davenport has now beat up on Hingis four straight, six out of
seven, to lead the rivalry, 10-7. Medusa, the Women's Tennis
Association computer, continues to list Hingis No. 1 (she was the
5-2 favorite with Melbourne bookies at the Jan. 17 starting gate),
and Davenport No. 2 _ but Medusa needs a saliva test.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Davenport had just about razed Hingis's house. She was
stripping the shingles, leading, 6-1, 5-1, 30-15, after 44 minutes.
The foundation was buckling under her assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unbeatable _ by anybody,'' said Davenport. ``I can't
believe I was playing so well. Two points away, though, and I
tensed a little, deflated a little.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hingis had called the cops then, they might have showed up in
time to rescue her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the clock,'' said Hingis, ``I thought, `Oh, my
God, people had to pay for seeing this match.' I wanted to get past
an hour.'' She did, by five minutes, firming up to win four
straight games to 5-5, whereupon Davenport lost a point on serve,
and felt needy.
</P>
<P>
   Needy enough to belt out the last eight points. ``But I felt
fine then,'' she said. ``I knew I could hold, and then break her.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis helped with a wild double fault at 5-6 to 0-15. ``I got
almost too excited,'' she said. ``But you know mentally Lindsay is
very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mental muscle is a quality usually associated with Hingis, but
apparently not when Davenport looms across the living room,
rummaging through drawers, cleaning out the silverware.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport says she has coveted the Aussie Open since crashing
the third round as a 16-year-old qualifier in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the hard courts, the friendliness of the people,'' she
said. ``I think it's the best-run of the majors. No hassles.''
</P>
<P>
   She was the hassler, the home-demolisher, the dispossessor.
Laver Arena belongs to the intruder. Breaking and entering,
Davenport had made it a haunted house for Hingis.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The minimalist stage is set for super bowl xxxiv.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's game should be shorn of all capital letters and
pretentious Roman numerals, for it most decidedly is a downsized
duel.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans and St. Louis Rams, two teams that in the
recent past forsook megamarkets for megadeals, will kick off at
6:18 in the Georgia Dome, with their caravan of disciples _ who
undoubtedly arrived in compact cars _ in tow.
</P>
<P>
   The transplants have followed similar paths downhill to reach
the top. After a half-century in the nation's second-largest
metropolis, Los Angeles, the Rams headed for the heartland _ and
the No. 21 television market _ in 1995. Two years later, the
Houston Oilers erased 37 years of history in the nation's
fourth-largest city and No. 11 TV market as they escaped to the
Volunteer State, where their new address is listed as No. 30 in the
Nielsen parade.
</P>
<P>
   Each team got a honey of a stadium deal as their suitors tried
to prove that smaller is better. But they also tampered with the
natural order of things _ and the network numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps reflecting this, the weather here has been apocalyptic
by the standards of the Gateway to the South, which has turned into
the Gateway to the South Pole this week, with snow, ice, and
sub-freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   But all that will be forgotten once the opponents step indoors
for an intriguing match between teams that are considered upstarts
because of more than just their locales.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were coming off 5-11 and 4-12 seasons this year under
reborn coach Dick Vermeil, who at age 61 had decided to rekindle
the flame _ moderately this time _ after leading the Philadelphia
Eagles to the 1981 Super Bowl, then taking a 14-year hiatus from
coaching not long after that because of burnout.
</P>
<P>
   With expectations hardly higher this season, the Rams rolled to
a 13-3 record and through their overmatched opponents by an average
score of 33-12. Kurt Warner, the quarterback straight from
oblivion, otherwise known as the Arena Football League and NFL
Europe, supposedly was thrown in over his head when the designated
starter, Trent Green, was lost for the year with a preseason knee
injury. Warner proceeded to become the NFL's Most Valuable Player
and the second man ever to throw 40 touchdown passes. ``He's the
story of the NFL, really,'' said Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Warner wasn't even necessarily the MVP on his own team.
That honor probably belongs to Marshall Faulk, who became the
second running back in history (joining the 49ers' Roger Craig) to
accumulate more than 1,000 yards each rushing and receiving and who
set an NFL record for total offense from scrimmage (2,429 yards).
In addition, wide receiver Isaac Bruce returned to breakaway form
after two seasons of hamstring problems, catching 77 passes for
1,165 yards. Az-Zahir Hakim (37 catches, 677 yards) was a dynamic
long-distance complement, and Torry Holt (47-666) wasn't far
behind. Pro Bowl tackle Orlando Pace anchored an immovable
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' defense thus lost out in the headlines, though not in
effectiveness. End Kevin Carter and cornerback Todd Lyght, Pro
Bowlers both, set the standard that was on display last week, when
the St. Louis defense was positively heroic while the offense
sputtered in an 11-6 victory over the gritty Tampa Bay Buccaneers
for the NFC title.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the high-profile Rams have been installed as 7-point
favorites. And truth be told, that's just the way the Titans want
it.
</P>
<P>
   After three straight 8-8 seasons, the Titans have reveled in
their underdog role this year, real or imagined, while compiling an
unlikely 13-3 record and then toppling Buffalo, Indianapolis, and
Jacksonville for the AFC crown.
</P>
<P>
   A fast, ferocious defense has been their calling card, with
rookie Pro Bowl end Jevon Kearse and veteran strong safety Blaine
Bishop leading the charge. The offense's mandate has been to not
gum up the works, and it has succeeded under the resourceful
direction of mobile quarterback Steve McNair. The major force is
Pro Bowl running back Eddie George, a battering ram who the Titans
hope will take the term literally. Another strong effort from
George, who has gouged out 354 yards during the playoffs after a
1,304-yard regular season, will be essential if McNair's favorite
target, wide receiver Yancey Thigpen, is unable to go because of a
hairline fracture of the right foot.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the stars of this modest extravaganza. The coaches
believe you can throw out the demographics when these two teams
play.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-effusive Vermeil said, ``I can't tell you how exciting
it is and what a pleasure it is to be here representing the city of
St. Louis.'' Then again, he'd be equally enthused about
representing the city of Podunk.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart, Titans coach Jeff Fisher, won't hear of this
game being dismissed as the Hee Haw Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only heard it referred to as Super Bowl XXXIV,'' he said,
supplying the traditional emphasis on magnitude. ``I think it's a
great example and a tremendous opportunity for anybody to make it
to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's usually no small achievement. Except for Sunday
night.

NEW CEO WILL HAVE MORE CLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Olympic Committee could name its new _ and decidedly more
powerful _ chief executive officer by next weekend. The executive
committee could choose from as many as three candidates from a
group of finalists that reportedly includes Marla Messing (who
headed last summer's women's World Cup), Colorado developer Harry
Frampton, and Pete Dawkins, the Heisman Trophy winner from West
Point who is now a New York financier. The corporate-style CEO,
who'll replace executive director Dick Schultz, will have complete
day-to-day control of the reformed USOC. The president will
essentially become board chairman, dealing with broad policy
issues. Top candidates to succeed incumbent Bill Hybl are Wellesley
attorney Paul George, who was the team chef de mission at the
Nagano Games, and fellow USOC vice president Sandra Baldwin. ``I
haven't printed up bumper stickers yet,'' said George, ``but I'm
definitely going to run.''
</P>
<P>
   A host of cities
</P>
<P>
   The list of contenders to host the 2008 Summer Games is up to
eight. Beijing is the front-runner in a field that includes Paris;
Toronto; Istanbul; Havana; Bangkok; Osaka, Japan; and Seville,
Spain. Buenos Aires; Cairo; Cape Town; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
could also join the chase by Tuesday's deadline . . . International
Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch says he'll be
delighted to come back to the United States next month and be
grilled by FBI agents about the Salt Lake City payoff scandal. ``We
have nothing to hide,'' said Samaranch, who testified before
Congress last month. The feds, who've already interviewed seven IOC
members, say Samaranch isn't a target . . . Great leap upward for
Irina Slutskaya. She suddenly became the favorite to win the
women's world figure skating title after knocking off Michelle Kwan
to claim the Grand Prix title with a stunning long program that
featured two triple-triples including the unprecedented lutz-loop.
The 20-year-old Slutskaya, who didn't even make the Russian team
last year, got married, slimmed down and cranked up her jumping.
Even if Kwan hadn't doubled two triples, Slutskaya still would have
beaten her _ she got a 6.0 and three 5.9 technical marks. The bar
keeps going up for the men, too. Russian teenager Evgeny Plushenko
landed a quad-triple-double combo to beat Canada's Elvis Stojko for
the men's title after two-time world champ Alexei Yagudin pulled
out with a broken boot before the event. The skaters, by the way,
hate the new finals format, which makes the top four do a second
(and different) long program. Why? So TV viewers won't be bored . .
. You can fit the entire US team for next weekend's world
all-around speedskating championships in Milwaukee into the back
seat of a cab. Jennifer Rodriguez, fiance KC Boutiette, and Derek
Parra are the only qualifiers for the Americans, who haven't won a
medal since Eric Flaim took the 1988 men's title. Germany's eternal
Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann, upset by teammate Anni Friesinger at the
recent European meet, will be gunning for her ninth title. Rintje
Ritsma of the Netherlands will be chasing his fourth . . . The US
team for the world short track championships in March will be
chosen the weekend after next at Walpole's Iorio Arena. Top local
contenders include Brookline's Dan Weinstein, Natick's Caroline
Hallissey, Lincoln's Penelope Lang, Arlington's Sarah Lang,
Belmont's Chris Needham, and Newton's Tracy Northup.
</P>
<P>
   Speeding-up process
</P>
<P>
   USA Track and Field types are crossing their fingers and hoping
that the wrong person doesn't win their Olympic marathon trials. If
next month's women's victor hasn't met the ``A'' standard of 2:33
(and only Libbie Hickman and Kristy Johnston have so far), the
Americans will get to send only one runner to Sydney, even if
others have gone sub-2:33. The men will have the same problem at
their May trials. Only David Morris and Joe LeMay have met the
``A'' standard of 2:14 . . . Why is Joan Benoit Samuelson trying
for another Olympic marathon 16 years after winning in Los Angeles?
``I'm qualified, I'm 42, this is the year 2000 and my kids have
supported me,'' said Samuelson, who hasn't run a marathon since New
York in 1998 and missed the US team last time. ``This will be my
last chance.'' . . . Missing the cut for Bela Karolyi's second
gymnastics boot camp next month is Atlanta gold medalist Dominique
Moceanu, who's still getting into shape after knee surgery,
parental problems (now patched up), and gym-switching (she's now in
Cincinnati). Karolyi invited only 15 of the 27 women from the
original group, including world teamers Vanessa Atler and Kristen
Maloney and Amy Chow, Moceanu's 1996 teammate. ``Nothing's going to
happen overnight,'' said Moceanu. ``If it's meant to be, it is.'' .
. . Another setback for gold-medal swimmer Amy Van Dyken, who had
surgery this month to remove scar tissue from the surgery she had
two years ago after tearing her rotator cuff in the weight room. If
all goes well, she figures to be back in the pool by March, five
months before the US Olympic trials. This time, though, Van Dyken
will swim only the 50 freestyle . . . Coincidence _ or karma? Six
years to the day after her henchmen kneecapped Nancy Kerrigan,
Tonya Harding skidded off an icy road recently and drove her pickup
into a ditch.

NO ROCKING ITALIAN BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Francesco de Angelis, the soft-spoken
skipper of Prada's Luna Rossa, maintained an air of polite reserve
when he was asked about Race 3 in the America's Cup challenger
finals and the war of attrition out on tempestuous Hauraki Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sailed very well,'' was about as bombastic as de Angelis
would get publicly in describing his sailing team's nearly perfect
performance Friday in the raging conditions that broke other
sailboats and even had spectators calling for help.
</P>
<P>
   AmericaOne, which withdrew from the race with a dangerously
damaged mast, had such a long list of breakage that, in a postrace
press conference, skipper Paul Cayard forgot a few things. After
enumerating the carnage _ a badly bruised bowman (Greg Prussia),
damaged mast ($400,000), torn spinnaker ($40,000), headsail washing
overboard (recovered) _ Cayard was reminded about his broken
batten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' he deadpanned, ``we broke a batten. That's so far
down my list I forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   While AmericaOne and Luna Rossa were staging Race 3 of the Louis
Vuitton finals, Team New Zealand took two boats out for a little
scrimmage, especially jibing and practicing downwind. But aboard
Black Magic the gear began to break, too, and when the Kiwi
spinnaker split like a silk stocking, the black boats scurried for
home.
</P>
<P>
   But through all the mayhem, sailing like a summer cruise, came
Luna Rossa (``Red Moon''), the handsome silver boat with the red
trim, sails trimmed like two shimmering silver blades, in the
30-knot-plus breezes and 6-foot seas.
</P>
<P>
   And when it was over, the usually reserved Italian sailors, let
loose among themselves, led by syndicate chief Patrizio Bertelli,
who chanted, ``Together! Together! For all, together!''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Prada's performance, de Angelis, who had never
match-raced before taking over as the team's skipper two years ago,
said, ``We are very proud to show to the world how we sail. We have
been waiting for a long time for such conditions. Everything on our
boat was very consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a well-known leader, but we are working together as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of his teammates say they might like to hear more
from de Angelis at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work as a team to sail perfectly,'' he said, ``maneuvering
the boat, making gybes and sail drops, and having nothing break.
That is team sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian skipper also pointed out that while AmericaOne
broached twice Friday, Prada has only broached twice in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never even close to broaching,'' said de Angelis,
speaking of the moment when a boat is overpowered by the wind and
thrown violently off course.
</P>
<P>
   So as heavy air was predicted for Saturday, the silver-suited
sailors of Prada were raring to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love to sail in these strong conditions,'' said Luca
Bontempelli, an Italian journalist who often translates Italian for
the English speaking press. ``They feel they have Cayard on the
edge of the ring and want another chance to push him down.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as he acknowledged that Cayard is still very popular
among Italians _ he won the Louis Vuitton Cup on Il Moro in 1992 _
de Angelis did suggest that it is perhaps time for a homegrown
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Cayard's request to Fiat president Giovanni Agnelli
for funds to help with his next Whitbread campaign, de Angelis
said, ``I think it is better for Italian money to be invested with
Italian sailors.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard won the last Whitbread around-the-world race, is
acknowledged as one of the world's best sailors, and is still
extremely popular in Italy. So his reaction to a Cayard-Agnelli
alliance is a sign of a growing pride among the Italians in their
role in world sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli, while acknowledging that his countrymen still stop
Cayard to ask for autographs, believes that the Prada team is proof
of a new age in Italian sailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very good for us when we won the Louis Vuitton Cup with
Cayard,'' he said. ``But it is time for an Italian team and Italian
skipper to win. That is even more important to Italian sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Cayard, speaking at a postrace news conference Friday,
conceded that Prada _ which was the first syndicate to arrive in
New Zealand _ was better prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been here the longest, and they have prepared their
boat the best,'' he said. ``They sailed great  &UR; today &LR; , and I
congratulate them for it.''
</P>
<P>
   To our readers: Because New Zealand is 18 hours ahead of US East
Coast time, all action takes place a day ahead (i.e. a Sunday noon
race there is taking place Saturday evening here). To avoid
confusion, all time references in America's Cup stories will
reflect when the events took place according to Eastern Standard
Time.

SCHOOL BACK IN FOR GLENN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He speaks now of needing structure and foundation. He's living
in Columbus, Ohio, spending time with his young son. He has gone
back to Ohio State to complete the requirements for a degree. He's
taking courses in history and business finance. He's due to finish
up the semester in March.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Terry Glenn also will soon begin working out
under Buckeye strength and conditioning coach Dave Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going to like the Terry Glenn that returns to the
Patriots,'' said Glenn. ``I'm going to be more focused than I've
ever been. I think I've learned from my experiences _ especially
the way the season ended _ what I need to do to get to the point
where I want to be in my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think going back to school is important right now. I
remember something Drew Bledsoe said about needing a foundation,
and I agree. I think I need that, too. Going back to school gives
me structure. I need to be at classes at a certain time. I need to
study and put my time into it. It's kind of weird being back, but I
still know some professors from when I was here before, and getting
to work out with Dave and the football team should be good for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn expects former Ohio State teammate Joey Galloway to be
working with him. Boston talk show callers like to suggest a
Glenn-for-Galloway swap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not,'' said Glenn. ``I want to spend my whole career in
New England. I don't want to be one of these guys who jumps from
team to team. I hope we can work out a long-term deal to stay
there. I'm comfortable with the people and the fans there. They've
been great to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was suspended by the Patriots for the final game of the
season. Coach Pete Carroll contended that Glenn broke team rules by
not showing up at the team hotel the Saturday before the game for
medical treatment of his flu symptoms. Glenn says he kept in
constant contact with team trainer Ron O'Neil, kept O'Neil informed
of his whereabouts and condition, and didn't break team rules.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was docked a week's pay and fined.
</P>
<P>
   His agent said he would never play for Carroll again. He won't
have to, at least in New England. Carroll was fired, and now Bill
Belichick has been named head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of Belichick bringing in Charlie Weis as offensive
coordinator excites Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my receivers coach my rookie year, when I caught 90
passes,'' said Glenn. ``I credit Charlie as much as anyone with
making that happen. When I came out of college and joined the team
that summer, Charlie brought me along slowly. I was a No. 1 draft
pick, but whereas some coaches would be tempted to make that high
draft pick a starter right away, Charlie said to me, `You're not
going to be a starter right away.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That summer in training camp, Vincent Brisby and Shawn
Jefferson were the starters. He told me this was the best thing for
me because I needed to earn it. I liked that about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Glenn suffered a hamstring pull, missed most of the
camp, and didn't get on the field until the third game of the 1996
season. Then he took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive scheme was great,'' said Glenn. ``If that's what
we're going back to, that would be unbelievable. I had my best
year, Drew had his best year, and we all had our best year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great system because it allows Drew to drop
back, look and see who's open, and throw them the ball rather than
this timing stuff where you wait for the break and throw the ball
to a spot,'' said Glenn. ``I think we all struggled with that. I
think going back to that will take some time because it'll be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is concerned about the receivers coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a new one, it would be my fourth coach in four
years,'' said Glenn. ``That's very important to a receiver, because
that's who you interact with the most. I'd love it if Bill keeps
Ivan Fears. Ivan and I had a very strong relationship that I'd like
to continue. I think I really connected with Ivan.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was told about a report that the team's other receivers
gave Fears a watch as a gift for putting up with Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' said Glenn. ``I think if
you asked Ivan which one of the receivers he had the best
relationship with, I'd be surprised if he didn't say me.''
</P>
<P>
   While he didn't have much interaction with Belichick in his one
season in New England, said Glenn, ``I respect him greatly. He's
always had nice things to say about me. I know that he won't take
any bull from anybody. He's pretty direct. I think that's what we
need here.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is on record as saying that Glenn will remain a
Patriot. He said he had a strong relationship with Glenn when he
was in New England in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very talented player,'' said the new Patriots coach.
``There are few receivers in the league with his ability.''
</P>
<P>
   War stories
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells looks to be the winner in the Patriots-Jets border
war, which, one suspects, isn't over. He held out for a No. 1 draft
pick and got it. He skillfully orchestrated the situation, making
the first call to Robert Kraft, ``mending fences,'' and then
negotiating and receiving everything he wanted. Of course, the
overall winner will be judged over time. The Jets must make proper
use of the Patriots' 16th overall pick (there is indication New
York may trade up with its first-rounders because it may not be
able to afford both). If Belichick brings the Patriots back to the
Super Bowl, then Kraft got the better of it. If Belichick can't,
and the Jets get a great player with the pick, Parcells will be
laughing and singing while driving down the causeway in Jupiter,
Fla., with the top down listening to the oldies. Kraft did give a
legitimate reason for caving in on the No. 1 pick by saying he
learned from the Robert Edwards situation. Edwards was a very good
pick by Bobby Grier who suffered a devastating knee injury and may
never play again. In other words, you never know with draft picks.
Three years ago, the Patriots gave up their superstar coach for
four draft picks and it wasn't worth it. The coach was more
important than the players. Kraft understands that now, and he's
chosen Belichick to prove his point . . . The two best coaches not
hired for head jobs: Gary Crowton, Chicago, and Mike Martz, St.
Louis. There are few more creative offensive minds in the NFL than
Crowton; he's a high-energy person and gained head coaching
experience at Louisiana Tech. Martz signed on with St. Louis as
Dick Vermeil's heir apparent, which was a good move; and he now
knows the players really well . . . Carroll's defensive
coordinator, Steve Sidwell, took off for Seattle, where he'll have
the same job with the Seahawks. After being told he probably won't
be able to bring any other ex-Patriot coaches with him, Sidwell
said, ``There are some outstanding coaches on that staff, and I
hope they're taken care of. Ray Hamilton, Ron Lynn, Bo Pelini,
Dwayne Walker all did outstanding jobs getting our defense ready.
They'd be an asset to any team they coach.'' Sidwell will be
reunited with Chris Canty. ``It should be interesting,'' said a
diplomatic Sidwell . . . Message to Belichick: Hire Steve Grogan as
quarterback coach . . . Carroll has done a lot to help his former
assistant coaches get work with other teams, according to one of
them. Carroll will take the year off, spend time with his family,
and then consider working next season. He has two years left on his
contract, worth more than $2 million. When he took over the Jets,
he signed a four-year deal and survived only one year. As one of
his former coaches put it, ``Pete's made a lot of money getting
fired.'' . . . One of the ex-player analysts on the national
networks had these observations about the Patriots: ``Willie
McGinest is a pretty decent speed rusher but he needs help with
pressure up the middle. Because quarterbacks are getting rid of the
ball so quickly these days, you need pressure up the middle to push
that pressure toward McGinest. Chad Eaton doesn't give you that.
He's a backup. The offensive line is very poor. (Todd) Rucci is
stiff; they get no push.'' . . . The feeling in Miami is that Dan
Marino retires soon, and he should hang it up because he can't make
many of the throws he used to make. It's not etched in stone that
Damon Huard is the heir apparent. The Dolphins will look around for
other quarterback candidates (Jeff George?). They are in decent
shape with the salary cap, about $5 million under the projected $62
million, though they do have two of their major offensive linemen _
center Tim Ruddy and left tackle Richmond Webb _ to sign . . .
Lenny Megliola of MetroWest News wrote a wonderful story about
former Patriot Ron Burton, who was recently diagnosed with cancer.
Burton, whose son is Channel 4 sports reporter Steve Burton, told
Megliola, ``I said to the doctor, `Give it to me straight.' He
said, `You've got cancer over 50 percent of your body. I give you
one to three years. There's no cure.' I went to my car and just
prayed and cried.'' Kraft led Burton to the man considered the
best, Ken Anderson at Dana-Farber. Burton is now fighting the
disease, and our prayers are with him . . . Ralph Cindrich, the
respected agent from Pittsburgh, had highly recommended the Jim
Haslett-Tom Donahoe team to the Patriots. ``They're excellent
football people,'' said Cindrich. ``Donahoe has great vision about
how to put together a team and he's very fair with players.''
</P>
<P>
   Saints alive
</P>
<P>
   Randy Mueller, the new GM of the New Orleans Saints, will be
earning more than $700,000 per year on a three-year contract with
incentives based on how well the Saints perform. Mueller might have
the most daunting job of any GM in the league. Not only does he
have to hire the right coach, he has to find a quarterback. The
Saints can no longer afford being led by the Billy Joes of the
world. Mueller will consider George, Seahawk backup Glenn Foley,
and recently released Trent Dilfer. There's also the possibility
that he could extract Doug Flutie from the Bills. Because he
doesn't have a first-round pick (after the Ricky Williams deal of
last season), he may attempt to make a deal with his current
personnel (Williams?) to get one. The Saints may target a few of
the Patriots' free agents, namely linebacker Tedy Bruschi and
receivers Shawn Jefferson and Troy Brown . . . Kraft was quite
impressed with Dom Capers, who interviewed for the head coaching
job last Wednesday. Capers felt he had a legitimate shot at being
hired but was well aware that Kraft wanted Belichick. ``The
situation was explained to Dom,'' said a source close to Capers.
``He knew the Patriots were having problems getting Belichick, and
they had no idea how the talks were going to go with the Jets at
the time. Dom never felt he was being used.'' . . . At first,
Dallas owner Jerry Jones was concerned about getting Deion
Sanders's $12.7 million cap figure reduced. But now he's wondering
whether Deion will be around at all. Sanders wants to play baseball
for the Cincinnati Reds again and said he will concentrate on
baseball until that season is over. Sanders, 32, is due to collect
$10.5 million, but Jones isn't going to pay it without a 16-game
commitment. This story is far from over . . . Hamilton was high
atop Dave Wannstedt's list of defensive line coaches before
Wannstedt gave the job to Clarence Brooks. Now Hamilton is a
possibility with the Jets and he may have a life with the Patriots
and Belichick . . . The Jaguars had better be ready to loosen their
purse strings for Tony Brackens. The All-Pro pass rusher will begin
negotiations next week. If something can't get done, he's expected
to be one of the most sought-after defensive linemen in recent
times. Brackens may be looking for a six- or seven-year deal, worth
about $7 million per.

<P>
   Anson Carter's skating might not figure well into the world of
figure skating, but the approach he takes to his art shares a
common note with those who specialize in double toe loops and
triple quads.
</P>
<P>
   Although admittedly ``musically challenged,'' the Bruins' winger
owns piles of CDs, especially rap, reggae, and rhythm and blues.
Whenever he's away from the rink _ be it the dressing room, the
team bus, the hotel _ he is perpetually plugged into a CD player,
with an eclectic assortment of tunes funneled through a large set
of earphones fit for a professional recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They block out the noise, and they give you that extra bass,''
said Carter, who is an MTV/NHL music video just waiting to happen.
``Bass, that's key for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like figure skaters, Carter relies on his tunes, in part, to put
him in the right frame of mind before he performs. Many of the
world's top figure skaters, just prior to their long or short
programs, often can be found at the end of a hallway or tucked in a
side room, swaying to the sounds of their chosen music. They block
out what their competitors are doing on the ice, the music soothing
their jitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same for me, exactly, a way to relax,'' said Carter. ``And for
me, there's only so much rock 'n' roll and alternative music I can
listen to. Sometimes guys on the team will grab my headphones, and
say, `Hey, AC, what are you listening to in there?' They'll listen
to what I've got on and I'll get this look, like I'm from a
different planet or something.''
</P>
<P>
   In what has been a disappointing season for the Bruins, the
25-year-old Carter has been one of the few bright spots, already
surpassing his career totals for goals (20) and points (44) with 32
games yet to play in the regular season heading into Saturday
night's against Buffalo. He has been playing on a different planet.
The music man tops the charts in team scoring. If even a quarter of
the roster mirrored his improvement this season, the Bruins would
be among the leaders in the Eastern Conference, rather than
skidding along the line of playoff elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to games, Carter typically prefers R&AMP;B tunes by female
vocalists. He intentiontally steers clear of heavy metal or
anything that could be categorized as pump music. Too much on the
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a feeling of being calm and in control when I get out
there and play,'' he said. ``If I'm too pumped, that's not good. I
mean, that's fine if you're headed to the weight room and you want
that kind of energy surge. But out on the ice, that's something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's top three CDs include: (1) Notorious B.I.G., by the
late rapper Christopher Wallace; (2) Beenie Man (reggae); and (3)
Jay-Z (rap). But he also has a keen interest in Andrea Bocelli, the
blind Italian tenor whose work ranges from opera to pop. Mention
the Beatles, the Beach Boys, or the Rolling Stones, and the Bruins'
Mr. Music scrunches up his nose as if you've suggested a weekend in
the Poconos with Lawrence Welk enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Carter grew up in Ontario, his parents lovers of country and
gospel music. Something was always playing on the stereo in the
Carter house of tunes. When he turned pro out of Michigan State in
the summer of '96, Carter began building a CD collection that he
now estimates includes more than 500 titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those I bought early on,'' said Carter. ``I got my
first signing bonus and I thought, `Hmm, what do I need most?' CDs,
that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who shops for music a couple of times each month, has
tried to find some link between the tunes he plays before the puck
is dropped and what the scoring summary shows after the game. Does
what he plays affect how he plays?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't found that link yet,'' he said. ``But if I'm shut
out, then I gas that song and look for something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a Bocelli aria would provide the right scoring aura? Who
knows? Carter says he gets some of the strangest looks from his
teammates when they hear Bocelli belting out of his headset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I got Tally (Rob Tallas) turned on to it, and (Joel)
Prpic asked to listen, too,'' said Carter. ``Hey, I know a lot of
'em like it, but they just won't come out of the closet and admit
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leetch still ailing
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers thought they were about to get Brian Leetch back _
triggering rumors that the under-performing Stephane Quintal could
be headed back to Montreal _ but X-rays late last week showed that
the former BC Eagle's cracked right arm still hadn't mended
sufficiently. More X-rays in a few days . . . Gee, about a quarter
of the way through the regular season, John Muckler was being
fashioned as a dunce by some in the New York media. The Blueshirts
now sizzling, Muckler looks like a genius, especially for putting
together his Czechmate line of Petr Nedved, Jan Hlavac, and
ex-Panther Radek Dvorak. And nothing makes a coach look brighter
than when his No. 1 goaltender _ in this case Mike Richter _ plays
like a No. 1 goaltender. A seven-win surge helped the Blueshirts
mitigate the Kevin Stevens situation. Stevens was arrested last
Sunday and charged with soliciting a prostitute and possessing drug
paraphernalia after a game against St. Louis. Word around the
league was that Stevens was about to be bought out of his contract
($3.2 million-plus this year) and would land back in Pittsburgh,
where his life once was far more successful and less complicated .
. . Anyone noticed how big, bad Chris Simon has developed some
scoring touch with the Capitals? The 6-foot-4-inch tower of power
is tied with Peter Bondra for the club lead in goals (15). This
from a guy who never popped in more than 16 in a season. ``He's
been playing on their top line,'' noted Bruins tough guy Ken
Belanger, who grew up in the same region of Ontario as Simon.
``It's nice to see a player like him get a chance to prove himself
in the league _ a guy who started in the league the way I did get a
chance to show what he can do. My ultimate goal is not to model
myself after him, but I'd love one day to get up to that level.
He's a little older, and it just shows again that it takes time in
this league _ time to show what you can do and earn the confidence
of the coach that you should be out there.'' . . . Calgary
defenseman Denis Gauthier fired a shot the way of the FleetCenter's
off-ice officials when he told USA Today, ``In Calgary, you really
have to take a guy's head off to (be credited with) a hit.
Carolina, Washington, and Boston, those places, you just blow on a
guy and they credit you with a hit. I'm averaging about four a
game. The Boston game (last Monday night), I didn't hit that much
and got eight. It's really inconsistent.'' Gauthier had 153 hits
(in 36 games) when he made the remarks, 56 behind league-leader Don
Sweeney . . . The Sabres, at the Vault Saturday, could have Dominik
Hasek back in net for Tuesday night's game against the Mighty Ducks
_ provided, of course, his groin muscle doesn't cause him any
problems. The Sabres need something to pump up their game. One
rumor on the shores of Lake Erie last week had Keith Tkachuk of the
Coyotes traded for Sabres captain Michael Peca and a high draft
pick. Tkachuk undoutedly will get moved, but with $8 million-plus
coming his way next season, it won't be to a small-market club like
Buffalo . . . The New York Post was trumpeting the possibility of
the Devils trading for malcontent Alexei Yashin, yielding the likes
of Brendan Morrison, Denis Pederson, Sheldon Souray and a draft
pick to the Senators. That's a classic dollar for three quarters,
two dimes, and a nickel. The Senators have to think in terms of
acquiring a true impact player if they're giving up Yashin. Look no
further than the Pavel Bure deal last summer. Bure is the top
peformer in the game (OK, with Jaromir Jagr right there, too), and
the Canucks are left with Ed Jovanovski. Like Yashin, Bure forced a
deal, and that immediately undermines a club's ability to get full
value . . . The Leafs picked up free agent blue liner Gerald
Diduck, the ex-Islander first-rounder who turns 35 in April. The
tie is coach-GM Pat Quinn, who had Diduck in the Canucks lineup in
'94 when they faced the Rangers in the Cup final . . . It took some
cajoling from league disciplinarian Colin Campbell, but Blues
netminder Roman Turek has reconsidered and will play in the
All-Star Game if Hasek is unable.
</P>
<P>
   Food for thought
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Axelsson sometimes has to head out of the Hub to satisfy
his cravings for home cookin'. Two or three times a season, the
Bruins winger drives to a grocery store in Rhode Island that
specializes in Swedish food. At the top of his shopping cart:
canned herring, mustard, and chocolate. He relies on a steady diet
of seafood here in the States. Note to Eddie Andelman: Axelsson
says the Chinese food in Sweden is far better than we get here.
Sounds like an 'EEI road trip. ``I think there's more meat in it,''
said Axelsson. ``And the spring rolls _ much better.'' . . . Just
wondering, but if the league went to all the trouble to add a
couple of feet of space behind the net, why do so few forwards take
the opportunity to set up back there, a la Wayne Gretzky? ``I don't
know that answer,'' said Bruins center Joe Thornton. ``Pierre
Turgeon probably does it more than anyone. And it's a pretty good
play, because you can pull a defenseman back with you and that
should create some more space in front.'' . . . Thornton's brother,
Alex, is a history teacher at Malden Catholic. ``The kids in class
give him the business sometimes about me _ stuff like, `Hey, how
come your brother's not scoring!?' '' . . . The Keith Primeau-Rod
Brind'Amour exchange is a solid swap. Primeau should thrive in
Philadelphia, getting less checking heat as No. 2 behind Eric
Lindros (back Thursday night after a third concussion in 22
months). And Brind'Amour, at least for a year and a half, could
help turn a ``C'' lineup into a ``B-minus'' _ and that's true
impact in today's hockey. However, anyone else out there wonder
whether the Flyers can compete seriously for a Cup with their
goaltending and defense? Don't be surprised if the Flyers make a
pitch for Montreal netminder Jeff Hackett prior to the March 14
trade deadline. Hackett signed a four-year, $12 million deal with
the Habs last summer and now has been supplanted by Jose Theodore .
. . The Lightning have only six players left from last season, the
likes of Vincent Lecavalier, Pavel Kubina, Petr Svoboda, Chris
Gratton, Darcy Tucker, and Mike Sillinger. If the Bruins ever
consider moving Sergei Samsonov, a likely partner would be the
Bolts because GM Rick Dudley was Samsonov's boss with the Detroit
Vipers (IHL). Gratton for Samsonov? Gratton was a flop in Philly,
but his size (6-4, 220) and skill make him enticing . . . Still
waiting for the Bruins to match the Celtics' free admission offer,
just not sure if anyone out there will beat Harry Sinden in the
arbitration case.

GEORGE GOT ACADEMY REWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was a special occasion, so Donna George wanted
everything to be just right.
</P>
<P>
   She prepared her son's favorite dinner. Another piece of cheese
steak, Eddie? Some fries with that? Forget milk _ have a Coke. And
for dessert, I've got a surprise for you, dear . . .
</P>
<P>
   A one-way ticket to Fork Union Military Academy. In the wilds of
Virginia. Only nine hours from home in Philadelphia. Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie George's head almost dropped onto his plate. What was
this, child abuse? How could his mother _ his own flesh and blood _
set him up like this? Was this any way to treat a sure-fire future
pro football star? Didn't she know that had been his career
objective since he was a young kid watching ``Monday Night
Football'' with his father, now separated from the family, and
thinking _ knowing _ ``That's going to be me''? How were the scouts
going to find him at some soldier school?
</P>
<P>
   All right, so he hadn't graced the honor roll in two years at
Abington High. Far from it. And his hobbies may not have been the
most wholesome _ skipping school and playing street football. OK,
that $55 he'd borrowed last summer that he told Donna had been for
an advanced math course had actually paid for a class he needed to
stay eligible for football. But for crying out loud, he wasn't a
bad kid. Rambunctious, maybe. But he'd never stolen anything, never
robbed anyone, wouldn't think of such things. And this was his
reward? Had Mom misunderstood when he told her he was goingto be
drafted someday?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' he thought. ``This is my life. She's taking away my
dream. I'm going to do everything I can to talk her out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nice powers of persuasion, kid.
</P>
<P>
   Donna George's orange Mustang, with 15-year-old Eddie aboard,
pulled to a stop in the scorching heat of backwoods Virginia on an
August Sunday in 1989. Before them lay a vista of trees, bugs, and
barracks. If Eddie could have gotten his hands on the steering
wheel, he would have done an about-face to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he reluctantly obeyed Donna's orders and followed her
to a locker room, where football coach Micky Sullivan _ the man
with whom she'd discussed her son's transfer to this school that
one of her brothers had attended _ was busy sorting equipment in
preparation for preseason camp.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, thought Eddie, this was more like it. When his mother
introduced him to Sullivan, his first questions were, ``Where's my
jersey? What's my number?'' He had something sweet in mind, he
would recall a decade later, something in the single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Micky Sullivan had other ideas. This wasn't a bad kid, he knew _
none of the 600 male boarders at Fork Union were _ just maybe a tad
cocky, with misdirected energy, someone whose parent felt he needed
a little more discipline, a little structure in his life, and who
was working three jobs to help provide it at a cost of several
thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son,'' he told Eddie, ``you do what you're supposed to do and
you'll get a number.''
</P>
<P>
   But he could have a uniform right away. A nice little ensemble
that could have been a West Point hand-me-down. Gray trousers with
black piping, a gray shirt with a black tie, and a military cap.
Eddie's required daily outfit for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be needing those clothes you're wearing,'' Sullivan
said. ``You can just put them in this bag.''
</P>
<P>
   And that wasn't the only goody. Sullivan showed Donna and Eddie
the boy's new accommodations in one of the three-story barracks
that slept 32 per floor, two or three to a room equipped with beds,
sinks, desks, and a couple of chairs. Eddie's room was right next
to the common showers, and he immediately realized he wasn't the
first summer guest _ the stalls were infested with roaches.
</P>
<P>
   If he could have caught up with the orange Mustang as Donna
pulled away from the campus, he would have.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He laughs wryly in retrospect. Eddie George is sitting at a
podium in the Georgia Dome _ sitting on top of the world, really _
the focal point for an international media contingent as he
prepares for Sunday's Super Bowl, where he will be the fulcrum of
the Tennessee Titans' offense, the main target of the St. Louis
Rams' defense, a featured performer in a worldwide showcase.
</P>
<P>
   He has become a pro football star and then some. He's one of
only four running backs in NFL history to have gained at least
1,200 yards in each of his first four years. This season's output
of 1,304 earned him his third straight trip to the Pro Bowl. His
354 yards in playoff wins over Buffalo, Indianapolis, and
Jacksonville have carried the former Houston Oilers to the first
Super Bowl in their 40-year history. And one of the mementos of his
college days is the Heisman Trophy he won in 1995 as a senior at
Ohio State, the big football school that found him in the Virginia
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   He has achieved all his dreams after all, and he would have
realized none of them, he acknowledges a bit sheepishly, had it not
been for the three years he spent at Fork Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would be in jail somewhere, but I don't think
I would be as successful as I am,'' he said. ``I'd probably be a
manager at a fast-food restaurant or something. Not that that's a
bad job, but that was just the reality of my situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fork Union opened the door to all his fantasies. It was
not the hard-core military school he had feared, but rather, as
Sullivan said, ``a high school that uses military structure.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant 6 a.m. reveille. Making his bed immediately. Falling
into formation for inspection. Eating breakfast promptly. Attending
classes without fail. Mandatory chapel services twice a week, in
accordance with the school's Christian philosophy. And marching
punishment details for various infractions. In other words,
accountability he had never known.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it was initially a jolt to the city boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have problems per se,'' said Sullivan. ``But he
experienced what I call culture shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban recreational pursuits and distractions were a thing of the
past. In contrast to the hubbub of Philly, there was not one stop
light in all of Fluvanna County. Downtown Fork Union consisted of a
couple of small restaurants, a hardware store, a pizza parlor, and
a pharmacy. The closest big town, Charlottesville, was a half-hour
away _ and that qualified as a hamlet by Philadelphia standards.
And while there were girls on campus, they were all faculty
daughters. So much for a social life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet George thrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough that first year,'' he said. ``But after about six
months, I saw this was a great opportunity because a lot of the big
schools went through there. And it put me in a situation where I
was with kids who were getting scholarships, getting good grades.
It made me want to try harder. Fortunately, the guys there stayed
with me and helped me. I'm still tight with a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   There also was the gospel according to Micky Sullivan, which he
preached to all his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He challenged me to be the best player I could be, to be the
best person I could be,'' said George. ``He challenged me to have
respect for myself and others. I took the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Exceeded it, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   George didn't start in football his first year, then starred his
last two, earning a scholarship to Ohio State. And Sullivan noticed
something he brought with him behind the cocky veneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an incredible work ethic,'' said the coach. ``He was
like that when he came here. Eddie came to Fred Hardy, the track
coach, and myself and said, `I want to play major college
football.' So I'd tell him, `OK, do this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly were the instructions out of Sullivan's mouth when George
would return saying, ``OK, Coach, I did that. What's next?''
</P>
<P>
   He sculpted himself into a 6-foot-3-inch, 240-pound power pack.
And when Sullivan told him, ``If you want to be a running back, you
need flexibility; you should run the hurdles,'' George became the
state 300-meter champion.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the track where Sullivan believes the epiphany
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   During George's second year, he was competing in Lynchburg, Va.,
against premier opponents when a March snow squall cast an eerie
shroud over the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to stand in the infield to see what was going on,''
said Sullivan, who helped Hardy coach track.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw was remarkable. ``There were hurdlers all over the
place coming out of nowhere, some of the best in the state,'' said
Sullivan. But down the straightaway, only one was visible _ Eddie
George, romping to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he lost another race,'' said Sullivan. ``And I
think that may have been the day he really started to believe what
Frank and I were telling him.''
</P>
<P>
   And George showed his appreciation. Five years later, when he
was announced as the Heisman winner during a nationally televised
ceremony at New York's Downtown Athletic Club, Sullivan was on
hand. ``A country boy in the big city,'' he said. ``I was the guy
jumping up and down yelling in the back of the room when Eddie's
name was announced. When I got home, my wife said, `I didn't see
you on TV, but I heard you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Micky Sullivan will be watching on TV and Donna George will be
in the stadium Sunday when Eddie's name is announced before the
Super Bowl, when he fulfills his ultimate dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I run all the hills in the offseason and why I lift
all the weights and sacrifice my time to be a better player,'' said
the Titans' model of self-discipline. ``It's all to be in this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Mom.

ROAD NOT ALWAYS SMOOTH FOR FRONTIERE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is a lie that nothing can stir the passion of a
sports-loving southern Californian, bolt him or her upright from
that laid-back position, save for an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Just mention Georgia Frontiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one time when she got up to give a speech to the
Rams before the season started, a motivational speech to the
team,'' said one southern Californian. ``And she said her dream for
the season was for the Rams to beat the 49ers in the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The story?
</P>
<P>
   No, the story's possible. Owners of National Football League
teams have said and done many a silly thing in their days. So it's
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams and 49ers getting to the same Super Bowl is not.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time she gave her players Christmas presents.
Cabbage Patch dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out one Sunday morning to go to the bus, all these
burly football players, defensive linemen, linebackers,'' said Jack
Youngblood, the former star defensive end for the Los Angeles Rams,
``and they've got luggage in one hand and Cabbage Patch dolls in
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Be kind. The dolls were for the players' kids.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Rams probably lost the game anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend, after her Rams had won their way into
Sunday's Super Bowl, making the 66,000 fans in the TWA Dome
delirious with postgame joy, Georgia Frontiere was asked by
Fox-TV's Terry Bradshaw if she realized the Super Bowl was going to
be played in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she replied. She hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   A writer for the Los Angeles Times noted in the next day's paper
that Bradshaw didn't follow up with the natural next question:
``Well, then, do you know who won today's game?''
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia Frontiere took her victory lap around the field, her
happiness so great that even a question from a southern Californian
couldn't dim her joy. A question about whether she felt bad for the
fans back in Anaheim and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' she replied. ``But the fans there can still watch
on TV. They were watching on TV and not coming to the games
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   A bigger lie is that you can never go home again. That's because
Georgia Frontiere was born some 72 years ago (though she won't
admit it) in St. Louis and now could be named by acclamation
Empress of St. Louis, for she brought the Rams there from Southern
California, and now the Rams are in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, when the Rams were in Los Angeles and Frontiere was in
her Beverly Hills mode, that she returned to the grammar school she
once attended in St. Louis and pulled up in a stretch limo, a
public relations man jumping out one side and a videocamerman out
the other as she made a grand entrance.
</P>
<P>
   But last Sunday, a much more self-effacing Frontiere, much more
Midwestern, had her childhood friends from Hamilton Elementary
School in her luxury box with her, with all kinds of Missouri
executives, congressmen, and senators watching her Rams win.
</P>
<P>
   Life has been longer than she admits.
</P>
<P>
   But life has been even more eventful than she could describe.
</P>
<P>
   And her seven husbands would be only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple marriages
</P>
<P>
   Husbands No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were gone when Georgia went to a
party in the late 1950s in the Palm Beach home of Joseph P.
Kennedy, the father of President John F. Kennedy, and set in motion
a most improbable series of events that one day would lead her to
be the only woman to own a National Football League team.
</P>
<P>
   She had been married at the age of 15, eloping with a soldier
heading off to World War II, but that lasted only a few weeks. A
few years later, she married again, but several weeks after the
wedding a bus struck the car she and her husband were in. Her
husband died as she struggled to revive him amid the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The third husband was a performer at a community theater in
Fresno, Calif., the fourth a stage manager at the Sacramento Music
Circus, and the fifth a Miami TV personality whose obituary
described him as ``a wholesomely handsome man who bore a striking
resemblance to Dick Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, for her part, was described _ to use a term from those
late 1950s _ as a ``knockout.''
</P>
<P>
   Frontiere's mother was a singer who performed at state fairs and
hotel lounges in the Midwest. In time, mother and daughter were
paired as ``the Pamela Sisters'' and sang in dinner theaters in the
Midwest and California.
</P>
<P>
   Various descriptions of Frontiere's life have said that she and
Joseph Kennedy were very friendly. But all that she has admitted to
is that she was at that party at the Kennedy mansion in Palm Beach
when Carroll Rosenbloom was introduced to her. Rosenbloom was the
millionaire owner of the Baltimore Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbloom, though married, fell head over heels for Georgia.
She promptly walked out on husband No. 5, the Miami TV personality,
and she and Rosenbloom became a fixture at Colts practices and
games.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, Rosenbloom, having divorced his wife after 25
years of marriage, married Georgia. By then, she and Rosenbloom
already had two children. It would not be until Connie Chung
disclosed the fact on TV many years later that the children, now
grown, learned they had been born out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbloom, meanwhile, had swapped franchises with Robert Irsay,
the Rams' owner, and moved to Los Angeles to run the Rams while
Irsay moved to Baltimore to run the Colts. Irsay eventually
incurred the same kind of wrath Frontiere later would feel when he
moved the Colts from Baltimore to Indianapolis 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On April 2, 1979, the 72-year-old Rosenbloom, reputedly a strong
swimmer, went swimming outside his home in Golden Beach, Fla., and
drowned. Frontiere has said she was in the kitchen of their home at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, two stories have been circulated about the
death of Rosenbloom by those who feel he was too strong a swimmer
to have drowned. Each of the stories alleges that Rosenbloom was
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   The first story concerns Rosenbloom's alleged heavy gambling.
Rosenbloom was said to have been such a heavy gambler than his
wagers alone reportedly moved the line by 3 points on the historic
Colts-Giants NFL championship game of 1958. Perhaps Rosenbloom was
murdered for gambling debts.
</P>
<P>
   The second story hints darkly about his wife. ``It's the height
of cruelty,'' said Frontiere to USA Today last week about the
recurring whispers that she may have had a hand in Carroll
Rosenbloom's death.
</P>
<P>
   An embittered son
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the Los Angeles Rams went to the Super Bowl
for the first time in franchise history. By then, less than a year
after Rosenbloom's death, Georgia was 52 years old and had taken up
with Domenic Frontiere, who would become her seventh husband.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Rosenbloom, then the 35-year-old son of Carroll and
stepson of Georgia, was first afflicted by grief at his father's
death and then consumed by rage at his stepmother's actions. Bad
enough that she had been 45 minutes late for her husband's funeral
and an hour late for his memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's will explicitly stated that his body was to be
cremated and his ashes interred in a simple, private service
attended by my family only,'' said Steven Rosenbloom. ``We had such
a service in Miami with about 30 of us attending. However, Georgia
decided she wanted something more _ what became a giant insult to
Carroll Rosenbloom's name and to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia decided to hold another service, an extravagant one in
tony Bel Air, Calif. A caterer was brought in and some 600 guests
were invited, many of them from Hollywood, with no personal
relationship to Rosenbloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``She put on a Hollywood extravaganza,'' said Steven Rosenbloom.
``Close to 600 people filled the grounds, and she brought in a
Florida caterer. It was incredible. Guests drank at various bars,
ate at tables piled high with expensive food, were entertained with
band music. I walked around and saw a lot of movie stars, people my
father didn't know, photographers at work, and tape recorders
going. And then Georgia showed up an hour late for the festivities,
keeping 600 people waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Rickles and Jonathan Winters told jokes, and some 20
speakers took to the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the NFL owners had come thinking it would be a period
of mourning,'' said Rosenbloom's son. ``Some of them had to be
restrained from standing up, expressing their disgust, and leaving.
Georgia's funeral for my father could have played Las Vegas for
eight weeks. My wife and I left and got drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   It got worse for the younger Rosenbloom. His father's will left
70 percent of the team to his wife and 6 percent each to the son
and his sister, but the will also directed that Steven Rosenbloom
continue to run the Rams as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Carroll wrote his will,'' Steven once explained, ``he was
faced with tough estate-tax problems. The best solution was to
leave Georgia with 70 percent of the team and trust her not to
upset what he had developed. He told me, `There are a lot of rich
widows in LA, but only one will have the prestige of the Rams'
ownership. I want Georgia to have that.' But he wanted me to retain
control of the operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after Rosenbloom's death, Georgia took over control of
the team. Then in August 1979, four months after the death, Georgia
fired Steve Rosenbloom from the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rams' team of that year went to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   History rewritten
</P>
<P>
   The biography of Georgia in the 1979 Rams' media guide contained
these descriptions:
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia Rosenbloom, a direct descendant of poet Ella Wheeler
Wilcox and a poet of note herself, was born in St. Louis, Mo.
Blessed with a natural soprano voice and with early formal
training, at 16 she began starring in light opera, musicals,
musical comedy, and modern opera in such favorites as `Magic
Flute,' `Madame Butterfly,' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia co-hosted with Dave Garroway the Today show in New
York. Her own TV talk show in Miami was a high-rated hit. . . .
Always active in sports, Georgia displays a 6 handicap in golf
(from the men's tee). At home on the ice and in snow, her mastery
of skating and skiing are additions to Georgia's accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   She had sung, but she had sung at the Silver Slipper in Las
Vegas, in lounges, at state fairs. She had been on national
television but had done only a two-week stint as a ``Today Girl''
(not as cohost) on ``The Dave Garroway Show.'' She had played the
lead in ``Oklahoma'' at various theaters-in-the-round in the
Northeast and had sung at various clubs in Canada and the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Frontiere's biography in this season's media guide
for the Rams says nothing about her musical career and little about
her years before arriving in St. Louis, but it devotes two pages to
her work as a civic and charitable leader of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention of what happened to Georgia and Domenic
Frontiere the last time the Rams were in a Super Bowl. The Rams
organization was caught scalping thousands of tickets to that 1980
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Since the game was in the Rose Bowl in nearby Pasadena, Calif.,
the Rams were allocated thousands of tickets for being the team
hosting the game. Furthermore, as one of the two teams playing in
the game, the Rams were allocated thousands more tickets. Despite
the abundance of tickets, Rams employees had difficulty obtaining
them, several being told, ``Come back the morning of the game, and
we'll see if we have any.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, the scheme was discovered, and Domenic Frontiere,
Georgia's seventh husband, served nearly a year in a federal
correctional institution for income tax evasion for not paying tax
on the money received from scalping thousands of tickets. Gerogia
Frontiere, though, escaped unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Georgia moved the Rams from the Los Angeles Coliseum
to Anaheim. The Rams slipped from a perennial power to an also-ran,
as the despised San Francisco 49ers took over dominance of the NFC
West. Then after a long series of moves that weakened the team and
alienated the fans of Orange County, Georgia moved the Rams back
East to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has divorced Domenic Frontiere but insists on retaining
his name (although she also insists the name should now be
pronounced ``Fron-teer''). Her companion now is Earle Weatherwax, a
tall, rugged, ponytailed former jazz musician who is now a
developer.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice has not failed her, as those close to the Rams recount
tale after tale of Georgia gathering friends around her and singing
show tunes or, more recently, Christmas carols. She is described as
an elegant hostess.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bud Adams, the owner of the Tennessee Titans, Frontiere
chose to take a low profile in the week before the Super Bowl, not
arriving in Atlanta until late Friday. But John Shaw, the president
of the Rams who directs the football operations, praised her highly
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the chairman of the team and she's consulted, advised,
and participates in all major decisions,'' Shaw said. ``She
generally defers to me and Jay (Zygmunt, the Rams' executive vice
president) on all financial matters, just as we defer to the coach
on all football matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, this is a tale of two women as much as a tale
of two cities. In Los Angeles and southern California, Georgia
Frontiere is despised as the owner who absconded with the team to
St. Louis. And, in St. Louis, Georgia is a warm, friendly,
personable community leader rather than the eccentric woman of LA
who would never sign checks or documents ``when Mercury was in
retrograde'' or would do astrological charts on her quarterback or
run down to the field to kiss her coach or the players.
</P>
<P>
   And few people in St. Louis know about Husbands No. 1 through 7
or how Carroll Rosenbloom died or how well she knew Joseph P.
Kennedy. And even fewer care now that Georgia is in Georgia, her
Rams in the Georgia Dome, and St. Louis is busting with pride over
its team.

AN ALL-STAR EFFORT BY FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike baseball, NBA fans deserve a little credit when it comes
to the All-Star voting process. Of course, maybe it's because pro
basketball's average fans aren't over 70 or rotisserie-league
geeks.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the fans did a respectable job selecting the
starting teams for the Western and Eastern conference teams.
</P>
<P>
   There's been virtually no controversy over the lineups,
something that almost never occurs in that other sport.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see how we stack up the fans' selections with our own as
we near the Feb. 13 game in Oakland:
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   Guards
</P>
<P>
   Fans' picks: Jason Kidd, Phoenix, and Kobe Bryant, Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Our picks: Kidd and Gary Payton, Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way Kidd (16.2 ppg, 10.0 apg, 7.2 rpg) doesn't make
the team. He's become the most prolific player to record
triple-doubles since Magic Johnson, and has even improved his jump
shot. Most importantly, he plays hard every minute, which is
something that can't be said for the rest of the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with the fans' choice of Bryant, but he
missed the first month of the season, and Payton is having perhaps
his finest year (23.3 ppg, 8.5 apg, 6.2 rpg) if you exclude the
usual temper flare-ups. Without him, the Sonics would be about as
distinguishable as the Warriors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forwards
</P>
<P>
   Fans' picks: Kevin Garnett, Minnesota, and Tim Duncan, San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Our picks: Garnett and Sacramento's Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   There's really no quibble here, since Garnett will become a
staple at this spot for the next 10 years, and the Duncan-Webber
debate could go either way.
</P>
<P>
   If we were building a team, we'd obviously take Duncan, but
Webber's 24.7 points and 10.8 rebounds should be recognized for
turning the Kings into a legitimate member of the NBA's upper
echelon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center
</P>
<P>
   Fans' pick: Shaquille O'Neal, Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Our pick: O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The no-brainer of the year. It's too obvious to even talk about.
Next conference, please.
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   Guards
</P>
<P>
   Fans' picks: Allen Iverson, Philadelphia, and Eddie Jones,
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Our picks: Iverson and Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson gives Larry Brown a headache about three times a week,
but his talent allows him to get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   There's some sentiment that Milwaukee's Glenn Robinson deserved
the other spot, but look at how far Jones has come in just the past
12 months. Yeah, that Lakers trade isn't looking so good today,
huh?
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been the glue that holds a shaky Charlotte team
together, especially after the death of Bobby Phills. Jones is
having a wonderful season, and will be courted by at least 10 teams
when he becomes a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Forwards
</P>
<P>
   Fans' picks: Vince Carter, Toronto, and Grant Hill, Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Our picks: Carter and Hill.
</P>
<P>
   We're still trying to figure out how Carter was left off the
Olympic team, forced to take a back seat to Milwaukee's Ray Allen.
He's possibly the most explosive player in the league in just his
second season, which was evidenced by being the No.1 vote-getter
for the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Hill deserves the starting spot because he has done what few
superstars do these days: Improve an aspect of his game.
</P>
<P>
   Hill hired a shooting coach last summer, and is currently
hitting 39 percent of his 3-pointers. He's become an even more
complete player.
</P>
<P>
   Center
</P>
<P>
   Fans' pick: Alonzo Mourning, Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Our pick: I've never been a big fan of the 6-foot-9 Mourning,
but there's a real shortage of centers in the East, with Atlanta's
Dikembe Mutombo the only other viable option. That's not much of a
comparison, since Mourning is more than a rebounder/shot blocker,
yet he still manages 4.3 blocks per night.
</P>
<P>
   The feud continues: The Sixers and Heat are getting downright
hostile in Week 2 of their disagreement over who botched the Larry
Hughes-for-Jamal Mashburn deal.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Pat Riley accused Philadelphia of leaking the trade
to the media last week, and became incensed this week when Sixers
GM Billy King said Toronto had discussed trading Tracy McGrady to
Miami for point guard Tim Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's (garbage),'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto prefers rookie point guard Anthony Carter to the
33-year-old Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Deals, deals, deals: Rick Pitino remains under fire in Boston,
and has put forward Danny Fortson on the trading block. Fortson has
barely been in Boston long enough to learn to mistrust Pitino after
being acquired for Ron Mercer. But he becomes a free agent after
the season and Boston would like to clear its salary cap. Also
available for any willing victims: Pervis Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hawks are not going to fire Lenny Wilkens, but
are open to offers for guard Jim Jackson and forward Alan
Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, when not talking to Philadelphia, has called Golden
State about John Starks, which would reunite the always-shooting
guard with his former Knicks mentor Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Eddie: The Hornets are ready to offer Eddie Jones a
seven-year, $86 million contract after the season in a
sign-at-all-costs move. ``I think that Eddie is essential to the
success of our team,'' Charlotte co-owner Ray Wooldridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Know your role: According to Mitch Lawrence of ESPN.com,
Clippers guard Lamar Odom recently was reprimanded by the
organization. Odom was critical of the direction of the franchise
several weeks ago, and worried over the potential departures of
free agents Maurice Taylor and Derek Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   According to the story, Odom was told by Clippers GM Elgin
Baylor that he would be suspended if he made further remarks.

DANCE STEPS MUST ACCOMPANY SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stylin'. Gettin' jiggy. Takin' it to the house.
</P>
<P>
   It is a new century, and touchdown dances are the rage more than
ever. Nobody is boring or bashful anymore. You intercept, you
tackle, you sack, you score.
</P>
<P>
   You dance.
</P>
<P>
   This is Super Bowl Sunday, and the end zone show is likely to be
better than the halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   American sports as I knew them forever changed when I attended a
Little League game at Murphy Field in Newton last spring.
Eleven-year-old Sam Shaughnessy popped one over the fence in
center. Proud dad sat and smiled. Then frowned.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Shaughnessy was stylin' around the bases. A slow trot.
Almost Jeffrey Leonard-like.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered, where do they get this stuff?
</P>
<P>
   But I knew. They get it from ESPN ``SportsCenter.'' They get it
from NBA Jam. They get it Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a big play or do something to put your team in a
position to win a ballgame or take the lead, you have some fun,''
said Tennessee Titans wideout Yancey Thigpen, who has been known to
dance. ``I don't think it should be overexaggerated, but I don't
have a problem with guys celebrating. Fans come to the game with
painted faces. You've got the cheerleaders cheering. Why can't we
have fun on the field? We're the ones playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans return specialist Derrick Mason ran a punt back for a
touchdown in the AFC Championship game at Jacksonville last
weekend. His TD dance was short and none too showy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have nothing planned,'' Mason said apologetically.
``It was kind of a surprise that I got in there. I wanted to get in
there, but I didn't think I would, so I didn't have a touchdown
dance ready. If I get to the end zone this week, I've got something
ready. I've been working out with my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   We worked out together. She says that I don't have enough
rhythm, so we're working on a little dance and whatnot.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest ESPN Magazine devotes 10 full pages to Gettin' Jiggy.
Tennessee's Jevon Kearse and St. Louis's Torry Holt were among four
NFL stars who posed for pictures and explained their routines. Holt
calls his dance the ``Bob 'n' Weave,'' and it's described as ``a
splash of Ali, a touch of Busta Rhymes, DMX, and Lost Boyz.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, whatever happened to Homer Jones spiking the ball behind
him after catching a touchdown pass from Earl Morrall?
</P>
<P>
   Ever on the cutting edge, Oliver Stone didn't miss an
opportunity to invent some creative end zone stuff in ``Any Given
Sunday.'' Every player I talked with in Atlanta said he'd seen the
movie, and all of them loved the hand-grenade and machine-gun
routines performed by the mythical Miami Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had some good stuff in there,'' said Tennessee wideout
Kevin Dyson. ``But now nobody can use it because it was in the
movie first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta be original. I think those would be outlawed anyway,
sort of like the slashing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has rules about grid choreography. You're not allowed to
take off your helmet. Taunting is supposed to result in a penalty.
And the throat-slashing, demonstrated by Keyshawn Johnson against
the Patriots on ``Monday Night Football,'' has been outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes guys go overboard with it, but I'm for it,'' said
Dyson. ``I think it's all part of the game, part of the fun.
Touchdowns don't come too often. I don't have any routine. Every
once in a while I'll do something out of the ordinary, but usually
it's the same old thing. In college I got flagged one time for
spinning the ball on the ground. I didn't even realize I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots players prefer the ball-spin, which is allowed in the
NFL. Who can forget Chris Canty celebrating tackles after giving up
12-yard passes? Or Larry Whigham blocking a punt in Philadelphia,
then celebrating while the Eagles picked up the ball and ran for a
first down. Lawyer Milloy made a fool out of himself by dancing
after interceptions when the last-place Patriots beat the Ravens on
the final day in Foxborough. New England players were wiggling and
waving their fingers in the air (signifying ``We're No. 5,'' I
presume) when they should have worn bags over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's ridiculous to dance in the end zone when you're
down two touchdowns or down any points at all,'' said Thigpen.
``I've never been penalized, but I've definitely celebrated. I
think as long as you're celebrating what your thing is and not
criticizing or not taunting your opponent, probably nothing is too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Dancing is not confined to wideouts and defensive backs.
Defensive linemen like to perform after sacks, and Titans offensive
tackle Brad Hopkins says even the beefy blockers can participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do end zone dances, man,'' said Hopkins. ``What happens
is they ask us to tone it down because they don't want to detract a
lot of attention from guys that did just score. Imagine if we were
in there doing the worm in the end zone. People would think we were
absolutely crazy. A lot of offensive linemen just can't celebrate.
Their bodies become stiff and can't move. But there's a lot of us
that can get down.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Sanders and Walter Payton were two players who never
demonstrated after scoring touchdowns. The old mantra was ``Act
like you've been there before.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried explaining this to Sam Shaughnessy. There's no taunting
in baseball. I told Mark McGwire Sam's story when I saw him last
summer. McGwire's son and Sam are the exact same age. The slugger
sent Sam a message into my tape recorder:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit a home run, you put your head down and run around
the bases. It's OK to celebrate a little if you just won the game
or set a record, but you should never show up the pitcher. He's not
trying to show you up. It's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not wrong in football. It's not wrong in the Super Bowl.
Not anymore. Get jiggy. Get ready for XXXIV. Get ready for ``Bob
'n' Weave.''
</P>

LONG JOURNEY ENDS AT HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ He doesn't know why, but when the proudest moment of
his life came Saturday morning, Howie Long knew his life has been
blessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every step along the way I have been lucky,'' said Long, his
eyes still red-rimmed just an hour after learning he had been voted
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ``I have had a lot of forks in
the road in my life, and somehow I've always taken the right
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is Canton, Ohio, the last Saturday in July, for a
formal induction into the Hall, where the kid who walked the
streets with ``Townies'' for the first 14 years of his life will
stand side-by-side with the legends of the game for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Long is the first homegrown Bostonian to reach the greatest
heights in America's No. 1 sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to take a long while for all of this to sink in,''
said Long. ``I was shocked when someone (Villanova) gave me a
scholarship to go to college. I was shocked when I was drafted (by
the Oakland Raiders), and I'm shocked to be voted into the Hall of
Fame today.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I know none of this would have ever happened if it wasn't
for my grandmother (Elizabeth Mullan) and my uncle Billy (Mullan)
and his wife. My grandmother moved me out of Charlestown when
busing came (in 1975). She didn't think that I would amount to
anything if I stayed there, and she asked my uncle Billy (her son)
to take me in. So I was moved to Milford (Mass.) and I thought that
was the end of the world. But it turned out to be one of the best
things that ever happened to me. The first fork in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up on Albion Place in Charlestown, Long was a big kid,
but not tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quiet,'' he said. ``I didn't say much. I didn't play
football. Hockey was my sport. Bobby Orr was my hero. I wanted to
grow up to be Bobby Orr.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Mullan, who lived in Milford and drove to Boston each day
to work for the Boston Housing Authority, had four kids of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never realized how great what he did for me really was until
I had three kids of my own,'' said Long. ``I couldn't imagine
taking in another 14-year-old kid off the streets to raise him. I
will never be able to thank Ma (his grandmother) or Billy enough;
without them I would never have this moment. Billy worked two jobs.
The family budget was stretched to the limit. When he got through
in Boston, he worked as a painter at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Long got another big break walking the hallways of Milford High
his first year as a ninth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't much of a student,'' he said. ``I didn't get the
foundation in Boston. Ma moved me out because I missed 60 straight
days of school due to busing. No one was going to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I was walking down the hall, and Dick Corbin, the
football coach, asked me to come out for the team. I told him I
didn't play football. Didn't know how. He got me to try out for the
team. First day out, I didn't have any idea what I was doing. But
he had great patience. And his wife, Ruthann, was great to me. She
realized my limitations (with learning) and she tutored me on her
own time. Without her, I would have never been able to go to
college. Another fork in the road, and the Corbins were there for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Long signed a letter of agreement to play for Boston College,
but knew he made a terrible mistake the first day he visited the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The head coach, Joe Yukica, said he wanted to make me an
offensive guard,'' said Long. ``I knew that wasn't for me, so I
didn't go there. Ma wanted me to go to a Catholic college.
Villanova was interested in me, so I went there.''
</P>
<P>
   There he got another great break, meeting a young lady from New
Jersey, named Diane, who would become his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``She helped me with my studies, and she's helped me with
everything since,'' he said. ``I loved Villanova. It was the
perfect school for me. I didn't get overwhelmed. People really
cared. They wanted to help.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest football break came after his final year at
Villanova. Long was not invited to any postseason all-star games.
But then good fortune smiled on him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from the people who run the North-South game,''
he said. ``One of the defensive linemen they had invited couldn't
make it. That's how I got invited, at the last minute, as a sub.
They had a banquet the night before the game and Frank Howard, who
had been a legendary coach at Clemson, started making fun at my
expense. He was giving a speech at the head table trying to be
funny about how some kid I was going to play against from Texas A&AMP;M
was going to take me apart. It was embarrassing, but I got mad. And
I took that feeling with me onto the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Long was named Most Valuable Player in the game. He was all over
the field making tackles, and clinched the game with a big play at
the end. Still, he believed pro football beyond his reach until he
was drafted by the Raiders in the second round in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I was good enough to play pro ball,'' he said.
``In fact, Dick Vermeil (then coaching the Philadelphia Eagles)
said, `Howie, make sure they give you a look at offensive guard.'
'' Meaning Vermeil didn't think Long could cut it as a defensive
lineman in pro ball, so he should try to hang on at another
positon. Yukica revisited.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got off the bus in Oakland for training camp, I thought
it was another world,'' Long said. ``To a kid from Charlestown, it
could have just as well been Taiwan. But I was very fortunate. I
played with great players, and great coaches, who wanted me to
succeed. For me, I was in the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Long had 84 sacks in 13 seasons with the Raiders in Oakland and
Los Angeles. ``This is what I've kept thinking about since I heard
the news (of his election). ``I've been on the verge of tears for a
couple of hours thinking about how different it all would have been
if it wasn't for my grandmother, my Uncle Billy, Coach Corbin and
his wife, Villanova, and all the people who made this possible. If
I died right now, I would be a happy man. My life would be
fulfilled. A lot of blood, sweat, work, and tears went into this,
but I still didn't believe it would ever happen until it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlestown to Canton, Ohio. That's quite a trip.

RAMS LOOK TOO TOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; In the first Extortion Bowl &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; the two participants
left their ancestral roots when they were able to fleece new
suitors for taxpayer-subsidized stadiums_the St. Louis Rams and
Tennessee Titans will settle their difference today in the
72-degree warmth of the enclosed Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a match painful to watch for many of the
disenfranchised fans in Los Angeles, who supported the Rams for 49
seasons, and in Houston, who did the same with the Oilers for 37
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   What will be even more aggravating to these people is that one
of the miscreants responsible for the shift in
residences &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; either the Oilers' Bud Adams, or the Rams' Georgia
Frontiere &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; will be strutting on center stage this evening
celebrating a Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   The hunch here is that person will be Georgia Frontiere, which
would reaffirm once again that hoariest of maxims that good things
tend to happen to good people.
</P>
<P>
   The guess here is that Tennessee's remarkable post-season run
that included the Music City Miracle over Buffalo to go with
stirring road victories over the Indianapolis Colts and
Jacksonville Jaguars finally will come to an unfortunate conclusion
in a blizzard of Kurt Warner completions to Marshall Faulk, Isaac
Bruce and Torry Holt.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't figure to be a runaway victory for the Rams, as were
most of their triumphs during a regular season in which they were
blessed to have one of the weakest schedules in NFL history, facing
only one team, Tennessee, that wound up with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Rams lost 24-21 to the Titans on the grass at
Adelphia Coliseum would seem to bode well for Tennessee, which
seems to have developed a knack this season for repeating victories
over good teams (the Titans beat Jacksonville) three times).
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams are a team built specifically for the indoors, and
their array of whippet-quick performers &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; Faulk, Bruce, Holt, as
well as Az-Zahir Hakim and Tony Horne &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; figures to break a few
long ones against a gambling Titan defense weakened by the injury
to its extraordinary free safety, Marcus Robertson, who broke his
ankle last week against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   The heralded Ram offense, the highest-scoring in the NFL this
season, was muffled thoroughly a week ago by Tampa Bay, and only a
late scoring pass from Warner to Ricky Proehl enabled St. Louis to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   There are those observers who now feel that the Rams' regular
season numbers were inflated by the poor quality of the opposition,
and that Dick Vermeil's team isn't nearly as dominant when it faces
a stern adversary.
</P>
<P>
   That might be true, but no team other than the Oakland Raiders
this season was able to torment a Buccaneer defense that ranks
among the best in recent NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans' defense isn't bad, either, but it's no where near as
stingy as Tampa Bay's, having this season yielded 35 points to the
Cincinnati Bengals, 41 points to the Baltimore Ravens and 36 points
to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee coach, Jeff Fisher, likes to blitz, and that will
create pressure on Warner. But it also will leave a lot of the Ram
receivers being covered by only one defender, which could result in
some lengthy touchdowns for the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Titans don't figure to take such a route to the
end zone, since their quarterback, Steve McNair, has had only one
completion in the post-season for more than 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tennessee's most successful advancements on offense this
January have come on the strong running of Eddie George and the
madcap scrambles of McNair, who has thrown for a total of only 300
yards during the playoffs and whose 40 completions include 31 for
10 yards or less.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, with their bruising, pocket-sized middle linebacker,
London Fletcher, have been one of the toughest teams in the league
this season to run against &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; and George and McNair figure to
endure their miseries today.
</P>
<P>
   But who knows for sure?
</P>
<P>
   The Titans somehow have been able to navigate a daunting playoff
gauntlet, and have that destiny aura about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just find a way to win each time out, and I think the same
thing will happen against the Rams,'' says the Titans' 38-year-old,
6-5, 305-pound guard, Bruce Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Titan defense will stifle the Rams' attack like the
Buccaneers did, and maybe Eddie George and Steven McNair will
dispense their heroics again for this unlikely team.
</P>
<P>
   But it's difficult to envision this explosive Ram offense being
contained a second consecutive Sunday on the turf.
</P>
<P>
   And thus expect to see the ungodly spectacle of George
Frontiere, the seven-time married Ram owner, on the Ram sidelines
late in the fourth quarter tonight, savoring a 30-20 win by her
minions and defying the laws of compensation yet again.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: McCain still leading in N.H.
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three New Hampshire tracking polls covering several days ending
Friday showed John McCain leading slightly over George W. Bush in
the state's presidential primary race, while Vice President Al Gore
stayed ahead of Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN-USA Today-Gallup had McCain with 36 percent to 35 percent
for Bush and 17 percent for Steve Forbes. The American Research
Group had that race 34-32-17, while a WMUR-Fox News poll by the
University of New Hampshire Survey Center had it 41-33-16. Alan
Keyes had 8 percent and Gary Bauer 1 percent in all three polls.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore led 51-43 in the first poll, 50-43
in the second and 54-42 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The margins of error were from 3 to 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is golf mag cover boy
</P>
<P>
   He's made the cover of most major U.S. magazines; now George W.
Bush is on Travel &AMP; Leisure Golf, which features a story on the
family golf legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Many golf fans are aware the Texas governor provided an
inspirational spark that helped last fall's U.S. Ryder Cup team to
victory. On Sept. 25, with the Europeans holding a commanding lead,
Bush gave a spirited reading of a letter that Col. William Barret
Travis wrote from the Alamo: ``I shall never surrender or retreat.
... Victory or death.'' The Americans ended up winning, and Ben
Crenshaw, the team captain and a fellow Texan, commented afterward:
``The governor's speech hit 'em pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's involvement in golf comes naturally, the article notes.
George Herbert Walker, the grandfather of former President Bush,
was president of the United States Golf Association in 1920. The
Walker Cup, which pits the United States against Great Britain and
Ireland, was named for him. Prescott Bush, George W.'s grandfather,
was secretary, vice president and president of the USGA and
maintained a two handicap well into his golden years.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes visits cardinal
</P>
<P>
   Forbes on Friday visited the Boston home of Cardinal Bernard
Law, spiritual leader of millions of New England Catholics.
Although a spokesman for Law said the meeting did not constitute an
endorsement, it was a symbolic coup for Forbes as he courts
religious conservatives in New Hampshire, home to an estimated
300,000 Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is being seen here as a courtesy visit,'' said a
spokesman for the cardinal. ``Nothing should be read into this.''
Forbes added that Law was ``not going to immerse himself in the
politics of the Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the meeting so close to Tuesday's primary appeared to be
a tacit show of support for a candidate who shares Law's strong
conservative views on issues like abortion and assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley fully anesthetized during heart treatment
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign staff acknowledged Saturday that on three
occasions _ none since May 1998 _ doctors have had to render him
unconscious with anaesthesia to treat his irregular heart beat.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley himself conceded that if elected to the White House, he
might have to surrender executive power temporarily to his vice
president using the 25th Amendment process if the same medical
procedure became necessary again. In that process, doctors use
electric jolts to restore normal heart rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and his cardiologist have said his condition is not
life-threatening and would not impede his ability to serve as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Steinem enjoying abortion debate
</P>
<P>
   Feminist Gloria Steinem couldn't have it any better in the
Democratic presidential race. She says she's happy to see the two
major Democratic candidates debating over who is more pro-choice,
because, she says, ``It proves two facts: First, the huge majority
of Americans believe that the abortion decision should be made by a
woman and her doctor. Second, the Republican presidential
nomination is in the hands of anti-choice extremists who don't
represent the majority of even their own party.'' Steinem supports
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush beat Bradley on SAT?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a Rhodes scholar who is sometimes described as
professorial, scored a 485 on his verbal SAT, according to The New
Yorker magazine. That's lower than the 566 reportedly earned on the
same test by Bush, who has had to defend his intellect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's acknowledged that he was an affirmative action case for
getting into Princeton,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser. But,
``there are few people ... who would doubt his intellectual
capacity.''

TYSON SHOES HIS OPPONENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, England _ The Daily Mirror got its money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   The British tabloid paid Julius Francis $40,000 last week to put
advertisements on the soles of his boxing shoes in the belief that
Mike Tyson eventually would make them visible.
</P>
<P>
   In just over four minutes, the public got to read them five
times.
</P>
<P>
   Francis took six minutes to make the walk Saturday from his
locker room to the ring in MEN Arena, and Tyson took 4:03 to send
him sprawling back in the same direction before referee Roy Francis
stopped the carnage in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson flattened Francis five times, overwhelming him with body
shots that crackled his ribs and uppercuts to the face that tipped
him over again and again until the referee finally tired of picking
up his namesake.
</P>
<P>
   This process of annihilation began not long after the opening
bell when Tyson landed the first of what would be an impressive
array of body punches that sapped Francis. But it was a short right
uppercut that first dropped him at 2:12 of the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   As Francis slumped to his knees, it seemed he was pondering the
wisdom of pushing himself skyward. Gamely he did. Don't ask why.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson pursued him wildly at that point but failed to land
another telling blow until a straight left dropped Francis again
just as the bell sounded to end the first round.
</P>
<P>
   So one-sided were the predictions for this affair that that in
itself was a moral victory for Francis. As things turned out, it
would be the only victory available to him.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after Round 2 began, poor Francis tasted the canvas
again after a fierce short left hook tore into him.
</P>
<P>
   Gamely, he rose again, only to be dropped within seconds from a
crushing left to the body that was the last of a string of such
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Francis the referee now was watching Francis the fighter closely
and so was Tyson, who twice cracked him to the body with nasty
hooks before dropping Francis for the fifth and final time with
another left hook that convinced both Francises it was time to
knock off early and go get a pint of bitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What surprised me were those short punches inside,'' said
Francis (21-8).
</P>
<P>
   ``All those punches hurt me. I went in thinking I had it right
to fight Tyson but you don't always get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're Tyson in a situation like the one he found himself
in Saturady night _ facing an opponent who could not match his hand
speed, foot speed, power, or aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a real destructive mood tonight,'' Tyson (47-3, 41
KOs) said. ``This is what I wanted to do every time out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether he was referring to the quickness of the
victory or the ineptness of his opponent. ``I was surprised he kept
getting up,'' Tyson said, as Francis sat next to him beaming with
pride that was difficult to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   If he had known Francis would so closely follow the script
Showtime had hoped for, Tyson might not have nearly ended things
prematurely 24 hours earlier when he broke and ran for the airport,
threatening to return to America without going through with the
(mis)match.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this may have been (a) fear of failure; (b) his
endless insecurities; (c) his wife, Monica, not showing up in
either London or Manchester as planned; or (d) British promoter
Frank Warren refusing to cover the $1.6 million cost of the emerald
and diamond watch and bracelet Tyson bought for himself earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   This was a fight less about money and more about opportunity
than any Tyson has had in a while. He was brought here not just to
earn big money or another victory. He was brought here to earn back
a fast-fading reputation and his own self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the whole promotion, this was a resounding
success,'' said Showtime executive Jay Larkin. ``His state of mind
after this was very important. The experience here has done
wonders.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tyson was headline news in England for 10 days, he has
been anything but that in the States.
</P>
<P>
   His box office appeal has been shrinking, his TV ratings have
softened, his saleability on pay-per-view has so been in question
that he has not appeared there since he bit Evander Holyfield's
ears in June 1997, and his volatility in the ring has so tarnished
him that his handlers felt he needed to leave the country for his
own good.
</P>
<P>
   What he needed to transcend some of his recent troubles was just
what he got. A chance to bring his own music to the dance. If Tyson
did not at least put up the fiction that there was still some iron
left in him, his problems as well as those of his promoters would
have deepened.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this goes into the fifth round I'm sitting in a warm tub
opening a vein,'' Larkin said before the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry.

HUD'S ``SMOKE SHOP'' FUNDING CRITICIZED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has come under
fire from anti-smoking advocates following a Senate report critical
of the agency for issuing $4.2 million in funding for construction
of six discount cigarette shops on Indian land.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anti-smoking advocates said the report was disturbing in light
of the Clinton administration's hard-line stance against smoking,
especially among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly one branch of the federal government not knowing
what the other is up to,'' said Matthew Myers, president of the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. ``It's amazing that no one would
see the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The report revealed that HUD had issued $4.2 million in
community development block grant funding to Indian tribes to build
six discount cigarette outlets known as ``smoke shops,'' primarily
in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the Indians say the smoke shops, like casinos and
bingo parlors, are the only venues for impoverished Indian
communities to generate revenues. Because of their sovereign
status, Indian communities can assess lower cigarette taxes than
bordering states, thus making the outlets lucrative operations.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., initiated the study after learning that
HUD had awarded $450,000 to the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony in Verdi,
Nev., last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said when he asked HUD officials about the funding of smoke
shops, he was told only one had been funded, which prompted the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the policy of the Clinton administration that we
ought to be discouraging teen-age smoking and not encouraging it.
Selling cigarettes at a discount is a way of encouraging teen-age
smoking,'' said Bond, who chairs the Appropriations Committee that
oversees HUD's budget.
</P>
<P>
   David Egner, HUD spokesman, said the agency cannot deny funding
for qualified applicants based on the politics of the smoking
debate. He said inner-city stores that stock cigarettes also
receive block grant funding, but no one is complaining about those
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Such funding is issued for a broad range of projects from sewer
and lighting to economic development. The purpose of the program is
to benefit low- and moderate-income people and help eliminate or
prevent blight in impoverished areas. In fiscal 2000, HUD budgeted
$4.8 billion for CDBG funding.
</P>
<P>
   When Bond raised the issue last June, Egner said the senator was
encouraged to introduce legislation for provisions banning such
funding, which he never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``His report condemns his own inaction,'' Egner said.
</P>
<P>
   He described the criticism as a further example of ``advocating
increased federal micromanagement on the way local government and
Indian tribes use federal funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Allen, vice president of the National Congress of American
Indians, said he found the focus on cigarette outlets on Indian
land unfair because the sale of cigarettes at discount prices is
not illegal or unusual. He said Virginia's low cigarette tax
invites customers from neighboring states and that large tobacco
companies pride themselves in being able to undersell competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he questioned the attack on federal funding for a handful
of smoke shops when tobacco farmers enjoy federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not quite clear what his agenda is here. (Bond) has
always been very critical of HUD and (HUD secretary Andrew)
Cuomo,'' Allen said. ``Some of us believe he is on a witch-hunt to
taint Cuomo and some of the most impoverished communities in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's focusing in on the small guys in the market and that's an
easy target. If he really wants to make a lot of noise for himself
he should go after the big boys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The question has surfaced before. In 1998, when the most
comprehensive anti-smoking legislation ever written went before
Congress, Bonds voted against the tobacco bill, which was
eventually defeated. The bill was designed to curb the propensity
to sell cigarettes to children, an issue Bonds has championed since
his days as governor of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   In defending his vote, Bond said the bill lacked sanctions
penalizing teen-agers by making them responsible for their actions,
and sanctions against parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Bond came under attack after he attended a private meeting
hours before the June 17, 1998, vote called by Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., who assured those in the meeting that the tobacco
companies would continue running ads defending a congressional
defeat of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry spent more than $1 million in television
advertising in the St. Louis area from April to mid-July, the third
largest media buy in the country for such ads, according to the
National Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Bond dismissed the allegations, which were investigated by the
Justice Department, as a ``classic example of changing the message
and attacking the messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is so much hogwash, they have no justification for this
misuse of federal funds so they attack me. And frankly, that one
does not bother me in the least because it has absolutely nothing
to do with the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Myers took issue with Bond's vote on the tobacco bill,
saying that his explanation for voting against the measure had no
merit.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said his objection to the issuance of block grant funding
for smoke shops is based on his belief that taxpayers' dollars
should not be used to build stores that sell cheap cigarettes,
making it easier for teenagers to maintain smoking habits.
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed HUD's claim that its hands are tied without
provisions specifically banning the use of community development
funds for smoke shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sheer nonsense. Their own regulations say that there
must be a public benefit. Would they fund a house of prostitution
if that was a revenue generator?'' Bond asked. ``It is, simply put,
an outrage that they are using these scarce dollars to fund
something that is not a public benefit. We should not be using
federal funds to encourage smoking among the general population,
especially among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to stop doing it. If they can't figure out how to
run their CDBG program, we will tell them how to do it.''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and

criticism from publishing houses.)

GREAT EXPECTATIONS NOT THE STORY IN TODAY'S SUPER BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is exactly what the NFL didn't want. A Super Bowl
with two vagabond franchises, both void of championship pedigree
and national appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Which is another way of saying what happens here today is a
cheap imitation of normal NFL expectations for its glorious event.
</P>
<P>
   Kinda the same as Bud Adams' hairpiece, obviously a homemade
item, or Georgia Frontiere's marriage vows, based on those seven
ex-husbands, living, dead or just out on parole.
</P>
<P>
   As if Tennessee Titans and St. Louis Rams aren't difficult
enough to sell, league executives are also forced to
squirm-and-bear-it on Bud and Georgia as Super Bowl team owners.
The clueless have arrived in the big-time.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it, however, to the ample talents of commissioner Paul
Tagliabue when it came to applying the proper spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this Super Bowl matchup demonstrates,'' said Tagliabue,
``is the strength of our system. And that our system works.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a Super Bowl is not a matter of how much money is
involved, or being in the biggest city. Fans of every team are
assured by what they see here in Atlanta that winning a
championship is available for one and all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, can consider that a shot
fired right past his ear. Major League Baseball is struggling with
a severe competitive balance headache, otherwise known as the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, however, can also fire back, with Tags as the target.
</P>
<P>
   The last major-league team to yank up roots and relocate was the
Washington Senators in 1972. How could you possibly say no to
former Arlington mayor Tom Vandergriff?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, while bragging on NFL competitive balance, had to
quickly shift to a verbal soft shoe when attempting to answer the
U-Haul nature of the NFL. In football, franchises are here today
and gone tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the other cloud over today's game. Both the
Rams and Titans departed their longtime homes within the past five
years. In Houston, Bud Adams will forever be remembered as greedy
and incompetent. The same goes for Georgia in Los Angeles. But now
Bud prospers in Nashville and Georgia in St. Louis, mainly because
of sweetheart stadium deals.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Tagliabue's state-of-the-NFL speech here Friday was
about how much the NFL tries to discourage clubs from leaving. But
Tags also works for those same owners who always have leaving on
their minds. So he was quick to defend Adams when Houston media
started asking hardball questions. Houston, of course, has been
awarded an NFL expansion team, but that doesn't mean Bud is
forgiven for 37 years of ownership sins.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even competitive balance, which is a legitimate NFL
brag, is a hard sell to TV networks and TV audiences. The networks
are paying zillions for NFL rights, and it's no secret they want
teams that have traditional appeal to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to justify Rams and Titans being in the Super Bowl,
Tagliabue had to admit that ``it takes the general fandom longer to
catch on to emerging clubs as opposed to Cowboys and Steelers.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the ``system'' Tagliabue crowed about, has worked
too well. That system is a strict salary cap, plus the rewarding of
bad clubs with higher draft picks and an easier schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But mainly, it has been the salary cap that has taken apart the
Cowboys, the 49ers, the Packers, etc., and now these are uncharted
seas the NFL is sailing. Due to the ``system,'' the Titans and Rams
figure to be only the first wave of Super Bowl clubs that are
basically a national mystery. All this while a sure draw like the
Cowboys dies the slow football death.
</P>
<P>
   Believe this _ the final score this evening won't end with which
team has the most points in the Georgia Dome. Just as important to
the NFL will be that set of numbers that shows the size of the TV
audience. The immense financial success of the league is driven by
network money. In return, the networks want showbiz, while caring
less about any ``system'' that works.
</P>
<P>
   But the game itself today may help to soothe both network and
league nerves. The on-the-field matchup of Titans and Rams has
plenty of potential for entertainment and good-to-the-last-drop
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, that's what still matters most in the NFL, even
beyond the almighty TV dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a season of surprises, and these two teams exemplify
just that,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   The best surprise of all would be a good game.

PHOENIX OPEN FOR BUSINESS, NOT PLEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   interesting moment unexpectedly occurred at the Phoenix Open,
and it shocked organizers to such a degree they quickly outlawed
any activity that might lead to another.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, the pre-eminent golfer in the world, stepped to the
tee at the 155-yard, par-3 16th hole. He lofted a high, arching
shot that landed about 4 feet from the hole, bounced then trickled
into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the moment.
</P>
<P>
   It came a fraction of a second later, when a gallery of slightly
tipsy, slightly ill-mannered, relatively unschooled and completely
euphoric spectators went nuts.
</P>
<P>
   The cheers continued to rise as Woods pumped his fist and walked
down the fairway to the green. Even if you've never seen a golf
tournament, film of the gallery's reaction to Woods' hole-in-one
will give you chills.
</P>
<P>
   It's something to behold, particularly since there's no way in
hell it'll ever happen again. Not here, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Having actual sports fans at a golf tournament apparently scared
the daylights out of organizers and sponsors of the Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a guy heckling Woods from the gallery was led off and
found to be carrying a gun. That was the end of it. Security was
beefed up. Alcohol sales were cut back. And promises were made to
strictly enforce ``decorum.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Matteucci, the tournament chairman, recently told an
``Arizona Republic'' reporter, ``Almost always issues are directly
related to irresponsible alcohol use, but we also are seeing
younger fans who simply do not know proper golf etiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can tell, ``proper golf etiquette'' requires
spectators to stand in reverential silence as participants perform
their solemn duties. Sort of like a funeral. Only more gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, American golfer Justin Leonard stroked a 45-foot putt
to win the 1999 Ryder Cup _ a contest between European and American
teams. The other Americans leaped in the air and stormed the green.
</P>
<P>
   European vice captain Sam Torrance described the celebration as
one of ``the most disgusting scenes I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   A columnist for London's ``Evening Standard'' wrote,
``(Americans) are a repulsive people . . . as odious in victory as
they are unsporting in defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   To which we should have responded, ``Yeah, so what's your
point?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, American golfers admitted to having gone a little
overboard and perhaps not showing enough ``class.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, this namby-pamby attitude rules golf contests throughout
the land, including our own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't surprise us. Sponsors spend a lot of money on
tournaments. The idea is to impress clients by offering them
proximity _ perhaps even access _ to professional golfers. They're
businessmen. They don't invite riff-raff into the office.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Open is a board meeting conducted in ugly trousers
and two-tone shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I won't be at the tournament today. I'll be at
home watching another sports program, cheering and jeering in my
odious, unsporting, American way. Then, when the pre-game show is
over, I'll watch the Super Bowl and get ``really'' rowdy.
</P>
<P>
   In my absence, however, perhaps one of you can lead properly
schooled members of the Phoenix Open gallery in a rousing cheer
known well to dignified linksmen:
</P>
<P>
   Gimme an ``S.'' Gimme an ``H.'' Gimme another ``H.'' Gimme
another ``H.'' Gimme another ``H.''

SACRED SOIL, BITTER DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   land.
</P>
<P>
   The earth. The rocky soil beneath the feet of Katherine Smith,
80, as she treads the vast landscape of northeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It is an immense, wild place, racing across high-desert ranges,
climbing onto plateaus of pinon and juniper forest, rearing up into
towering mesas, then plunging suddenly into multicolored canyons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our songs and our prayers are tied to this place,'' Smith says
in the clipped tones of the English she learned in her two years of
formal schooling in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   But that bond is about to be severed forever.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, dozens of Navajos such as Smith will, by federal
law, become trespassers on the lands of their birth.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, in December 1974, President Ford
interrupted a Colorado skiing vacation to sign a law forcing
thousands of Navajos to move.
</P>
<P>
   The law has turned the land over to the nearby Hopis, for whom
it is also hallowed ground.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Navajos call this the world of the Hero Twins _
Child Born of Water and Monster Slayer _ who received powers from
their father the sun to slay bloody monsters.
</P>
<P>
   They made this remote, rocky place safe for the Dine, ``The
People,'' as the Navajos call themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is safe no longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopis won a long, bitter battle in Congress, arguing that
the larger Navajo Tribe had gradually taken over much of their
land. The Hopis insisted that their survival and simple justice
required that the Navajos be moved back.
</P>
<P>
   But this forced relocation of thousands of Navajos is more than
the latest episode in an intertribal feud. It's also the last,
haunting echo of America's controversial policy of Indian removal.
Critics say it is tainted with racism; they argue that if the
settlers on Hopi land were non-Indian, they would never be evicted.
</P>
<P>
   And it has targeted some of the last traditional Indians living
in the continental United States. They dwell far from mainstream
America, over axle-bending dirt roads that turn to mud after the
driving summer storms Navajos call ``male rain.''
</P>
<P>
   They have little understanding of the English language or White
people's laws. They believe the land is alive with sacred power,
that gods _ Diyiin Dine, the Holy People _ live in the springs, the
rain, the wind.
</P>
<P>
   About 13,900 Navajos have bowed to the Bilagaana Bi Behaasani,
the ``White Man's Law,'' as the relocation act is often called. It
has cleared out entire communities with the relentlessness of a
glacier.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1974 thought it could get the job done in a few
years at a cost of about $40 million. Twenty-five years later,
relocation goes on, and the cost to taxpayers is approaching a
half-billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Navajos remain, anchored by the sturdy women of Big
Mountain and a few other places. Some, including Katherine Smith's
daughter, have accepted the 1996 ``accommodation agreement'' that
allows signers to stay for 75 years under Hopi jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some Navajos, known as ``resisters,'' cannot bring
themselves to acknowledge either Hopi ownership or the Feb. 1
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials in Phoenix promise there will be no marshals
on the disputed lands this week. Not yet. But after eviction
proceedings make their way through federal court, the marshals are
likely to move in unless the Navajos give in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no choice,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Lodge said,
``but to enforce the law.'' &QL; 
Pauline Whitesinger, Katherine Smith's half sister, reacts to the
news with bewilderment and defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I wonder what exactly caused it,'' she said. ``Is
it because we didn't offer enough prayers and corn pollen to the
Holy People? Are we being punished because we are joining other
religions, like the Christians and the Native American Church?''
</P>
<P>
   Other times, her temper flares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them bring out the policemen and the guns and the tanks,''
she said. ``We'll see who's standing at the end. Let's get this
over with.''
</P>
<P>
   It is almost over, even though critics such as anthropologist
David Aberle have for years urged Congress to reject relocation.
Aberle and others cite a long-standing federal policy of resolving
Indian land claims without dislodging settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schifter, an attorney for the Navajos, told Congress
that relocation embodies a racist double standard and a deviation
from past federal policy in Indian land disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it be, may I ask, that where the settlers are White, we
pay off the original owners in cash; but where the settlers are
Indian, we find expulsion and removal an acceptable alternative?''
</P>
<P>
   Forrest Gerard, a staffer on the Senate Interior committee that
endorsed the 1974 bill, concedes Schifter's point.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of the legislative land-claims settlements that I
looked at or was involved in, we never once dislocated a non-Indian
party,'' Gerard said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gerard said, many congressmen looked to Arizona Sen.
Barry Goldwater for guidance. Goldwater initially straddled the
fence between the two tribes. But after a bitter political feud in
the 1970s with then-Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald, he came down
strongly on the Hopi side, calling for the eviction of Navajos from
911,000 acres of high-desert rangeland.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater promised that relocation would be good for the
Navajos. He said the new homes provided in the law made it ``a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for them to improve their lives.'' &QL; 
In some cases, he was right. Many young Navajos, educated and
culturally mobile, have been happy to receive the new homes
provided by the law.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Pahi, a secretary in the office of the Maricopa County
attorney, used the $79,000 check she received to make a hefty down
payment on her Phoenix house.
</P>
<P>
   Some Navajos who left moved onto the reservation. Others have
moved to places like Flagstaff and Winslow and Phoenix, where some
have thrived, using federal relocation benefits of up to $82,000 to
get a head start on the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   But many other relocatees have found only loneliness and misery
in their new homes. There also is widespread agreement that the
whole relocation effort has been hampered by federal bungling,
political cronyism and drastic underestimates of the cost both in
taxpayer dollars and human suffering.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Forcibly relocating people with a strong tie to the land is
about the worst thing you can do to them short of killing them,''
said Thayer Scudder, professor of anthropology at the California
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Calling relocation ``a cultural disaster'' for the Navajos,
Scudder said, ``I'm increasingly seeing it as an American version
of ethnic cleansing. You can't tell me we would have done that with
Anglos or any other population in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as the most unjustified, unethical involuntary
relocation in the United States since the relocation of
Japanese-Americans in World War II.'' &QL; 
The home Pauline Whitesinger clings to is 12 miles from the nearest
phone, about 25 miles from pavement. To outsiders, it is the
forlorn middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   To her, it is the vibrant center of everything. A plain-spoken
woman whose life is defined by the chores required by her sheep
camp, cornfield and small stone house, she speaks in Navajo about
her ties to this rolling land of dark-green pinon and sandy range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the children of the earth, of the bright-colored
corn,'' she said, her face deeply creased by sun, work and worry.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Smith's most precious possession is a bag of dirt, a
ceremonial bundle of buckskin containing soil from the Navajos'
four sacred mountains.
</P>
<P>
   So, Smith was not swayed by her visit to the so-called New
Lands, the government-built community east of Holbrook that offers
new homes and a chance to graze livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tension is a result of the 1996 accommodation
agreement, which allowed Navajos to remain on Hopi land if they
signed a lease acknowledging Hopi jurisdiction and defining how
they may use the land.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Navajos have done so, the dozens of resisters
insist they are bound to the land by their religion.
</P>
<P>
   The accommodation agreement grew out of a Navajo lawsuit that
made exactly that claim _ charging that relocation violated the
Navajos' constitutional right to practice their religion.
</P>
<P>
   A federal Appeals Court asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Harry McCue
of San Diego to step in to mediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most significant contact I have ever had with other
human beings,'' said McCue, 72, adding that he came to respect both
tribes' commitment to the land.
</P>
<P>
   McCue said he began to understand the tenacity of elderly
Navajos when he saw a woman living under a plastic sheet at the
side of a sandstone plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than accept relocation benefits, the woman clung to the
land. Barred by court order from replacing her house, she lived in
a hole in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really overwhelmed by the realization that here is a
society that is truly attached to the land,'' McCue said, ``not
just physically, but spiritually and emotionally.'' &QL;

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Leon Smith looked at his right arm, then at his left.
As he awoke in a hospital after a suicide attempt, he asked a
doctor why only the left arm still had an intravenous line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach said to take the IV out of your right arm,'' she
said. ``He said that's your shooting hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith wondered why a team that did not want him around would
make sure that his shooting hand was spared. The coach, the Dallas
Mavericks assistant Bill Peterson, said later that he could not
think of any other way to help _ besides offering a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Smith semiconscious that day last November at Parkland
Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Peterson was no longer observing the
big, strong 19-year-old with vast athletic potential, a
6-foot-10-inch, 240-pound Chicago schoolboy star who was selected
in the first round of the NBA draft last June. Smith was now a
deeply troubled soul who had tried to end his life by ingesting a
half-bottle of aspirin, approximately 250 tablets' worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't instruct the doctor to take the IV out, I just
mentioned it,'' Peterson recalled. ``People can look at that the
way they want, but at least I got in there to visit him. Where was
everybody else when Leon needed help?''
</P>
<P>
   The question has haunted, if not defined Leon Smith from the
very beginning. Abandoned by his father and removed from his
mother's custody when he was 5, Smith grew up a ward of the state
of Illinois. He moved from group home to shelter, forced sometimes
to rummage through Dumpsters for food with his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   But he could play the game. At Martin Luther King High School in
Chicago, he dominated opponents routinely enough to be considered
one of America's top hoop prospects. He had his mind set on
following the path of other prep superstars who skipped college and
went right to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But if Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett are models of players who
were mature enough athletically and emotionally to make that huge
jump, Leon Smith's sad and tumultuous basketball odyssey is a
cautionary tale _ one that is forcing the NBA to rethink how to
decide which teen-agers are capable of going right from high school
to the pros and what to do with those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   Smith stormed out of the gym during his first practice with the
Mavericks last summer. He fired two agents in three months. He was
arrested twice, had his contract suspended and spent 31 days in a
Dallas psychiatric center after his suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unfair to call Leon a poster child for anything
but Leon,'' David Stern, the NBA commissioner, said. ``All of these
young men are individuals. But I remain convinced, in a broader
context, that we need to disincentivize players who have other
options from coming into the NBA too young.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is here in Houston now, living in a two-bedroom apartment
with a childhood friend. He is working out daily, hoping to earn
another shot in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks new owner, Mark Cuban, recently indicated that he
wanted to keep Smith. But the players association has told the team
that Smith would not return if Don Nelson, its coach and general
manager, remains in Dallas. Smith has already signed an agreement
that pays him his $1.45 million contract over ten years instead of
the original three.
</P>
<P>
   He will soon work out, but it is unclear whether he will return
to the NBA this season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and the people around him understand there are more
important hurdles to clear. And while many people who were close to
Smith in Chicago are busy assigning blame, Smith says he is ready
to accept responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it on myself,'' he said before a recent workout in
Houston. ``When I was in the hospital, I had time to grow up. I sat
in my room and I cried. I sat in there and thought about what I
did, and realized that things didn't have to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the executive director of the National Basketball
Players Association, and Purvis Short, the union's director of
player programs, have spent the past two months helping Smith put
his life back together. He still attends counseling sessions in
Dallas and Houston, and he has been off all medication for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family from Chicago have painted the Mavericks as an
organization not equipped to deal with such a sensitive situation.
Smith, though, bears no strong resentment toward anyone. Not even a
system that caters to impressionable teen-agers who happen to play
basketball well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did the best they could even when they didn't know to
help me,'' he said. ``I don't hold grudges. And I don't feel sorry
for myself. I'm here now. That's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had long dreamed of playing in the NBA, and he had no
shortage of elders and peers to help nurture the fantasy. In
elementary school, he once blocked 27 shots in a single game. In
his freshman year in high school, Smith says, he decided he wanted
to become a pro some day. He had grown nearly 5 inches over the
previous summer, to a gangly and uncoordinated 6 feet 9 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my teammates were teasing me, saying, `You can't block a
shot, you can't even dunk,''' he said. ``I couldn't. My knees hurt
so bad. But Kevin Garnett had just come out of high school the year
before. So I was, like, `Man, I bet you I go straight from high
school to the NBA'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   After his junior year in high school, Smith attended Sonny
Vaccaro's prestigious ABCD camp at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
The camp is a showcase for many of the country's top high school
stars. Vaccaro approached Smith after the camp ended, asking him if
he wanted to be drafted in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Smith said, his voice thick with excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a done deal,'' Vaccaro told him.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Bauer, whose mother runs a group home where Smith lived for
eight years, said the conversation was a watershed. ``Once Sonny
confirmed it, Leon became obsessed with making it,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Competing for space on the wall of Smith's room were posters and
pictures of nearly every current NBA player who skipped college and
turned pro. Kobe Bryant, sailing in for a dunk. Kevin Garnett,
scowling while harnessing a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Smith led nationally ranked King High to the Chicago public
school championship his senior year, averaging 25 points, 15
rebounds and eight blocked shots a game. He briefly explored
enrolling at Fresno State and Rhode Island, but he feared that his
poor grades would force him to sit out a year to become eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be on TV,'' he said. ``That's all I wanted to be.
I wanted to get out of the projects. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith acknowledged that he made his decision without much
consultation. ``A lot of these kids have families, and their
families could show them how to handle themselves in certain
situations,'' he said. ``I didn't have a family. They can put it on
me, but if a child decides he wants to come out of high school and
play in the NBA, that's his decision. And if the teams feel like
he's ready, then I think he should do it.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Smith's first agent, Dan Fegan, said, ``Look, Leon wanted to do
this. No one was going to tell him he couldn't. People may have
given him ideas about turning pro, but he wasn't pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was selected with the final pick of the draft's first
round last June. The Mavericks had not met him or worked him out.
The following month, Smith flew from Chicago to Dallas with his
only possession, a bag of dirty laundry. He moved into an
unfurnished, upscale apartment. With loans, he bought two beds, a
television and stereo equipment.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just threw him a little bit,'' said Doris Bauer,
the woman who ran the Lydia Home, where Smith lived from age 5 to
13. ``He was used to coming home to people, and all of a sudden
he's got a big, empty apartment with nothing. Leon was alone
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's first practice with the Mavericks ended with him
storming off the floor in front of television cameras. Another
player had been slow running sprints, so Donnie Nelson, an
assistant coach, told the group to run again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go run the sprints,'' Smith told Nelson, who asked Smith
to repeat himself because he was so stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson, the team's coach and general manager (and Donnie
Nelson's father) soon decided that Smith was too disruptive to be
allowed around the team. He assigned Peterson and Kiki Vandeweghe,
another assistant coach, to work with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, there was just a lot of frustration,'' Smith
said. ``When they first drafted me, they were telling me I had to
go somewhere else to get my game. I felt like they were cheating me
out of my opportunities. I put my name in the NBA draft, because I
felt I could play in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks decided that Smith was not ready to play in the
league, and told him that one way to improve his raw game was to
play for a year with a minor league team in St. Louis. Smith
resisted. His heart was set on following his heroes by going right
into the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson felt Smith's presence was so disruptive that he pleaded
with Smith's new agent, Matt Muehlebach, to make sure his client
did not attend the Mavericks' season opener Nov. 2 _ Smith's 19th
birthday. Undeterred, Smith paid for his own plane ticket from
Chicago and bought a ticket to the game from a scalper. The
Mavericks contend that a season ticket-holder gave Smith the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt him more than anything,'' said Short. ``The team not
wanting him around really set him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and the Mavericks have been accused of gross negligence
in their handling of Smith, especially by Smith's supporters in
Chicago. ``They treated him like a piece of meat,'' said Sonny Cox,
Smith's high school coach. ``Dallas did that boy wrong. They talk
about a support system, but they're trying to save their own
behinds at this point. They segregated Leon from everyone instead
of truly trying to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson defended the team's actions and insisted that there
was a support system for Smith. But he also conceded that he had
drafted Smith for one simple reason: Nelson and other Mavericks
officials were very worried that the Lakers were going to use the
first pick in the second round to acquire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the lack of big, talented people in the NBA, and
in college basketball, and if we didn't take him someone else would
have,'' said Donnie Nelson. ``That was the worst draft in 10 years.
If you're going to take a risk, the rule of thumb is, take it on a
big guy with some potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't delve into Leon's medical records, but we knew
about the issues and the challenges. It just goes against any
grain. You do not cut or trade talented young players, unless it's
for fantastic reasons. Leon had a 7-foot-5 wingspan. Looking back,
maybe you sometimes get blinded by talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Said one high-ranking league official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, ``They can defend themselves all they want, but how do
you draft a player without ever talking to him?''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure built on Smith. Friends kept calling him for money.
He felt the Mavericks did not want him around. Then he and his
girlfriend, Cassie Pondexter, a 16-year-old basketball star in
Chicago, broke up.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 14, Smith swallowed the aspirin tablets and was found by
a friend, passed out on the floor of his Dallas town house, with
green war paint smeared on his face. After being released from the
hospital, he returned two weeks later to Chicago, where he was
immediately arrested twice within two days for threatening
Pondexter and damaging her mother's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to tell anymore that I was hurt, because I
was,'' Smith said. ``When you care for somebody, you want to see
them. I had to get past that.''

</P>
<P>
   People in the NBA are struggling with the lessons of Leon
Smith's saga.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just lay this off on the league and say it somehow
failed him,'' said Gregg Popovich, the coach and general manager of
the San Antonio Spurs, who had actually drafted Smith with the
intention of trading him to the Mavericks in a prearranged
deal.``They've got numerous programs to help them. But if we're
going to draft these young kids, individual teams are going to have
to install the proper support systems. Economically, emotionally,
psychologically or whatever, they need more support than we're
currently giving them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, the NBA commissioner, said, ``This is an area we and the
players have to look at again.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This isn't an expertise that we come to easily, but
we're determined to do whatever is necessary to ease the transition
of these young men.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Smith is trying to learn from his experience. On this day in
Houston, he looks at the rim and down at his feet behind the
3-point line. He is going one on one with Ashley Hunter, a mature
20-year-old with whom Smith grew up and who lives with him on the
recommendation of the players association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottoms up!'' Smith says as he releases a rainbow jump shot
from 25 feet away on the left baseline.
</P>
<P>
   The ball passes gently through the net at the Westside Tennis
Complex, where the Rockets practice in the morning and a
19-year-old trying to make a comeback practices in the afternoon.
Hunter retrieves the ball and tosses it off the backboard for his
friend, who leaps high and tomahawks it through the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm ready to play on this level,'' Smith says, pausing
between shots. ``I'm just working as hard as I can, just in case
somebody calls me up. I'm in Triple-A right now. I'm trying to make
it to the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Smith grabs the ball, turns and fires another 3-pointer.
All net. All better. At least for now.

<P>
   &UR; THE CRIME OF SHEILA McGOUGH &LR;  By Janet Malcolm. Vintage, $12. A
rigorously intelligent journalist chronicles the drama of a
disbarred lawyer who claims she was framed but who may have been
the victim of her own relentless honesty, blinkered loyalty and
poor storytelling skills. ``No other writer tells better stories
about the perpetual, the unwinnable, battle between narrative and
truth,'' Margaret Talbot wrote in The New York Times Book Review in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EMPRESS OF THE SPLENDID SEASON &LR;  By Oscar Hijuelos.
HarperPerennial, $13. Lydia Espana, the heroine of this tender
novel by the author of ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' is a
romantic Cuban emigre who is forced by the death of her prosperous
husband to become a cleaning lady for wealthy New Yorkers. As she
navigates between two alien worlds, she struggles to reconcile her
instinct for self-invention with her inability to invent a suitable
self. ``The New York that emerges in this novel is as layered as
Lydia's inner life, as infused with meaning,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg
wrote last year. ``The city both echoes and shapes her moods.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRAZILIAN ADVENTURE &LR;  By Peter Fleming. Northwestern University,
$16.95. In this Pythonesque 1933 travelogue, Fleming (a literary
editor and brother of Ian) recounts his voyage with a bunch of
squabbling Brits in search of a missing explorer deep in the
Brazilian jungle. His acerbic account of their ``hilarious safari''
is ``full of rich, rare and entertaining reading,'' C.G. Poore
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SONNY LISTON WAS A FRIEND OF MINE: Stories &LR;  By Thom Jones. Back
Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95. The author's third collection of short
fiction features his usual gallery of lost souls and hard-luck
cases, many of whom are given to esoteric drug use because the
world has failed them. Each story is ``a raw, adrenalinized chunk
of conflicted emotion and barely suppressed rage,'' Dwight Garner
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KADDISH &LR;  By Leon Wieseltier. Vintage, $15. The author's journal
of the year in which he formally mourned his father is also a
deeply personal meditation on rabbinical tradition and the
relevance of sacred Judaic texts to his own life. The result ``is
an astonishing fusion of learning and psychic intensity,'' Harold
Bloom wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVELING MERCIES: Some Thoughts on Faith &LR; , by Anne Lamott
(Anchor, $13), is a collection of exuberant essays tracking the
author's rocky search for spiritual faith. ``Lamott is a narrator
who has relished and soaked up the details of her existence,
equally of mirth and devastation ... and spilled them onto her
pages,'' Alexandra Hall said last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SCAPEGOAT &LR;  By Daphne du Maurier. University of
Pennsylvania, $15.95. An unhappy British teacher meets his physical
double in a French bar, is drugged and wakes up to find that the
stranger has exchanged their clothing and documents, leaving him
little choice but to slip into another identity. Big mistake: It
turns out his alter ego had plenty to escape. In 1957 the reviewer
Anthony Boucher called this a ``magnificent thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE HOUSE ON THE STRAND &LR; 
($15.95), in which a rootless former editor becomes addicted to a
potion that allows him to commute between contemporary and
14th-century Cornwall. His own life soon pales in comparison with
the medieval drama. The result is ``prime du Maurier,'' David
Dempsey wrote in 1969. ``Her skill in finessing the time shifts is
enough to make one want to try a little of the brew himself.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FREDY NEPTUNE: A Novel in Verse &LR;  By Les Murray. Farrar, Straus
&AMP; Giroux, $14. This verse novel, which unfolds in relaxed
eight-line stanzas, is about an Australian sailor who loses the
ability to feel pain and drifts through the horrors of the 20th
century. The result is ``a haunting, loving, fiercely democratic
epic by a master poet,'' Ruth Padel wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``YOU AIN'T HEARD NOTHIN' YET.'' The American Talking Film:
History &AMP; Memory, 1927-1949 &LR;  By Andrew Sarris. Oxford University,
$18.95. This free-form collection of notes and essays by a seasoned
film critic known for his missionary zeal is less a history than a
personal tour of the images he encountered on the screen. ``The
prose is full of bounce and opinion ... and plenty of finely flung
allusions,'' Michael Wood wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of
Slavery &LR;  By Henry Mayer. St. Martin's Griffin, $18.95. This
dramatic biography seeks to re-establish the Boston abolitionist
newspaper editor as a major figure in 19th-century history who
wielded the power of a biblical prophet. ``Much of the narrative is
fluently and fascinatingly rendered,'' Carla Davidson wrote in
1998. ``Mayer has an especially strong sense of place.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SANDGLASS &LR;  By Romesh Gunesekera. Riverhead, $12.95. This
densely plotted tale focuses on two warring families in Sri Lanka
whose rift echoes the often violent divide between the country's
Sinhalese and Tamil peoples. Last year the reviewer Jacqueline
Carey called it ``an important novel.''

DEMOCRATS CLASH ON ABORTION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for new byline, new dateline, rewriting throughout)  
 (HLW)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Unleashing a harsh, double-barreled assault
in a television commercial and on the stump, Bill Bradley Saturday
assailed Vice President Al Gore's credentials as a defender of
abortion rights. Facing Bradley's persistent accusations, Gore
insisted that despite what he has said in the past, he remained
unalterably in support of a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   The quarreling over abortion only three days before the first
primary in New Hampshire was striking, given that only a week ago,
before the Iowa caucuses, the Republicans were battling over who
was the most ardent foe of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   On this final weekend before the voting, the campaigns pulled
out all the stops _ including political luminaries, fresh oratory
and biting television commercials _ in one last attempt to win over
undecided voters or to persuade their supporters to stick by them.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, Sen. John McCain, who polls show is
struggling to hang onto his tight lead here over Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, leveled some of his most pointed attacks on the
governor. He sought to raise doubts about one of Bush's most potent
selling points: that he could defeat a Democrat in the general
election. Repeatedly drawing a contrast between himself and Bush,
he asserted that he would not need ``on the job training'' as
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush trotted out the biggest names Saturday to stump on his
behalf: his father, the former president, and mother, Barbara,
appeared with him and three of his four siblings at a rally in
Milford. ``This boy, this son of ours, is not going to let you
down,'' the elder Bush declared in one of the more emotional
moments of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' bickering over abortion Saturday centered on a
letter Gore wrote to a constituent from his Senate office in 1987,
in which he said abortion was ``arguably the taking of a human
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned Saturday about whether he still believed abortion was
the taking of human life, Gore was quick to assert that he had
qualified that thought 13 years ago. ``I used the word `arguably,'
and yes, my position has changed,'' he said. Then, when asked
whether he stood by the idea that abortion was ``arguably'' the
taking of a human life, Gore added, ``I would not use that phrasing
today.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments were clearly a response to Bradley, who first
raised the matter in a debate on Wednesday and has hammered him on
the theme ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in his most forceful attack on the issue, Bradley, who
has slipped appreciably behind Gore in the polls here in recent
days, appealed to women by sharpening his remarks on the vice
president's abortion record and promoted his own support for a
laundry list of women's issues. The attack was a reference to
Gore's opposition, as a member of the House, to public financing of
abortions for poor women.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an issue that you can straddle,'' Bradley told 250
supporters at a YWCA in Concord, using a line from the television
commercial his campaign began running in this state Saturday.
``This is not like changing your position on whether taxes should
go up from 10 cents to 15 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign is hoping to magnify Gore's past comments on
abortion into larger questions about his character and ability to
tell the truth. The insurgent Democrat and his surrogates,
accelerating their assault on Gore's integrity, called on the vice
president to explain his ``journey'' from opposing abortion as a
congressman from Tennessee to his staunchly abortion-rights
position of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the drive to depict the vice president as a late
convert on the issue, the Bradley campaign released a letter
written in 1984 by Gore, then a member of Congress, in which he
told a constituent that it was his ``deep personal conviction that
abortion is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign put out a letter of its own, signed by 34
members of the House and 8 members of the Senate, asserting that
there was no difference between Gore and Bradley on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But in his new commercial, Bradley sought to portray himself as
the only candidate in either party who has always, unequivocally,
backed abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be on both sides; you have to decide which side
you're on,'' Bradley says in the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Although he does not name his opponent, Bradley's use of the
word ``straddle'' in the advertisement is a stinging echo of an
infamous 1988 attack commercial, ``Senator Straddle,'' that George
Bush used in the closing weekend of that campaign here to depict
Bob Dole as a fence-sitter on cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a new radio advertisement, Steve Forbes, who is trying to
dent Bush, also used the word ``straddle'' to attack Bush. ``No
straddle here from Bush,'' the announcer says. ``He has taken
millions from Washington interests and lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican contender, Gary L. Bauer, also offered
Bradley some unsolicited help when he told reporters that he once
considered Gore an aggressive opponent of abortion rights. He said
he ``almost fell off my chair'' when Gore declared in a debate in
New Hampshire on Wednesday that he had always supported abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In that encounter, Bradley first raised the issue of Gore's
abortion credentials. He asked the vice president whether he had
been consistent on the issue of abortion over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded: ``I've always supported Roe vs. Wade. I have
always supported a woman's right to choose. And let me say that if
you entrust me with the presidency, I will guarantee that a woman's
right to choose is protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the National Abortion and Reproductive Right Action League
has acknowledged that his stand on the subject has ``evolved'' over
the years, since he voted several times against public financing
for poor women who wanted abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But his record also includes a 1984 vote in support of amending
civil rights laws to redefine the word ``person'' to include
``unborn children from the moment of conception.'' That amendment
would have extended civil rights to those ``unborn children,'' a
move that was strongly backed by abortion foes and rejected by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   In saying Saturday that his position had changed, it was the
second time that Gore recently backtracked from comments he had
made in debates with Bradley. In early January, Gore said in a
debate in New Hampshire that he would require that any appointees
to the joint chiefs of staff fully support allowing gays to serve
openly in the military. After an uproar from military leaders, Gore
reversed himself.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure among candidates of both parties to gain ground was
particularly intense Saturday because for four hours on Sunday the
stumping will come to a dead halt for the Super Bowl. By Monday, it
may be too late for the contenders to reach many voters.

GALLEY MISSES HIS CHANCE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TORONTO _ Garry Galley had a chance to save the Kings from
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Steve Thomas scored the winning goal in the final
seconds of Toronto's 3-2 victory Saturday night, Galley had the
game in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:30 remaining in the third period, Ziggy Palffy passed the
puck to the slot where Galley was waiting. Maple Leafs goaltender
Curtis Joseph was out of position. But Joseph is an MVP candidate
this season for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely thought I had it,'' Galley said. ``CuJo was
moving so I knew he was going to open his legs. When he did I went
for the 5-hole. All of a sudden they closed up.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the Kings' chances. With 18.9 seconds left, Bryan Berard
took a blast from the point, Thomas parked in front and stuck out
his stick. The puck deflected in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows how quickly everything can change,'' Galley
said. ``We played very well on this trip and got two points in
three games. We played well tonight, but when you let up just a
little you find the puck in the back of your net.''
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti improves: The last time Jere Karalahti played in
Canada, he was taking his first steps in the National Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti, signed last summer out of Finland, looked out of
place in the Kings' 3-1 victory over Montreal on Dec. 11. Saturday
night, he continued to show his improvement with a goal that gave
the Kings a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It came on a slap shot from the point during the power play and
sailed over Joseph's left shoulder. It was Karalahti's third goal
of the season. He also appeared to have an assist on the Kings'
first score, but Bryan Smolinski was credited with an unassisted
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an adjustment period, no doubt,'' Kings coach Andy
Murray said. ``But he is now a critical part of our power-play
unit. We're seeing that big shot he had in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Reunited: Former King Yanic Perreault returned to the Toronto
lineup Saturday after missing 23 games recovering from surgery on
his left forearm that was broken on a slash by Pittsburgh
goaltender Tom Barrasso.
</P>
<P>
   Perreault, who used to room with Ian Laperriere, was traded by
the Kings last March 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got together last night,'' Laperriere said. ``That was a
bad injury. He still has two screws in his forearm.''

HAROLD H. GREENE, 76, JUDGE WHO OVERSAW BREAKUP OF THE AT&AMP;T
COLOSSUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (A shorter version of this obit is moving as OBIT-GREENE-SHORT)  
 (HLW)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge Harold H. Greene, a drafter of landmark civil rights and
voting rights legislation but best known for presiding over the
monumental 1984 dismemberment of American Telephone and Telegraph,
died Saturday at his home in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He was 76. The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, his son, Dr.
Michael D. Greene, said. Greene had undergone a series of brain
operations.
</P>
<P>
   His 45-year career as government lawyer and judge _ he never set
up a private practice _ helped shape profound changes in American
life and earned for the soft-spoken native of Germany a reputation
as having not only one of the most acute legal minds of his
generation but a practical one as well.
</P>
<P>
   He strongly opposed sentencing guidelines, for example, saying
they were unconstitutional because they forced judges to order jail
time for defendants who did not deserve it. He also managed to
impose tight administrative rein on the AT&AMP;T proceedings, which a
Justice Department lawyer described as ``history's biggest case''
and which had languished for years before he inherited it.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, a presidential panel had just concluded that the
government was mishandling complex antitrust cases so badly that
unless ways were found to control and expedite them, corporate
America might regard the law as unenforceable. His success may have
emboldened those who in the 1990s brought such a case against
Microsoft, the company with the nation's highest stock valuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``His management of the case was able to demonstrate that the
legal system was up to the task,'' said Morgan Frankel, a clerk to
Greene at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A refugee from Nazi persecution of Jews that had forced his
family into circuitous escape and Anne Frank-like hiding, Greene
arrived in the United States in early 1943. The family name then
was Gruenhaus. He was promptly drafted into the Army and sent back
to Europe to interrogate German prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Upon discharge, he breezed through two years of night school at
George Washington University, working at the same time as an
interpreter and translator at the Office of Alien Property, a unit
of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Law school soon beckoned, though largely by default. Greene, who
as a teenager had learned something of the jewelry business from
his father but had no interest in the field, found that he had no
scientific bent, nor was he drawn, as friends had been, into the
foreign service or intelligence work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law was the alternative that came along,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While attending George Washington's law school, he was a clerk
for former Sen. Bennett Champ Clark at the Court of Appeals, and
after graduation Greene went to the Justice Department. His work
there was dominated by civil rights issues, which had been given
fresh impetus by the Kennedy administration.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was soon heavily involved in drafting what became the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and he
helped lobby for them in Congress. The unit he led also contributed
to the department's day-to-day handling of racial confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general would call at 5 o'clock in the evening
and say, `Tomorrow morning we're going to try to integrate the
University of Mississippi. Get us a memo on what we're likely to
do, what we can do if the governor sends the National Guard there _
and I want to have it on my desk at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning,'''
Greene later recalled. ``That's the kind of thing that I did and my
people did.''
</P>
<P>
   In drafting the 1964 legislation, Greene and his colleagues had
to choose whether to base it on the 14th Amendment, which bars
discrimination, or on the commerce clause of the Constitution.
Though less symbolic, the latter was chosen as better standing up
to challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Greene marveled at how quickly the new law had its
intended effect, unlike the foot-dragging and outright resistance
with which court decisions had typically been met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within days, it was everybody all over the South _
restaurants, hotels, motels _ just gave up their previous
opposition,'' he once observed.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 years, Greene moved to the Court of General Sessions, a
local court now called the Superior Court for the District of
Columbia, where he brought order to a demoralized institution in
near-chaos from case overload. He was also deeply engaged in
planning for a new courthouse building, successfully insisting that
it not contain a jail. His position was in accord with his
longstanding belief that courts should not be regarded as portals
to prison.
</P>
<P>
   It was this segment of his career, not the civil rights work or
the telephone case, that he was most proud of, his son, Dr. Greene,
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, President Carter appointed him to the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There, among the 140 to 150 cases he was immediately assigned,
was the one that would transfix the telecommunications world for
the better part of a decade, the antitrust case of United States
vs. AT&AMP;T. The government contended essentially that the telephone
colossus was illegally stifling competition, using
regulator-sanctioned profits from the telephone business to
subsidize unregulated businesses, like making equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The government's position was not widely popular, with much of
the public wondering why Washington seemed to be putting in
jeopardy what was generally acknowledged to be the world's best
telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, though complaints are still heard, the
settlement that followed an 11-month trial won acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Without the breakup, Stanley Sporkin, a federal district judge
and colleague of Greene's, said recently, the United States would
now probably have a ``rudimentary'' telephone system without
cellular phones, caller ID and a host of other options, and
competition that has brought long-distance rates for millions down
to pennies a minute.
</P>
<P>
   He called Greene's work ``one of the great decisions of all
time, an important part of the technological revolution we're now
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the case in an interview for the court's oral
history project, Greene said his main contribution was to require
the parties to submit statements of contentions and proof _ their
claims and the evidence they had to support them _ that he insisted
be progressively whittled down.
</P>
<P>
   The judge then forced the two sides to stipulate points of
agreement, reducing to one year a trial that he said might have
dragged on as long as five years. With the clock running down, the
government and the company suddenly reached a settlement over the
Christmas holidays and announced it in January 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Although Greene was out of town and knew nothing of the proposed
deal, many said he brought the company to the negotiating table
because of a lengthy opinion he wrote halfway through the trial in
which, responding to a motion to dismiss the case, he rejected most
of AT&AMP;T's contentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been said that that was responsible, at least in part,
for the settlement because they felt I gave them an in as to what I
would do'' should he need to make a ruling, Greene recalled. ``But
that wasn't my purpose. My purpose was to deal with the motions
that had been filed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his son, ``He always said he didn't know for sure''
how he would have ruled.
</P>
<P>
   After wrangling with a court in New Jersey over who should
decide whether the settlement, which split AT&AMP;T into seven regional
companies, was in the public interest, Judge Greene approved it
subject to various conditions. The breakup of AT&AMP;T was completed on
Jan. 1, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when asked about his response to criticism of the
breakup _ consumers' complaining about things like complicated
bills and the need to choose from a confusing array of
long-distance companies and to buy telephones that would no longer
be fixed free _ Greene said he was convinced the right outcome had
been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time I don't react at all because you cannot
possibly persuade people that what they have firmly in mind is not
so,'' he said. ``I am perfectly content in my own view that the
breakup was a good thing. It brought competition into a field where
there hadn't been any competition and that's the American way.
Competition brings down price and brings up quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had exactly that effect. The rates, particularly
long-distance rates, are way down. Even the local rates, although
initially they were up, have since decreased. So far as quality is
concerned, many, many things that have come in since then were not
there when AT&AMP;T had a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent case he handled involved John M. Poindexter,
national security adviser to President Reagan, who was charged with
lying to Congress about the Iran-Contra episode, in which his
subordinate, Oliver North, diverted proceeds from arms sales to aid
the American-supported faction in Nicaragua's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   With the defense arguing that Poindexter acted under
instruction, Greene ordered Reagan, by then out of office, to be a
witness, the first time a president was compelled to testify on
matters involving his own administration.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, Greene ruled in the landmark case Edwards
vs. Habib that a tenant could not be evicted for requesting
enforcement of the housing code.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is survived by his wife, Evelyn; his son, Dr. Michael D.
Greene, of McLean, Va.; a daughter, Stephanie Cavagrotti of Los
Angeles; and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Aides and colleagues described Greene as extraordinarily
diligent, often volunteering to relieve the caseload of fellow
judges and sometimes rising in the middle of the night to commit
his views to paper. But while other judges would need to spend
hours preparing written instructions to juries, Greene would charge
them with scarcely a note. ``When you went into the Greene court,
you knew he was the smartest person in the room,'' Sporkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he suffered defeats, one of them when as an assistant
attorney general he was given the rare chance to argue a case
before the Supreme Court, which included the venerable Felix
Frankfurter. His task was to argue that the government had the
right to appeal a motion. Greene recalled decades later that the
court rejected the idea 9-to-0 after Frankfurter first raised his
hopes by accurately summarizing his presentation, then deflated him
by declaring, ``If that's your argument, there's no need to go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew _ I knew _ that if it was a winnable case, the
solicitor general would have argued it most likely, or people close
to that seat of power,'' Greene said. ``But it was still a great
emotional high.''
</P>
<P>
   He also admitted to a professional disappointment because the
AT&AMP;T case was settled before he could issue a final ruling. ``I
felt it would have been kind of nice to write a major antitrust
opinion,'' he said.

ITALIANS GAIN THIRD VICTORY OF SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for rewriting throughout) 
(HLW)  
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ In a remarkable comeback, Italy's Prada
Challenge overtook America One in the final moments of the last leg
Sunday to win the fourth race of challenger finals.
</P>
<P>
   Prada now holds a 3-1 lead in the five-of-nine Louis Vuitton
finals, which will determine the boat that will face Team New
Zealand in the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   America One skipper Paul Cayard and his crew, who had taken
charge of the race on the second leg with a fierce, ruthless
display of match racing, were solidly in control through most of
the second half of the 18.5 mile course and held a 37-second lead
as the boats rounded the mark for the last downwind leg.
</P>
<P>
   But on that final leg, Prada roared back into contention on the
winds of a fresh following breeze. Approaching America One in a
close crossing situation with the finish line in sight, Prada held
starboard jibe and right-of-way over the port-jibed San
Francisco-based team.
</P>
<P>
   Determining that he would be unable to cross Prada's bow, Cayard
called for his crew to jibe the spinnaker. But the Americans were
slow and allowed Prada to gain an overlap, meaning that Cayard was
bound by the rules to keep clear on the advancing Italian boat.
</P>
<P>
   The judges called America One for a foul, meaning Cayard would
need to perform a 270-degree turn to exonerate himself. But he was
running out of race course. Though America One crossed the finish
line half-a-boatlength ahead of Prada, he had not yet completed the
turn.
</P>
<P>
   America One dropped their spinnaker and returned to re-cross the
line. But that was 2 minutes 32 seconds after the Italians
officially recorded the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The first windward leg had a deja-vu quality to it. Both boats,
as in the third race, immediately peeled off to the course's
left-hand side in anticipation of a westerly shift. Again, the boat
speed between the two vessels was remarkably even.
</P>
<P>
   In a tit-for-tat nautical chess match, Cayard and his tactician,
John Kostecki, employed superior tactics to take the Italians past
the lay line to the mark, and they led them around with a meager
but well-earned eight-second lead.
</P>
<P>
   With the course skewed slightly after a left-hand wind shift,
both skippers called for the crews to jibe set the spinnakers.
Prada's crew work was a hair quicker and her skipper, Francesco de
Angelis, now in attack mode, tried to climb above America One and
blanket his sails.
</P>
<P>
   But Cayard had an ace up his sleeve _ a slight edge in downwind
boat speed that gave him enough room to answer Prada's aggressive
tactics. He called to his sail trimmer, asking for a bit more power
in his mainsail. ``I need some grunt.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 minutes on starboard jibe, Cayard swung his transom
through the wind and Prada immediately followed. As the inside
boat, Cayard now held maneuvering rights. It would soon be a huge
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Now running downwind on port, with the two boats side by side,
Cayard nudged his bow over in a luffing move to shake de Angelis'
slight advance.
</P>
<P>
   But for the second time in as many days, America One's
lime-green spinnaker blew to smithereens, the remaining portion
streaming from the masthead.
</P>
<P>
   It could have spelled disaster for America One. But Cayard has a
famous, nasty, ruthless streak, and he instinctively picked the
perfect moment to exhibit it. With the day's race _ and perhaps the
series _ laying in the balance, Cayard continued to steer into the
wind. Prada had no choice but to punch up into the breeze as well.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was the Italian's turn to self-destruct. Unable to
control their spinnaker, pandemonium broke loose aboard Prada.
Cayard cooly held his course while Prada spun out of control, then
crash-jibed behind the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard, with the remnants of his wasted spinnaker still flapping
above him in what was now 23-knots of breeze, kept his poise. ``Get
it up,'' he ordered, imploring his foredeck men to hoist the genoa.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another American One crewman was being hoisted
to the top of the mast, a knife in hand, ready to slash the halyard
of the useless spinnaker.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard resumed course toward the bottom mark, but Prada was
still flailing. Finally, the Italians corralled their spinnaker and
replaced it with their own genoa. But the damage was done. America
One rounded 39 seconds, or about 200 yards, ahead of the shaken
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   America One extended its advantage at the third mark to 54
seconds. But the Italians never gave up, and continued to gnaw away
at the American's lead. The relentless charge set up a dramatic
finish, a devastating loss for America One, and the third Italian
victory of the series.

SUNDANCE JURY PICKS THE BEST OF RICH CROP OF INDEPENDENT FILMS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ A romantic drama about a Brooklyn girl who finds
fulfillment in the boxing ring, a first-time director's story of
estranged siblings in a small town, and a documentary about South
Africa's struggle for justice won top honors at the 16th annual
Sundance Film Festival Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, the premier event in the independent film world,
concludes its 10-day run on Sunday in Park City, Utah, its final
day dedicated to encore screenings of Saturday night's award
winners. This year's assortment of feature films, documentaries and
short films was widely viewed as among the richest to appear in
recent years at the festival, which has been the launching pad for
such independent hits as ``sex, lies and videotape,'' ``Shine'' and
``The Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of this year's rich crop was seen in the dual awards
handed out by the jury in the festival's dramatic competition.
``Girlfight,'' writer-director Karyn Kusama's gritty drama about a
teenaged boxer (newcomer Michelle Rodriguez) living in a Brooklyn,
N.Y., housing project, won the festival Grand Jury Prize along with
``You Can Count on Me,'' writer-director Kenneth Lonergan's subtle
drama about a small-town mother (Laura Linney) whose staid life is
thrown into turmoil by the unexpected appearance of her wild,
estranged brother (Mark Ruffalo). Ms. Kusama also won the
festival's dramatic directing award, while Lonergan won its
screenwriting prize.

<P>
   ``There's a lot of hyperventilation that takes off before the
festival, a lot of buzz,'' Robert Redford, the actor and
Oscar-winning director who founded Sundance, said in an interview.
``Every year we hear, this is going to be the new this, this is
going to be the new that, and it never is. The buzz just doesn't
mean anything. I'm glad it doesn't. Because I think the festival
shows that what succeeds is content. I'd like to think that we've
succeeded in presenting a real menu of films.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Long Night's Journey Into Day,'' focusing on post-apartheid
travails of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission and
directed by Frances Reid and Deborah Hoffman, won the Grand Jury
Prize for documentaries. The documentary directing award went to
Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman for ``Paragraph 175,'' about
persecution of homosexuals during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Another festival favorite, ``Dark Days,'' a documentary about a
man who spent two years living in the tunnels beneath Grand Central
Terminal, won two jury awards, one for freedom of expression and
another for Marc Singer's cinematography. Cinematography awards
also went to Andrew Young for the documentary ``American Latino:
Life in the United States'' and Tom Krueger for ``Committed,'' a
comedy about a woman (Heather Graham) who stalks her estranged
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Sollett won the award for the festival's best short film
for ``Five Feet High and Rising,'' which he made during his senior
year at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the jury awards, the festival also presents
audience awards in several categories, voted upon by those
attending the festival screenings. ``Dark Days'' won the
documentary audience award while ``Two Family House,'' a period
drama set in the 1950s Long Island from director Raymond DeFelitta
that was presented in the festival's American Spectrum section and
thus not eligible for jury prizes, won the dramatic audience award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace,'' a British comedy from director Nigel Cole
about a widow who is forced to grow marijuana to make ends meet,
won the audience award for world cinema.

SABRES RUN INTO BRICK WALL IN BRUINS' HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, the FleetCenter isn't the house of horrors after all.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least it wasn't Saturday night as the Bruins eked out a
1-0 victory over the Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Byron Dafoe, who was called on to stand on his head
during parts of the contest, had 25 saves on the way to his 20th
career shutout. Coincidentally, Dafoe's last shutout came on Jan.
13 when the Bruins played to a scoreless tie against this same
nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   The victory came amid a giant distraction caused by team owner
Jeremy Jacobs's critical comments aimed at Pat Burns and his staff
in Will McDonough's column in Saturday's Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Home had been treacherous for the Bruins this season. They went
into Saturday night's game with an 0-5-4 mark in their previous
nine contests at the FleetCenter and were 7-10-8 overall at home.
Boston was in the midst of its longest home winless streak since
Oct. 14-Nov. 22, 1962 when the team was 0-6-3.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Bruins overall are 3-2-3 in their last eight games
and because those losses were in overtime, the club has at least a
point in all eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly played with a lot of emotion, which is good, and
physical, too,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``We finished our hits and
stood up to the nonsense they wanted to throw at us. We've played
well in this last stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins for much of the season have long lamented their slow
starts out of the gate. Too often, they've gotten down early and
had to climb their way back. Sometimes they have been able to,
sometimes not. The Bruins came out strong in the first period,
turning in their best opening 20 minutes in some time, especially
in their home rink.
</P>
<P>
   Boston outshot the Sabres, 12-6, in the opening 20 minutes with
left wing P.J. Axelsson giving the Bruins all the offense they
would need at 11:52.
</P>
<P>
   Center Joe Thornton started the play when he blasted a shot from
the top of the left circle that goalie Martin Biron stopped. The
puck bounced out into the slot and Biron tried to pokecheck it out
of harm's way but Axelsson was there and put the shot over the
off-balance goalie. It was Axelsson's eighth goal of season, tying
a career high set in his rookie year of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday marked the return of left wing Ken Belanger, who missed
34 games with post-concussion syndrome.He only played three shifts
over 2:02, but made his presence felt at 12:36 when he leveled a
punch to Buffalo right wing Dixon Ward's head. Defenseman Alexei
Zhitnik belted Belanger in the back of the head, knocking him to
the ice. Belanger and Rob Ray wound up with unsportsmanlike conduct
penalties while Zhitnik picked up a roughing minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to see Kenny back,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Zhitnik wound up in the box again at 5:44 of the second when he
and Thornton squared off after Zhitnik whacked Thornton over the
head with his stick. Thornton delivered some punishing blows to the
Sabres' pesky defensemen before the two were separated. Zhitnik got
a double minor for high sticking and a fighting major, with
Thornton getting a roughing minor and fighting major.
</P>
<P>
   ``He high-sticked me so I thought we'd better not let him get
away with that so I started a little fight,'' said Thornton. ``He
likes to use his body and we wanted to make sure he felt something
tonight. He's one of the better skilled defensemen they've got and
if he's in the box, that's definitely a plus for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres didn't even manage a shot in the period until the
8:03 mark when they had back-to-back bids by center Brian Holzinger
and center Erik Rasmussen, which Dafoe turned back.
</P>
<P>
   Things got a little hairy at 14:22 when the Bruins were
shorthanded, but their penalty killing unit, which had killed off
the last 10 power plays over these last four games, came through.
