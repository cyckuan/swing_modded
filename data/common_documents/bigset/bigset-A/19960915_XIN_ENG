<HEADLINE> Nepal Continue Debates over Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali parliament today
continued debates over a border river development treaty with
India for the third consecutive day amid opposition's demand for
further discussions.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN-UML) today
asked the joint session of both houses for further studies and
discussions on the Mahakali treaty and not to vote on its
ratification in haste.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML today decided to vote against the treaty if it is
put to the vote in the parliament without necessary corrections
the party demanded earlier, sources close to the party said.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML, with its 101 MPs in both the upper and lower
houses, holds the key to the fate of the Mahakali treaty as its
ratification needs a two-thirds support in the 265-seat
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India signed the treaty on the integrated development
of the Mahakali river, Nepal's western border river with India,
last February on the prime ministerial level in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Water resources officials here said the treaty is a watershed
in Nepal-India cooperation on water development laying down
principles of cost-benefit sharing for future hydro-projects on
the river.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML, Nepal's main opposition party, announced earlier
this week its conditional support to the treaty, demanding
correction of the alleged weakness in the treaty and written
assurances from the government for the resolution to several
bilateral issues between Nepal and India as preconditions for its
ratification.
</P>
<P>
However, the response to the demands raised by the opposition
party from the Indian government, through its embassy here, was
not "positive," according to the local press.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary discussion on the Mahakali treaty was still
going on till late night today while security was tight in
downtown Kathmandu in fear of protests by anti-Mahakali treaty
groups, who have been claiming that the treaty is against Nepal's
national interest.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Defends Presence of Western Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait reaffirmed that the
presence of the Western coalition forces is "legal and
legitimate" and that Kuwait is entitled to take all the measures
and precautions necessary to ensure its security, sovereignty
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement issued by the Information Center of
the Kuwaiti Embassy in Cairo today.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Kuwait is not to blame for the crisis
currently experienced by Iraq, holding Iraq responsible for its
current confrontation with the Western coalition.
</P>
<P>
The statement denounced Iraq's failure to implement the
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, pointing out that
this gives rise to the current crises.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has not abandoned its fancies and its evil ambitions to
Kuwait. Kuwait's security comes under constant threats, and so
its has concluded a number of defense cooperation agreements
with friendly countries," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
denied Friday that he had directed any threats to Kuwait and that
the threat which Iraq is coming under comes from Kuwait which has
allowed the American Stealth aircraft to be stationed on its
territory in order to launch attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is reported to boost its military presence in the
Gulf region, preparatory to entering into a confrontation with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, The United States was moving
sophisticated weaponry to the Gulf, including the F-117A, a
stealth attack bomber that will be based in Kuwait. Four planes
landed Friday evening in Kuwait and four more were expected later.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz has described Kuwait's move to
allow some U.S. jets to be based on its territory as a "flagrant
act of aggression against the people of Iraq and an act of war
against the Iraqi state."

<HEADLINE> Taliban's Advance Complicates Afghan Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban's recent
advance in eastern Afghanistan had complicated the peace process
in the country, a UN official said in Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted Marrack Goulding, the UN Under
Secretary for Political Affairs, as saying that the Taliban had
still not given up the military option.
</P>
<P>
Goulding, who is on a visit to Afghanistan, denied that the
Taliban's offensive was "a slap in the face" to the UN peace
efforts in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would repeat a UN call for negotiations to
settle the Afghan conflict when he met the Taliban leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has captured three provinces in eastern Afghanistan
since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Goulding and the UN envoy to Afghanistan, Norbert Holl, began
their visit in Afghanistan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to meet senior officials of the Kabul
regime, the Taliban leaders and Rashid Dostum, the head of
Junbush-i-Melli which controlled seven provinces in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Goulding noted in Kabul that peace was only possible if there
was "a readiness to renounce military options."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Goulding said that there was no evidence
to confirm the accusations about Pakistan's military assistance to
the Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Elections Running Smoothly So Far: OSCE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Just hours after crucial
elections in Bosnia began early today, ballot organizers in
Sarajevo expressed satisfaction with voting so far in most of the
4,400 polling stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
The 19 special routes across inter-ethnic boundary lines were
open and initial blockages had been cleared up, Agota Kuperman,
spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Kuperman said the OSCE, which is charged with organizing and
monitoring the first general elections in Bosnia since the ending
of the 43-month war last December, has created favorable
conditions for voting and expected a large turnout at the polling
stations.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions have been established, we no longer witness
daily reports of killings and ethnic cleansing," she said, adding
that the OSCE hopes these elections "will mark a start in bridging
the ethnic divide created by four years of war."
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement signed in December 1995, the 2.9
eligible voters will go to polls to choose a three-member Bosnian
presidency -- one from each ethnic faction -- a national
parliament, a president and separate parliament for the Serb
Republic, and a parliament and cantonal administrations in the
Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
Some 29 political parties and five coalitions were running in
the poll.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the election is to reunite the country, split by
bloody ethnic wars between the Serbs, Croats and Muslims, under
one government.
</P>
<P>
"Bosnia has unquestionably embarked on a democratic course,
these elections are a crucial step in the continuing pursuit of a
democratic voice," Kuperman stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the Serb capital Pale, which is only 16 kilometers away from
Sarajevo, local voters were active in voting and there were queues
outside most of the 35 polling stations. Most voters told
reporters they would be voting for the ruling Serb Democratic
Party (SDS) and wished a better future for their nation.
</P>
<P>
The extremist SDS, representing the Bosnian Serbs, has made no
secret of its desire for independence and opposition to the
unification of the country with the two other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Although the international community has pinned much hope for
the elections to bring the three sides -- Serbs, Muslims and
Croats -- together again, reporters feel a strong sense of
ultra-nationalism and deep hatred among the voters of the two
entities: the Muslim-Croat Federation and Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to hide, I have just voted for the SDS. We
can't live together with the other half of the country. The
First, Second World Wars and the just ended civil war have proved
that," a Serb voter, a refugee from Croatia, told reporters
outside one polling station in Pale.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials said there were some minor incidents of violence
in the morning in northern and northwestern Bosnia where local
Serbs had obstructed Muslim refugees crossing into Serb-controlled
land to vote but such obstruction was not systematic. There was
also one shooting incident near Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day election, tens of thousands of voters are
expected to cross inter-ethnic borders to cast their ballots in
their old homes which they had fled to escape war.
</P>
<P>
To make sure the voting goes on smoothly until the closing time
at 19:00 local time (1700 GMT), almost all 55,000 heavily-armed
IFOR troops, 1,600 U.N. troops, police and local police were
assigned to security duties since early morning.

<HEADLINE> World Solar Commission Conference Opens in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Solar Commission
(WSC) conference opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the conference, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who is
also the chairman of the WSC, stressed the need of developing the
renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
He said the need to identify and develop renewable energy
sources has become imperative and extremely urgent in this era of
global warming, deforestation and wide-spread and frequent
droughts.
</P>
<P>
Without reliable and perennial sources of energy, efforts
directed toward improvement of the general living standards of
the people in the periphery of urban centers and remote areas
would remain elusive, he added.
</P>
<P>
At today's conference, delegates from the 16 member countries
of the WSC discussed and approved two draft documents drawn up by
the WSC -- the "world solar program (1996-2005)" and the "Harare
declaration on solar energy and sustainable development", which
will be presented to the world solar summit to be held next
Monday and Tuesday for examination and approval.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, state councillor of China and secretary general of
the State Council, attended the conference on behalf of Jiang
Zemin, president of China, a member country of the WSC.
</P>
<P>
The conference was held on the initiative of the WSC, the
Zimbabwean government and the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
The WSC was set up in September last year by the UNESCO to
promote the development and utilization of the renewable energy
sources such as solar, wind, mini-hydraulic, geothermal, tidal
and biomass energy in the world.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the UNESCO say at least 30 percent of the world's
5,800 million population are condemned to a life without
electricity despite the greater use of oil, coal and other kinds
of fossil energy in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
The WSC conference concluded this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Caspian Sea Claims 228 Lives in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Caspian Sea has claimed
228 lives, including 22 females, in its southern shore of Iran
this summer, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Iran reported that most of the dead were
under the age of 25 and among them 22 were females, who were
drowned due to their swimming outside of the safe zones.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the death toll stood at 287 last summer.
</P>
<P>
Some local people attributed the high death toll to the
separation of women and men in the swimming areas due to the
Islamic code.
</P>
<P>
Every year in summer hundreds of thousands of tourists,
particularly from the capital of Tehran, go to the Caspian Sea
coastal areas for a relief in the summer resorts.
</P>
<P>
However, the Islamic law prohibit men and women from swimming
together not only in the swimming pools but also in the sea no
matter they are married or unmarried, old or young.
</P>
<P>
Armed policemen even patrol along the breach. Those who swim
together regardless of sex will be put into jail and be
punished. Thus, a couple and a family have to swim in different
and distant zones.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the female can not swim with the swim suit,
they have to swim with long black chadore. This is one of
the causes for high death toll.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Arabs Completely Support Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said here today that the Arab states completely support
the Palestinians and their efforts for the implementation of
Palestinian-Israeli agreements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks following an emergency meeting of Arab
foreign ministers, which focused on the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called the meeting to seek support from the Arabs to
pressure Israel into honoring its agreements signed with the
Palestinians and moving faster toward peace.
</P>
<P>
"Their (the Arabs') response was very positive," he
said. "They support completely the Palestinians and their efforts
to achieve the implementation of what has been agreed upon
between us and the Israelis."
</P>
<P>
He said that dangerous conditions are now facing the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting followed a regular meeting of the
ministers, which resumed later today and is due to conclude
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid said in a
speech at the regular meeting that this meeting came in the light
of critical dangers and several challenges that do not only
threaten Arab national security but the entire Mediterranean area
because the current Israeli government went back on all
agreements signed by the former Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of trying to impose a fait accompli through
its settlement policy and Judaizing Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"All these Israel attempts and practices could not be
accepted," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned Israel against going on with policies that run
contrary to the international legitimacy.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- About 43,000 Bosnian
refugees on Saturday returned back to their former residential
areas to vote, the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) reported.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Brett Boudreau, citing figures provided by the
Serb side, said that by 15:00 (local time), 37,000 refugees
crossed the inter-entity boundary from the Federation side to Serb
republic while 6,000 came from the Serb side to the Federation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, IFOR dispatched troops to control crowds of
voters impatient with the slow process at some polling stations in
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
About 4,400 polling stations in Bosnia opened at 7 a.m.(local
time) to estimated 2.6 million eligible voters, and will close at
7 p.m.(local time). But in Sarajevo, voting hours in some reopened
stations could be extended to 10 p.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 IFOR soliders and UN police were scattered around
Bosnia to prevent any incident of violent clashes between hundreds
of thousands of refugees returning to home towns or villages and
ethnic groups which now control these areas.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen roads have been designated as special routes for
refugees returning home, which will be heavily protected by IFOR.

<HEADLINE> Chinese State Councillor Stresses Renewable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Luo Gan, state councillor of
China, said here today that confronted with shortages of fossil
energy sources and serious environmental pollution, people in
various countries should accelerate the development of solar
energy and other renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
Luo made the remarks at the World Solar Commission (WSC)
conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
Luo, who attended the conference on behalf of Jiang Zemin,
president of China, one of the 16 member countries of the WSC,
said with the current proven reserves and at the current rate of
exploitation, the mining of oil reserves in the world can only
survive 50-60 years, of natural gas 60-70 years, and of coal
about 300 years.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the people in the world have to go all out to
develop and use new and renewable energy sources while the
limited fossil energy sources are economically used, he said.
</P>
<P>
The unrestrained and inefficient use of fossil energy has, on
the other hand, caused grave damages to environment for human
survival, the Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
To protect the fragile life-supporting environment, it is
highly necessary for the people to use alternate energy sources
while economically optimizing the use of the fossil fuel, he told
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the development of the renewable energy sources in China,
Luo said china has developed various renewable energy sources
which have made important contributions to national economic
development, and in particular, to the sustainable development of
remote, mountainous and sparcely-polulated areas and islands
where construction of national power grids is not suitable.
</P>
<P>
It should be a principle for the international community in
conducting cooperation to ensure that every country enjoys the
sovereign rights over the development and use of their own resources,
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the "Harare declaration of solar energy and sustainable
development" and the "world solar program 1996-2005" to be
examined and approved at the world solar summit next Monday and
Tuesday, Luo said, "the Chinese government fully supports the
views in the declaration and totally agrees to the goals set in
the program. We are ready to take an active part in the series of
activities for the implementation of the program."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the international community, the United
Nations, and the developed countries in particular, to provide
the developing countries with financial and technical assistance
so as to help them develop the renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese state councillor highly commended the WSC, the
Zimbabwean government, the United Nationas Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for their efforts
made in the past few years in enhancing the awareness of the
mankind about the renewable energy sources and promoting their
use.
</P>
<P>
The WSC conference was held on the initiative of the WSC, the
Zimbabwean government and the UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
The WSC, with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe as its
chairman, was established in September last year under the
sponsorship of the UNESCO to boost worldwide the development and
utilization of the renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
The conference was concluded this afternoon.

<P>
MAPUTO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi announced the country's economic growth has risen
at an annual rate of 7.4 percent for the first half of this year,
a local newspaper said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi was quoted by the local daily Noticias as saying that
if the economy keeps the current momentum, there would be no
problem that the government's economic plan for 1996 could be
easily implemented.
</P>
<P>
Although the agricultural growth recorded at 9.4 percent
during the first six months of the year, it is still far below
the level of the 1960s and the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister predicted that the annual inflation rate
for 1996 could be checked within 22 percent, though the inflation
of the first quarter of the year had risen due to the flood and
the price hike of vegetables and the fuel.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi did not mention the industrial and business sectors,
but pointed out that the sectors of mining, fishing and
telecommunication were all declined.

<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid reiterated here today that Iraq's sovereignty
and territorial integrity must be maintained.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a regular meeting of Arab foreign ministers, he
denounced what he called "the interference in the domestic
affairs of any Arab country even on accounts of setting up
security buffer zones."
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to Turkey's intention to establish
a buffer zone in northern Iraq to guard against attack by Turkish
Kurdish rebels operating from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and some other Arab states have expressed grave concern
over the planned zone, saying that it will violate Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came amid high tension between the U.S. and
Iraq. In an apparent reference to the U.S., he denounced what he
described as "the use of military power by any state to deal with
the causes of tension within any Arab country."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Abdul-Meguid condemned the U.S. missile
attacks on Iraq, which were carried out in response to Iraqi
army's operation in the north to help one Iraqi Kurdish faction
fight against another Kurdish faction.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid, in his speech at today's meeting, also called on
Iraq to respect all the relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions so as to spare the Iraqi people more sufferings.
</P>
<P>
On the Libya-West crisis over the Lockerbie issue, the
secretary general expressed hope that the U.S. and European
countries would express understanding vis-a-vis the Lockerbie
issue especially as Libya has voiced readiness for cooperation
with all regional and international efforts made to solve the
problem.

LAGOS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Two plants with active
anti-AIDS virus ingredients have been discovered in southeastern
Nigeria, Minister of State for Agriculture Adlmola Adesina
announced today.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day workshop on "the role of conservation in health

<HEADLINE> Last Phase of Lebanese Elections to Start Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 410,000 voters are going
to vote in 903 polling stations in eastern Lebanon Sunday to elect
23 members in the 128-seat parliament, in the last round of a
five-phased general elections in this country.
</P>
<P>
Of the 134 candidates in the Beqaa constituency, 57 belong to
four electional coalitions and 77 are independents.
</P>
<P>
The strongest coalition is the "List of National Concord and
Unity" comprising candidates of Lebanon's two major Shiite
groups, the Amal movement of House Speaker Nabih Berri and the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, as well as others.
</P>
<P>
However, local political observers do not see the 23-member
coalition as a "monolithic bloc" since it is made up of various
ingredients, including a nephew of President Elias Hrawi, two
allies of Premier Rafik Hariri and six ministers in the government.
</P>
<P>
There are also some figures who have rarely sung the same tune
with the administration in the past, such as Hezbollah's
incumbent deputy Ibrahim Amin al-Said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has three candidates and two
allies in the coalition, which was only formed after Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon, mediated a compromise between the
moderate pro-Syrian Amal movement and the fundamentalist Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Observers expect that a tactics of "Tashtib," or crossing
names of rival candidates off the vote, will be commonly used by
supporters of the factions involved in the coalition in the Sunday
elections.
</P>
<P>
The inherent defects give three other coalitions, the "People's
List," the "List of Loyalty to People's Will" and "the Beqaa's
List," as well as independent candidates, chances to wrestle some
seats from the Amal-Hezbollah coalition.
</P>
<P>
Syria had earlier intervened to bring about a coalition in
southern Lebanon between the two rival Shiite groups, which won 21
of 23 seats in the elections last Sunday, leaving two to Bahia
Hariri, sister of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and another
Hezbollah-backed candidate.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Lebanese National News Agency announced today
that President Hrawi is to go to his hometown of Zahle in the
Beqaa to cast vote in the Sunday elections.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi stressed today that he would be in the "same distance"
from all the candidates and that the administration would maintain
a "complete neutrality" in the elections in the Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the Lebanese army and the security forces
reinforced their security in Beqaa at dawn today, increasing
patrols and setting up check points at every corner of the
area.

CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid today called for drawing up a long-term Arab
strategy to enhance Arab cooperation with other countries and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will also reflect the Arab interest in
international affairs, namely peace, security, environment,
disarmament and human rights, Abdul-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
At the 106th session of Arab foreign ministers, which opened
here today, he called on Arab states to promote cooperation with
the European Union (EU), urging the EU to play a vital role in the
Middle East peace process as it has increasing interests with the
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Arabs to bolster cooperation with the United
Nations, the Organization of Islamic Conference and the
Organization of African Unity in order to coordinate stances on
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The regular meeting, which is held twice a year, resumed later
today after an emergency meeting of the ministers, which was
called by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to discuss ways to
pressure Israel into moving faster toward peace with the
Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The two-day regular meeting is discussing a wide range of
issues with emphasis on setting up an Arab court of justice and
creating an Arab mechanism for the peaceful settlement of
inter-Arab disputes.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid said in a speech at today's meeting that such
mechanisms would help invigorate the role of the Arab League.

WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Army troops based at
Fort Hood, Texas, are making final preparations today for
deployment to the Gulf region and possible military strikes
against Iraq, Army sources said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department announced that some 5,000 American
troops would be sent from Fort Hood to man scores of tanks and
vehicles in the Gulf region. But defense officials at Fort Hood
said that the actual deployment from there would be about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
The Army contingent will join some 1,500 American troops
already in Kuwait. Pentagon officials said that the American
troops will hold military exercises in border area near Iraq, but
local news reports said that they would be used in a possible new
round of U.S. strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. Monica McNeal at the Fort Hood told reporters that
the Army troops were waiting for the official deployment order
from the Pentagon.
</P>

She said that U.S. tanks and other equipment were already in
place in Kuwait so the American troops would travel only with
individual gear.

Eight U.S. radar-evading F-117A warplanes arrived in Kuwait and
four U.S. B-52 bombers with cruise missiles rebased to the Indian

SARAJEVO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The figure of refugees
returning to vote in their former home villages or towns is much
lower than expected, the UN international police reported on
Saturday.

By 15:30 (local time), Only 8,600 Bosnian refugees in 315 buses
crossed through the inter-entity boundary line from the Federation
side to the Serb side, the police said.
</P>
<P>
But IFOR spokesman Brett Boudreau cautioned the figure might be
higher because the UN only counted crossings on the
specially-designated roads and the figure of Serbs voting in the
Federation side is still not available.
</P>
<P>
IFOR had earlier expected between 50,000 to 100,000 refugees to
cross the inter-entity boundary to vote.
</P>
<P>
About 4,400 polling stations in Bosnia opened at 7 a.m.(local
time) to estimated 2.6 million eligible voters, and will close at
7 p.m.(local time). But in Sarajevo, voting hours in some reopened
stations could be extended to 10 p.m. (local time).

Nineteen roads have been designated as special routes for
refugees returning home, which will be heavily protected by IFOR.

<HEADLINE> OIC Says Iraqi Threat to Kuwait Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) said today that the latest Iraqi threats
to Kuwait are unacceptable at a time when the Islamic world needs
cooperation and solidarity among its nations.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's official news agency KUNA quoted Secretary General of
OIC Hamid Al-Ghabid as telling an OIC's economic, cultural and
social committee that the "organization will not tolerate any
action against Kuwait's sovereignty and calls for the
implementation of all related international resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his fear that the Iraqi threats would spark off
war in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The threats come at a time when the Islamic world needs
cooperation and solidarity among its nations to achieve welfare.
</P>
<P>
Iraq warned Kuwait on Friday against letting U.S. warplanes to
use its land as a base to strike Iraq, claiming that the act was a
declaration of war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Eight U.S. stealth F-117a warplanes have landed in Kuwait in a
further flexing of military muscles by the U.S. following its two
salvos of missiles attacks against Iraqi targets earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Ghabid also asserted the OIC's commitment to public
international laws and United Nations resolutions as well as
its keenness on Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara said here today that the ties maintained by some Arab
countries with Israel should be linked to pushing forward
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shara, who is in Cairo to participate in meetings of Arab
foreign ministers, told reporters that many Arab foreign
ministers hold such a point of view.
</P>
<P>
He said that the resumption of peace talks on the basis of
previously-approved principles and signed agreements is the way
to push forward the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Syria has repeatedly accused Israel of ignoring the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers and officials today held an emergency
meeting on the stalled Mideast peace process at the request of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
They also gathered for a regular meeting to discuss creating
mechanisms to contain and solve peacefully inter-Arab disputes.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shara said that the ministers are very aware of the crucial
nature of the present stage of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East is gradually deviating from the atmosphere of
peace due to Israel's intransigent position, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Iraq, Shara said Syria rejects any
interference in Iraq's internal affairs and strongly supports
Iraq's territorial integrity.

PARIS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Seven thousand people
demonstrated today in the southern city Marseille to protest the
murder of a 14-year-old boy Monday this week by a naturalized
Moroccan teenager.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 5,000 people attended in the small church of
Saint-Pierre-Saint-Paul in Marseille the funeral of the victim of
the murder, young Nicolas, who was stabbed to death by a
15-year-old naturalized Moroccan boy while he was eating a
sandwich.
</P>
<P>
The protest was held after bitter quarrels took place between
the the far-right National Front (FN) and the Socialist Party
which accused FN president Jean-Marie Le Pen of spreading racism
by declaring in public that some models of civilizations are
superior than others.
</P>
<P>
While paying a visit Friday to the former site of Auschiwitz
death camp in Poland, French President Jacques Chirac called on
French people not to forget the lesson of Auschwitz while warning
them against "doctrines of exclusion".
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette today also accused the FN of
"exploiting the misfortune" caused by the death of young Nicolas
by organizing the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The murderer, whose name was not revealed for the protection of
his family, has confessed his murder. He said he killed Nicolas
because he felt inferior to him.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends US Military Policy towards Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton warned Iraq on Saturday that the United States will
continue to take whatever steps it needs to protect its strategic
interests in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton defended his military
policy toward Iraq in last two weeks, saying his order of cruise
missile strikes on Iraqi military facilities and buildup of U.S.
military presence in the Gulf "tightened the strategic
straitjacket on Saddam Hussein".
</P>
<P>
"In doing so we advanced American interests in the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched 44 cruise missiles on Iraq air
defense installations in two rounds of strikes under the order of
Clinton last Tuesday, which he said was to let Saddam "pay price"
for his troops entering the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of U.S. strikes and threat, the Iraqis denounced
no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq as "null and void" and
fired missiles at U.S. aircraft patrolling the skies of the no-fly
zone imposed by the United States and its allies right after the
Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force has dispatched four B-52 bombers to the
island of Diego Garcia, close to the Gulf areas, and sent 8
radar-evading F-117 stealth fighter-bombers from home to Kuwait.
In addition, a contingent of 18 F-16C fighter planes at an air
base in Georgia flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday to relieve another
F-16 contingent, but the latter, instead of returning home, will
stay in the region to show off U.S. military strength.
</P>
<P>
The Army has activated two Patriot anti-missiles batteries,
used during the Gulf War, and sent them to the Gulf region.
Another move the Army has taken is to send 5,000 troops of the 1st
Cavalry Division to Kuwait with tanks and armored vehicleds to
join another 1,200 soldiers already there in exercise "Intrinsic
Action".
</P>
<P>
The Navy has already deployed the aircraft carrier USS Carl
Vinson in the Gulf. Another aircraft carrier USS Enterprise is on
its way toward the Gulf region to join the USS Carl Vinson. It
arrived off Port Said at the northern end of the Suez Canal on
Saturday. There are about 180 warplanes on both carriers, which,
plus about 130 warplanes on ground in the Middle East, will put
the number of U.S. fighters and bombers up to more than 300.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets with Arafat on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Egypt's port
city of Alexandria this evening for talks mainly on the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said afterwards that his meeting with Mubarak came amid
important and weighty changes resulting from faltering
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and Israel's failure to
implement agreements signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel must abide by all Palestinian-Israeli agreements, he
was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came after an emergency meeting of Arab foreign
ministers presided over by Arafat earlier today in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called on the emergency meeting to seek support from
the Arabs to pressure Israel into honoring its agreements signed
with the Palestinians and moving faster toward peace.
</P>
<P>
"Their (the Arabs') response was very positive," he said in
Cairo after the meeting. "They support completely the
Palestinians and their efforts to achieve the implementation of
what has been agreed upon between us and the Israelis."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said in Alexandria that his meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this month should have
constituted a springboard for the implementation of
Palestinian-Israeli agreements, but "unfortunately, none of the
deals has been implemented so far," MENA reported.

<HEADLINE> CIA Spends $100 Million on Anti-Saddam Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) has since 1991 spent around 100 million
U.S. dollars on the failed campaign to oust Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, The Washington Post quoting U.S. administration,
congressional and Iraqi dissident sources reported today.
</P>
<P>
The CIA's covert operation headquarters is reportedly located on
a hill in the city of Salahuddin in Kurdish northern Iraq, where
a small team of American CIA officers has been helping to
implement a classified 1991 U.S. presidential order to oust
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
Dissident Kurds and other Iraqis asked for and received the
funds from CIA to spend on light arms and ammunition,
communications gear, publishing materials, broadcasting equipment,
cars and trucks, food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi dissidents set off some bombs, recruited defectors,
fought a brief military battle with Iraqi troops in March and took
hundreds of Iraqi army prisoners.
</P>
<P>
But a military sweep across northern Iraq in the past two weeks
by Kurdish forces backed by Baghdad has left the major CIA effort
in the Kurdish region in tatters.
</P>
<P>
Many members and sympathizers of a CIA-supported umbrella
organization in the region have been captured, killed or
surrounded by military forces loyal to Saddam, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency under the Pentagon
admitted in a recently declassified report to the U.S. Congress
that Saddam's departure from the Iraqi political scene "does not
appear imminent".

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller today warned Iran to
stop its alleged support for the rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted Ciller as
saying: "Turkey can no longer turn a blind eye to this."
</P>
<P>
"We warned our friends in a brotherly manner," she said,
referring to her meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati in Izmir city along the Aegean Coast Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ciller urged Iran to take measures against the PKK, jointly
with Turkey if necessary, or let Ankara sort out the border
issue itself.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a war for self-rule in southeastern
Turkey since August 1984. More than 21,000 people have been
killed in conflicts between the PKK and the Turkish government
troops.

<HEADLINE> Only Four Goals Scored in Five League Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The 16th round of the China's
professional soccer league witnessed a goal drought as only four
goals were scored in the five matches on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Songri played to a 1-1 draw against league leaders
Dalian Wanda. The match was the only one which had more than one
goal in the 16th round.
</P>
<P>
The other two matches which ever produced a goal were Beijing
Guo'an lost to Jinan Taishan 1-0 at home and Yanbian Hyundai
defeated Sichuan Quanxin 1-0 on home turf.
</P>
<P>
The match between defending champions Shanghai Shenhua and
Guangzhou Apollo was postponed as the Shanghai team just played a
Asian club match on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The match between Beijing Guo'an and Jinan Taishan took the
limelight of the round. The Beijing team, who had never beaten
Jinan Taishan in both League and Cup matches in the past three
years, failed to rewrite the record.
</P>
<P>
The host team were even out-played by the Jinan team in the
first half. Shu Maozhen scored the solo goal of the match at the
37th minute. That was enough for the visiting team to garner
three points and walk out of the relegation zone.
</P>
<P>
In the other two matches played on Sunday, the Chinese Army's
team failed to take advantage high-altitude home turf against a
high-spirited Tianjin Sumsung and were forced to a 0-0 draw.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Hongyuan, playing at home in Dongguan, dominated the
match against Shenzhen, one of the four league teams from
Guangdong Province. But they just could not converted any of the
scoring chances.

<HEADLINE> Perry: US to Continue Containment Policy against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry said here today that the United States will
continue to implement the containment policy against Iraq while
keeping the possibility of a further strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Perry told a press conference shortly before leaving here for
Bahrain that "there is still a possibility to strike Iraq again."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We believe the goal of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein is to dominate this region and he could only be prevented
from doing so by the containment policy."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense secretary accused Saddam Hussein of making
"numerous attempts" to break out this containment policy by
sending several divisions down to the Kuwaiti border in 1993 and
1994. "He did it again today," Perry added.
</P>
<P>
Perry further noted that the danger is not just in the north
although Saddam made military adventures in the north. He said
the danger is that Saddam would be emboldened by those actions
and break out containment again and develop weapons of mass
destruction which the U.N. sanctions have restrained him from
developing and move to "either coerce or even attack his
neighbors" in the south.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, it was necessary to take some action. The
key to this action was to expand the no-fly zone up to the 33rd
parallel almost up to the southern border of Baghdad in a bid to
strike at Saddam Hussein's strategic center.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the no-fly zone is to keep the Iraqi army and
military forces "as far from the border of Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia as possible," said Perry.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "we will neither tolerate threat to our
pilots, nor do we believe that we can rely on Saddam Hussein's
promise that he will not attack our airplanes," clearly referring
to the missiles launched by the Iraqi forces against the
U.S. planes patrolling over the no-fly zones in Iraq eralier this
week.
</P>
<P>
Another "no-fly" zone is above the 36th parallel in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Perry said "we are interested in actions, not just words."
</P>
<P>
He went on, "We will take whatever actions necessary to
continue to reinforce no-fly zone up to the 33rd parallel and we
will take whatever action necessary to protect our pilots."
</P>
<P>
He said he ordered a second carrier battle group to be moved
into the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He added that with the permission of the Kuwaiti government,
"we have ordered eight F-117 stealth planes into Kuwait and they
are already deployed for operations."
</P>
<P>
"I have also ordered a Patriot battery to be moved into
Kuwait," Perry said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was sent here by U.S. President Bill Clinton to
"consult especially with his Kuwaiti counterpart about the
future actions and assessment of the situation."
</P>
<P>
During his press conference, he mentioned twice that the
U.S. would "stand shoulder by shoulder" with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here this morning from Saudi Arabia in a shuttle
Middle East tour which also includes Bahrain and Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medalists China
beat Brazil 3-1 here today to win a World Women's Volleyball Grand
Prix leg with three wins.
</P>
<P>
Brazil finished second in the leg with two wins and one
loss. Russia, which beat winless South Korea 17-15, 15-12, 15-10
in today's other match, was third with one victory against two
losses.
</P>
<P>
China was never behind in the first set, which it took 15-7
with effective blockings and services that disrupted the
opponent's rhythm.
</P>
<P>
Brazil rallied from 1-8 down to level the score at 9-all,
10-all and 14-all in the second set and finally won after two
consecutive mistakes by Chinese setter He Qi.
</P>
<P>
But successful Chinese defense warded off the Brazilian attacks
in the third and fourth sets, where spikers Wu Yongmei and Li Yan
had outstanding performances to inspire China to win 15-7 and
15-12.
</P>
<P>
Li scored 10 points during the match while Wu and veteran Lai
Yawen added seven and six points respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ana Moser had 11 points to lead the Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
All three individual prizes of the leg went to Chinese
players. Li was named the Most Spirited Player, Lai became the
Most Valuable Player and Wu was named the Best Spiker.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Lang Ping said her players had to fight off
fatigue resulted from their Saturday marathon match against
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I told them they had to conquer themselves, that is their
fatigue, before having a chance to beat Brazil. They performed
well in blocking and counter-attacks," she said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory, China has never beaten Brazil in major
world events like the Olympics, World Cup and World Championship,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian team manager Lattari Filho said injuries had greatly
affected his team's performance after the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
In the last leg of the preliminaries next week, China, Russia,
the United States and the Netherlands will compete in Hong Kong,
while Cuba, South Korea, Japan and Brazil will meet each other in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The top three teams out of the preliminaries, and host team
China, will enter the finals in Shanghai later this month.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China's national economic
development has maintained steady growth in the past eight months,
and the country is witnessing its best overall economic situation
since 1993, a senior Chinese official has said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Zhu Rongji said at a three-day National Conference
on Cotton, which closed on Thursday, that all the items of the
macro-economic index have basically met requirements set at the
beginning of this year. Some are even better than expected.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the achievements to the better controls by the
Communist Party of China and the government in economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has enhanced its macro-economic control
without sacrificing its fast and sustained development and without
causing an obvious rise of unemployment rate in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said since the beginning of this year, the country's
consumer demands have grown steadily, investment in fixed assets
has gone up sensibly, and foreign trade has increased steadily.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that while revenues have increased
rapidly, the financial situation remains stable, and that a good
agricultural situation is providing a sound foundation for the
good economy.
</P>
<P>
As for the management of state-owned enterprises, Zhu
attributed the poor economic returns of a number of state-owned
enterprises to an outdated management system that does not fit in
with the requirements of a social market economy, and a product
mix that does not meet the market needs.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the enterprises' problems are inevitable
during the process of the reform of the economic system. Efforts
must be made to solve the problems, he said, otherwise it will
simply be impossible to establish a new socialist market system.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the government has taken a series of measures to help
state-owned enterprises improve their economic conditions and to
tide them over during the present difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that their difficulties have been
lessened, their economic returns have begun to improve in the past
two months and their exports have increased.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Li Tieying
called for western parts of the country to quicken the pace of
reforms to speed up economic development.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and minister of the State
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, made the remark during a
tour of Xinjiang from September 6 to 15.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the central government is watching the economic
development and reforms in the vast central and western parts of
the country closely and is making greater efforts to narrow the
gap between the eastern and western parts of China, but urged the
regions to use every means possible to liberate minds and boost
productivity.
</P>
<P>
Li said that priority should be given to reforms in state-owned
enterprises and establishing a new system for new enterprises. He
added that China has planned many key construction projects in
Xinjiang for the next five years, and in no way should they use
conventional ways in dealing with the projects.
</P>
<P>
He singled out the Tarim Oil Field, saying that it has made
great headway in setting up a new system, inviting bids for
drilling wells, laying pipe, and building roads, which has proven
effective.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of Xinjiang's agricultural development and the
great contribution made by the Xinjiang Production and
Construction Corps to the region's economic and social
development.

PERTH, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Tommi Makinen of Finland
extended his lead after Sunday's special stages in the Rally of
Australia, the seventh round of the world championship.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain forced organisers to cancel two stages after four
of the first six cars were stranded in a deep river crossing.
</P>
<P>
But Makinen, driving a Mitsubishi, sailed through unscathed and
will become world champion for the first time unless positions
change during the third and final day on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Makinen said he felt strange that other drivers could not go
faster. He extended his lead to one minute 22 seconds after
Sunday's stages.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Eriksson of Sweden, one of two drivers with a chance of
overtaking Makinen, drove his Subaru to edge Carlos Sainz of Ford
team to the third place.
</P>
<P>
Sainz of Spain, the other title contender, stopped in
the river and slid off the road twice. The incidents almost
forced him out of the title contention.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Press Urges US to Abandon Policy of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi newspaper
Al-Thawra, mouthpiece of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party,
urged today the United States to listen to the voice of
reason and logic and to abandon the policy of aggression and
arrogance.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has taken all actions capable of warding off the
confrontation forced by Washington against Iraq within the
outbiddings taking place in the U.S. presidential election
campaign," Al-Thawra said in a political analysis.
</P>
<P>
The paper added, "Washington, which speaks the language of
force, finds itself today in a difficult position that would not
enable it to market the policy of violence and aggression it has
adopted against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra pointed out that China, Russia and France have
expressed their opposition to using any form of force against
Iraq, urging Washington not to go beyond the boundaries of
international legitimacy which admit no aggression to be launched
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Another Iraqi newspaper, Al-Jomhouriya, also affirmed today
that the U.S. missile attacks on Iraq has availed the
U.S. nothing, and that it has only revealed the Clinton
administration's incapability to find convincing reasons for
such an action.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military buildup in the Gulf is continuing, in
preparation for carrying out a fresh operation against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein held
Saturday a meeting with members of the Air Defense Command and
examined with them all eventualities of a military confrontation
with the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China's national economic
development has maintained steady growth in the past eight months,
and the country is witnessing its best overall economic situation
since 1993, a senior Chinese official has said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Zhu Rongji said at a three-day National Conference
on Cotton, which closed on Thursday, that all the items of the
micro-economic index have basically met requirements set at the
beginning of this year. Some are even better than expected.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the achievements to the better controls by the
Communist Party of China and the government in economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has enhanced its micro-economic control
without sacrificing its fast and sustained development and without
causing an obvious rise of unemployment rate in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said since the beginning of this year, the country's
consumer demands have grown steadily, investment in fixed assets
has gone up sensibly, and foreign trade has increased steadily.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that while revenues have increased
rapidly, the financial situation remains stable, and that a good
agricultural situation is providing a sound foundation for the
good economy.
</P>
<P>
As for the management of state-owned enterprises, Zhu
attributed the poor economic returns of a number of state-owned
enterprises to an outdated management system that does not fit in
with the requirements of a social market economy, and a product
mix that does not meet the market needs.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the enterprises' problems are inevitable
during the process of the reform of the economic system. Efforts
must be made to solve the problems, he said, otherwise it will
simply be impossible to establish a new socialist market system.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the government has taken a series of measures to help
state-owned enterprises improve their economic conditions and to
tide them over during the present difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that their difficulties have been
lessened, their economic returns have begun to improve in the past
two months and their exports have increased.

YINCHUAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Two giant salamanders are
still doing quite well in the Shahu Aquarium in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, four years after they were netted
in nearby Shahu Lake.
</P>

Giant salamanders are given top state protection and have been
found living in the fresh waters of southern China, but this was
the first time for them to be found in waters above the 38th
parallel in northern China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on Cotton Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has
called for an early adjustment in the structure of China's
nation's textile industry to promote a steady cotton production.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made the plea during a
three-day National Conference on Cotton which ended on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the State Council, decided not to
throw open the nation's cotton market, raw material price and the
administration over cotton growing this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said new problems on cotton production, circulation
and consumer demand reflected the textile industry's long existing
problems as repetition of low-level production, surplus
production capacity, poor quality and outdated products.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier stressed that all the problems can be solved
through further reforms, adjustments of the product mix, and
adopting comprehensive rectification measures.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government's finance, tax authority and marketing
cooperatives to seek ways of helping textile mills overcome their
problems to reactivate the industry.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Chen Junsheng said at the conference's opening
ceremony, on behalf of the State Council, that maintaining the
steady growth of cotton production is an important task of the
local governments in cotton growing areas.
</P>
<P>
He called for further adjustments of the overall arrangement of
cotton production to raise the yield of cotton from each hectare.
</P>
<P>
Chen also urged the promotion of cotton production with the
help of science and technology, and improving the quality of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the textile industry, he asked textile mills to
improve their management, raise their technical levels and sharpen
their competitive edges in world markets.

<HEADLINE> Attack on School Kills One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- One man was shot dead and
another wounded at a school closing ceremony in Huriwa district
of North Mogadishu controlled by faction leader Hussein Mohamed
Aidid yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness, the shooting was carried out by a
young man carrying an Ak-47 who was believed to have been among
the students of the Brothers' Institute of Language.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the shooting is not known. However, people
after the incident told Xinhua the occurrence happened after a
religious group came and asked the school's administration to
give them a chance to offer a religious lecture at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
All the students and their parents were summoned to attend the
ceremony in which the best students would be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
The teachers of Institute who organized the ceremony with a
group of musicians and entertainers with soft drinks and sweets
had refused the religious men access to give lecture to the
participants.
</P>
<P>
A report said the religious group had then considered the act
as being against "the good behavior of Islam".
</P>
<P>
Another eyewitness said, after a short quarrel, all the
religious men who wore trousers that did not reach their ankles
and had long sleeves returned.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear, whether the group has carried out the attack.
Nevertheless, a group calling themselves Anti Debauchery team has
claimed to have engaged in bitter fighting against the
non-Islamic movements as they put it.
</P>
<P>
The group had dropped threatening leaflets warning people to
avoid all anti-Islam movements, otherwise they will be punished.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Islam fundamentalists dare give out
orders in the war torn capital of Mogadishu since the fighting
broke out between rival clans in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu is currently hosting few private language institutes
and ordinary primary and intermediate schools. The intermediate
and elementary schools are run by Islamic organizations funded by
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait through Al-Itihad and Al-Islah
respectively. There has been no secondary schools or universities
in Somalia since 1991.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry today reaffirmed U.S. commitment to defend its
allies in the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. would stand shoulder by shoulder with Kuwait," Perry
said at a press conference held before he left for Bahrain after a
brief visit to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said, during his short stay here, he met with Kuwaiti Amir
Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah and held consultations with Kuwaiti
Defense Minister Sheikh Hmoud Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the future actions to be taken regarding the
latest developments in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said any further strikes against Iraq would be taken with
the agreement of the U.S. allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Perry arrived here this morning from Saudi Arabia in a shuttle
tour in the region, his tour will also take him to Turkey after
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
A White House official said before Perry's departure to the
Middle East that the purpose of his tour is to "share our
intention and options with our allies and friends and get their
input on the degree to which they would support such action and
the implication of such action."
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to a possible further strike on
Iraq following two salvos of U.S. missile attacks against Iraqi
air defense targets earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the Perry trip will be to talk to
regional partners about providing support we would need to
carry out various operations in the region and to explain to them
exactly what possible missions might be in this case," the
official was quoted as saying by local media.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Close More Foreign Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government may
close more diplomatic missions abroad after it shut its high
commission in Canada ten days ago, the Guardian newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Countries to be affected, according to the newspaper, are
mostly those whose economic status and socio-political relations
with nigeria are considered to be ''lying low''.
</P>
<P>
In the new dispensation, a particular mission may have to
supervise affairs in as many countries as possible, a situation
which now obtains on a very minimal level in Nigeria's 94
diplomatic missions abroad, it said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources as saying that the exercise would
''come in trickles'' though the number of foreign missions to be
shut is yet to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria announced the closure of its diplomatic mission in
Canada on September 6 in a ''rationalization exercise'' in its
foreign service stations for cost-effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
But it is widely believed that the decision was taken to avoid
a possible embarrassment in the hands of Canada which has been in
the forefront of countries calling for the imposition of
wide-ranging sanctions against Nigeria for alleged human rights
abuses.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Canada has refused to retaliate by closing
down its mission in Nigeria but it is likely to downgrade its
high commission in the country.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Activists Step Up Claim Over Temple Mount </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
Jews have reinforced their activities in asserting their historic
claims over the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem since the
rightwing Likud Party came to power. English bi-weekly The
Jerusalem Report reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Report said in a special article in its latest issue  that
for nearly 30 years, an uneasy status quo prevailed on the Temple
Mount -- Jordan effectively controlling the Holy Moslem site,
Palestinians aspiring for it, and most orthodox Jews considering
too holy to walk upon.
</P>
<P>
But now conflicting claims are threatening to turn what is
already the Middle East's most sensitive ground into a real flash
point.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu victory has raised expectations of a change in
the so-called status quo -- which grants Jews the right to
visit but not pray on the Mount, and which gives Israeli
police authority at its gates but Moslem officials control
within.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government is the first to include in its
coalition guidelines implicit support for Jewish prayer on the
Mount, promising to "guarantee the rights of the Jews to pray in
all the places holy to them."
</P>
<P>
Already under pressure not to step up tensions with the
Palestinians, Netanyahu is unlikely to initiate any changes on
the Mount for the time being. "The government has no intention of
altering the status quo," promised Jerusalem mayor and Netanyahu
confidante Ehud Olmert.
</P>
<P>
But the Jewish activists have begun an unprecedented dialogue
with the new government. In mid-July, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan told them he sympathized with their position, on civil
liberties grounds.
</P>
<P>
"People used to smile when they'd mention us," said veteran
activist Yisrael Medad. "Now we're taken seriously, and in some
religious Zionist circles, very seriously."
</P>
<P>
Jewish activists have presented the government with a list of
demands, including establishing a tourist center overlooking the
Mount, setting up a synagogue, and ending the veto power of the
Waqf, the Muslim Religious Trust, over Jewish prayer.
</P>
<P>
Though none of those demands is likely to be met at this
stage, Netanyahu is apparently receptive of allowing Jewish
"study groups" onto the Mount. But he wants to be sure that the
study groups don't turn into prayer groups.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Old City from the Jordanians in the
Six-day War in 1967, asserted authority over Wester Wall
plaza while allowing Moslem Waqf to retain control over the
Temple Mount itself.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, after Jewish worshipers at Western Wall were stoned,
a total of 17 Palestinians were killed by Israeli police in what
was known as the "Temple Mount Massacre."

<HEADLINE> PC Officials Satisfied With Response to HK SAR Selection Body Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) have expressed satisfaction over the response to the
nomination for seats in the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
The PC Secretariat Office in Hong Kong had received a total of
5,833 application forms for seats on the 400-member Selection
Committee by Saturday noon, the deadline for Selection Committee
membership applications.
</P>
<P>
A total of 22,106 forms had been distributed by the office,
with 18,630 of them taken by organizations and 3,476 by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
PC Deputy Secretary-General Shiu Sin-por said the whole process
 of nomination which began on August 15 was smooth and the
committee was satisfied with the number of nominations.
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be no problem in selecting the right people
 to sit on the committee," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shiu said the committee would allow nominees whose forms showed
 such technical problems as missing signatures and photocopies of
their identity cards, to add in the details today or as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Although (the nomination) is a serious matter, we do talk
about flexibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shiu, who submitted his nomination via the professional
category, said the secretariat would first check the application
forms and then submit a list of applicants to the PC next month
for examination. The list is expected to be ready at the end of
this month, he said.
</P>
<P>
A rough estimate showed that most of the application forms came
 from the industrial, commercial and grassroots sectors, Shiu said.
</P>
<P>
Fei Fih, deputy director of the Secretariat Office, said that
Hong Kong people had showed great enthusiasm for the formation of
the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The warm response demonstrated Hong Kong people's commitment
to a bright future," she said.
</P>
<P>
PC member Professor Lau Siu-kai said the good response was the
reflection of social support for the process, adding that it was
more of a political mobilization process.
</P>
<P>
"Many nominees applied simply because they want to show support
 for the PC -- not necessarily aiming at seeking representation,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Council Warns of Danger of Tooth Whiteners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Consumer
Council has warned that some tooth whiteners on sale in Hong Kong
contain more than 100 times the recommended level of hydrogen
peroxide, which is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
The Council recommended people to use only tooth whiteners
prescribed by dentists, the local English-language newspaper South
 China Morning Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The council said using whiteners with a high hydrogen peroxide
content could cause inflammation, swelling and bleeding of
gums. If the chemical was accidentally swallowed it could lead to
vomiting and internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
The Council's latest tests found that seven samples of tooth
whiteners available on Hong Kong market, which are all from the
United States, contained 2.6 to 10.4 percent of hydrogen peroxide.
</P>
<P>
The levels were in excess of the 0.1 percent limit under the
European Union's requirement by 26 to 104 times.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chi-kin, chairman of the Council, said consumers should be
careful in using these products as no laws are available now to
regulate them.
</P>
<P>
The authorities in the U.S. were evaluating whether tooth
whiteners should be regulated as drugs or as cosmetics, the report
 said.

CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will spend 25 million pounds (7.35 million
dollars) on security at the Egyptian Museum after a man tried to
steal some Pharaonic treasures from it, the Egyptian Gazette
reported today.
</P>
<P>
An electronic security system will be fitted in the museum,
particularly in rooms containing valuable gold items. Police dogs
will also patrol the building daily after closing.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri approved an
ambitious investment program for the current fiscal year to
complete utility and public service projects in all governorates,
especially in southern Egypt, according to the Egyptian Gazette
today.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri said that the government allocated 3,710 Egyptian
million pounds (1,091 million dollars) for services and 3,951
million pounds (1,162 million dollars) for administrative reforms
in southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT -- Saudi Health Ministry has started paying arrears to
pharmaceutical and medical equipment suppliers going back four
years, according to the latest issue of the Middle East Economic
Digest (MEED).
</P>
<P>
MEED quoted Saudi industry sources as saying that the payments
to suppliers have started in late August.
</P>

Industry sources put the arrears at 1,000 million dollars, but
Kevin Taecker, chief economist at Saudi American Bank, estimates
the backlog at between 2,000 million dollars and 3,000 million

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Made Pencils in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Pencils with clearly trade
mark "Kofa" "Made in China" were laid in order together with note
papers on the shining table in a solemn hall of the Zambian State
House.
</P>
<P>
This was seen when Zambian President Frederick Chiluba was
receiving foreign guests in the hall recently.
</P>
<P>
Taking up his pencil, a local friend came at me and said with
smile, "made in china, made in china, your pencils are used in
our president's office !"
</P>
<P>
His words put me in deep thoughts. I have traveled in not a
few countries in Asia and Africa and taken part in some important
functions. On those occasions, only European and American pencils
were used for their "good quality".
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that i saw Chinese made pencils on the
table in a solemn function abroad.
</P>
<P>
Chinese made pencils are also found in conference centers and
hotel meeting rooms in the Zambian capital.
</P>
<P>
What surprises me most is that i even found Chinese made
pencils in markets in the remote villages of Kabompo and
Mwinilunga and in boothes at the road sides in the wild bushes
from Kabompo to Mwinilunga and then to Solwezi along Zambia's
border areas adjacent to Angola and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
I was awaken from the untrammeled fancy when the president
began talking with his guests. Looking at the golden words "Made
in China" on the pencil, i could not help from feeling "how great
is our motherland".

KUNMING, Yunnan Province, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
Army's team were forced to a goalless draw in the 16th round of
the Chinese professional soccer league here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Led by veteran coach Liu Guojiang, the Army's team have made
great progress this season and even entered the top three of the
standings.
</P>
<P>
But they met a strong challenge from the Tianjin Samsung team,
who are fighting desperately to avoid relegation.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin team, which sacked their coach earlier in the
season, collected three points in as many matches. They tied
defending champions Shanghai Shenhua and forced Beijing Guo'an to
a 2-2 draw in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The match between the Tianjin team and the Army's team is
mostly a defensive one. The two teams adopted the same tactics of
counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
Yet both teams had the scoring chances, but they all squandered
them.

<HEADLINE> Govt Should Protect Beggars' Rights: Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A federal court in Lagos has
restrained the Lagos State government from further expelling
beggars from the state, saying the government order is a naked
violation of their basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
The court held that the government's order did not only
infringe on the rights of beggars, mostly disabled persons, but
was also capable of generating bad blood and ethnic discord, the
Sunday Champion newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The disabled brought on May 29 an application for the
enforcement of their fundamental rights, following a state
government order that all disabled persons should be cleared from
the streets of Lagos, and subsequently empowered a task force to
expel any person caught to their states of origin.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the task force arrested 1,806
beggars including children and women from various parts of the
Lagos metropolis in April. About 1,200 of them were on May 1
repatriated to their home states while 606 others sent to the
vocational and rehabilitation center in the north of the state.
</P>
<P>
In their statement of claim, the disabled averred that as
law-abiding citizens, who had not committed any crimes, they were
entitled to all the rights accruing from the provision of the
constitution, including the right to be protected from the
excesses of executive powers of the government, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thai PM Faces Big Challenge in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa might face a one-man battle to win a censure debate in
parliament this week after some of his key supporters seem to be
leaving him, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Banharn's final bastion apparently is crumbling after Sanoh
Thienthong, secretary-general of the Banharn-led Chart Thai (Thai
Nation) Party (CTP), said on Saturday that Banharn would have to
clear himself during the censure debate.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 percent of the opposition's allegations are directed
solely against Banharn, so the prime minister will have to respond
to most of the allegations himself, said Sanoh, who will head the
coalition's ad-hoc committee whose major role is to assist the
government in countering the opposition's censure.
</P>
<P>
The committee can only help respond to allegations involving
the government's general work, Sanoh said, but adding that Banharn
could be assured of the voting support of the coalition which
holds 209 seats in the 391-member lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that the opposition led by Democratic
Party Leader Chuan Leekpai planned to grill Banharn in parliament
on a major allegation that the Banharn-led government is
responsible for the country's worsening economic problems such as
the rising living cost, the stock market slump, falling foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's censure scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday
reportedly will also focus on the allegations concerning the
cabinet approval's for new bank licenses which allegedly involved
huge kickbacks, Banharn family's involvement in land deals, and
other personal issues related to Banharn.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also claimed that they have new evidence that
the CTP received financial support from Rakesh Saxena, the prime
suspect in the Bangkok Bank of Commerce embezzlement case.
</P>
<P>
Within the six-party coalition, some party leaders also seemed
to differ on certain issues.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Muan Chon (MASS) Party Leader and Justice
Minister Chalerm Yubamrung alleged that a senior figure gained
bribes of 750 million baht (30 million U.S. dollars) in exchange
for approving three new bank licenses.
</P>
<P>
New Aspiration Party Leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who recently
proposed to form an economic "dream team" to tackle the country's
existing economic problems, is also blamed by some Banharn aides
for discrediting the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Despite these troubles, however, Banharn still has a chance to
survive the censure debate as all the six coalition parties have
promised to vote for him, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
He may also have other choices, such as dissolving parliament
before the debate for fresh general elections, or just resigning
to pay the way for a new prime minister from the current
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said that although Banharn may survive the censure
debate this time, but a major change could be expected in the Thai
political arena soon after the debate.

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries Urged to Increase Aid to Poverty Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Female parliamentarians today
urged the international community, the developed countries in
particular, to increase economic and technical assistance to
developing countries to resolve the issue of escalating poverty.
</P>
<P>
Yossria Loza, an Egyptian representative here attending a
meeting of female parliamentarians of the 96th Conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, which is scheduled to open tomorrow,
said that governments everywhere must increase their budgetary
spending on poverty alleviation so as to achieve a goal of the
United Nations to halve the world's poverty-stricken population
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"However, assistance by the international community, especially
technical assistance, will help developing countries to develop
the potential labor resources and this is crucial to resolving the
poverty issue," Loza said.
</P>
<P>
Prejudice against women in education and employment has made
them the major victims of poverty, Loza said, urging
nongovernmental organizations and the business community to play a
greater part in the battle against poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Nongovernmental organizations are a link between the
governments and people whereas the business community can help
eradicate poverty by making investments in social service
facilities and creating more job opportunities," Loza said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Fighting Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 120 million rural
Chinese women have been involved in a national technical training
program for poverty alleviation over the past seven years, with 80
percent of them eventually grasping one or two techniques.
</P>
<P>
"Women are both the main beneficiary of China's anti-poverty
effort and the main force to fight against poverty and
backwardness," Lin Liyun, member of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, said here today at a meeting of female
parliamentarians prior to Monday's official opening of the 96th
Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that China currently still has a
poverty-stricken population of 65 million, 60 percent of whom are
women and children.
</P>
<P>
Women who have benefited from the technical training program
can lend a helping hand to their sisters still mired in poverty by
passing on to them what they have learned and helping them raise
funds, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
"This method of fighting against poverty and achieving common
prosperity through joint efforts has generated very good results,"
Lin told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The anti-poverty campaign has also produced 510,000 female
technicians and enabled over three million women to become
literate annually, Lin said, noting that technical training has
been incorporated in a government program for women's development
as an effective means to counter the poverty of women.
</P>
<P>
China plans to make all its destitute population have enough to
eat and wear by the year 2000. The All-China Women's Federation,
the largest non-governmental organization for women, has launched
a campaign focusing on the development of courtyard economy to
lift one million women out of poverty before 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Differences and conflicts
among countries must be resolved through negotiation and other
peaceful means, top officials of the Inter-Parliamentary Union
urged here today.
</P>
<P>
"We always advocate that all differences will be settled by
peaceful means, by negotiation, and this is the permanent position
of the IPU," Pierre Nornillon, IPU's Secretary-General, said when
was asked in an interview to comment on the United States' recent

</P>
<P>
Ahmed Sorour, President of the Council of the IPU, said in the
same interview that "according to international law, every country
is independent and the rules of law are known by all and legality
must be respected by all parliaments."
</P>
<P>
He said that the emergent supplementary item put forward by
Iraq on the U.S missile attack can only be passed by the
conference with a 4/5 majority vote.
</P>
<P>
"From the objective point of view, if the question is
discussed, I am sure our resolution or recommendation will meet
the national legality, the rule of law and respect of human
rights," Sorour said.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming 96th Conference of the IPU, scheduled to open here
tomorrow, will discuss the policy and strategy on how to further

women and children in particular, and on how to ensure mankind's
rights to food at a time like today when economic globalization
and trade liberalization prevail, Sorour said.

Russia and other countries, will cover hot issues in international
relations, Sorour added.

<HEADLINE> Women Parliamentarians Discuss Political Equality with Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- To facilitate women's equal
participation in political affairs and relieve them out of poverty
were two major topics at the meeting of women parliamentarians,
which was held here today.
</P>
<P>
Attended by more than 100 parliamentarians around the world,
the meeting was convened just a day before the opening of the 96th
conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a total of 104 women parliamentarians have
registered to attend the IPU conference to be held in Beijing
September 16-21.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee of
China's National People's Congress, was elected chairwoman of
today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
One year had passed since the Fourth UN World Conference on
Women was held here, but the phenomena of women's being
discriminated against, oppressed and even bullied still exist,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Women parliamentarians from different countries will continue
to discuss issues of common concern for women around the globe,
making persistent efforts to correct the imbalanced participation
in political affairs between men and women so as to achieve true
equality stipulated in laws, she said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ahmed Fathy Sorour, President of the Inter-Parliamentary
Council, said at the meeting that all countries are plagued by
poverty to one degree or another, and the alleviation of poverty
deserves strong action by both governments and parliaments in
various countries.
</P>
<P>
"Studies carried out nationally and internationally tend to
show that women are often more drastically affected than men by
poverty and extreme poverty. They also show that women can play
decisive role to eradicate it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I trust that, both as women and as parliamentarians, you will
be able to identify, in the course of your discussions, positive
experiences and creative ways and means to face this phenomenon,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
As to women's participation in political affairs, he said that
both genders need to cooperate in solving problems, such as
poverty, which affect them both. "This is why the IPU has been
promoting over the years an increased participation of women in
politics."
</P>
<P>
Nie Li, a member of China's NPC Standing Committee, said China
will further strengthen women's participation in political affairs
to ensure that all leadership at various levels will include women.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, China will ensure women basically
have enough food and clothing, eradicate illiteracy among young
and middle-aged women, and make both urban and rural women enjoy
good medical care, Nie said.
</P>
<P>
Women parliamentarians from India, Japan, Russia and Libya also
made speeches on women's political rights and poverty alleviation.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parliament to Vote on Treaty With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The fate of a Nepal-India
border river development treaty, which has met strong opposition
here, is expected to be determined on Monday when the Nepali
parliament holds a vote on its ratification.
</P>
<P>
The joint session of the upper and lower houses of parliament
was adjourned late Saturday night after holding discussions on the
Mahakali treaty for the third consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary session will be held again on Monday when the
treaty would be put to the vote, Speaker of the lower house Ram
Chandra Poudel announced.
</P>
<P>
The voting on the Mahakakli Treaty was scheduled for Saturday
but the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (CPN-UML) pushed
for the postponement at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML, which holds the key to the treaty's ratification,
asked for more time to discuss the treaty and threatened to vote
against it if the ruling side forced the voting in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party has demanded "necessary corrections" of
the treaty as a precondition for ratification, but the response
from the Indian government was "not positive," according to the
local press.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nepali government Saturday agreed to write to
the Indian side for further clarification on the treaty as
demanded by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML demands India clarify its proposed purchase of
Nepal's power share of a hydro project on the border river.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India signed the treaty on the integrated development
of the Mahakali river, in New Delhi in February.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which provides for principles of benefit sharing
for future hydro projects on the river, has been hailed as a
diplomatic achievement of Nepal in its water development
cooperation with India.
</P>
<P>
The treaty's ratification in Nepal needs a two-thirds majority
in the 265-seat parliament where the main opposition CPN-UML holds
101 seats.

<HEADLINE> Eighty Percent of New University Students From One Child Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Eighty percent of the new
students in Beijing's universities this year are from families
with only one child, Beijing Television Station reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
It said that Chinese universities are experiencing a peak year
when too many only children entered schools. Last year, the rate
of only children in universities was 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most only children were born in the 1970s and 1980s, because of
the adoption of the birth control policy. Many of them are at the
age to go to university.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that these children, usually living in
wealthier families, are self-centered and poor in handling their
daily life. This will bring new problems to universities, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jilian, deputy director of the Psychology Department of
the Beijing Normal University, was quoted as saying that his
university is preparing some psychological archives to study these
students' problems.

<HEADLINE> Report: Netanyahu Signs Big Deal With US Publisher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has struck a lucrative deal with an American
publisher for his memoirs, which will be written after he leaves
office, English bi-weekly The Jerusalem Report said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the bi-weekly, the deal was arranged with Warner
Books, one of the publishing arms of the giant Time-Warner-Turner
conglomerate. Warner staff are now apprising foreign language
publishers of news of the deal, hoping to sell the rights to the
book to as many countries as possible.
</P>
<P>
A Netanyahu spokesman confirmed the book deal and said
it had actually been signed before the prime minister won
election in May.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman denied claims that the deal was worth 1
million dollars or more -- "It's not even half of a million" --
and stressed that the money would be declared and taxed
appropriately.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line Likud prime minister mentioned his
memoirs-writing plan when he talked with the Jerusalem Post in a
comprehensive interview, which was published Friday in the English
 daily.
</P>
<P>
Asked what was in his mind when he met with PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat whom he said he'd never meet, Netanyahu
replied: "quite a few things, but I'll leave that to my
memoirs." The historic meeting took place on September 4.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has edited or written five books, including a
1992 volume, "A Place among Nations," setting out his vision
for Israel. Most of the prime minister's eight predecessors
penned memoirs of their years after stepping down. Netanyahu is
probably the first to sign a deal for such a work even
before taking office.

<HEADLINE> Wounded Afghan Soldiers Being Treated in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- wounded soldiers of
President Burhanuddin Rabbani's government in war-torn Afghanistan
are being sent to New Delhi, capital of India, for medical
treatment, the local Hindustan Times newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Most of these soldiers are undergoing treatment at private
hospitals and nursing homes in various parts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Since December last year, Indian hospitals have started
receiving wounded Afghan soldiers. According to a doctor treating
the Afghans, the 1,000-bed Kabul military hospital had been
damaged in constant rocket fire on the capital by the Taliban
Muslim Militia.
</P>
<P>
The medical services are in a bad shape in Afghanistan as most
hospitals have been damaged and there are inadequate numbers of
doctors.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan soldiers were quite at home here as they were
familiar with Indian people and felt at ease with them. Another
reason for sending them to India was that medical services here
were much more economical than in some Western countries, said
Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jitendra Nagpal at South Point hospital.

<HEADLINE> Edible Fungus Growing Helps Fujian Farmers Rid Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Business has mushroomed --
literally -- for growing numbers of farmers in south China's
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
They have become better-off by growing edible fungus, with
local officials saying the growing of fungus has added an
additional four billion yuan to local farmers' total income in the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
The province is now believed to be the world's biggest
production and processing base for edible fungus.
</P>
<P>
Last year the province chalked up 2.5 billion yuan in
agricultural output value from fungus growing, and earned 200
million US dollars from exports of the fungus.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has more hilly areas than arable land, and the per
capita share of farmland is very small. Many local farmers used to
live in poverty as a result of solely relying on grain cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities have been making efforts to try and
spread an edible fungus comprehensive development scheme in the
province's rural areas. The province's mild climate and high
humidity have helped achieve the desired good results.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations decided in 1994 to establish an
"Asia-Pacific Training Center for Edible Fungus" in Fujian, and
entrusted the center to conduct South-South Cooperation projects,
a so-called scheme to encourage cooperation between developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's advanced edible fungus growing technology has been
spread to many parts of China. Agricultural workers from more
than 20 countries, including the United States, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, have also visited the southeastern Chinese
province for further studies.

OTTAWA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States scored the
tying and go-ahead goals 43 seconds apart late in the third
period and poured in two more for good measure in a 5-2 win over
Canada to claim the World Cup championship in Montreal, Canada on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With Canada ahead 2-1, Brian Leetch fired a 50-footer for the
Americans from the blue line, which Brett Hull tipped past goalie
Curtis Joseph to tie the score with 3:18 remaining.
</P>
<P>
Tony Amonte's game-winner came at 17:25 as the forward banged
home a rebound of a shot by Derian Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
The goals by Hull and Amonte were both reviewed by replay
officials -- Hull's to see if he had held his stick too high on
the deflection, and Amonte's to determine if he had kicked the
puck in.
</P>
<P>
Both goals were upheld and the fired-up Americans scored twice
more to turn the final moments into a wild celebration as the
U.S. team prevailed two games to one in the inaugural World Cup of
Hockey championship.
</P>
<P>
The victory marked the most significant U.S. international ice
hockey triumph since the Miracle at Lake Placid in the 1980
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
U.S. goaltender Mike Richter, who stopped 35 shots, including
21 in the second period, was named the tournament Most Valuable

WUHAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Construction of an exhibition
hall for 2,400-year-old bronze chime bells is to be completed soon
in Wuhan, capital city of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The province started construction work on the exhibition hall
seven years ago with an investment of 20 million yuan to promote
traditional Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
The musical bells were unearthed in the tomb of the Marquis of
Zeng of the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.), 18 years
ago. They have been stored and displayed in the Hubei Provincial
Museum, said Shu Zhimei, museum curator.
</P>
<P>
The 64 bells were used as a musical instrument in ancient
China. They can still be used to play complicated Chinese and
foreign musical works after thousands of years underground, Shu
said.
</P>
<P>
Many researchers and archeologists are interested in the dragon
designs and inscriptions about ancient music on the bells.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition featuring the bells attracts 40,000 tourists at
home and abroad per year. Touring exhibitions in foreign
countries, such as Singapore, Japan, and Luxembourg, have been

KUWAIT CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The registration of
candidates for the upcoming October 7 general elections in
Kuwait came to an end Saturday, unaffected by the rising
tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
A total of 253 candidates had registered to run for the 50
seats in the National Assembly as the 10-day registration period
drew to an end Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This is the lowest number of candidates to file for parliament
elections since the current distribution of constituencies was
introduced in 1981, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the first election following the Gulf War in 1992, 304
candidates registered as against 534 and 267 in 1981 and
1985 respectively, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 percent of the candidates are new faces, bidding
to enter parliament for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti voters, totaling about 168,200, will choose 50 deputies
in 25 constituencies, two from each, for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament would face many issues, of which the most
important ones are security, crime and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Tension is escalating in the Gulf region after the United
States has threatened more military operations against Iraq
following two U.S. cruise missile attacks in early September on
the southern part of the oil-rich Arab country.

<HEADLINE> China's Cordless Phone Market Has Bright Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese telephone users
prefer to get their wires crossed, rather than use cordless
telephone sets.
</P>
<P>
The cordless phones only account for two percent of telephone
sales in the country.
</P>
<P>
But if the level reached a double-digit 10-percent the annual
market demand for the cordless phones is expected to hit 2.5
million sets by the year 2000, China's "People's Post and
Telecommunications News" reported.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, only 800,000 cordless phones were sold
in China, representing two percent of the total domestic sales
volume, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
As a striking contrast, the paper says 12 million cordless
phones were exported, accounting for 20 percent of the overseas
phone sales volume. Cordless phones account for 20 percent of all
the telephone sets in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The sharp contrast shows that the domestic cordless phone
market has great potential to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
China now has 27 cordless phone manufacturers, up three times
from 1993.
</P>
<P>
But experts warned that the country terminated the use of 48/74
MHz frequency for cordless phones in January of this year. Phone
manufacturers are expected to change the frequency quickly, and
develop new products.

<HEADLINE> More World Women Participate in Parliamentary Organs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 600
parliamentarians from different countries will attend the 96th
Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) to open here
Monday, 17.4 percent of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
According to IPU statistics, female parliamentarians account
for ten percent of all parliamentary members in the world.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that the IPU pays great attention to
encouraging more women to take part in political affairs and
raise their social status, IPU Secretary General Pierre
Cornillon noted.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the IPU will provide a report on world
women's participation in parliaments between 1945 and 1995 on the
basis of investigations in 186 countries.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, 176 countries had established parliaments.
</P>
<P>
In the parliaments of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and the
Netherlands, female parliamentarians account for 30 to 40 percent
of total parliamentary members in their countries.
</P>
<P>
The percentages are the highest compared with figures in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Parliaments in 12 other countries are all composed of men.
</P>
<P>
With regard to different regions around the globe, female
parliamentarians take up 13.2 percent in countries in Asia and
Europe, 12.7 percent in countries in America, 9.8 percent in
countries in Africa to the south of the Sahara Desert, 6.3 percent
in the Pacific region, and 4.3 percent in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
In China, the figure runs to 21 percent, the highest figure
among Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
By June 1995, parliaments in 16 countries, such as Britain,
Japan, Germany, Sweden, Mexico and South Africa, were headed by
women.
</P>
<P>
In some Western countries, the percentages of females elected
to parliaments are not high.
</P>
<P>
US congresswomen account for 10.9 percent which ranks 43rd
among all parliamentary organs in the world. The figures in
Britain and France are 9.5 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively,
which rank the 49th and 64th.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, the number of countries having
parliamentary organs has increased six times, but percentage of
female parliamentarians rose only three times.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also indicate that the 1950s was a turning point for
women to participate in political affairs, and the 1960s and 1970s
witnessed steady progress.
</P>
<P>
The 1980s saw another fast growth of women parliamentarians,
but the percentage slipped at the end of the 1980s and early
1990s. Over the past two years, the number of women
parliamentarians rebounded.

<HEADLINE> China's Participation is critically important to U.N.: Ghali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of the
United Nations Boutros Boutros Ghali said in an article recently
that China's active participation in the United Nations' efforts
in the spheres of international peace and security, decolonization
and sustainable economic and social development has been of
critical importance to the international community.
</P>
<P>
This year is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the restoration of
the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the U.N.
Beijing-based fortnightly magazine, namely "China's Talents", will
tomorrow carry the article by Ghali titled "United Nations and
China: Twenty-five Years' Fruitful Relationship For Peace and
Development".
</P>
<P>
Ghali said in the article that when the People's Republic of
China was established in 1949, this most populous country in the
world was denied membership in the world Organization.
</P>
<P>
"This anomaly was rectified in 1971, and the People's Republic
was welcomed into the United Nations," he noted, pointing out that
this contributed significantly to the credibility and relevance of
the United Nations as a truly universal, intergovernmental
organization.
</P>
<P>
He said that decolonization has been one of the great
achievements of the United Nations, and that the Organization's
success in this area is borne out by the enormous growth in the
number of Member States.
</P>
<P>
"China has played an important role in the decolonization
process," he voiced.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1970s, he said, China has also been an active
supporter of disarmament and has promoted the cause of disarmament
at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Also China played an instrumental role in securing the
comprehensive political settlement for Cambodia, he said.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that China, as a permanent member of the Security
Council, will have an important role to play in the years ahead in
helping to determine the most effective courses of action for the
Organization in its efforts to prevent crises, to respond to these
new challenges and to promote peaceful and stable relations among
all States.
</P>
<P>
China's remarkable economic growth in the wake of the reform
and open-door policy initiated under the leadership of Mr. Deng
Xiaoping has helped hundreds of millions of its people out of
poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This experience can be a source of inspiration for many other
countries striving for prosperity," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believes the United Nations played a useful
role as China began its process of opening to the world.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that he was encouraged by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's statement in the General Assembly on the occasion of
the U.N. fiftieth anniversary last October, as saying "As we enter
the twenty-first century, let us join together in a common effort
to build a better world".
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Be Firm on Black Sea Fleet Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, Ukraine, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will not
retreat from its stand on the dispute over the Black Sea Fleet and
the port of Sevastopol, a security official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Gorbulin, secretary of the Ukrainian Defense and State
Security Committee, said it might be "appropriate" to ask the
United States to help settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the recent negotiations between the
Ukrainian and Russian government delegations in Kiev, the two
sides actually held identical views on the dispute. But when the
Russian delegation returned to Moscow, he said, it charged that
the Ukrainian side was "inconsistent".
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had found a
practical solution to the Black Sea Fleet dispute during his visit
to Kiev, Gorbulin said, but he immediately "changed" his stand
after returning home.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet and the port of Sevastopol became a thorny
issue in the relations between Ukraine and Russia after the
disintegration of the former Soviet Union. They had agreed to
split the fleet 50-50 and the Russians were ready to purchase 32
percent of Ukraine's share of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia insists on basing its part of the fleet at
Sevastopol and moving the Ukrainian Navy's headquarters out of the
port which is situated in the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula.
</P>
<P>
But Ukraine insists that the port be jointly used by both
countries but the part used by the Russian Navy should be on a
lease basis.
</P>
<P>
The row has been affecting the signing of a friendship and
cooperation treaty between the two countries.

<P>
TOKYO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's largest beer brewer,
Kirin Brewery Co., has developed gene-splicing technology to
prevent plant viral diseases, a major business daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Plant viral diseases, immune to agricultural chemicals, cause
heavy damage to farm produce every year.
</P>
<P>
Kirin, now engaged in biotech research, claimed to have
confirmed the efficacy of the new technology by applying it to
tobacco plants, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
They implanted into tobacco two kinds of human enzyme gene that
recognize and destroy virus-infected cells, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The gene re-combination technology is billed as effective
against an array of viruses. There are about 600 viruses
worldwide that hurt plants.
</P>

<HEADLINE> BOC to Open Merchant Bank in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Bank of China (BOC) is
expected to set up a merchant banking subsidiary in London to step
up its presence in the world financial center.
</P>
<P>
Bank of China Intl (UK) Ltd, which is expected to start
operation by the end of this year, will engage in the capital
market, corporate finance and direct finance, said a BOC official.
</P>
<P>
The merchant bank is under a holding company called Bank of
China Intl Holdings Ltd. Wand Xuebing, BOC chairman and
president, will be chairman of the holding company.
</P>
<P>
One of the merchant bank's goal is to help domestic companies
list shares on the London Stock Exchange, the official said.
</P>
<P>
China Securities Regulatory Commission is expected to sign a
memorandum of understanding with the London securities watchdog on
supervisory matters this year, which will pave the way for Chinese
companies' London listing.
</P>
<P>
China so far has listed 23 companies on the Hong Kong and New
York stock exchanges, but many overseas exchanges including
London, Tokyo and Australia have expressed strong interest in
accepting Chinese firms.
</P>
<P>
Besides underwriting the stock issue, the official said the
merchant bank will also focus on structured financing, including
arranging syndicated loans, aircraft leasing and export credits.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also offer corporate advisory services to
European companies seeking to invest and form joint ventures in
China.
</P>
<P>
BOC launched its London branch in 1929, the first overseas
branch of the bank. The branch has since become an important
member of London's banking community, with business involving
savings and lending for the Chinese community in Britain, trade
settlement between China and Europe, foreign exchange trading,
interbank borrowing and interest rate swaps.

MONTEVIDEO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news events over the past few days:
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- The Chilean Senate approved by a wide majority the
agreement on economic integration with the South American Common
Market (Mercosur), including the protocols of physical integration
and of adhesion to democratic commitment.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed on June 25 this year in the Argentine
city of San Luis, was passed by 36-3 with one abstention, after
two days of debate in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Senate decision opened the way for free trade between Chile
and Mercosur starting October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Mercosur is a successful example of regionalism
that does not contradict the liberalization of world trade, said
WTO Director Renato Riggiero.
</P>
<P>
After describing as "positive" Chile's economic integration
with Mercosur, Riggiero warned that strong growth of regional
systems could become in the medium-term an obstacle to free trade
expansion.
</P>
<P>
He said regionalism is advancing faster than multilateralism
and thus might become a brake for trade.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- An international post-graduate course to train
technicians for enterprises as well as public and private
institutions in the agricultural and livestock integration of
Mercosur will be offered in September and December of 1996 and in
March and June of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The course, to be organized by universities of Argentina,
Brazil and Uruguay, will prepare trainees for solving agricultural
and livestock problems arising from regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Uruguay approved a promotional tariff for cargo
transportation between Mercosur countries.
</P>
<P>
The tariff, added to other recently approved cost reductions,
will cut the cost of cargo transportation bound for Argentina and
Paraguay by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
approved a law eliminating the tax on the circulation of goods and
services (ICMs) which had been applied to the exports of raw
materials and manufactured products.
</P>
<P>
The law also eliminates the ICMs on capital and consumer goods
acquired by enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian economy will be more competitive with the
reduction of three cost factors: tax, interest and capital. The
economy will have a significant growth thanks to the new law, said
Brazilian Planning Minister Antonio Kandir.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is paying an
official visit to Argentina, the first leg of his Latin American
tour which also includes Brazil and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
His tour is aimed at boosting trade relations with the
continent and promoting confidence in the political and economic
sectors of Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Argentine leaders are expected to discuss the trade
and economic links between the two countries and between the
European Union and Mercosur.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Proposes Simultaneous EU, NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, Ukraine, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian foreign
minister said today that the European Union should expand eastward
in parallel to the similar move by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Udovenko made this statement while addressing an
international seminar on regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The seminar drew the participation from NATO member states,
countries affiliated with the Partnership for Peace program and
member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian UNIAN news service quoted the foreign minister as
saying that the enlargement of EU and NATO should be conducted in
close tandem in that the enlargement by the EU is conducive to the
integration of Europe and to the formation of a new security
system on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko is firmly opposed to the deployment of nuclear weapons
on the territories of any central or east European countries to be
included into the NATO framework.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that his country holds it a principle that
central and eastern Europe should be nuclear-free.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister is also opposed to the idea that the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) should
be taken for granted as the political superstructure of the new
European security system.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said that the new security system should be based on
the cooperation, coordination and supplement of the EU, NATO,
OSCE, Council of Europe and Western European Union.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country is interested in establishing a
special partnership with the North Atlantic alliance and in
exchanging information concerning politics, economy, military
affairs, science and technology and ecology with it.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister listed as pre-conditions for the NATO
enlargement the development of relations between Ukraine and NATO,
the establishment of a free trade zone and the signing of a
Ukraine-EU agreement.
</P>
<P>
The seminar drew such NATO member states as Germany, France,
Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The work of the Sino-British
Joint Liaison Group has achieved considerable progress this year
along with the improvement of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, a good momentum has appeared
in the frequent exchange of contact between high-ranking officials
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Following the visit to China by British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind in January, Chinese Premier Li Peng met British
Prime Minister John Major at the Asia-Europe Meeting held in
Bangkok, Thailand, in February.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met Rifkind in the
Netherlands in April, while British Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine visited China in May, and British Minister of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Jeremy Hanley, in September.
</P>
<P>
The series of meetings and visits demonstrate the progress made
in China-Britain relationships.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of improved bilateral ties, the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group convened the 35th and 36th
meetings respectively in Hong Kong and London, reaching consensus
on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
According to a Chinese representative of the Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group, the new progress of the group's work can be
outlined as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- An agreement was reached in principle on ways the future
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region takes part in activities
of some 30 international organizations, including the World
Intellectual Property Rights Organization, and international
organizations of civil aviation, labor and industry, as well as
maritime affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have begun to take steps to inform relevant
international organizations and member states of such
organizations about their arrangements.
</P>
<P>
-- A principled agreement was reached on over 200 international
treaties which might continue to be applied in Hong Kong after
1997. The two sides will explain to the world community and the
treaty depositary authority on those to continue to be applied in
Hong Kong.

<P>
-- The two sides reached agreement on the text of an agreement
drafted by Hong Kong and Taiwan aviation companies. This will
guarantee continued development of air transportation between Hong
Kong and Taiwan after 1997, which will be beneficial to exchanges
as well as economic cooperation and trade across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
-- The two sides reached consensus on preparing for issuing
passports of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The
preparatory work for printing and issuing passports has been
proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
-- Progress has been made in franchises and contracts related
to the Hong Kong economy and its people. The Chinese side agreed
to the issuing of licenses for mobile communication services and
franchises, on base maintenance for the new Hong Kong airport and
aircraft parking area's services, as well as contracts on the
management of four tunnels in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The two sides confirmed that after 1997, these licenses and
contracts will be continuously effective in accordance with
relevant stipulations of the Basic Law, and will be recognized and
protected by the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Within this year, the group will convene two meetings, one in
Beijing beginning September 17, the other in Hong Kong. The
forthcoming 37th meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
will continue to discuss issues concerning international
organizations and pacts, the localization of Hong Kong laws, and
tourist documents.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese representative has expressed the hope that the
British side will closely cooperate with the Chinese side,
particularly on such issues directly related to the transfer of
political power as the handover ceremony, the transfer of the Hong
Kong government archives and assets, as well as financial budget
extending beyond 1997, thus reducing troubles and fulfilling the
tasks entrusted by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and ensuring
a stable transition and smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong.

In Guatemala City, the South Korean president held a summit
meeting with the presidents of Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras,
and El Salvador, at which they agreed to create a Central
America-South Korea dialogue and cooperation forum and to admit
South Korea as an extraterritorial partner of the Central American
Economic Integration Bank with an initial participation of 57
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
These agreements will help expand the economic and commercial
ties between the two sides and facilitate the entry of Seoul's
investments and technologies to the subregion.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Central American countries have been
promoting sustainable development and attracting more investments
and technologies from other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, in the north of Latin America, is South Korea's major
commercial and investment partner in the region, but Kim's
activities in Guatemala City showed that Seoul intends to advance
to south, toward Central America.
</P>
<P>
President Kim and the South Korean entrepreneurs also traveled
to Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Peru to explore market for the
products and investments of this Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is Seoul's major trade partner in South America, with
their trade volume reaching 2.9 billion dollars last year. But
South Korea's investments in Brazil totaled only 94 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
During Kim's visit to Brazil, the two sides signed several
agreements on tourism, technology transfer and information
exchange. Kim also announced that his country will invest 5
billion dollars during the next three years in this South American
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A signed article issued by
Xinhua News Agency in Beijing today, pointed out that Taiwan's
attempt to "rejoin the United Nations" will bring tensions between
the two sides across the Taiwan Straits, and is doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
The article, titled "'Rejoining' Means Splittism", said that a
small number of nations, including Nicaragua, wrote to the
secretary general of the United Nations in July to again propose
Taiwan's so-called "representation" in the UN, roped in and lured
by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
It is common knowledge that the United Nations is an
international inter-government organization, composed of sovereign
states, and according to the United Nations Charter, only
sovereign states can become its members, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of the countries in the world
recognize that there is only one China in the world, the
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal
government which represents China, and Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that the Taiwan authorities have
obstinately clung to its stance of splitting the motherland, and
obstructing reunification for years.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, they have repeatedly advocated
"rejoining the UN", and tried to claim to the world that "China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity are separated at the present
stage" through its attempt to "rejoin the UN", the article added.
</P>
<P>
These splittist activities not only run counter to the UN
Charter and principles, but also cannot be accepted by all
countries and people in favor of justice, it said.

In Santiago, South Korean and Chilean officials signed an
agreement on promoting and protecting investments, and the South
Korean Hyundai Electronics Corporation said it was planning to
invest 300 million dollars in the building of a copper-refining
plant in Chile.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Argentina also signed agreements on nuclear
cooperation and transportation. Chile agreed to sell Seoul 800

1998-2007 period.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Peru, the last leg of Kim's tour, signed a

fishing sector. And the chambers of commerce of the two countries
signed a memorandum of understanding on the promotion of commerce

The South Korean president's Latin American tour was only a few

Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Peru and Costa Rica from August 20 to 28.

<P>
It is evident that the two Asian nations are competing for more
trade and investment opportunities in the region through top-level
diplomatic offensives.
</P>
<P>
Latin America is a politically stable and economically dynamic
region. Thanks to the economic adjustments and reforms in several
countries, the region promises to be a good investment venue to
many countries outside the continent.
</P>
<P>
World Bank reports said Latin America and the Caribbean each
need, for the next four years, an investment of 24 billion dollars
in the energy sector, 14 billion dollars in transportation, 12
billion dollars in water and sewage projects, and 10 billion
dollars in telecommunications.

The Taiwan authorities' attempt to "rejoin the UN" has suffered
defeats since 1993, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Especially since the latter half of last year, the campaign of

<P>
The article said the Taiwan authorities' activities to "rejoin

</P>
<P>
They instigated Nicaragua, and some other countries to submit a
motion, which vigorously play up the achievements of Taiwan's
so-called "democracy", in a move to cheat world opinion with their
so-called "democracy", and gain sympathy and support, the article
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Taiwan authorities made use of "the people's

that the "will of the people in Taiwan in favor of 'rejoining the

</P>
<P>
The article emphasized that the farce directed by the Taiwan
authorities to split the motherland cannot win people's will, so
it will not help save their failure to "rejoin the UN".
</P>
<P>
Recently, under both internal and external pressure, leaders of
the Taiwan authorities repeatedly stated that they were in favor
of reunification and against "Taiwan independence" in an attempt
to cheat the people all over the world, and world opinion, the
article said.
</P>

But the so-called "rejoining UN" activities conducted by the
Taiwan authorities reveal once again that they do not want
relaxation in tensions across the Taiwan Straits, but
confrontation, and they are not in favor of reunification, but

<HEADLINE> Rebels in Philippines Vow to Fight for Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Some former members of the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) have risen to challenge the
forces of MNLF Chief Nur Misuari and vowed to carry on the fight
of "Islamic Mindanao," local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The new armed group, identified as the Moro Islamic Liberation
Organization (MILO), is reportedly led by Mampait Alam, Misuari's
former chief of staff and one of the MNLF's founders.
</P>
<P>
Alam has accused Misuari of "betraying the cause of the Moro
people" by signing a peace agreement with the government two weeks
ago. He is negotiating with Christian vigilantes on the main
southern island of Mindanao for a common fight against Misuari.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to hit key Mindanao areas where Nur Misuari
enjoys support. We will show him we are the force to reckon with,"
Alam said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the MILO is made up of some 1,000 men who had
broken away from the MNLF starting in 1992 up to early this month
when Misuari signed the agreement with the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another breakaway group of the MNLF, the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), warned that the scheduled peace
talks with the government may be imperiled unless army troops,
surreptitiously deployed close to rebel bases, were pulled out.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos said on Saturday that the peace agreement
has started to yield dividends with the signing of some
development contracts totaling 14.2 billion pesos (542 million US
dollars) in Mindanao. But observers here said he has some
immediate problems to solve in carrying out the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ramos again urged those groups which continue to oppose the
peace agreement to raise their level of thinking and join the
peace process in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Economists Expect Bumper '96 Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Economists from the State
Statistics Bureau see hope for a bumper grain harvest this year,
according to the "Business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
The bureau indicated a preliminary estimated output of nearly
480 million tons this year, 15 million tons more than 1996's
target which was set by the Ministry of Agriculture early this
year, the same as 1995.
</P>
<P>
Bureau economists reported little impact from floods and other
disasters on grain production this year. In addition, the swell of
cereals acreage and about a 30 per cent increase in the State
grain purchase price are inspiring farmers to boost production,
the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The economists noted that the summer harvest, which chalked up
a year-on-year jump of 3 per cent to top 110 million tons this
year, has laid a solid foundation for the January-December
agricultural period.
</P>
<P>
Early rice acreage in the countryside has reached a total of
8.29 million hectares this year, up 1.1 per cent on a year-on-year
basis. As a result, the crop yield amounted to 44 million tons, an
increase of 4.2 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Meat and aquatic-product production in the countryside have
also contributed to the optimistic feelings of the bureau
economists. The experts are expecting a higher farmer's income
this year.
</P>
<P>
Yet Ministry of Agriculture officials and statistics bureau
economists are forecasting a shrinkage in cotton and rapeseed
output this year due to plunging domestic prices of ginned cotton
and edible oil.
</P>
<P>
Gross cotton output may only reach 3.5 million tons this year,
down 28.6 per cent from 1995, a bureau economist predicted.

Moya, ranked 24th by the ATP, struggled to defeat unseeded
Romanian Andrei Pavel 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 in the semi-finals at
Bucharest's Progresul clay court.
</P>
<P>
Pavel, helped by his powerful serve, easily won the first set
but lost concentration after Moya's accurate shots forced him to
make mistakes in the second set.
</P>
<P>
In the second semifinal match, Berasategui, ranked 25th, upset
Christian Ruud of Norway 6-0, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard had no problem winning the first set but had to
struggle to win the second after missing some easy balls.
</P>
<P>
Moya and Berasategui became favorites for the Saturday final
after the tournament's stars, Boris Becker and Goran Ivanisevic,

<HEADLINE> Olympics Bombing Suspect Wins Right to See Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A security guard suspected
in the bombing at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in July has won the
right to see copies of documents of FBI evidence against him,
according to news reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A US magistrate ruled Friday in favor of Richard Jewell, the
security guard who reported spotting a suspicious package in
Centennial Olympic Park minutes before it exploded, killing two
people and injuring 112.
</P>
<P>
Jewell's lawyers have won the right to examine affidavits used
to secure legal permission to search his property.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted with Judge Gerrilyn Brill's ruling," said
lawyer Jack Martin, who filed the motion on September 3. "Perhaps
this disclosure may serve as an early step in the process of
building a bridge between the government and Jewell who someday
will be a key prosecution witness."
</P>
<P>
According to the judge, only part of the affidavit containing
witness information relating to Jewell will be unsealed to the
lawyers. Any leaks to the media will be considered contempt of
court.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has questioned Jewell
several times and searched his home but has not charged him. His
name surfaced in the investigation just hours after the July 27
bombing after authorities received a tip from a former employer.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has not named any suspects in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Jewell has denied any connection to the blast.

from the end to win the 247-km Paris-Brussels cycling race on
Saturday.

<P>
It was the biggest victory as a professional for the
30-year-old Tafi.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Kowloon Railway Gives Rise to New Economic Corridor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Areas along the newly-opened
Beijing-Kowloon Railway, China's longest north-south railway, are
expected to form a new economic corridor and an appealing spot for
overseas investment, Chinese experts say.
</P>
<P>
Running 2,553 kilometers through nine Chinese provinces and
municipalities, the gigantic railway is the most costly ever to
have been built in China.
</P>
<P>
With economically booming southeast provinces in desperate
need of energy and raw materials, the northwest provinces and
autonomous regions are complaining about large stocks of coal
waiting to be transported. The new railway line can add some 100
million tons in traffic volume between southern and northern
Chinese provinces, cutting nearly 40 billion yuan in economic
losses for China each year.
</P>
<P>
But the most remarkable change viewed by local officials rests
on economic impetus. As the railway line runs across a
resource-rich, but underdeveloped region, areas along the new
railway line are already being widely acclaimed as a potential
major economic corridor.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin developed from an area of salt fields and fishing port
into China's third largest city owing to the construction of a
major Chinese canal. The construction of the Beijing-Kowloon
Railway will make the city an artery for goods transported from
the north to the south and vice versa, said an official with
Tianjin municipality.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure projects and markets are already being built
along the railway line. The mountain locked Yimeng area in
Shandong province is building a major market with an annual
business volume of several hundred million yuan to facilitate the
smooth flow of local products.
</P>
<P>
Fuyang, a land-locked city in east China's Anhui Province, has
become a bustling area as the meeting point of three major railway
lines. A major oilfield is being exploited, with the joint efforts
of Chinese and US petroleum companies. And a four-billion-dollar
thermal power plant is expected to start generating electricity in
two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi, another economically underdeveloped province, has
invested 1.7 billion yuan in the construction of the
infrastructure facilities in areas along the new railway line in
the recent years.
</P>
<P>
Hubei, a central Chinese province, plans to build three
production bases along the railway line, power, agriculture and a
comprehensive industrial base. In the first six months of this
year the province's Dabie Mountain area introduced 50 million US
dollars in overseas investment, a record high.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Kowloon Railway has opened up a new era for
central and western Chinese provinces, and it can serve as a belt
linking the developed and underdeveloped regions of China,
injecting new vitality into China's economic development,
economists say.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expresses Cautious Satisfaction Over Bosnian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. presidential
representative Richard Holbrook on Saturday expressed cautious
satisfaction over the first elections in Bosnia since the end of
43-month old war.
</P>
<P>
"What we saw was by and large an election which we did not see
things that would in themselves disqualify the electoral process,"
said the former U.S. assistant secretary of state who brokered the
Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
But whether the election day "was a turning point towards a
really peaceful settlement in this region, or was it just another
election after which the things fall back, we are not prepared to
say that yet", said Holbrook, who is heading a delegation on
behalf of U.S. president Bill Clinton to observe the Bosnian
elections.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the United States and its partners in the
so-called contact groups are committed to the peace process in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
John Kornblum, who replaces Holbrook as the U.S. special envoy
on Bosnia, said that "the elections are not the end-point of
process, they are somewhere in the middle."
</P>
<P>
"The real job is to get joint institutions set up and get
political structure going on the basis of these elections,"
Kornblum said, referring to the Bosnian presidency and parliament
which will consist representatives of the former warring ethnic
factions.
</P>
<P>
Carl Bildt, Higher Representative of the contact group, hailed
the elections as being held with "great dignity, great calm and
great seriousness".
</P>
<P>
But he also said that he would withhold judgment on the
integrity of the elections until receiving reports from thousands
of international officials who supervise the the election process.
</P>
<P>
According to Bildt, some 60 to 70 percent of eligible voters
cast their ballots and 20,000 refugees from the Bosnian Federation
voted in Republika Srpska, and one quarter of figure vice versa.

<HEADLINE> SDA Refuses To Recognize Elections in Serb Entity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Party of Democratic
Action (SDA), the major party of the Bosnian Muslims, indicated on
Saturday that it would refuse to recognize the results of
elections in the Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Halid Genjac, president of the SDA Main Board, in a letter to
the president of UN security council, said that necessary
conditions did not exist in the Serb entity to "provide for free
and fair elections".
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that "the lack of the necessary general
conditions has been compounded by the new evidence of technical
irregularities that has developed or come to light at the
electional polls" in the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
"For the above reasons, the Party of Democratic Action deems
the results of elections in the Serb entity to be legally
invalid," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Genjac demanded that the UN security council review the matter
and also seek meetings with officials of the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, a U.S. presidential delegation which is here to
monitor the elections has been cool to SDA's demands.
