Brooke offers possible World Cup help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand rugby giant Zinzan
Brooke said he might consider a comeback to bolster the flagging
All Blacks for next year's World Cup.
	   But an official said it was unlikely they would need Brooke, 33,
who quit New Zealand at the end of last year to take on the
player-coach job with English club Harlequins.
	   His departure, along with those of fellow veterans Sean
Fitzpatrick and Frank Bunce, has been attributed as a reason for
the All Blacks worst test run in almost 50 years _ four defeats in
succession.
	   ``No, I wouldn't rule out making myself available for the All
Blacks if they wanted me,'' Brooke told New Zealand Press
Association in London. ``I'd have to have a look at that. It's a
huge decision but I wouldn't rule it out. I'd just have to wait and
see. Funnier things have happened.''
	   New Zealand Rugby Football Union chairman Rob Fisher said Brooke
would have to return to New Zealand to be eligible for the All
Blacks.
	   ``The current policy is pretty straightforward,'' Fisher said.
``We only select players for the All Blacks who are resident in New
Zealand and playing here.
	   ``I think the board would want Brooke to return and play in a
competition suitable enough for him to show his form.''
	   Fisher said the board had not been approached by Brooke and he
doubted that coach John Hart would be interested in the loose
forward, saying, ``after all it's another year down the track from
when he retired.''
	   The All Blacks were en route home from South Africa on Tuesday
after losing in the final minute of their tri-nations match.
	   New Zealand's next game is against Australia in Sydney on August
29 where the Wallabies will be trying to complete a clean sweep of
the three-match Bledisloe Cup series.

Tourist numbers from Asia hard hit by regional crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The number of tourists visiting
Australia from economically troubled Asian countries plunged last
month, preliminary official figures showed Tuesday.
	   In news that confirmed the Asian economic crisis was biting,
tourist numbers from southeast Asia fell than a quarter (28.8
percent) from the July 1997 figure to 39,600, while numbers from
northeast Asia fell by 16.7 percent to 115,000.
	   China and Singapore were the only Asian countries to record a
rise _ 56.5 percent to 7,200 and 1.5 percent to 13,700
respectively.
	   South Korea recorded the highest fall, 70.1 percent, with 15,500
fewer tourists visiting Australia last month compared with July
1997.
	   This was followed by falls from Indonesia, 58.4 percent,
Thailand, 24.0 percent, Malaysia, 22.9 percent, Japan, 15.4
percent, Philippines, 13.8 percent, and Taiwan, 4.7 percent.
	   The overall number of tourists visiting Australia from overseas
fell 7.5 percent in July compared with the same month in 1997 to
367,600.
	   Meanwhile, the number of visitors from the United States rose
marginally by 6.7 percent to 35,000 and from Britain by 11.5
percent to 25,300, while from New Zealand they fell by 3.5 percent
to 77,500.

Olympic champion hit by the flu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Dual Olympic 1500-meter swimming
champion Kieren Perkins has been hit by the flu a week before the
Australian team departs for next month's Commonwealth Games.
	   The triple world record holder and 1992 and 1996 Olympic
champion has been away from the limelight since the Atlanta Games
and failed to qualify for the world championships earlier this
year.
	   He said he was returning to his best form, but the illness has
forced him to stop training for the games, starting in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, on Sept. 11.
	   ``It can't be good because he only gets out of the water in
extreme circumstances,'' said Perkins' father and manager Kevin
Perkins. ``He needs it like a hole in the head.''
	   Perkins was due to leave Brisbane with other members of the
Commonwealth Games swim team next week.
	   The 41-member team will spend three days in Perth, Australia,
before flying to a training camp in Singapore on Aug. 28 to prepare
for the KL Games.
	   ``He's not feeling very happy and he's still not too good,''
said Kevin Perkins. ``It's not clear when he'll be able to get back
into the water.''

Northern Ireland prepares for first funerals from terrorist strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-12 with excerpts from article by Blair in
two Belfast newspapers; EDITS to conform; will be topped after
first funeral, tentatively scheduled to begin at 1000 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ With all 28 victims finally
identified and five suspects in custody, the family of a mother and
young daughter killed in a terrorist car bombing prepared to say
goodbye Tuesday in the first in a long line of funerals.
	   The carnage and confusion that reigned on Omagh's Market Street
after the 500-pound (200-kg) car bomb exploded Saturday meant the
bodies were not released to their loved ones until Monday.
	   ``I'm sure we'll have a series of funerals through the week,''
said the Rev. Lawrence Dawson, the Catholic parish priest presiding
over back-to-back services Tuesday in nearby Augher for 30-year-old
Avril Monaghan, pregnant with twins, and her 18-month-old daughter
Maura.
	   Mrs. Monaghan's 65-year-old mother, Mary Grimes, also was killed
in the bombing. She will be buried Wednesday.
	   The Irish Republic town of Buncrana almost came to a standstill
as the hearses bearing the coffins of three local boys killed in
the bombing _ James Barker, 12, Sean McLoughlin, 11, and Oran
Doherty, 8 _ arrived home Monday night.
	   Hundreds of people waited for several hours at the County
Donegal border to see the coffins cross over, and mourners lined
the town's streets and stood in tearful silence as they passed.
	   ``This has been one of the most difficult and emotional duties I
have ever had to supervise,'' police superintendent Tom Long said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote in two Belfast
newspapers Tuesday that the experience of meeting the bombing
victims in the hospital would ``stay with me all my life,'' and
that it reinforced his resolve that the peace process must
continue.
	   In an emotional article for the Belfast Newsletter and the Irish
News, Blair told how his thoughts turned to his own children and
how he would ``go mad with grief should it happen to them.''
	   ``Do they feel at all? Are they sitting there now in some place
or other with any shred of remorse, doubt, even pity?'' he said of
the bombers.
	   He acknowledged that some people would seek to blame the Irish
Republican Army and its allied political party, Sinn Fein, but said
that Northern Ireland's top policeman, Royal Ulster Constabulary
Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan, had told him they were not
connected with it ``either explicitly or implicitly,'' and that
there was no evidence their materials had been used to build the
bomb.
	   Mo Mowlam, Britain's top official in Northern Ireland, toured
the destruction in Omagh on Monday night and assured residents that
authorities would stop at nothing to nail the bombers, whom she
called ``animals, obscene in what they have done.''
	   ``I just can't get out of my head the pain, the suffering that
is going on,'' she said. ``That is overwhelming.''
	   At dawn Monday, police had arrested five people in connection
with the attack _ the worst in Northern Ireland's history. The
suspects included 19-year-old Shane Mackey, the son of a leading
critic of Sinn Fein's support of April's peace agreement.
	   No information was released about the suspects, believed to be
members of the ``Real IRA,'' made up of defectors from the IRA.
Under British anti-terrorist law, the five can be interrogated for
up to a week before being released or charged.

 &UR; Cambodian anti-drug police burn 3.6 tons of marijuana

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian anti-drug police burned
3.6 tons of marijuana Tuesday and called for the speedy trial of
two Americans and four Thais arrested for alleged involvement in
drug trafficking.
	   Anti-drug chief Heng Pov said he was concerned the suspects, who
have been languishing in Phnom Penh's T-3 prison for more than six
weeks, would bribe their way out.
	   One of the American suspects, he told reporters, has reportedly
offered to pay dlrs 5 million for his freedom.
	   ``We want the court to convene the trial as soon as possible,''
said Heng Pov. ``We want to avoid any delay which would provide an
opportunity for the criminals to get free, causing tremendous
difficulties for our agents.''
	   Court officials said Tuesday that no date has been set for the
trial. They provided no explanation for the delay.
	   The six suspected drug traffickers were arrested in Cambodian
waters on June 28 after officials discovered 3.6 tons of marijuana
in their boat.
	   The American suspects have been identified by anti-drug police
as Joe Hardy, 46, and Michael Smith, 40, both from New York City.
One of the Thais arrested has been identified as a Navy colonel
named Shinawat Prometa.
	   As the drug smoldered in front of him, Heng Pov said that the
marijuana _ used mostly as a cheap cooking spice in Cambodia _ has
a street value in the United States of more than dls 21 million.
	   Cambodia has become a major exporter of marijuana in recent
years. It is also an important transit point for heroin coming from
the Golden Triangle, the opium-growing region where the borders of
Thailand, Laos and Burma meet.
	   The marijuana seized in late June was grown by Cambodian
farmers, and bought by the traffickers who posed as businessmen,
Heng Pov said.
	   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has been investigating the two
American suspects ``for a long time,'' he said.
	   U.S. embassy officials confirmed that the two Americans are
still in prison, but could provide no further details.

Indonesian police chief warns against mass rape rumors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's national police chief has
warned activists will be prosecuted if they have exaggerated claims
that dozens of ethnic Chinese women and girls were raped during
recent riots, news reports said Tuesday.
	   Claims of mass rapes, along with widespread attacks against
Indonesian Chinese and their property, have outraged Chinese
communities around the globe. China itself has demanded that
Indonesia catch and punish those responsible.
	   The Indonesian Observer newspaper quoted Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi as
saying some members of non-governmental agencies might be
questioned if they were suspected of ``spreading false reports.''
	   ``They have said they are continuing with their efforts to
gather information. Please continue then,'' the official Antara
news agency quoted him as saying. ``But if you fail to come up with
evidence then we can charge you with spreading rumors.''
	   He said police had no evidence that rapes were committed during
May's violence, which ended with the deaths of 1,200 and the
dramatic resignation of longtime President Suharto.
	   Women's groups allege 168 women and girls were raped during
May's riots, many of them ethnic Chinese who were targeted for
their affluence. Thousands of Chinese-owned houses and buildings
were ransacked and burned.
	   Some activists claim many victims are too frightened or ashamed
to go to the police.
	   The Observer said that some victims were refusing to go to the
authorities because they believed that some members of the military
might be responsible.
	   Others have allegedly received threats to stay quiet, the paper
said.
	   While Chinese make up only about four percent of the population,
they control much of the economy and have been targeted as
scapegoats for a massive economic crisis now gripping Indonesia.
	   China has demanded the Indonesian government take firm action to
protect Indonesians of Chinese descent, and protesters in Taiwan,
Hong Kong and the United States have called for those responsible
to be arrested.
	   Despite the claims by Indonesian police that they have no
evidence of rapes, President B.J. Habibie on Saturday condemned
rapes when he addressed Parliament on Saturday.
	   Habibie, who replaced Suharto, admitted that many of the victims
were of Chinese origin and described the rapes and other attacks as
``barbaric.''
	   Habibie has set up a special commission to investigate the rapes
and plans to invite other countries to supply intelligence officers
to help in the inquiry.

Statistician: Asian economic crisis hits Australia hard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis is hitting
Australia hard on two major fronts, pushing its once lucrative
trade with ASEAN countries into the red and badly damaging its
tourist industry.
	   Both blows are reflected in figures the government statistician
released Tuesday.
	   It reported that Australia's once booming exports to member
countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations have
slumped over the past year.
	   This led statistician Bill McLennan to make a special report on
the problem.
	   ``The deterioration in Australia's trade balance with ASEAN in
the first six months of 1998 was particularly marked in the case of
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and to a lesser extent
Singapore,'' he said.
	   The countries of ASEAN collectively have been Australia's second
biggest export customer after Japan, which takes huge quantities of
coal, iron ore and meat from here.
	   Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Vietnam make up the
rest of ASEAN.
	   McLennan said, for example, that Australia's trade balance with
Indonesia plummeted from a surplus of U.S. dlrs 380 million (644
million Australian dollars) in the first six months of last year to
a deficit of U.S. dlrs 357 million (605 million Australian dollars)
in the first six months of this year.
	   Australia's trade with Malaysia and Thailand also went from
surplus to deficit during the period.
	   The previous Labor prime minister Paul Keating had hoped to
boost Australia's overall trade performance by developing markets
in the Southeast Asian region.
	   The bureau also noted that the number of tourists coming to
Australia from Asian countries has fallen sharply this year.
	   This, too, is critically important to the Australian economy as
tourism _ on some measures _ is the nation's biggest single
industry.
	   The number of tourists from Southeast Asian countries dropped 17
percent, the bureau reported, while the number from Japan and other
Northeast Asian countries was 9 percent lower in the June quarter
this year than in the same quarter last year.
	   The number of tourists coming to Australia from South Korea,
which authorities here had regarded as a growing market, dropped by
89 per cent between the June quarter of last year and the same
quarter this year.
	   But vigorous marketing_and heavy discounting _ by the industry
did succeed in attracting more tourists from Singapore, Hong Kong,
and China over that time.
	   The industry has also managed to attract more tourists from
Europe and the United States during the same period.

Asian markets mixed on stronger yen, shaky regional economies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stocks opened mixed on Tuesday with
investors remaining cautious despite the resilience of U.S. markets
and the Japanese yen after Russia devalued the ruble.
	   Japan's Nikkei average of 225 selected issues ended Tuesday's
morning session at 15,091.81, up 297.15 points or 2 percent. On
Monday, the key average tumbled 329.27 points to 14,794.66, the
lowest level since June 17.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday soared 149.85 points,
or 1.8 percent, to 8,574.85 despite an announcement from the
Russian government of its debt moratorium and the devaluation of
the ruble.
	   At midday Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 145.65 yen after
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan will intervene in the
foreign exchange markets if necessary to support the yen.
	   Analysts said that despite early gains, investors were likely to
remain worried about parliamentary debates to revitalize Japan's
ailing financial industry. Although quick passage of the bills is
seen as necessary, a political confrontation threatens to delay the
process.
	   Analysts said the testimony and national speech by U.S.
President Bill Clinton on his relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky had little effect. One Hong Kong trader, who
did not want to be identified, said Wall Street's gains already
reflected market sentiment.
	   In Hong Kong, stocks opened slightly lower as investors waited
to see if the government would intervene again in the markets.
Since Monday was a holiday, Tuesday was the first day of trading
since the government stepped in Friday to defend the Hong Kong
dollar and the stock market, sending the benchmark Hang Seng Index
up 8.5 percent to close at 7,224.69.
	   The Hang Seng was down 5.07 points to 7,219.62 early Tuesday.
	   Acting Financial Secretary Rafael Hui said the government
intervened in markets on Friday only in response to heavy
speculative pressure. ``There is no intention on our part to prop
up the market at any particular level,'' he said.
	   The market remained pessimistic over the latest unemployment
figures to be released later Tuesday. Newspaper reports said the
unemployment rate would rise to a 15-year high of 4.8 percent, with
160,000 out of work.
	   In Seoul, share prices were down as concerns over labor unrest
dampened optimism that the impact of Russia's woes wouldn't be as
big as anticipated. The KOSPI index was down 8.27 points, or 2.7
percent, to close the morning session at 293.35.
	   Shares opened higher in Singapore, on a resilient yen and a
technical rebound following the market's recent downward spiral.
The Straits Times Industrials Index was up 1.1 percent, or 10.57
points, at 956.06.
	   Philippine shares opened mixed as blue-chip stocks suffered from
profit-taking, while some oversold issues were boosted by
bargain-hunting. The PSE Index was down 18.78 points, or 1.4
percent, at 1,316.93.
	   Despite little impact on Southeast Asian markets from the
ruble's devaluation, investors were likely to stay away from Asian
stock markets due to shaky regional currencies, traders said.

Thai Labor Ministry sets up help center for unemployed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Trying to ease the impact of an
economic crisis that has deprived two million people of their jobs,
the government is opening a center to help laid-off white collar
employees find work, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   Deputy Labor and Social Welfare Minister Jongtham Thiengtham was
quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying the ministry center will also
provide counseling and help debt-ridden people reschedule their
repayments.
	   The center is expected to open this week, with serial numbers
used to keep confidential the identity of people seeking help.
	   Layoffs of skilled workers and white collar employees began
after the crisis hit in mid-1997.
	   Thousands more will lose their jobs following the merger or
closure of several financial institutions under a new government
restructuring of the reeling financial and banking sector.

Tense standoff at Jewish shrine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TLV103-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ It looks more like a military bunker
than a shrine, with sandbags, barbed wire and gun-toting young men
at the locked metal gates. An Israeli flag flies overhead.
	   In the heart of Palestinian-run Nablus, the West Bank's biggest
city, several dozen Jewish settlers are hunkered down inside
Joseph's Tomb, an enclave where frictions between Palestinians and
settlers have turned fatal in the past. Now both sides are warning
that could happen again.
	   The tense standoff is in many ways typical of
Israeli-Palestinian quarrels in the West Bank, with its mix of
religious fervor, pragmatic political aims and jockeying for
territory.
	   It's typical in another way as well: Each side says the other
side started it.
	   In the years since the Oslo peace accords set the Palestinians
on the path toward autonomy, an uneasy but largely workable
arrangement had prevailed at the site, which religious Jews hold to
be the burial place of the biblical figure Joseph, sold into
slavery by his jealous brothers.
	   Palestinians, who have full security control over the area
surrounding the tomb, allowed Israelis to enter in daylight hours
to pray and study. Jews from nearby settlements have set up a small
yeshiva, or religious seminary, within the walled compound.
	   That agreement has unraveled over the past two weeks, however,
beginning with the unsolved killings of two young settlers at the
nearby Jewish settlement of Itzhar. Both were students at the
seminary.
	   Israeli military authorities gave settlers permission to stay in
Joseph's Tomb around the clock to sit shiva, or hold ritual
mourning, for the men. Eventually, several dozen settlers were
staying in the compound full time.
	   Palestinians objected, calling it a bid to establish a de facto
settlement. By Monday, Palestinian police had halted settlers'
regular bus service in and out of the enclave.
	   Mahmoud Alool, the Palestinian governor of Nablus, said no one
else would be allowed in until settlers promise to halt their
overnight stays.
	   ``Otherwise, we will have to take steps to deal with them,'' he
said. He declined to elaborate.
	   Yigal Amitai, a settler leader from Itzhar, accused the
Palestinians of effectively putting the compound under siege. ``We
expect the army to do something about it,'' he said.
	   Settlers guarding the tomb on Monday refused to allow
journalists inside. From a nearby rooftop, small sandbag
fortifications, tents and satellite dishes could be seen inside the
courtyard.
	   Palestinians watched the scene with growing dismay.
	   ``There are really bad feelings between them and us _ their
being here makes us really mad,'' said Monir Saleh, who runs a
small woodworking shop across the street.
	   For Israelis and Palestinians alike, the standoff brings back
memories of an outbreak of bloody violence at the site nearly two
years ago.
	   In September 1996, widespread Palestinian street riots erupted
over Israeli construction of a tunnel in Jerusalem near one of
Islam's most sacred shrines, the Al Aqsa Mosque. The fighting in
Nablus centered on Joseph's Tomb. Six Israelis and one Palestinian
were killed and, at one point, thousands of rioters tried to storm
the compound.
	   Even though the Palestinians acknowledge Jews' right of access
to the enclave as a religious site, historic claims to it are
tangled.
	   Palestinians question whether it is actually Joseph's burial
place, saying evidence points to a Muslim holy man having been
buried there. A mosque once stood at the site.
	   Throughout the Palestinian lands, sites like this one _ with
religious significance for both sides, straddling areas of Israeli
control _ have time and again proved flashpoints.
	   At the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron, a Jewish settler gunned
down 29 Muslim worshippers in 1994, setting off deadly riots. In
Bethlehem, the Jewish shrine of Rachel's Tomb, just up the hill
from a Palestinian refugee camp, is the scene of frequent clashes.
	   Settler leaders said the dispute redoubles their determination
to prevent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from ceding more land
to the Palestinians.
	   ``This is an embarrassment to our government _ we are being made
to look weak,'' said Elyakim Labanon, rabbi of the nearby
settlement of Elon Moreh.
	   Abdel Fattah Fayad, a Palestinian lawyer whose family has been
living adjacent to Joseph's Tomb for generations, said the fight
for Joseph's Tomb is political rather than religious.
	   ``It's just dust and stones,'' he said. ``But it's a battle,
like everything here.''

 &UR; Striking Hyundai autoworkers brace for police raid
 &UR; Eds: UPDATEs with government mediation apparently failing, details;
CHANGEs dateline and byline &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of striking Hyundai Motor
Co. workers braced for a police raid Tuesday after the government
apparently failed to resolve a month-long labor dispute at the
nation's largest automaker.
	   Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho met with Hyundai's managers and union
leaders until past midnight Monday and asked both sides to submit
their final proposals by noon Tuesday. Neither side complied.
	   ``Both sides seem to choose a collision course. The government
has now exhausted all the means it can use. We see little prospect
of bringing a negotiated end to this dispute,'' said Lee Soo-yong,
an official at the Labor Ministry.
	   Kim In-hwan, a union leader, dismissed the minister's mediating
efforts as ``a face-saving gesture to justify a police
intervention.''
	   Kim said 5,000 striking workers and their families picketing
Hyundai's main plants in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles)
southeast of Seoul, were prepared for a police raid.
	   ``We're prepared to die. Losing jobs is like facing death,'' he
said.
	   An estimated 15,000 riot police were massed around Hyundai's
plants in Ulsan to evict the striking workers and their families,
the national news agency Yonhap said.
	   Militant workers armed with metal pipes confronted the police,
shouting ``We say no! to layoffs,'' and ``We will fight to the
end!''
	   Dozens of housewives carrying children on their backs joined the
protest in the front rank. Police urged family members to move out
before the planned raid. At the plant's main entrance, brief
shoving matches erupted between workers and police but no serious
violence was reported.
	   Hyundai Motor, a key subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, the
nation's largest conglomerate, has been idle since July 20 when its
26,000-member union went on strike to protest spreading layoffs.
	   Hyundai's union wants the company to take back 1,600 workers it
fired July 31 because of sharply falling domestic sales.
	   The company, which earlier got rid of 6,100 workers by offering
them enhanced early retirement packages, insists it has to reduce
its work force in line with slumping demand for its cars.
	   Before starting his mediation effort in Ulsan Monday night, the
labor minister told reporters that the union must accept ``some
form of layoffs.''
	   ``The international market is closely watching how the Hyundai
dispute is handled. A flexible labor market is our promise to the
international community,'' he said.
	   A flexible labor market is a key part of reforms South Korea
promised to make in return for a dlrs 58 billion bailout package by
the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   The number of jobless people has since doubled to 1.5 million
and is expected to reach 2 million by year's end, a shock to South
Korean workers long accustomed to lifetime employment.
	   Hyundai's experience will set an example for other
conglomerates, including Samsung and LG, which reportedly plan to
shed up to 30,000 workers each by the end of this year.
	   The government views the Hyundai strike as illegal because
workers did not seek mandatory government mediation.
	   ``Our principle stands firm that we will never tolerate illegal
activities at work sites,'' said presidential spokesman Park
Ji-won, urging labor to accept layoffs.
	   Armed with court-issued arrest warrants, police were seeking 64
Hyundai union leaders.

Thai police to provide security for Burmese demonstrators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai foreign ministry has asked
police to provide security to Burmese students who have staged
peaceful protests in front of the Myanmar Embassy for two weeks,
the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
	   Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra was quoted as
saying the government must beef up security at the embassy to
prevent violence against the students calling for democracy in
their home country.
	   The request came after several attacks against the demonstrators
by unknown assailants in the past week.
	   The first occurred Aug. 12 when men on motorcycles and in a
truck threw dozens of bottles at the group, injuring eight people
including three Thai students who had joined the sit-in protest.
	   The latest attack occurred Sunday morning when a group of Thai
men struck two demonstrators with swords. The two required stitches
at a hospital.
	   The protesters reported the incidents to the police and asked
for protection, saying they believed the attacks were ordered by
the Myanmar government.
	   ``I am convinced that Thais are not motivated to attack us. The
attacks were ordered by the Myanmar government which wants to
threaten us,'' said Gaw Minth, an exile from Myanmar, also known as
Burma.
	   He said the peaceful protest will continue until Aug. 21 and a
hunger strike will follow if the Myanmar government refuses to
convene Parliament.
	   Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has demanded the
government convene the body which was elected in 1991 but
suppressed by the military, which is working on a new constitution
for the country.
	   There are no signs the military will meet Suu Kyi's demand.

Albright brings message of American support to Tanzania, Kenya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Incorporates BC-Albright-Embassy Bombings and UPDATES with
Albright arrival, officials hoping for aid, U.S. congressional
leaders send letter with Albright, Kenyan police denying another
arrest made &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright arrived Tuesday in East Africa, seeking to demonstrate
American solidarity after the bombings that targeted U.S. embassies
but mostly claimed African lives.
	   Officials in Kenya and Tanzania also hoped she would announce
new aid to their countries, where the Aug. 7 terrorist blasts
killed 257 people in the capitals Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   FBI agents, meanwhile, pushed ahead with their all-out
investigation into the bombings. In a joint statement with Kenyan
police, the bureau said Monday that a suspect who was returned from
Pakistan had not admitted any role in the crimes or implicated
anyone else after three days.
	   That appeared to conflict with reports out of Pakistan, where
the man was apprehended, which said suspect Mohammed Saddiq Odeh
had confessed and named his co-conspirators. The reports also said
the man had ties to renegade Saudi multimillionaire Osama bin
Laden, who is accused of sponsoring terrorist attacks.
	   ``To America's embassy personnel in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, I
will bring a message of solidarity in their sorrow, admiration for
their courage and support for their continued efforts on behalf of
our country,'' Albright said Monday before leaving Andrews Air
Force Base, Maryland.
	   ``To the people of Kenya and Tanzania, I will bring a message of
friendship, made deeper by our shared grief, and of support in
doing all we can to ease their suffering and help them start
anew.''
	   Albright, after a 16-hour flight, stopped first at the site of
the new embassy in Dar es Salaam, relocated after the bombing that
killed 10 people. She was scheduled to spend only five hours in Dar
es Salaam and then about 5 1-2 hours in Nairobi before returning
immediately home.
	   Her visit to East Africa was designed in part to demonstrate
U.S. resolve in the face of growing terrorist threats to Americans.
	   Some Kenyans have complained that after the Nairobi bombing,
rescuers gave priority to finding American victims and to
protecting evidence at the expense of saving African lives. But
Albright and other U.S. officials have strongly disputed that
notion, saying the priority had been rescuing all possible, African
and American.
	   The majority and minority leaders of the U.S. House and Senate
sent a letter with Albright to be read to U.S. embassy employees in
Kenya and Tanzania, expressing condolences and thanking U.S. and
local personnel for their work.
	   ``It is a painful reality that Americans and American facilities
are often the target of terrorist attacks,'' said the letter, which
mourned the deaths of Americans and Africans killed in the blasts.
	   The congressional leaders promised continued work to promote
democracy and stop terrorism, adding, ``We must not lose sight of
the fact that what America stands for _ peace and democracy _ is
the greatest threat to terrorists.''
	   ``All of you _ Americans, Kenyans and Tanzanians _ contribute to
this work every day, both before and after the bomings,'' said the
letter signed by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Minority Leader
Tom Daschle, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt.
	   Meanwhile, a top Kenyan police official denied a Nairobi
newspaper report the previous day that another suspect had been
returned to Kenya, or that more arrests had been made.
	   ``As far as we are concerned, there have been no additional
arrests apart from the five previously arrested and now the suspect
returned to Kenya by the Pakistani authorities,'' Peter Mbuvi,
deputy director of the Criminal Investigations Department, was
quoted in the East African Standard as saying.
	   FBI officials at the bureau's Washington headquarters were
analyzing the first batch of evidence from the Nairobi bombing,
which arrived over the weekend.
	   Many more shipments are expected, but the first batch contained
cotton swabs taken at the blast site in hopes of picking up
microscopic residues that could positively identify what the bomb
was made of. A U.S. official said last week that field tests
suggested the presence of a Czech-made plastic explosive called
Semtex that has been used by terrorist groups before.

Rafter donated half U.S. Open winnings to charity says Mom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Patrick Rafter secretly donated half of
his prizemoney for winning last year's U.S Open to help sick
children in his home state of Queensland, Australia.
	   Rafter, who has hit peak form by winning two tournaments in the
past fortnight as he prepares to defend his title this month, gave
away half of his U.S. dlrs 650,000, according to his mother Jocelyn
Rafter. She said the money was used to build a games room for
terminally ill children.
	   ``He likes to share, he likes to help to do things for people
and particularly for children,'' Jocelyn Rafter told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. Tuesday. ``I don't know if that has anything to
do with coming from a big family where the whole family is
orientated that way anyway.''
	   Rafter, the world No. 3, won his only Grand Slam at Flushing
Meadow last year. Former world No.1 John McEnroe recently said the
Australian was a likely ``one-slam wonder'' but Rafter showed he
was in strong form with victory over Pete Sampras in the final of
the Great American Championship in Ohio on Sunday. He has won more
than U.S. dlrs 1 million in the past fortnight.

Justice minister wants to lower age juveniles can be tried as
</HEADLINE>
adults

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Facing a rash of violent crimes committed by
juveniles, Japan's justice minister said Tuesday he wants to lower
the age at which suspects can be tried as adults.
	   While current Japanese law defines anyone under the age of 20 as
a juvenile, suspects aged 16 or over can be tried as an adult for
violent crimes.
	   Justice Minister Shozaburo Nakamura didn't specify how far he
wanted to lower the threshold for trying youthful offenders as
adults, but a spokesman for the ministry said there was strong
support for lowering the age to 14.
	   Only juveniles accused of the most violent types of crimes _
such as murder or extortion _ are tried as adults, said the
spokesman, on condition of anonymity.
	   Just 0.6 percent of juvenile suspects were tried as adults in
1995, the most recent year for which data is available, he said.
	   Nakamura's calls to lower the age come as Japan has been shocked
by a series of violent crimes involving suspects under 16. The law
has barred authorities from trying them as adults.
	   The most famous case was the May 1997 arrest of a 14 year old in
the city of Kobe for the grisly beheading of an 11-year-old
elementary student.

Saudi king discharged from hospital after surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ King Fahd was discharged from a
Riyadh hospital after recovering from surgery to remove his gall
bladder, Saudi television reported Tuesday.
	   The television showed footage of a relaxed Fahd being greeted by
dozens of royal family members and other well-wishers at King
Faisal Specialist Hospital before his release late Monday.
	   Some kissed his hand and chatted with the monarch, who sat in a
chair in the traditional Saudi black cape with gold trim. He was
then shown leaving the hospital, waving to bystanders from a blue
Mercedes.
	   On the occasion of Fahd's recovery and release from the
hospital, the kingdom will free a number prisoners convicted of
non-violent crimes, the television quoted an Interior Ministry
statement as saying.
	   The statement did not say how many prisoners would benefit from
the amnesty.
	   Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, was admitted to hospital on Aug. 2.
A medical team led by a U.S. surgeon successfully removed Fahd's
gall bladder last Wednesday.
	   The king had been hospitalized for a short time in March, also
with a gall bladder problem.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in 1995 that damaged his short-term memory and
his ability to concentrate. Two months later, he temporarily handed
over power to his half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah.
	   Fahd, who has suffered from diabetes and arthritis for years,
has used a wheelchair since the stroke. Fahd was born in 1924 but
the exact date is not known.

Appeals court confirms sperm clinic was OK to reject lesbian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Queensland's highest state court
ruled Tuesday that a donor sperm clinic did not discriminate
against a lesbian when it refused to inseminate her.
	   Last January, the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Tribunal found
the 24-year-old woman had been discriminated against by the clinic
on the basis of her sexuality.
	   The woman, who is now a mother of two, has gone on record as
saying she led the crusade for lesbian access to the clinics
because stringent testing meant the clinics did not carry the same
risks as private donor insemination, notably the possibility of
AIDS contamination.
	   However, the state Supreme Court overturned the decision after
the clinic appealed, saying it had the right to refuse treatment
because the woman was not infertile.
	   The Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court finding on Tuesday,
saying the woman had not been directly discriminated against on the
basis of her lesbianism.
	   Justices Bill Pincus, Geoffrey Davies and James Thomas found
that the tribunal president, Roslyn Atkinson, erred in finding that
lesbianism was the reason for the refusal of treatment.
	   However, the court sent back to the tribunal issues of indirect
discrimination and a possible exemption under the
Anti-Discrimination Act.
	   The issue of indirect discrimination relates to whether the
clinic acted reasonably in its imposition of a condition that all
women treated must have a consent form signed by a male partner.

Japanese stocks rebound, dollar drops against yen in Tokyo

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rebounded Tuesday as investors
snapped up bargain-priced shares of banks and other companies
following a rally overnight on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar fell
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 269.13
points, or 1.82 percent, to close at 15,063.79. On Monday, the
average sank 329.27 points, or 2.18 percent.
	   ``The technical rebound after the recent plunge continues, but
the momentum of bank share buying is tapering off on the weakening
of the yen,'' against the dollar, said Masatoshi Sato of Kankaku
Securities Co.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which has fallen almost 10
percent since its peak of 9,337.97 on July 17, recovered Monday,
soaring 149.85 points, or 1.8 percent.
	   The Dow, which has been volatile recently, shrugged off the news
Monday that Russia implemented a sharp devaluation of its currency,
along with a forced restructuring of domestic debt.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, meanwhile, expressed worry
Tuesday that Russia's devaluation of the ruble could negatively
impact economies around the world, Japan's Nikkei news wire
reported.
	   Still, Wall Street's rally bolstered sentiment in Tokyo, helping
to trigger short-covering which pushed the market higher, traders
said.
	   Stocks also got a boost as investors started buying after
judging prices had fallen to attractive levels relative to
corporate earnings prospects, they said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 14.69 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,166.72. The
TOPIX tumbled 16.77 points, or 1.43 percent, on Monday.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, meanwhile, the dollar
bought 145.51 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 0.94 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of 145.96.
	   The dollar lost ground against the yen after Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan is ready to defend the value of
the yen if necessary, traders said.
	   But the U.S. currency's slide was stemmed in afternoon trading
from relief following the smooth deliverance of a highly
anticipated speech by President Bill Clinton in Washington late
Monday, they said.
	   Clinton admitted in the speech to having had a ``not
appropriate'' relationship with a former White House intern, ending
seven months of denial.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.155 percent from
Monday's finish of 1.150 yen, pushing its price down to 112.07 yen
from 112.11 yen.

Govt. wary of North Korean tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's women's soccer team will
travel to communist North Korea for a three-game series next week
despite warnings from their federal government.
	   The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said it had
spoken to the 20-member team about the dangers of going to North
Korea as preparation for the qualifying rounds for the 1999 World
Cup.
	   ``The Department has been in contact with the Australian Women's
Soccer Association and has expressed our concerns about matters
such as the quality of health care, food and water and the
limitations on consular assistance should anything go wrong,'' A
DFAT spokesman said Tuesday. ``We said we were very concerned with
their visit going ahead.''
	   The spokesman said he understood the team was travelling with
their own food because of major food shortages in North Korea.
	   ``But medical assistance would be difficult if something went
wrong,'' he warned.
	   Australia broke off diplomatic relations with North Korea in
1975, and has an arrangement with the Swedish mission there.
	   ``But it is a small mission and they would have a very, very
limited capacity to help,'' the spokesman said. ``We have no travel
advisory current for North Korea, no-one goes there.''
	   It is believed to be the first visit by an Australian sports
team to North Korea since 1975.
	   North Korea is one of the first teams to qualify for the women's
World Cup, finishing second behind China in the Asian Championships
last December.
	   Australian Women's Soccer Association spokeswoman Janene Mar
said the organization had sought detailed information about
travelling and staying in North Korea from groups including DFAT.
	   ``We have tried to do our homework,'' Mar said. ``It's certainly
different.''

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Flood waters two stories high covered tourist
sites on Sun Island as the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin
struggled Tuesday against what is feared will be its worst flood in
50 years.
	   Soldiers worked 24 hours straight piling sandbags along a
26-kilometer (16-mile) embankment at Harbin, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported. More than 260,000 people were trying to
protect the city of 9 million, Xinhua said.
	   The water level in Harbin reached a record 120.34 meters (397.12
feet) on Tuesday morning and continued to rise. Officials said
their biggest concern was the nearby city of Jiamusi.
	   Medical teams around the country have been treating soldiers and
civilians exhausted from a summer of fighting the worst floods in
decades. The floods have killed more than 2,000 people and made
millions more homeless.
	   More rain was expected Tuesday on the Songhua and Nen rivers in
the northeast and on the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze,
China's mightiest river farther south where flooding is the
heaviest in 44 years, the Workers Daily reported.
	   Soldiers have evacuated more than 700 families and 52 businesses
from Sun Island in the Songhua River outside Harbin, where a park
in the bitter northern winter draws tourists with snow sculptures,
sledding and skating. Also moved were 52 Siberian tigers from a
breeding center on the island.
	   A photo in the official China Daily showed workers piling up
sandbags between the swollen Songhua River and a highway linking
Harbin and China's largest oil field, Daqing.
	   The flooded Nen River on Monday punched a 50-meter-wide
(50-yard-wide) hole in an embankment protecting Daqing.
	   Soldiers worked to repair it and build up another dike that
would be the final defense of the oil field and the 2.3 million
people of the city of Daqing.
	   Floods have inundated 1,391 wells, and production also has been
halted at an additional 280 wells, the official China Daily
reported.
	   More than 270,000 soldiers and civilians were working night and
day to protect Daqing, Xinhua reported.
	   To the south, in central China, the Yangtze River reached a new
record height of 45.22 meters (149.2 feet) Monday morning at Shashi
city, and then began to recede.
	   Officials earlier warned that if the river went over 45 meters
(148.5 feet) dikes might be dynamited to deliberately flood an area
south of Shashi and safeguard cities down river.
	   Xinhua said 335,000 people had been moved out of the area that
would be inundated, in Hubei's Jingjiang flood diversion area, in
case officials go ahead with the plan.
	   In Jilin province in northeast China, 155,000 people were
evacuated last week from Tongyu County because of floods on
tributaries of the Nen River, Xinhua reported Tuesday. Two railways
in the province were destroyed, it said.

India's opposition unites to take on prime minister over bribe
</HEADLINE>
charge &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's splintered opposition parties
closed ranks Tuesday to press Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
for an investigation into allegations that people close to him were
bribed to transfer a senior bureaucrat.
	   The bribery accusation brought the 5-month-old government to yet
another crisis. It has come close to collapsing several times
because of erratic behavior of Jayaram Jayalalitha, a powerful
regional politician from the south who is part of the 19-party
coalition.
	   On Sunday, Jayalalitha accused Vajpayee in an open letter of
transferring the head of the Enforcement Directorate _ which
investigates financial crimes _ because the owners of a
``well-known group of publications'' had ``paid hefty bribes to
persons very close to the prime minister.'' She did not name the
media baron.
	   Vajpayee's office replied with a curt letter asking Jayalalitha
to prove her charges.
	   The exchange was part of weeks of sparring between Vajpayee's
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and Jayalalitha, who faces
several charges of financial wrongdoing during an earlier tenure as
the top elected official in southern Tamil Nadu state.
	   The Directorate, which comes under the Finance Ministry, also is
investigating alleged foreign currency violations by an owner of
the Times of India, the country's largest English daily. The
publisher has denied impropriety.
	   Vajpayee's political rivals immediately sought a parliamentary
inquiry into the bribery charges.
	   ``The charges cannot be dismissed lightly'' since they come from
within Vajpayee's own coalition, said Laloo Prasad Yadav, leader of
an influential opposition party from the north.
	   Jayalalitha has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the
government over several local issues. She has not carried out her
threat so far.
	   Her All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham party and four
local allies together have 30 lawmakers whose support is crucial
for Vajpayee's government in the 545-member federal Parliament.

Japan expresses concern over ruble devaluation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister said Tuesday that Russia's
decision to devalue the ruble would have ``a large impact'' on
world economies, but other officials predicted little effect on
Japan.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told Parliament that the devaluation
was ``regrettable.''
	   Russia on Monday gave up the costly efforts of the past three
months to prop up its weak currency, letting the ruble's value
slide up to 34 percent.
	   ``This couldn't but have a large impact on the world's
economies,'' Obuchi said. ``It is hard to grasp the situation
fully. We will closely monitor the situation for the time being.''
	   But officials said Japan would largely escape direct ill-effects
of the change because the country's exposure in trade and lending
to Russia is limited.
	   ``It's a more immediate concern for Europe and the United
States,'' said Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the International
Bureau at Japan's Ministry of Finance.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was quoted as saying by Kyodo
News agency that he expects the International Monetary Fund to
continue playing a leading role to help Russia get over its
financial crisis.
	   He added that Tokyo will support the IMF's efforts.
	   ``I can only say now that I expect the Russian government to
stick to the IMF bailout program and to swiftly implement economic
measures relating to taxes and pension funds,'' he was quoted as
saying by Kyodo.

Cambodian opposition calls post-coup contracts `illegal'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's top two opposition
leaders warned foreign investors Tuesday that all contracts signed
following last year's coup d'etat with what they described as an
``illegal'' government are ``subject to revision and possible
annulment.''
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who together won close
to half the seats in the National Assembly in last month's
parliamentary elections, urged potential investors to wait until a
new government is formed in October before signing any new
agreements.
	   Co-Premier Hun Sen's ruling party won in a slight majority in
last month's parliamentary elections, but not the two-thirds needed
to form a government.
	   The July 26 elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted his
co-prime minister Ranariddh, shattering their tense dual
premiership formed after the U.N-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Hun Sen called the elections to restore his legitimacy in the
eyes of the international community and win back foreign aid.
	   ``We advise all investors or potential investors to ensure that
they consider carefully the legal ramifications of entering into
contracts with the present illegal Phnom Penh government,''
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy wrote in a joint statement.
	   Hun Sen has asked Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy
Party _ which together won 58 seats in the 122-seat National
Assembly _ to join him in a coalition government.
	   They have so far refused even to recognize the polls which they
said were marred with irregularities, and have threatened to
boycott Parliament unless their complaints are properly
investigated.
	   ``It is our duty to defend the national interest of Cambodia by
ensuring that contracts are signed through legal procedures, on
behalf of the people, not for the benefit of a small group led by
partisan interests,'' they wrote.

Citing Russian ruble, Malaysian premier blames speculators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With Russia the latest country to
devalue its beleaguered currency, Malaysia's prime minister warned
Tuesday that speculative attacks on developing countries were
spreading.
	   ``The currency attack is now at dangerous and irresponsible
levels,'' said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has repeatedly
blamed Western currency traders for triggering Asia's financial
troubles.
	   ``I'm worried that if the attacks on developing nations'
currencies continue, the pressure will spread to other countries
that could have prevented it,'' Mahathir told a gathering of
workers to mark the country's labor day.
	   On Monday, Russia's government let the value of the ruble drop
34 percent after spending billions of dollars over the past three
months trying to prop the country's weakened currency.
	   The devaluation came just weeks after the International Monetary
Fund cobbled together an aid package of nearly dlrs 23 billion to
stabilize Russia's financial markets.
	   Since Thailand devalued its baht last July, much of East Asia
has been hit with massive currency depreciations which have spread
as far as South Africa, Eastern Europe and now Russia.
	   ``Russia has a nuclear bomb, they may want to use it now,''
Mahathir joked.
	   The prime minister, in his attacks on Western currency traders,
has argued that ``foreign forces'' use financial markets to wipe
out wealth and topple governments. He has said that sudden flows of
capital should be controlled.
	   In Southeast Asia, only Mahathir and Singapore's Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong, have managed to stay in office since the economic
crisis began last year.
	   Addressing another of his favorite themes, Mahahtir said that
foreign powers were not content with crippling the country's
economy but now were preventing economic recovery.
	   He cited recent downgrades by Moody's and Standard and Poor's,
which forced Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim to cancel a dlrs 2
billion sovereign bond issue. The cash would have gone towards
funding a bank to help tackle the country's growing bad debt
problem.
	   ``We should not rely on foreigners,'' Mahathir said. ``Not only
do they not want to help, they are also preventing us from
restoring our economy.''

Archaeologists worry housing project could cover old kingdom site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Archaeologists are worried that a
proposed golf course and housing development will cover the site of
a 16th century Javanese kingdom, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The proposed development near Bogor, 60 kilometers (35 miles)
east of Jakarta, was once dotted with buildings of the Pajajaran
kingdom, the official Antara news agency quoted Hidayat Suryalaga,
head of Pasundan University's Cultural Center, as saying.
	   Antara also quoted Edi Ekajati, dean of Pajajaran University's
faculty of letters, as saying an antique manuscript had described
the area, known as Rancamaya, as part of the kingdom.
	   However, Bogor Mayor Eddy Gunardi denied any archaeological site
was buried under the 257-hectare (635-acre) tract of land.
	   Gunardi said Indonesia's National Center for Archaeological
Research had certified that the Rancamaya area did not contain any
objects of historical significance.
	   The site is on Indonesia's main island of Java, which in ancient
times was divided into many rival kingdoms.

Americans leave Pakistan, vow to return

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ About 200 Americans prepared to leave
Pakistan Tuesday after their government deemed the country unsafe,
but U.S. Ambassador Thomas Simons vowed they would be back.
	   Simons is among the diplomats who remained behind as their
families, non-essential staff and their relatives departed under
State Department orders following the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The
nearly simultaneous bombings killed 257 people and injured
thousands.
	   ``The Americans always come back. We have very important
business to conduct in this country,'' Simons told reporters after
arriving at the airport with the evacuees in a convoy of four
buses, the ambassador's car and a few police motorcycle outriders,
their sirens blaring.
	   Though ordinary Americans have been strongly advised to leave as
well, few took up their government's offer of a ride on the charter
plane booked to fly diplomatic staff and relatives to Brussels
Tuesday.
	   ``People are thinking about leaving, but there is no general
rush for the exits,'' Simons said. ``They're going to continue to
watch the situation. But they're calm, as we are calm.''
	   Americans not connected with the embassy were briefed by Simons
Monday, hours after learning of the evacuation order. Many said
that despite the seriousness of the warning and the sudden
departure of much of the embassy staff, they were inclined to stay
for the time being because there had been no specific threat
against Americans in Pakistan.
	   ``It is a general pattern of threat that we're responding to,''
Simons said Tuesday.
	   Similar measures have been taken at U.S. Embassies in Asmara,
Eritrea; Tirana, Albania; and Ulan Bator, Mongolia
	   On Monday, Simons dismissed the possibility the United States
was planning to use Pakistan as a staging ground for an attack on a
terrorist leader holed up in neighboring Afghanistan who has been
identified as a possible suspect in the African bombings. Pakistani
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz added his country had not been asked
to facilitate any attack on Osama bin Laden, who the United States
has accused of sponsoring terrorism around the world.
	   Rumors of a U.S. attack on bin Laden are circulating in Pakistan
and elsewhere.
	   The Gulf newspaper Emirates News, quoting unnamed Pakistan
Foreign Ministry officials on Tuesday, reported Washington had
asked Islamabad for permission to use the Afghan border city of
Peshawar as a military staging ground. The newspaper's sources said
the go-ahead for an attack could come if the type of explosives
used in East Africa were found to match explosives used in other
attacks linked to bin Laden.

Egypt denies reports of Abu Nidal arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian security officials on Tuesday
denied that master terrorist Abu Nidal had been arrested in Egypt,
responding to news reports and several days of rumors that the
one-time Palestinian guerrilla was in custody.
	   They also said that followers of Abu Nidal _ the nom de guerre
of Sabri al-Banna _ had not been detained in Egypt.
	   The security officials spoke to The Associated Press on
customary condition their names not be used. A similar denial was
carried on Egypt's Middle East News Agency, quoting a security
source who called the reports ``untrue and baseless.''
	   The reports, by a foreign news agency Monday and the Arabic
daily Al-Hayat's Tuesday edition, also quoted unnamed sources. They
included comments by Egyptian and Palestinian officials denying any
knowledge of such an arrest.
	   Abu Nidal's capture would be a major victory for anti-terrorist
authorities. The U.S. State Department lists his group as ``the
most dangerous terrorist organization in existence,'' blamed for
killing 300 people and wounding 650 in 20 countries since 1973.
	   Rumors of Abu Nidal's alleged arrest in Egypt have been
circulating in the Palestinian community in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip as well as in Lebanon.
	   Some Palestinian sources said he was seized a month ago while
coming from Libya. Others said henchman of the terrorist leader
were arrested but not the man himself. All the sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   There has been no official confirmation of any of the reports,
and checks with sources in the U.S. intelligence community in
Washington turned up no one who had heard of such an arrest.
	   Abu Nidal's prime targets were Israelis, but he was accused in
recent years of becoming a hit man for various Arab regimes who
backed him. He also murdered close allies of Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat after he broke with Arafat in
the mid-1970s, accusing the PLO chief of weakness in confronting
Israel.
	   Abu Nidal _ the name means ``Father of Struggle'' in Arabic _ is
61 and was born in Jaffa, now on Israel's Mediterranean coast. He
has operated from Iraq, Syria and Libya.
	   His group was blamed for the Dec. 27, 1985, twin attacks on
ticket counters of the Israeli airline El Al at Rome and Vienna
airports. The seven attackers killed 18 people and wounded 120
others.
	   Abu Nidal also has been accused of the bombings of a Pan Am
jetliner on the ground at Rome Airport in 1973 that killed 32
passengers and of a TWA jet over the Aegean Sea the following year
that killed all 88 people aboard.
	   His group also has been blamed for a long string of attacks on
Western diplomats and Jewish worshipers stretching from Europe to
the Middle East.

Pan Mingdong, prominent dissident, dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Pan Mingdong, a veteran dissident who was
repeatedly jailed for his activism, has died of cancer after a long
wait for a passport that would have enabled him to be treated in
the United States, human rights groups said Tuesday.
	   Pan, a former boxing coach whose father was executed in the
1950s for opposing Chairman Mao Tse-tung, died Sunday evening in
Changsha city, southern Hunan province, the Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The Hong Kong-based group gave Pan's age as 49. China Peace, a
New York-based group that also reported his death, said Pan was 50.
	   After he was diagnosed last year as having cancer of the rectum,
friends of Pan's in the United States invited him to go there for
medical treatment, the Information Center said.
	   But Changsha police took nearly a year to process Pan's passport
application, and by time he got a passport in June, Pan's cancer
had spread to his liver and he was too sick to travel, the group
said.
	   Pan took part in the seminal Democracy Wall movement of the late
1970s and in the massive pro-democracy protests of 1989. After the
1989 protests were crushed, Pan was sent to a labor camp for two
years.
	   During his years as a dissident, he was detained dozens of
times, most recently for four days in March when he was already
very ill, the Information Center said.
	   Pan was unmarried and is survived only by an elder brother, the
group said.

Scientists set to probe frozen Arctic graves for deadly virus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that fort where virus was diagnosed was in Kansas. &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway (AP) _ Eighty years ago, the Spanish Flu
virus killed tens of millions before it disappeared. Scientists
trying to pry its secrets out of an Arctic cemetery are taking no
chances that they might bring it back to life.
	   The four-nation team believes frozen remnants of the virus are
in six bodies buried in permafrost in this island outpost north of
the Norwegian mainland. On Monday, they were assembling equipment
for exhuming the bodies.
	   The research team, which includes experts from Norway, Canada,
Britain and the United States, hopes the viral material that may
have been frozen in the bodies will permit the construction of a
genetic profile of the virus.
	   According to Kirsty Duncan, a Canadian medical geographer who
leads the 15-member team, that could help explain how the 1918
virus killed so many people and then disappeared.
	   ``My first focus in the next few weeks is safety,'' Duncan said.
	   Experts say there is virtually no chance of finding a living
sample of the virus that killed more people than fighting in World
War I. The virus, first detected in the United States at Fort
Funstan, Kansas, spread rapidly among troops sent to Europe in
World War I. Victims suffered a sudden fever, chills, headache,
malaise, muscle pain, pneumonia and rapid death.

Cambodian resistance leader vows to fight on if election results
</HEADLINE>
unfair

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A leader of the resistance forces
loyal to ousted Co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh pledged
Tuesday to fight on until his group is satified that last month's
elections were fair.
	   The vow by Serey Kosal, one of the most senior Ranariddh
loyalists to escape last year's coup d'etat, followed news that
resistance forces had captured a village in the southwestern
province of Koh Kong.
	   The area is far from the resistance's stronghold on Cambodia's
northern border with Thailand, and little or no guerrilla activity
had been reported there previously.
	   Ranariddh was ousted by his co-prime minister Hun Sen in a coup
d'etat last year.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's party won a slight majority in last
month's parliamentary elections, but not the two-thirds needed to
form a government.
	   A ceasefire agreement between Hun Sen's government and the
resistance was reached early this year, but troops loyal to
Ranariddh say they will continue fighting until Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC party recognizes the election results.
	   FUNCINPEC and other opposition parties have so far refused to
recognize the legitimacy of the polls which they said were marred
with irregularities, and have threatened to boycott parliament
unless their complaints are properly investigated.
	   ``We are waiting for the announcement of the election results,
but if they are not acceptable to us we will have no other choice
but to continue the resistance,'' Serey Kosal said Monday.
	   About 100 guerrillas under his command captured a remote jungle
village called Thmar Da in Koh Kong last week, he said. His claim
was confirmed by the Koh Kong governor Rong Phlam Kessarn.
	   Serey Kosal said his troops, supported by a band of Khmer Rouge
guerrillas, pushed government troops out of the village and were
now consolidating their position. Fourteen government soldiers were
killed in the attack and 9 captured, he said.
	   Governor Rong Phlam Kessarn confirmed that the village was lost
to the rebels and said his troops were awaiting orders from Phnom
Penh before mounting an attack to retake the village. He denied
that there were any serious casualties during last week's fighting.

mistake

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and his top economic
planner publicly disagreed in parliamentary testimony Tuesday over
whether a decision to raise taxes last year was a mistake.
	   Both men were asked by an opposition lawmaker about the decision
by Obuchi's predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, to raise the national
sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent in April 1997.
	   ``I don't think it was a mistake,'' Obuchi said.
	   Obuchi was elected prime minister last month after Hashimoto
resigned following a humiliating defeat by his ruling Liberal
Democratic Party in parliamentary elections.
	   Many economists have said that last year's sales tax hike
triggered Japan's current economic recession by slowing
consumption. Obuchi's government has promised to cut income and
corporate taxes to get the economy going again.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, head of the Economic Planning Agency, responded
to the question from Kazuo Shii of the Communist Party by saying he
thought the tax increase was a bad idea.
	   Sakaiya, who was appointed by Obuchi, is known as unusually
frank and outspoken for a Cabinet minister. One of his first acts
on taking office was to describe the government's official 1.9
percent economic growth target for this fiscal year as
``impossible.''

Egypt denies reports of Abu Nidal arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian security officials on Tuesday
denied that master terrorist Abu Nidal had been arrested in Egypt,
responding to news reports and several days of rumors that the
one-time Palestinian guerrilla was in custody.
	   They also said that followers of Abu Nidal _ the nom de guerre
of Sabri al-Banna _ had not been detained in Egypt.
	   The security officials spoke to The Associated Press on
customary condition of anonymity. A similar denial was carried on
Egypt's Middle East News Agency, quoting a security source who
called the reports ``untrue and baseless.''
	   The reports, by a foreign news agency Monday and the Arabic
daily Al-Hayat's Tuesday edition, also quoted unnamed sources. They
included comments by Egyptian and Palestinian officials denying any
knowledge of such an arrest.
	   Abu Nidal's capture would be a major victory for anti-terrorist
authorities. The U.S. State Department lists his group as ``the
most dangerous terrorist organization in existence,'' blamed for
killing 300 people and wounding 650 in 20 countries since 1973.
	   Rumors of Abu Nidal's alleged arrest in Egypt have been
circulating in the Palestinian community in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip as well as in Lebanon.
	   Abu Nidal's prime targets were Israelis, but he was accused in
recent years of becoming a hit man for various Arab regimes who
backed him.
	   Abu Nidal _ the name means ``Father of Struggle'' in Arabic _ is
61 and was born in Jaffa, now on Israel's Mediterranean coast. He
has operated from Iraq, Syria and Libya.
	   His group was blamed for the Dec. 27, 1985, twin attacks on
ticket counters of the Israeli airline El Al at the Rome and Vienna
airports. The seven attackers killed 18 people and wounded 120
others.
	   Abu Nidal also has been accused of the bombings of a Pan Am
jetliner on the ground at Rome Airport in 1973 that killed 32
passengers and of a TWA jet over the Aegean Sea the following year
that killed all 88 people aboard.
	   His group also has been blamed for a long string of attacks on
Western diplomats and Jewish worshipers stretching from Europe to
the Middle East.

Hong Kong groups protest for release of Chinese dissidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A group of democracy activists chanted and
carried banners to the offices of China's news agency on Tuesday to
demand the release of imprisoned mainland dissidents.
	   Ten activists from four democracy groups marched to the building
to present a petition calling for the release of Lu Yongxian, Liu
Nianchun and all other political prisoners.
	   Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, is considered to be
the unacknowledged center of the Chinese Communist Party in Hong
Kong.
	   About ten police officers were stationed outside the news agency
offices. Its doors were locked before the demonstration.
	   Leung Kwok Hung, leader of the April Fifth Action Group, a small
Hong Kong organization that frequently demonstrates for democracy
in China and Hong Kong, said that China's release of prominent
dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng in recent months was not
enough.
	   He called for release of all remaining political prisoners,
especially those who are ill.
	   Labor activist Liu, in his early 50s, was jailed three years
ago, without being charged. He suffers from stomach problems and
high blood pressure. Police detained his wife and mother-in-law
last week after they tried to approach a Beijing government office
to demand Liu be given better medical treatment.
	   Lu, also in his early 50s, was convicted in 1996 of
participating in an anti-government group and sentenced to five
years in prison.
	   His application for medical parole was rejected three times last
year.
	   Despite concerns before Hong Kong's return to China last year,
political protests remain legal, and are quite frequent in Hong
Kong.

Displaced Kashmiris return home as India, Pakistan border tension
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ROSHAN MUGHAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Hundreds of displaced families
have returned to border villages in Kashmir following a lull in
cross-border shelling between Pakistani and Indian troops.
	   Thousands more were on their way Tuesday, an official said in
Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. Residents
were returning despite reports that troops traded light weapons
fire in few areas Monday, killing one man and wounding a child, he
added on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Witnesses said hundreds of families, mostly in jam-packed buses
and jeeps, went back to their villages from refugees camps on
Sunday and Monday. There were also many who walked, carrying large
bundles of their belongings and herding cattle.
	   ``There is always a fear of renewed Indian shelling,'' said
Mohammad Sadiq, a shopkeeper in Chokoti, a border town around 50
kilometers (30 miles) from Muzaffarabad. ``But we have no choice
other than to go back as we are facing hardships in (refugee)
camps.''
	   Most of the villages on the Pakistani side of Kashmir are a
stone's throw from the border and exposed to Indian troops
positioned on nearby mountains.
	   Nearly 200 people were killed, hundreds wounded and thousands
displaced on both sides of the border following heavy artillery
duels during the last week of July and early August. Each country
accuses the other of unprovoked fighting.
	   Both sides hold parts of Kashmir _ a former princely state
located in the shadow of the Himalayan Mountains _ and lay claim to
the rest. The two countries have fought two wars over Kashmir since
independence from British rule in 1947.

Up to 12 hours ahead of time, Fiji plans to warn the world about
</HEADLINE>
Y2K
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ If the doomsayers are right, Fiji will be
among the very first countries in the world to be hit by Millennium
Bug as it creeps across the face of the earth at midnight on Dec.
31, 1999.
	   Lying just east of the International Dateline, Fiji and a
handful of other Pacific island nations are up to 12 hours ahead of
the rest of the world and will be the first to see the clock tick
over into the first day of 2000.
	   The eyes of the world will be on the region for the New Year's
Eve party of the millennium, but it could also be the first in line
for computer chaos.
	   Bad luck? Maybe, but enterprising Fiji is turning the potential
disaster to its advantage by promoting itself as the place where
businesses and others can see what may be in store.
	   As part of global television coverage of Millennium night events
in Fiji, computers will be set up so that viewers can watch as the
computer bug begins to bite, Misa Lesuma, an official of the event
organizing committee, said Tuesday.
	   ``Fiji will be the first place to be affected by the computer
virus because of it's dateline position,'' he said.
	   Fiji could be one of the first countries to have its television,
communications, airline, airport, power, banking and other vital
services crippled, he said.
	   Industries and governments around the world are spending
billions to head off the unnatural disaster called the Year 2000
(Y2K) problem or Millennium Bug. It arises from the inability of
old computer systems to distinguish between the years 2000 and 1900
because their codes represent years simply as 00.
	   Scattered bug bites are already being felt. For example, the
United States government is throwing out old but durable computer
systems that work all right except for the Y2K problem.
	   Under some scenarios, the disruption will be so great the
economy itself will sag from the weight of it.
	   But there are skeptics who say Y2K is a large but
straightforward problem that is causing hysteria.
	   In Fiji, many say that if the bug is a disaster, the
government's plan to televise it won't work because transmission
will stop just as things get interesting.

International trade with North Korea up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ International trade with North Korea rose to dlrs
2.5 billion in 1997 from around dlrs 2.2 billion in the previous
three years, but is expected to fall this year, Japanese trade
officials said Tuesday.
	   The Japan External Trade Organization said North Korean exports
to the world rose 21 percent to dlrs 1.03 billion in 1997, the
first time exports were above dlrs 1 billion in four years.
	   The calculations were based on customs clearance statistics from
51 countries and regions.
	   Imports rose 3.5 percent to dlrs 1.47 billion, and North Korea's
trade deficit contracted 22.2 percent from 1996 to dlrs 447.66
billion, JETRO said.
	   The economically-isolated country's three biggest trading
partners in 1997 were China, Japan and South Korea. Trade with
Japan contracted for the second year in row, but North Korea
maintained its trade surplus with Japan, which reached dlrs 78.34
million.
	   In the first half of 1998, however, trade between North Korea
and China, Japan and South Korea fell 30 percent from the same
period a year ago to dlrs 483.6 million, JETRO said.
	   Exports to the three countries fell 40 percent to dlrs 153.0
million and imports dropped 23 percent to dlrs 330.6 million.
	   North Korea posted a trade deficit of dlrs 177.7 million with
its top three trading partners in the first half of 1998,
suggesting that international trade for the full year will fall as
well, JETRO said.

Coalition minority partner splits as Shipley warns of early
</HEADLINE>
election &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with grafs 7 and 8, with Peters and Shipley locked in
meetings after parliamentary session. &QL; 
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's ruling coalition
splintered Tuesday under pressure from Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley, who warned her minor party counterparts to support her or
face an early election.
	   Two ministers of the minority coalition party New Zealand First
resigned and declared their support for Shipley, shoring up her
chances of holding on to power in a minority government.
	   Shipley needs a total of seven NZ First votes to secure her
government's hold on power. Sources told The Associated Press up to
three more NZ First Cabinet ministers will support Shipley. This
would take her to within two votes of a majority in the 120-seat
Parliament.
	   The coalition has been in crisis for almost a week, after NZ
First leader Winston Peters led a walk-out of Cabinet after a
dispute over the sale of the government's stake in Wellington
airport.
	   Shipley sacked Peters and invoked dispute resolution procedures
under the coalition agreement which give the parties one week to
solve the row before the coalition can be formally ended.
	   Looking drawn and tense after a meeting Tuesday with his
legislators, Peters said he wanted the dispute resolution process
to go ahead immediately.
	   Shipley and Peters went into a dispute resolution meeting after
a firey session of Parliament, in which Peters again questioned
Shipley's credibility and she countered by accusing him of
stage-managing the Cabinet walkout.
	   The two were late Tuesday still locked in negotiations.
	   Peters' apparent eagerness to solve the dispute is a signal some
NZ First members have threatened to quit the party if he pursued
his hallmark tactics of dragging out such talks as a publicity
spectacle, observers believe.
	   With her National Party holding just 44 votes in Parliament,
Shipley has the support of one other minority party and two
independents, but this is still not enough for a majority.
	   The government has not collapsed so far because there has been
no vote in Parliament on money bills or a confidence motion.
	   Opposition parties are clamoring for such a test of the
government, but have no immediate way of forcing a vote.
	   Gambling on a show of strength, Shipley on Monday said Peters
and NZ First had a choice about their future.
	   ``If he wants to precipitate a general election, he can,'' she
said in a television interview.
	   The airport was sold to a private sector investment company
Friday, with Peters' approval, after safeguards about New Zealand
retaining majority ownership were built into the sale agreement.
	   NZ First, ranking only 2-3 percent in opinion polls, is regarded
by National Party members as losers at the next election, which
would otherwise be expected in mid-1999.
	   Three recent polls in Peters' home electorate show he would
finish third in an election. Until now his home base has been
secure, another indication his party has worn out voter patience
with its antics in government.

Japan looks to businessmen, scholars for advice on fixing its
</HEADLINE>
economy

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan chose 10 business leaders and scholars on
Tuesday to advise the government on how to revive the sagging
economy.
	   The so-called Strategic Economic Council was asked to come up
with a plan by the end of December for pulling Japan out of
recession.
	   Business executives appointed to the council included Hiroshi
Okuda, president of Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's most profitable
company, and Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of beer maker Asahi
Breweries Ltd.
	   The government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has been under
pressure at home and from abroad to do more to boost economic
growth. Obuchi has promised to cut taxes and increase spending on
public projects to kick start economic growth.
	   Japan's economy shrank by 0.7 percent in the fiscal year ended
in March, the first full year of economic contraction since 1974.
	   The other businessmen chosen for the economic council were
Masataka Ide, chairman of West Japan Railway Co., Toshifumi Suzuki,
president of retailer Ito-Yokado Co., Chiyono Terada, president of
moving company Art Corp., and Minoru Mori, president of property
developer Mori Building Co.
	   The four scholars were Motoshige Ito, professor at the
University of Tokyo, Sawako Takeuchi, assistant professor at the
same university, Heizo Takenaka, professor at Keio University, and
Iwao Nakatani, professor at Hitotsubashi University.
	   The council gathers for its first meeting at the end of the
month.

Mubarak, Arafat meet on Egypt's north coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MERSA MATROUH, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak met Tuesday
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat about the stalled Middle East
peace process.
	   Arafat did not speak with reporters on arrival at the airport
Mersa Matrouh, a beach resort on the Mediterranean Sea 270
kilometers (160 miles) west of the port of Alexandria. His meeting
with Arafat was held at an undisclosed location nearby.
	   The consultations come amid rising Palestinian frustration over
Israel's refusal to accept an American proposal on troop
withdrawals from the West Bank.
	   Egypt, meanwhile, has been working with France on a plan to call
an international summit to try to get the negotiations back on
track. The summit would involve Arab and Western nations interested
in the Middle East peace process but would, initially, exclude
Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Mohammed Sobeih, the Palestinian representative to the
Cairo-headquartered Arab League, said Arafat was discussing with
Mubarak the ``freeze in the peace process and the failure of all
attempts to convince the Israelis to accept the American
proposal.''
	   He said the Egyptian-French idea for a summit also would be
brought up because ``there are no fruits from the American
attempts, so international efforts are necessary.''
	   Egypt in 1979 was the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty
with Israel and has long served as a mediator in Arab-Israeli
talks.

an international summit to try to get the negotiations back on
track. The summit would involve Arab and Western nations interested
in the Middle East peace process but would, initially, exclude
Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Mohammed Sobeih, the Palestinian representative to the
Cairo-headquartered Arab League, said the Egyptian-French idea for
a summit would be brought up because ``there are no fruits from the
American attempts, so international efforts are necessary.''
	   Egypt in 1979 was the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty
with Israel and has long served as a mediator in Arab-Israeli
talks.

Landslide kills 60 people in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A landslide killed 60 Hindu pilgrims
returning Tuesday from a religious shrine in Tibet, a government
official said.
	   The mud slide, triggered by overnight torrential rains, buried
the pilgrims camped in a Himalayan village near Pithoragarh, 325
kilometers (200 miles) east of New Delhi, said Ashok Kumar, the
relief commissioner of Uttar Pradesh state.
	   Another 25 local residents were missing and feared dead, Kumar
told The Associated Press in Lucknow, the state capital.
	   The road to Pithoragarh was washed away, hampering efforts by
rescue crews to reach the site. Telephone lines also were down, and
further details were not available.
	   Every year, groups of Hindu devotees trek to the Chinese
province of Tibet to pray at Kailash Mansarovar temple, in trips
organized by the Indian government.
	   This was the second disaster to hit the mountainous region of
Uttar Pradesh in a week. Last Wednesday, a landslide killed at
least 42 people and hundreds of animals, and destroyed several
houses and shops in the nearby Ukhimutt region. The downpour
knocked down telephone and electricity poles and blocked roads.
	   Ukhimutt is near Rudraprayag, one of the most important Hindu
pilgrimage centers, and is close to a region ravaged by an
earthquake in 1991 that killed 341 people.

Doctors allowed to visit Suu Kyi in seventh day of standoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government allowed
doctors to visit opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi at the site of
their roadside standoff on Tuesday.
	   But Suu Kyi also came under attack from ruling generals who
urged a crowd of workers to ``annihilate'' her, and reports emerged
that two members of her political party have been sentenced to
jail.
	   Suu Kyi and three colleagues have been holed up in a van for
seven days 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of Yangon. They were
stopped there by the authorities last Wednesday while attempting to
travel to the city of Bassein to meet members of her political
party.
	   During the standoff, Suu Kyi became ill with severe dehydration
and a 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) fever.
	   Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy,
said her two personal physicians would visit her Tuesday afternoon.
	   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner has tried to travel outside
Yangon four times during the past two months and been stopped by
the government at the same checkpoint each time.
	   Her doctors were initially allowed to visit her, but one was
barred after the authorities found she was bringing food to Suu
Kyi.
	   While a government spokesman insisted the military was providing
Suu Kyi with food and water during that six-day standoff, she and
her party later said the government had attempted to starve her
into submission.
	   The government ended that standoff by seizing Suu Kyi's car,
forcibly restraining her and driving her back to Yangon against her
will.
	   A government spokesman said this week Suu Kyi could not be
allowed to travel to Bassein because of threats against her life.
	   Suu Kyi is popular with the people of Myanmar, also known as
Burma, but the regime does not allow her to make public
appearances. The only physical attack on Suu Kyi took place in Nov.
1996 by mob whose members said they were paid by the government.
	   Three generals in the ruling military council urged government
workers to annihilate Suu Kyi and her colleagues in speeches
reported in Tuesday's state-run New Light of Myanmar.
	   Ministers of Industry Numbers One and Two and the Minister of
Immigration and Population accused Suu Kyi of collaborating with
Western countries to impose neocolonialism upon Myanmar.
	   Also Tuesday, student groups said the government sentenced two
members of Suu Kyi's political party to seven years in jail for
handing out pro-democracy leaflets, the same offense for which 18
foreigners were deported last week.
	   The All Burma Students Democratic Front said Kyi Toe and Aung
Than Nyunt were sentenced last Thursday for distributing leaflets
containing a message from their party.
	   They were arrested with nine other NLD members, but their fate
is not known, the student group said.
	   ``The tragic thing is that these two NLD members will to spend
the next seven years in prison merely for allegedly distributing a
message form the NLD, a legal political party which won the 1990
election,'' the ABSDF said.
	   Suu Kyi's NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament, but the
military refused to honor the election.

Unemployment increases to 4.8 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In the latest blow to Hong Kong's foundering
economy, the government announced Tuesday that unemployment rose to
an estimated 4.8 percent in the last three months.
	   The figure, in line with what most analysts were predicting, was
announced in the midst of continued economic turbulence. It was
expected to continue to rise in subsequent months.
	   Already in recession, Hong Kong has seen the value of its main
stock index fall drastically this month. On Friday, the government
intervened heavily in both currency and stock markets to fight off
speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar's fixed peg to the U.S.
dollar.
	   In announcing the unemployment figure for the three months
ending with July, government officials also lowered their estimate
of unemployment for the previous three months. They reduced the
figure 0.1 percent from their original estimate of 4.5 percent, a
15-year high.
	   Officials said that the construction, import-export, retail,
restaurant and business service sectors again were hit particularly
hard. The figure reflected not only new layoffs, but new graduates
on the job market, they said.
	   The government estimated that about 161,000 people were
unemployed. Another 88,000, or 2.6 percent of the workforce, were
estimated to be underemployed.
	   While the increase was in line with what most analysts expected,
many experts said they thought it would increase further. The
economy shrank 2.8 percent in the first three months of the year
and is expected to continue contracting.
	   Analysts said the increased unemployment figures already were
factored into weak stock prices and may not have a major effect.
The Hang Seng Index, the main measure of Hong Kong's blue-chip
stocks, fell slightly on Tuesday, and the unemployment figures were
announced after the market closed.

Dollar drops against yen in Tokyo, stocks rebound
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with late-afternoon bond and currency prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar sank against the yen on Tuesday, hurt by
a rally in Tokyo stocks and pledges by Japanese policymakers to
support their currency.
	   The dollar bought 145.78 yen in late-afternoon trading, down
0.67 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
rate of 145.96.
	   The dollar lost ground against the yen after Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan is ready to defend the value of
the yen if necessary, traders said.
	   Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs, Eisuke
Sakakibara, told reporters that the market believed the yen had
bottomed out at around 147.00 yen to the dollar.
	   Traders interpreted the remark as a line in the sand in the
government's defense of the yen.
	   ``Sakakibara's words were so concrete that it means we will be
more careful about trying to take the dollar up, although
fundamentally there is still no yen-buying news,'' said Minoru
Shioiri, assistant foreign exchange manager at Nippon Credit Bank.
``He's set the new level.''
	   The yen hit an eight-year low of 147.61 yen to the dollar last
Tuesday.
	   On the Tokyo exchange, stocks rebounded sharply as investors
snapped up bank shares following a rally overnight on Wall Street.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 269.13
points, or 1.82 percent, to close at 15,063.79. On Monday, the
average sank 329.27 points, or 2.18 percent.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which has fallen almost 10
percent since its peak of 9,337.97 on July 17, recovered Monday,
soaring 149.85 points, or 1.8 percent.
	   The Wall Street rally bolstered sentiment in Tokyo, traders
said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 14.69 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,166.72. The
TOPIX tumbled 16.77 points, or 1.43 percent, on Monday.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at a modest
324 million shares Tuesday, down from 398.04 million Monday.
Advances outnumbered declines 858 to 275, while 153 issues were
unchanged.
	   In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year
Japanese government bond rose to 1.155 percent from Monday's finish
of 1.150 yen, pushing its price down to 112.07 yen from 112.11 yen.

Security Council puts onus back on inspectors in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to ADD analysis; EDITS to trim. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Rather than explicitly encouraging
inspectors to try to search suspected weapons sites now banned by
Iraq, the Security Council has merely voiced its ``full support''
for the arms experts' mandate.
	   The council decision Monday puts the onus back on inspectors to
decide whether to try to test Iraqi resolve in enforcing its
inspections ban _ a thorny decision that could lead to a renewed
confrontation with Baghdad.
	   Iraq froze cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Aug. 5 after the
chief inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Baghdad
had destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.N. inspectors must make that certification before the Security
Council will lift sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded
neighboring Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf war.
	   The inspectors haven't conducted any inspections since the Aug.
5 decision and asked the council for guidance on how to proceed.
	   Council members said letters being sent to the top two weapons
inspectors were appropriate responses, but U.S. Ambassador Bill
Richardson indicated that they weren't expected to end the standoff
outright.
	   Rather, the council was turning to Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
who staved off a U.S. and British-threatened war with Iraq by
brokering a February agreement to give inspectors access to banned
presidential palaces.
	   ``The Security Council has acted,'' Richardson said after the
council approved draftqp`, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said Monday.
	   Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, made clear Monday that Baghdad
would not allow any inspections regardless of Shah's involvement.
	   ``We found nothing in Shah's initiative that would satisfy our
concerns,'' Hamdoon said. Negotiations in Baghdad with Shah were
continuing, but ``our concerns will have to be met,'' he said.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions and has
demanded that sanctions be removed.
	   According to a final draft of the letter, the council called
Iraq's actions ``totally unacceptable.'' It said council members
``reiterate their full support'' of the International Atomic Energy
Agency and the U.N. Special Commission that searches for evidence
Iraq retains chemical and biological weapons material.
	   If Baghdad blocks an inspection, council members could more
easily hold Baghdad in violation of U.N. resolutions and a February
agreement that gave them unconditional access to suspected weapons
sites. To date, the council has only said Iraq's Aug. 5 freeze on
inspections ``contravened'' the agreement, a semantic detail which
prevented council members from taking tougher action.

Italian journalist barred from Myanmar expelled on attempted entry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ An Italian journalist who was blacklisted
for illicitly gathering news in Myanmar earlier this month was
expelled when he tried to enter the country again, official sources
said Tuesday.
	   The journalist, Maurizio Giouliano, 23, had first arrived in
Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ on a tourist visa on August 6, said
a government news release.
	   When he left Myanmar on Aug. 12, Giouliano was told not to enter
the country again because ``he had contacted the opposition
National League for Democracy and illegally gathered information
during his stay here,'' reports in the state-controlled press said.
	   He tried to enter Myanmar again on Sunday with a different
passport and holding a tourist visa which identified him as a
tourist, but was caught and immediately deported, the reports said.
	   In June a senior general in Myanmar's military government
accused Western powers of trying to discredit the country by
spreading lies through the news media.
	   Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the powerful head of military intelligence,
accused what he called ``neocolonialist countries'' of ``attempting
to dominate and control Myanmar.''
	   Khin Nyunt, one of the top four generals of the ruling State
Peace and Development Council, spoke at a conference of the Myanmar
Writers and Journalists Association, whose members he urged to
instill patriotism in the public.
	   Khin Nyunt accused hostile nations of ``disseminating fabricated
information and false accusations, through their own media,
orchestrated with their lackeys in the country, to discredit and
create false impressions of the country.''
	   The military regime has long accused the West of trying to
control Myanmar and of plotting with Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of
the stifled pro-democracy movement and winner of the 1991 Nobel
Peace Prize, to do so.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Tickets for the opening ceremony
of the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games have sold out and closing
ceremony seats are almost fully booked, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Ticket sales for the games, which run from Sept. 11 to Sept. 21,
reached 299,065 over the weekend, Youth and Sports Minister
Muhyiddin Yasin was quoted as saying in the New Straits Times
newspaper.
	   The figure included some 57,000 tickets on sale for the Sept. 11
opening ceremony. Thirty thousand additional seats had been
reserved for athletes, guests and officials.
	   But officials were facing an uphill task selling tickets for
many events, including athletics. In a bid to fill the stands, the
Games organizers on Tuesday announced they were scrapping separate
tickets for the morning and evening sessions of athletics and the
same ticket would be good for both.
	   Britain and 69 other countries that once formed the British
Empire are participating in the 10-day games.

Palestinians say Lewinsky affair harms peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Top Palestinian officials voiced concern
Tuesday that U.S. President Bill Clinton's confession in a sex
scandal will weaken him to the point that he will be unable to
pressure Israel in the stalled Mideast peace process.
	   ``Obviously we have been paying the price of a besieged
administration incapable of taking bold positions in the peace
process,'' said Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi.
	   ``The peace process has been paying the price of a shaken
president and the diversion of attention,'' said Ashrawi who until
last month served in the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   The Palestinians have for months been asking the United States
to pressure Israel to agree to a U.S. proposal to end the 17-month
deadlock in talks on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   The U.S. initiative calls for an Israeli withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank and the Palestinian fulfillment of a
series of Israeli security demands.
	   Israel has rejected the U.S. plan but the Palestinians have
accepted it in principle.
	   A top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Tuesday that Clinton's domestic troubles had no bearing on the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
	   ``The peace process has not been interrupted by the problem that
the president has had and we expect it not to be interrupted in the
near future either,'' the aide, David Bar-Illan, said.
	   Large headlines about Clinton's testimony covered Israeli and
Palestinian newspapers on Tuesday and radio and television stations
were abuzz with commentary on the implications of his
acknowledgment that he had an inappropriate relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   Israeli political analysts said the affair has distracted
Clinton and kept him from dealing with important foreign policy
issues.
	   ``The greatest power in the world is not acting as a great
power,'' analyst Shlomo Avineri said.
	   Commentator Hami Shalev wrote in the Maariv newspaper that
Clinton's preoccupation with the scandal had paralyzed him.
	   ``The president of the United States, the defender of the free
world, has simply stopped functioning,'' Shalev wrote.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ With bad news everywhere from shopping streets
to tourist hotels and the stock market, Hong Kong's unemployment
rate rose in the three months that just ended to an estimated 4.8
percent, the government said Tuesday.
	   The figure, in line with what most analysts were predicting, was
announced in the midst of continued economic turbulence. It was
expected to continue to rise in subsequent months.
	   Already in recession, Hong Kong has seen the value of its main
stock index fall drastically this month. On Friday, the government
intervened heavily in both currency and stock markets to fight off
speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar's fixed peg to the U.S.
dollar.
	   In announcing the unemployment figure for the three months
ending with July, government officials also lowered their estimate
of unemployment for the previous three months. They reduced the
figure 0.1 percent from their original estimate of 4.5 percent, a
15-year high.
	   Officials said that the construction, import-export, retail,
restaurant and business service sectors again were hit particularly
hard. The figure reflected not only new layoffs, but new graduates
on the job market, they said.
	   The government estimated that about 161,000 people were
unemployed. Another 88,000, or 2.6 percent of the workforce, was
estimated to be underemployed.
	   While the increase was in line with what most analysts expected,
many experts said they thought it would increase further. The
economy shrank 2.8 percent in the first three months of the year
and is expected to continue contracting.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan chose 10 business leaders and scholars on
Tuesday to advise the government on how to revive the sagging
economy.
	   The so-called Strategic Economic Council was asked to come up
with a plan by the end of December for pulling Japan out of
recession.
	   Business executives appointed to the council included Hiroshi
Okuda, president of Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's most profitable
company, and Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of beer maker Asahi
Breweries Ltd.
	   The government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has been under
pressure at home and from abroad to do more to boost economic
growth. Obuchi has promised to cut taxes and increase spending on
public projects to kick start economic growth.
	   Japan's economy shrank by 0.7 percent in the fiscal year ended
in March, the first full year of economic contraction since 1974.
	   The other businessmen chosen for the economic council were
Masataka Ide, chairman of West Japan Railway Co., Toshifumi Suzuki,
president of retailer Ito-Yokado Co., Chiyono Terada, president of
moving company Art Corp., and Minoru Mori, president of property
developer Mori Building Co.
	   The four scholars were Motoshige Ito, professor at the
University of Tokyo, Sawako Takeuchi, assistant professor at the
same university, Heizo Takenaka, professor at Keio University, and
Iwao Nakatani, professor at Hitotsubashi University.
	   The council gathers for its first meeting at the end of the
month.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ International trade with North Korea rose to dlrs
2.5 billion in 1997 from around dlrs 2.2 billion in the previous
three years, but is expected to fall this year, Japanese trade
officials said Tuesday.
	   The Japan External Trade Organization said North Korean exports
to the world rose 21 percent to dlrs 1.03 billion in 1997, the
first time exports were above dlrs 1 billion in four years.
	   The calculations were based on customs clearance statistics from
51 countries and regions.
	   Imports rose 3.5 percent to dlrs 1.47 billion, and North Korea's
trade deficit contracted 22.2 percent from 1996 to dlrs 447.66
billion, JETRO said.
	   The economically-isolated country's three biggest trading
partners in 1997 were China, Japan and South Korea. Trade with
Japan contracted for the second year in row, but North Korea
maintained its trade surplus with Japan, which reached dlrs 78.34
million.
	   In the first half of 1998, however, trade between North Korea
and China, Japan and South Korea fell 30 percent from the same
period a year ago to dlrs 483.6 million, JETRO said.
	   Exports to the three countries fell 40 percent to dlrs 153.0
million and imports dropped 23 percent to dlrs 330.6 million.
	   North Korea posted a trade deficit of dlrs 177.7 million with
its top three trading partners in the first half of 1998,
suggesting that international trade for the full year will fall as
well, JETRO said.

	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of striking Hyundai Motor
Co. workers braced for a police raid Tuesday after the government
apparently failed to resolve a month-long labor dispute at the
nation's largest automaker.
	   Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho met with Hyundai's managers and union
leaders until past midnight Monday and asked both sides to submit
their final proposals by noon Tuesday. Neither side complied.
	   ``Both sides seem to choose a collision course. The government
has now exhausted all the means it can use. We see little prospect
of bringing a negotiated end to this dispute,'' said Lee Soo-yong,
an official at the Labor Ministry.
	   Kim In-hwan, a union leader, dismissed the minister's mediating
efforts as ``a face-saving gesture to justify a police
intervention.''
	   Kim said 5,000 striking workers and their families picketing
Hyundai's main plants in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles)
southeast of Seoul, were prepared for a police raid.
	   ``We're prepared to die. Losing jobs is like facing death,'' he
said.
	   An estimated 15,000 riot police were massed around Hyundai's
plants in Ulsan to evict the striking workers and their families,
the national news agency Yonhap said.
	   Militant workers armed with metal pipes confronted the police,
shouting ``We say no! to layoffs,'' and ``We will fight to the
end!''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Citing slumps in world chip prices and Japan's
economy, Moody's Investor Service cut its credit ratings of two of
Japan's biggest electronics makers, Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi
Electric Corp.
	   The New York-based credit rating service said Monday it has
downgraded Hitachi's long-term debt rating to Aa3 from Aa2.
	   On the same day, it also cut Mitsubishi Electric's long and
short-term debt ratings to A3 from A2.
	   While reflecting concerns about future profitability, the new
ratings are still ``A'' and mean the companies remain relatively
safe investments.
	   Moody's said Mitsubishi should see earnings fall because it
``depends largely on memory products (i.e., computer chips) that
are suffering heavily from prolonged unit-price deterioration.''
	   Domestic sales of Hitachi's bread-and-butter mainframe computers
will likely fall due to the stagnant Japanese economy, Moody's
said.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis is hitting
Australia hard on two major fronts, pushing its once lucrative
trade with ASEAN countries into the red and badly damaging its
tourist industry.
	   Both blows are reflected in figures the government statistician
released Tuesday.
	   It reported that Australia's once booming exports to member
countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations have
slumped over the past year.
	   This led statistician Bill McLennan to make a special report on
the problem.
	   ``The deterioration in Australia's trade balance with ASEAN in
the first six months of 1998 was particularly marked in the case of
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and to a lesser extent
Singapore,'' he said.
	   ASEAN countries -- collectively -- have been Australia's second
biggest export customer after Japan, which takes huge quantities of
coal, iron ore and meat from this country.
	   McLennan said, for example, that Australia's trade balance with
Indonesia plummeted from a surplus of U.S. dlrs 380 million (644
million Australian dollars) in the first six months of last year to
a deficit of U.S. dlrs 357 million (605 million Australian dollars)
in the first six months of this year.
	   The number of Asian tourists visiting Australia continued to
fall last month.
	   The number of tourists from southeast Asia plunged 28.8 percent
from July last year to 39,600, while numbers from northeast Asia
fell by 16.7 percent to 115,000.
	    &UR; ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Trying to ease the impact of an
economic crisis that has deprived two million people of their jobs,
the government is opening a center to help laid-off white collar
employees find work, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   Deputy Labor and Social Welfare Minister Jongtham Thiengtham was
quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying the ministry center will also
provide counseling and help debt-ridden people reschedule their
repayments.
	   The center is expected to open this week, with serial numbers
used to keep confidential the identity of people seeking help.
	   Layoffs of skilled workers and white collar employees began
after the crisis hit in mid-1997.
	   Thousands more will lose their jobs following the merger or
closure of several financial institutions under a new government
restructuring of the reeling financial and banking sector.

Share prices close slightly lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices closed slightly lower Tuesday,
with brokers saying that continued government intervention in the
market prevented the key index from falling sharply.
	   The Hang Seng Seng Index slipped 13.77 points, or 0.2 percent,
closing at 7,210.92.
	   On Friday, the index had surged 8.5 percent after the government
intervened in the stock and futures markets for the first time ever
to crush speculators. The Hong Kong market was closed on Monday for
a public holiday.
	   Tuesday's turnover fell to 5.20 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 666 million), down from Friday's 8.55 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.1 billion).
	   Brokers said the government's intervention on Tuesday was
``defensive'' in an attempt to keep share prices at current levels,
rather than pushing them higher.
	   After the market closed, the government announced that the
territory's unemployment rate rose in the three months that just
ended to an estimated 4.8 percent.
	   While the increase was in line with what most analysts expected,
many experts said they thought it would increase further. The
economy shrank 2.8 percent in the first three months of the year
and is expected to continue contracting.
	   Among losers, Hang Seng Bank fell 1.10 Hong Kong dollars to
38.90, and China Telecom fell 10 cents to 10.70, and Hong Kong
Electric fell 5 cents to 22.55.
	   Among gainers, HSBC Holdings rose 89 cents to 156.00, and Sun
Hung Kai Properties rose 10 cents to 24.10.

Opposition says Yeltsin ``devalues himself'' by permitting ruble's

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has ``devalued himself''
by allowing the ruble to take a dive, the leader of the parliament
opposition said Tuesday.
	   ``Our president has absolutely devalued himself,'' said
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who leads the largest faction in
the parliament's lower house.
	   He said the ruble devaluation announced Monday is the latest in
a long line of Yeltsin failures, and repeated his call for mass
protests and the president's resignation. His previous calls have
triggered little response.
	   Yeltsin appeared to gear down from crisis mode on Tuesday,
accepting the resignation of his long-time economic advisor,
Alexander Livshits. Other personnel changes were not likely
immediately, his spokesman said.
	   The Interfax news agency reported that Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko and Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin had offered to
resign, but Yeltsin told them to stay.
	   The moves followed the announcement Monday that the government
would permit the price of the ruble to fall by a third _ from about
6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the dollar _ an effective devaluation
which Yeltsin had repeatedly pledged to avoid.
	   Russian newspapers had a mixed response, saying that it could
give a break to the battered economy and let the government pay off
its months-long wage arrears. But they also warned it could
backfire on Yeltsin politically when prices begin to rise.
	   ``We woke up in another country _ one standing on the eve of
price rises, deficit, cuts in import and black currency market,''
said the business daily Kommersant.
	   Many commentators assailed Yeltsin for putting himself in an
embarrassing position by denying that devaluation was on the agenda
just days before the move.
	   ``If Yeltsin had set a deliberate goal to undermine his own
prestige, he couldn't have invented anything better than to pledge
there would be no devaluation three days before it happened,'' said
the daily Russky Telegraf.
	   The government pledged to control the ruble's decline, and it
sank to 6.89 to the dollar on the Central Bank-controlled Moscow
currency exchange from 6.43 on Monday.
	   The larger and more important interbank currency market remained
frozen Tuesday. Russian commercial banks, many of whom face a
liquidity crisis, have suspended trading since last week.
	   The more sensitive street rate, which on Monday immediately
plunged to the very bottom of the government-set band, fluctuated
between 8 and 10 rubles to the dollar at exchange booths around
Moscow.
	   In the Russian capital, demand for dollars was low as people
waited for the ruble to stabilize at a higher level and there was
no panic withdrawal of deposits. Business also continued as usual
in Moscow stores, which have mostly kept their price tags
unchanged.
	   However, Kommersant said there was high demand for dollars in
some other Russian cities even at those rates.
	   Analysts said consumer prices would rise over a number of weeks
as stores sell off their current inventories. The higher prices are
expected to deal a painful blow to the population; imports account
for a huge share of Russia's consumer market, including more than
half the food sold in stores.

American found dead in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ An American security officer with
the United Nations' observer force in Tajikistan was found dead in
his apartment with a single bullet wound in his head, security
officials said Tuesday.
	   Local police found 38-year-old Jore de Marco in his apartment in
Dushanbe Monday night, according to Security Minister Saidomir
Zukhurov.
	   U.N. spokesman Ivan Timnev confirmed that de Marco was a U.S.
national serving with the U.N. military observer force as a
security officer.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said the bullet came from de Marco's
pistol, and there was no sign of a struggle. Investigators have not
excluded suicide.
	   Zukhurov said the death did not appear related to Tajikistan's
tense political situation.
	   ITAR-Tass said de Marco was alone in his apartment when he died.
But neighbors told The Associated Press they heard voices from the
apartment around the time the death occurred.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
last year's peace deal, which ended five years of civil war in the
impoverished former Soviet republic.
	   Despite the peace accord, there are periodic clashes between the
hard-line government and the mostly Islamic opposition. Numerous
warlords who do not recognize the peace deal wage turf battles with
one another.
	   In July, three U.N. military observers and their Tajik
translator were shot at point-blank range while on patrol in the
Pamir mountains in eastern Tajikistan.

Paying tribute, Albright visits bombing sites in East Africa

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright paid tribute Tuesday to bombing victims and embassy
staffers in East Africa, demonstrating American solidarity and
promising to track down the perpetrators.
	   ``Together, we promise to bring to justice the murderers of our
friends,'' she told about 200 American and Tanzanian embassy
workers, whom she presented with the State Department's award for
heroism.
	   Officials in Kenya and Tanzania also hoped she would ultimately
announce new aid to their countries, where the Aug. 7 terrorist
blasts killed 257 people in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   FBI agents, meanwhile, pushed ahead with their all-out
investigation into the bombings. In a joint statement with Kenyan
police, the bureau said Monday that a suspect who was returned from
Pakistan had not admitted any role in the crimes or implicated
anyone else after three days.
	   That appeared to conflict with reports out of Pakistan, where
the man was apprehended, which said suspect Mohammed Saddiq Odeh
had confessed and named his co-conspirators. The reports also said
the man had ties to renegade Saudi multimillionaire Osama bin
Laden, who is accused of sponsoring terrorist attacks.
	   Albright, arriving after a 16-hour flight from Washington,
visited the site of the bombing that killed 10 people at the
embassy in Dar es Salaam, laying a wreath on the ground next to the
crater left by the blast. Then she handed a folded American flag to
a line of seven Marines standing at attention and, wearing a white
construction hard hat, toured the damage inside.
	   Reporters also were allowed inside for the first time since the
explosion and found broken glass and smashed furniture scattered
throughout the embassy.
	   ``If it had not been constructed the way it was, we would have
had a lot of people dead,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Dudley Simms
said.
	   Albright helped hang a poster on an outside wall of the embassy
compound, advertising the previously announced reward of up to dlrs
2 million for information leading to the bombers' arrest.
	   ``This is not politics, this is not religion,'' said the poster,
which shows a photograph of the Nairobi blast. Underneath, in big
red letters, it said: ``This is murder.''
	   She then lavished praise, and heroes' citations, on embassy
staffers at the residence of John Lang, head of the U.S. mission in
Tanzania, before meeting with bombing victims at the Muhimbili
Medical Center and with government officials. Later, she was bound
for Nairobi.
	   ``America is very proud of you, all of you _ Americans and
Tanzanians,'' she told the staffers. ``I am truly in the presence
of heroes.''
	   ``Your bravery and compassion and courage have been recognized
around the world,'' she said. ``And the terrorists who would like
to drive us apart have, in fact, brought us all closer.''
	   Albright announced a gift of 500 pounds (225 kilograms) of
medical supplies to Tanzania and Kenya from the Walter Reed Army
Medical Center near Washington, and promised government aid for
Tanzania, but was not specific.
	   Officials in the two African countries are counting on
substantial compensation for victims' families along with
assurances of aid for the governments, whose key tourism industries
were dealt a blow by the bombing.
	   ``A visit alone without any tangible material help and mere
condemnation of the terrorists will not do,'' said the East African
Standard, a private newspaper close to the Kenyan government, in an
editorial Tuesday.
	   The head of the FBI investigation in Dar es Salaam, Kenneth
Piernick, said the bureau has questioned more than 100 people
there, but indicated that most of the interrogations had led
nowhere.
	   ``Right now my evidence is scant, and I'm not going to draw
conclusions based on that,'' he said. He would not elaborate, or
comment on whether two suspects remained in detention, as was
previously reported.
	   In Nairobi, a top Kenyan police official denied a newspaper
report that more arrests had been made there. Officials said last
week that six people were in custody for questioning about the
bombing.

New landslide strikes on anniversary of apartment tragedy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A landslide destroyed four homes and
injured two children north of the capital Tuesday, exactly one year
after 28 people were killed in a landslide that prompted tighter
construction regulations.
	   A chunk of soil and rock about one hectare (2.47 acres) in area
_ some covered by a retaining wall _ slid down a hillside outside
northern Keelung city, burying homes up to their second floors.
	   Residents blamed construction work on new homes farther up the
mountain and demanded compensation from the company building the
units.
	   The landslide occurred one year to the day after a restraining
wall gave way in a typhoon, releasing a deadly wave of soil, rock
and concrete against a five-floor apartment house in the Taipei
suburb of Hsichi.
	   After the tragedy, officials reviewed construction projects in
hilly areas and tightened height and area restrictions.
	   But bureaucracy and a shortage of inspectors have hamstrung
efforts to improve safety. Substandard construction and planning
are believed to be widespread.
	   Crowded Taiwan is largely mountainous, and cheap housing built
on slopes is often the only affordable option for many families.
	   Cheap land in mountainous areas surrounding Taipei has been
aggressively developed as the area's population has topped 6
million.

Two Olympic champions killed in car crash

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Two Olympic gold medalists from Poland
were killed in an overnight car crash, according to media reports
Tuesday.
	   Wladyslaw Komar, who won the shot put gold medal at Munich in
1972, and Tadeusz Slusarski, the pole vault gold medalist in
Montreal in 1976, died when their vehicle collided head-on with
another car late Monday in a rural area 550 kilometers (330 miles)
northwest of Warsaw, said newspaper reports and the PAP state news
agency.
	   Komar, 58, won the gold with a 21.18 meter (69.89 feet) effort,
defeating favored George Woods of the United States at the Munich
Games. He cried on the victory stand as the Polish anthem was
played.
	   One of Poland's most popular athletes, he also appeared on stage
and in films, including Polish-born director Roman Polanski's
``Pirates'' in 1986.
	   Slusarski, 48, also won the silver medal at the Moscow Olympics
in 1980. He then coached Swedish pole vaulters and was to train
Polish athletes later this year.

Spanish communist leader recovering from heart attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish Communist Party leader Julio
Anguita was in stable condition on Tuesday after suffering a heart
attack, hospital officials said.
	   Anguita, 57, who had a first heart attack in May 1993, was
recovering at Reina Sofia Hospital in the southern town of Cordoba.
Doctors said his life was not in danger.
	   Anguita, who was on vacation, was rushed to the hospital Monday
afternoon complaining of severe chest pain several hours after
having lunch. Emergency room doctors operated on him to clear a
blocked coronary artery, hospital officials said.
	   On Tuesday Anguita received visits in his hospital room from
members of United Left, a coalition centered around the Communist
Party.
	   United Left won 11 percent of the votes in the last
parliamentary elections, held in March 1996. The coalition groups a
dozen national and regional parties.
	   The Spanish left is dominated by the Socialist Party, a
center-left grouping that ruled for nearly 14 years until it was
defeated in the 1996 election by the center-right Popular Party.

Economic crisis could cause rise in prostitution in Asia: ILO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The regional economic crisis could
trigger an increase in the number of women and children driven to
prostitution in Southeast Asia, the International Labor
Organization said Tuesday.
	   In spite of the financial woes rocking the region, the sex
industry shows no signs of slowing down, according to an ILO
report, entitled: ``The Sex Sector: The Economic and Social Bases
of Prostitution in Southeast Asia.''
	   The report, edited by Lin Lean Lim and released in Manila,
studies prostitution in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and
Thailand and began before financial turmoil hit the region
beginning in mid-1997.
	   Ms. Lim said during the recession in the mid-1980s, surveys
showed that women who lost their jobs in factories were drawn into
prostitution not just to support themselves but ``very importantly,
because their families back in the rural areas have come to depend
on their earnings.''
	   Ms. Lim, the coordinator for the ILO program on jobs for women,
said child prostitution was a more serious problem than adult
prostitution because of its lifelong and life-threatening
consequences.
	   She said the growing number of children who stop going to school
who have to work for their families because of the financial crisis
is worsening the problem.
	   Ms. Lim said child prostitution ``is a serious human rights
violation and an intolerable form of child labor and that the aim
should be its total elimination.''
	   Although poverty is the main factor behind the rise, the report
said many women are tricked into prostitution or forced into it
through violence or heavy debts.
	   The report said prostitution in the four Southeast Asian
countries has grown so rapidly in recent decades that the sex
business has ``assumed the dimensions of a commercial sector''
which contributes ``substantially to employment and national income
in the region.''
	   The report estimates that the ``sex sector,'' which includes all
those involved directly and indirectly in prostitution, accounts
for between 2 to 14 percent of the gross domestic product in the
four countries.
	   In Thailand, women in the sex sector send about dlrs 300 million
to families in the countryside. This amount sometimes exceeds the
Thai budgets for development programs. In 1993-1995, it was
estimated that prostitution in Thailand yielded an annual income of
dlrs 22.5 billion to dlrs 27 billion.
	   The report said that .25 to 1.5 percent of that total female
population in the four countries are engaged in prostitution.
	   There are an estimated 140,000 to 230,000 prostitutes in
Indonesia, 43,000 to 142,000 in Malaysia, 400,000 to 500,000 in the
Philippines and 200,000 to 300,000 in Thailand, it said.
	   Precise figures are unavailable for child prostitutes, but there
were an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 child prostitutes in Thailand in
1993.

Paying tribute, Albright visits bombing sites in East Africa

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Tanzanian foreign minister, trims.
Albright expected in Nairobi by 1200 GMT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright paid tribute Tuesday to bombing victims and embassy
staffers in East Africa, demonstrating American solidarity and
promising to track down the perpetrators.
	   ``Together, we promise to bring to justice the murderers of our
friends,'' she told about 200 American and Tanzanian embassy
workers, whom she presented with the State Department's award for
heroism.
	   Officials in Kenya and Tanzania also hoped she would ultimately
announce new aid to their countries, where the Aug. 7 terrorist
blasts killed 257 people in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   FBI agents, meanwhile, pushed ahead with their all-out
investigation into the bombings. In a joint statement with Kenyan
police, the bureau said Monday that a suspect who was returned from
Pakistan had not admitted any role in the crimes or implicated
anyone else after three days.
	   Albright, arriving after a 16-hour flight from Washington,
visited the site of the bombing that killed 10 people at the
embassy in Dar es Salaam, laying a wreath on the ground next to the
crater left by the blast. Then she handed a folded American flag to
a line of seven Marines standing at attention and, wearing a white
construction hard hat, toured the damage inside.
	   Reporters also were allowed inside for the first time since the
explosion and found broken glass and smashed furniture scattered
throughout the embassy.
	   ``If it had not been constructed the way it was, we would have
had a lot of people dead,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Dudley Simms
said.
	   Albright helped hang a poster on an outside wall of the embassy
compound, advertising the previously announced reward of up to dlrs
2 million for information leading to the bombers' arrest.
	   ``This is not politics, this is not religion,'' said the poster,
which shows a photograph of the Nairobi blast. Underneath, in big
red letters, it said: ``This is murder.''
	   She then lavished praise, and heroes' citations, on embassy
staffers at the residence of John Lang, head of the U.S. mission in
Tanzania, before meeting with bombing victims at the Muhimbili
Medical Center and with government officials. Later, she was bound
for Nairobi.
	   ``America is very proud of you, all of you _ Americans and
Tanzanians,'' she told the staffers. ``I am truly in the presence
of heroes.''
	   ``Your bravery and compassion and courage have been recognized
around the world,'' she said. ``And the terrorists who would like
to drive us apart have, in fact, brought us all closer.''
	   Albright announced a gift of 500 pounds (225 kilograms) of
medical supplies to Tanzania and Kenya from the Walter Reed Army
Medical Center near Washington, and promised government aid for
Tanzania, but was not specific.
	   Officials in the two African countries are counting on
substantial compensation for victims' families along with
assurances of aid for the governments, whose key tourism industries
were dealt a blow by the bombing.
	   ``A visit alone without any tangible material help and mere
condemnation of the terrorists will not do,'' said the East African
Standard, a private newspaper close to the Kenyan government, in an
editorial Tuesday.
	   Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete said Albright's visit
comforted the Tanzanian people and promised continued close
cooperation with American law enforcement in the investigation.
	   ``This is a common tragedy,'' he said. ``We need to work
together closely, for the terrorists do the same.''
	   Albright told the foreign minister the American people share in
the profound sorrow of the Tanzanians and said the United States
will maintain its presence throughout Africa and throughout the
world.
	   ``These bombings will not cause America to back down or
retreat,'' she declared.
	   The head of the FBI investigation in Dar es Salaam, Kenneth
Piernick, said the bureau has questioned more than 100 people
there, but indicated that most of the interrogations had led
nowhere.
	   ``Right now my evidence is scant, and I'm not going to draw
conclusions based on that,'' he said. He would not elaborate, or
comment on whether two suspects remained in detention, as was
previously reported.
	   In Nairobi, a top Kenyan police official denied a newspaper
report that more arrests had been made there. Officials said last
week that six people were in custody for questioning about the
bombing.

South Africa bat first
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ South Africa won the toss and elected
to bat first in the crucial match against England in the one-day
triangular series Wednesday.
	   With Sri Lanka already qualified for Thursday's final at Lord's
with a positive net run rate of 0.21, an England win here will
ensure them a place in the final.
	   England had earlier beaten world champions Sri Lanka on Sunday
by 36 runs.
	   Even if England loses, chasing a target, as long as it is by 46
runs or less in a full 50-over match, the home side will still
qualify.
	   South Africa, having lost to Sri Lanka in the tournament opener
by 57 runs at Trent Bridge, will have to beat England by more than
a 46-run margin to book a place in the final.
	   England named an unchanged side from Sunday, while South Africa
brought in debutant Mornantau Hayward in place of Steve Elworthy in
the only change to the first outing.
	   England: Alistair Brown, Nick Knight, Alec Stewart (captain),
Nasser Hussain, Graeme Hick, Adam Hollioake, Ian Austin, Robert
Croft, Darren Gough, Alan Mullally, Peter Martin.
	   South Africa: Gary Kirsten, Mike Rindel, Jacques Kallis, Daryll
Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Jonty Rhodes, Shaun Pollock,
Mark Boucher, Pat Symcox, Mornantau Hayward and Allan Donald.
	   Umpires: John Holder and George Sharpe.

Cash-strapped state television network rejects local films
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The state-owned television station
has stopped broadcasting new, Malaysian-made movies because it
can't afford to buy rights to them and is having trouble finding
sponsors, an official said Tuesday.
	   Deputy Information Minister Suleiman Mohamed said Radio and
Television Malaysia, the country's oldest television station, is
being forced to repeat programs it had broadcast previously.
	   Due to the Asian economic crisis, advertising revenue on the
station's two channels has plunged by 70 million ringgit (dlrs 16.7
million) in the first six months of this year, Suleiman said.
	   He added that RTM has delayed a 400 million ringgit (dlrs 95.2
million) plan to upgrade equipment.

Palestinians say Lewinsky affair harms peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Top Palestinian officials voiced concern
Tuesday that U.S. President Bill Clinton's confession in a sex
scandal will weaken him to the point that he will be unable to
pressure Israel in the stalled Mideast peace process.
	   ``Obviously we have been paying the price of a besieged
administration incapable of taking bold positions in the peace
process,'' said Palestinian council member Hanan Ashrawi.
	   ``The peace process has been paying the price of a shaken
president and the diversion of attention,'' said Ashrawi who until
last month served in the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   The Palestinians have for months been asking the United States
to pressure Israel to end the 17-month deadlock in talks on a West
Bank troop pullback.
	   A U.S. initiative calls for an Israeli withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank and the Palestinian fulfillment of a
series of Israeli security demands. Israel has rejected the U.S.
plan but the Palestinians have accepted it in principle.
	   A top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Tuesday that Clinton's domestic troubles had no bearing on the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
	   ``The peace process has not been interrupted by the problem that
the president has had and we expect it not to be interrupted in the
near future either,'' the aide, David Bar-Illan, said.
	   Large headlines about Clinton's testimony covered Israeli and
Palestinian newspapers on Tuesday and radio and television stations
were filled with commentary on the implications of his
acknowledgment that he had an inappropriate relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   Israeli commentator Akiva Eldar said Clinton had been set to
publicly blame Israel for the prolonged deadlock in the Mideast
peace talks, but changed his mind when Lewinsky signed an immunity
deal with a special prosecutor.
	   ``Clinton is no longer in a fighting mood,'' Eldar wrote in the
Haaretz newspaper. ``The results of the DNA tests and Clinton's
version of the events ... will have a major effect on the peace
process.''
	   Other analysts said the affair has distracted Clinton and kept
him from dealing with important foreign policy issues.
	   ``The greatest power in the world is not acting as a great
power,'' analyst Shlomo Avineri said.
	   Commentator Hami Shalev wrote in the Maariv newspaper that
Clinton's preoccupation with the scandal had paralyzed him.
	   ``The president of the United States, the defender of the free
world, has simply stopped functioning,'' Shalev wrote.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore narcotics officers in an overnight
operation arrested 120 suspected drug offenders and seized a total
of 250 grams (8 ounces) of heroin, Singapore TV reported Tuesday.
	   Of the arrested, 80 tested positive for heroin abuse and were
sent to the drug rehabilitation center. The rest tested positive
for marijuana and amphetamines.
	   Under Singapore's strict drug laws, any adult caught with 14.8

A month after suspect's arrest, trial delayed by another two weeks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A month after a suspect was arrested in
connection with the murder a decade ago of British tourist Julie
Ward, the court Tuesday granted the prosecution another two weeks
to examine the evidence.
	   In her ruling, Magistrate Uniter Kidullah acknowledged it was
unfair to the accused, Simeon ole Makallah, for the court to
further delay the trial. But she said it was important for the
prosecution, who are senior police officers, to have all the
evidence in hand.
	   She set the trial date for Sept. 1.
	   To defense attorney Karieko Tobiko's objection that his client
had already been held too long without bail, Kidullah replied:
	   ``There have been people who have been in custody for more than
this period.''
	   Tobiko said he would seek to have Makallah, who was arrested
July 17, released from custody Wednesday.
	   On Monday, prosecutor Stephen Munguti told the court he needed
more time to examine the evidence.
	   The day after the arrest of Makallah, a senior warden in the
Kenya Wildlife Service, Attorney General Amos Wako told a news
conference there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to arraign
the suspect and hold a second trial in the murder of the
28-year-old Ward, whose burned corpse was found in the Maasai Mara
National Reserve in September 1988.
	   Makallah has not yet been required to enter a plea because no
charges have yet been filed against him.
	   Ward's mutilated and charred remains were discovered in the
reserve on the Tanzanian border Sept. 13, 1988. Officials first
claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild animals.
	   Two park rangers were subsequently arrested and tried for her
murder, but they were found innocent of all charges in June 1992.
Justice Fidahussein Abdullah criticized the police for conducting a
flawed investigation.
	   On March 2, 1996, Wako agreed that new information about the
killing made another ``fair and objective'' investigation
necessary.
	   Ward, a wealthy hotelier from Bury St. Edmunds, England, has
carried on a 10-year campaign to find his daughter's killers and
have them brought to justice.

Disputes ruffle relations between Croatia and Slovenia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ As the rest of Europe aspires toward
integration, neighbors Slovenia and Croatia are drifting apart.
	   The two former Yugoslav republics on the southern fringe of
western Europe have much in common. But a series of disputes
stacked on the backburner are now driving a wedge into what had
been cordial relations.
	   Since simultaneously declaring independence from Yugoslavia in
1991, Slovenia and Croatia have yet to chart a clear national
border, neither on land nor sea. Property disputes amounting to
more than dlrs two billion remain unresolved, as does the fate of
about dlrs 180 million of Croat savings deposited in a Slovene-run
bank.
	   In the past, the differences seemed surmountable in due time.
With much of the rest of former Yugoslavia embroiled in ethnic
warfare, routine squabbles between the Croats and the Slovenes were
hardly worth rocking the boat.
	   Even an embarrassing incident earlier this year when a Slovene
defense intelligence vehicle was seized deep in Croatian territory
generated only minor attention.
	   But earlier this month, Slovenia suddenly cut off Croatia's
power supply from a mutually-owned nuclear energy plant inside its
territory. Slovenia said the Croats were not paying their share of
the plant's daily operational expenses.
	   Although transmission was soon restored, the incident
represented the most serious dispute between the two partners. It
could have blackened out thousands of homes and businesses in
Croatia if it had persisted for a long time.
	   A week later, the Slovene town of Secovi, on the river Dragonja,
secretly registered four disputed border hamlets in its geodetical
books as integral parts of the municipality.
	   Croatian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Drobnjak responded
with a letter to Slovene officials demanding the incident be
investigated.
	   ``If the allegation is founded, Croatia would consider it an
entirely unacceptable unilateral act, abrogating its territorial
integrity,'' Drobnjak wrote. ``The Republic of Croatia supports
tight bilateral ties with Slovenia and is committed to its further
development, but such unilateral decisions could have counter
consequences.''
	   In the Slovene capital Ljubljana, the government distanced
itself from the incident, maintaining that it was a unilateral
decision by a local municipality and was not sanctioned by the
national administration.
	   Slovenia's popular independent weekly Mladina speculated that
the Ljubljana government may have miscalculated.
	   At the time, Slovenia's ambassador to the United Nations, Danilo
Turk, held the one-month rotating presidency of the U.N. Security
Council, a position which enhanced the country's international
prestige.
	   ``These are not new and unfamiliar problems,'' said Croat
ambassador in Ljubljana, Ivica Mastruko. ``As soon as relations
strain, unresolved issues tend to swim to the surface taking on
emotional dimensions,'' he added.
	   The two governments are now engaged in damage control as media
continues to trumpet the tensions. A meeting between foreign
ministers has been scheduled for next week.
	   Croatia and Slovenia emerged the most advanced economies in the
old, Communist-era Yugoslavia, profiting from the late Yugoslav
dictator Josip Broz Tito's unique mix of planned and open market
policies and work habits adopted under the Austro-Hungarian empire.
	   For years, the Slovenes particularly complained that their hard
work and export income was going to subsidize poor, inefficient
corners of Yugoslavia such as Kosovo and Macedonia.
	   Slovenia, which boasted the highest living standard in the
former Yugoslavia, is faring better than Croatia. Slovenia, which
emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia without long, bloody
conflict, is a frontrunner for NATO membership and is at the
doorstep of the European Union, along with Hungary, Poland and the
Czech Republic.
	   A tiny Alpine nation of two million, it is keen on tying up
loose ends that may hamper its drive towards European economic and
defense structures.
	   While the Slovene economy is vibrant and its long-term political
outlook is sound, Croatia, on the other hand, is mired in the
intrigues of Bosnia -- which has a large ethnic Croat population --
and rising social discontent at home.
	   Analysts in Slovenia and critics in Zagreb believe the Croat
government is deliberately biding time and putting up an inflexible
front to solicit greater concessions from Slovenia.
	   Those who support Zagreb are saying that Slovenia is campaigning
at all costs to promote itself as the last bastion before the
unstable Balkans, a role Croatia is bent on contending too.

Missing pages of young Jewish girl's famed diary are found
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ World War II researchers said
Tuesday they have located five handwritten pages from Anne Frank's
famed diary that they didn't even realize were missing.
	   The pages, in which the young Jewish diarist hiding from the
Nazis harshly describes her parents' marriage, were found to be in
the possession of a former employee of the Anne Frank Foundation.
	   The foundation and the Netherlands State Institute for War
Documentation have issued a joint demand for their return and have
hired a lawyer.
	   Once the pages are recovered, they will be included in a
forthcoming new edition of ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' the
institute said Tuesday.
	   ``We thought we had a complete edition. Now this pops up,'' said
a bewildered David Barnouw, a spokesman for the war documentation
agency and an editor of an unabridged version of the diary.
	   ``I don't doubt the authenticity of the pages,'' he added.
	   The man now holding the pages recently told researchers that
Anne's father, Otto Frank, gave them to him shortly before his
death in 1980. His name was not released, and there was nothing to
indicate that he had done anything wrong.
	   Even so, ``it is highly improbable that Otto Frank made a gift
of this original manuscript to this former employee,'' the war
documentation center said in a statement. ``Rather, he may have
just handed him the pages to prevent the contents from becoming
public.''
	   Barnouw said he couldn't rule out the possibility that still
more pages might be missing from the diary, a modern literary
classic that has been translated into more than 50 languages and is
required reading in schools worldwide.
	   It was first published in 1947 by Otto Frank, the only member of
the family to survive the war, and since has become the subject of
films, books and even a hit Broadway musical.
	   Scholars have said that Mr. Frank was careful to withhold pages
of the diary dealing with his marriage, wishing to keep some
aspects of the family's life private. But although the version
most-read by schoolchildren is known to be abridged, other versions
were believed to have been complete, so the latest discovery took
everyone by surprise.
	   Complicating matters, Anne had begun rewriting her diary on
loose sheets of paper that easily could have been lost or
confiscated in the confusion of her eventual betrayal and arrest.
	   The war documentation agency said Anne wrote about her parents'
relationship in ``very critical'' terms, but declined to elaborate
``given the sensitive nature of the material.''
	   Tuesday's revelations came ahead of the publication this fall of
a new book claiming to reveal the informant who blew the whistle on
the Frank family in August 1944.
	   Hauled away by German police, the spirited teen-ager died
starved and freezing at the Bergen-Belsen camp, just weeks before
its liberation in the spring of 1945.
	   Her hiding place for two years, a secret annex hidden behind a
movable bookcase in an Amsterdam canal house, is one of the Dutch
capital's most popular tourist attractions and draws hundreds of
thousands of visitors each year.

Nuclear whistleblower wants to sue Israel in British court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Mordechai Vanunu, who is serving an 18-year
sentence for giving away Israel's nuclear secrets, wants to sue the
Israeli government in a British court for kidnapping him, his
lawyer said Tuesday.
	   On Monday, the former Israeli nuclear technician asked a court
in the Israeli town of Beersheba to order prison authorities to let
him meet with two British attorneys who want to prepare his case in
Britain, said his Israeli attorney, Avigdor Feldman.
	   Prison officials have refused to let Vanunu meet with the
British lawyers, arguing they did not have security clearance. The
court has not yet ruled on Vanunu's petition.
	   Vanunu is serving an 18-year prison term for giving Israel's
nuclear secrets to The Sunday Times of London in 1986. Based on
photographs of Israel's nuclear reactor in Dimona provided by
Vanunu, experts said at the time that Israel had the world's sixth
largest arsenal of nuclear weapons.
	   Vanunu was kidnapped by Israeli agents in 1986 and brought to
Israel to stand trial. The kidnapping was carried out in Rome, but
it was while he was in London that a female Israeli agent met him
and persuaded him to come with her to Rome.
	   Vanunu has served two-thirds of his sentence and was recently
denied early release by a parole board. Feldman appealed against
the board's decision and the Beersheba court is to rule on the
appeal Friday.

Philippine peso recovers, stocks ends lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso closed higher
against the U.S. dollar Tuesday, buoyed by the Japanese yen's gains
and sufficient supply of the U.S. currency, traders said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's admitting to a relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky virtually had no impact
on the peso-dollar rate, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 43.028 pesos on the Philippine Dealing
System, down 21.5 centavos from Monday's average of 43.243 pesos.
The dollar closed at 42.85 pesos.
	   Volume totaled dlrs 113 million compared with Monday's 109.8
million.
	   ``Banks lowered the offer rates for the dollar as soon as they
saw the yen gaining in early trading,'' a trader said, adding three
foreign banks dominated dollar selling in the market.
	   The banks offered the dollar at 43.10 pesos, the lowest level
for the day, preventing other banks from selling at a higher rate.
	   The yen's gains were triggered by Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa's statement that Japan will intervene to support the
Japanese currency in the foreign exchange markets if needed,
traders said.
	   The Russian ruble's devaluation did not affect trading, with the
market remaining focused on the yen's movement and its effect on
Southeast Asian currencies, a trader said.
	   Traders said the Philippine central bank's decision to keep its
key overnight borrowing rate high at 18 percent helped buoy the
peso as it limited domestic funds that could have been used to
speculate on the dollar.
	   Philippine shares, meanwhile, ended lower Tuesday on
profit-taking, with investors eager to cash in on recent gains
posted mostly by blue-chip issues, traders said.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index closed 12.54 points, or nearly 1 percent lower, at 1323.17,
to add to Monday's 2.21-point loss to 1335.71.
	   The market recovered Friday when the main index closed 34.63
points higher following a six-day losing streak, which shaved off
221.46 points, or 15 percent, from the market indicator.
	   Traders said the Russian ruble's devaluation and Pres. Clinton's
testimony on Lewinsky did not have any impact on the market.
	   What continues to weigh heavily on Asian stock markets is the
regional economic crisis, which is expected to continue hampering
the recovery of Asian stocks.

Singapore stocks continue to slide, STI Index to be revamped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's stock market closed at a new
10-year low Tuesday, falling by 17.97 points, or 1.9 percent, to
927.62 points.
	   The last time the markets closed below that level was in April
5, 1988, when the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index stood
at 926.83.
	   Traders said the index will likely slide toward 900, before
rebounding. But they added the respite will probably be temporary,
as the index will then tumble down to the 750-800 mark.
	   The market was being affected by lingering concerns over a
possible spillover of the devaluation of the Russian ruble onto the
Hong Kong and Chinese markets, dealers said.
	   Also Tuesday, the Stock Exchange of Singapore and Singapore
Press Holding Ltd. announced they will launch a revamped Straits
Times Index Aug. 31 to replace the Straits Times Industrial Index.
	   To insure continuity with STII, the new index will begin with a
base set to the closing value of the STII Aug. 24, the two said in
a joint statement.
	   ``The new STI index will be broad-based, comprising stocks from
various sectors from the Stock Exchange of Singapore and not just
industrials,'' they said.

Government asks soldiers to regroup as rebels advance on Kinshasa

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo _ With electricity out in the capital and a
rebel army advancing on the city, state radio cranked up a
generator Monday morning and broadcast a call for soldiers to
regroup at a Kinshasa military base.
	   State radio also promised rations of bread and sardines to all
new recruits, as the government sought more volunteers to try to
beat back the rebel army, made up of President Laurent Kabila's
former Rwandan allies, ethnic Tutsi fighters and disaffected
members of the president's own military.
	   The calls for soldiers comes as Kabila's military is in
increasing disarray. One of his most important battalions _ the
Zulu Battalion _ has defected to the rebel side, according to a
former military intelligence officer with close ties to the
government, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The entire Zulu Battalion has abandoned Kabila over the past few
days, the former officer said, leaving the towns of Inga and Nzongo
_ and their important electrical supply stations _ to fall to the
rebels.
	   The Zulu Battalion was among the first units to enter Kinshasa
last year when Kabila's army ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko and had been specifically dispatched by Kabila to beat back
the current rebel advance.
	   The rebels are now believed to be within 125 miles (200
kilometers) of Kinshasa, moving up from the west.
	   As for Kabila himself, his whereabouts are unknown. He had been
expected to return to Kinshasa on Monday night from the southern
Congolese city of Lubumbashi, his stronghold during his own rebel
days, but it was not clear if he had done so. Congolese officials
would only say Monday that he was in the country. Kabila, who had
been in Lubumbashi for much of last week, flew briefly to Kinshasa
on Monday before returning to the south.
	   Despite the rebels quick advance in the two weeks since the
rebellion began, Kabila has remained publicly defiant, saying his
soldiers would prevail and blaming the fighting on Rwandan and
Western plotting against him.
	   But Kabila has also been seeking outside support. He was in
Angola over the weekend to ask for troops and arms to shore up his
troubled army, according to a senior Kabila adviser, speaking on
condition of anonymity. In late July, he went to Cuba, where he
also reportedly sought help. One report indicated Kabila may have
ordered a MiG fighter jet during his visit.
	   But just how much, if any, support was promised was not known.
	   Angolan soldiers, along with former Rwandan and Ugandan allies,
helped Kabila in his eight-month fight last year to oust Mobutu,
who had destroyed the infrastructure and economy of the country
during his long, dictatorial rule.
	   Now, though, Kabila's former allies have turned against him.
While Rwanda denies involvement in the war, they are widely
believed to be helping the rebels, who have captured a number of
key towns in the east and, following a cross-country airlift, also
have been advancing on Kinshasa from the west as well.
	   Rwandan Tutsi troops _ once the core of Kabila's military _
defected en masse two weeks ago to join the ethnic Tutsi-led
rebellion, acting on concerns that Kabila has done little to secure
Congo's turbulent border with Rwanda.
	   Tutsis, an ethnic minority centered in eastern Congo and
neighboring countries, including Rwanda, have become the target of
attacks and arbitrary detentions in Kinshasa.
	   In Kinshasa, the situation has become increasingly tense. The
city's residents have been stocking up on food essentials for days,
fearing they will be cut off once the final assault comes. State
radio urged shops Monday morning not to hike prices _ but gasoline
and food prices have already been rising.

Military investigators finish questioning Suharto's son-in-law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Single name for Wiranto is correct

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Military investigators on Tuesday
wrapped up questioning of a son-in-law of former President Suharto
who is suspected in the kidnapping and torture of political
activists.
	   A seven-member military panel has been investigating Lt. Gen.
Prabowo Subianto about the abductions of dozens of anti-Suharto
activists in the months before his father-in-law quit in May amid
riots and protests.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions.
	   Investigators questioned Prabowo and two other senior officers
on Tuesday, said Lt. Gen. Djamari Chaniago, secretary-general of
the investigative panel known as the ``honor council.''
	   The council will present a report to Gen. Wiranto, the armed
forces chief, in the next couple of days, he said.
	   The head of the inquiry, Gen. Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, has
reportedly said he will recommend that Prabowo be court-martialled.
	   Prabowo rose fast through the ranks while Suharto was in power,
but his career suddenly stalled when the former leader ended his
32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Prabowo, 46, has since been the target of numerous allegations
of wrongdoing, the most serious relating to the abductions that
were allegedly carried out by troops under his command in
Indonesia's special forces, known as Kopassus.
	   Investigators have already arrested 10 special forces troops,
alleging they were involved in the kidnapping of more than two
dozen activists in 1997 and earlier this year. Fourteen people
remain missing and are feared dead.
	   Those that have been released said they were abducted, tortured
and questioned about their political activities. Prabowo was in
charge of the special forces at the time.

arriving at the airport with the evacuees in a convoy of four

later.

Asian markets close generally lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally lower
Tuesday, but share prices rebounded sharply in Tokyo on the back of
a strong rally on Wall Street.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 269.13
points, or 1.82 percent, to close at 15,063.79. On Monday, the
average sank 329.27 points, or 2.18 percent.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday soared 149.85 points,
or 1.8 percent, to 8,574.85 despite an announcement from the
Russian government of its debt moratorium and the devaluation of
the ruble.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell against the yen after Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan is ready to defend the
value of the yen if necessary.
	   It was quoted at 145.78 yen in late-afternoon trading, down 0.67
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate
of 145.96.
	   In Seoul, share prices closed sharply lower, with the key index
tumbling 3.5 percent on concern over the devaluation of the Russian
ruble and worries about continuing labor unrest in South Korea.
	   Thousands of striking Hyundai Motor Co. workers braced for a
police raid Tuesday after the government apparently failed to
resolve a month-long labor dispute at South Korea's largest
automaker.
	   The Seoul Stock Exchange's Korea Composite Stock Price Index
fell 10.47 points to 291.15.
	   Indonesian shares also slumped, pushed down by profit-taking.
The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index dropped 10.775 points,
or 2.6 percent, to close at 403.855.
	   Singapore shares closed mixed, although the benchmark index
ended at its lowest level in almost 10 1/2 years because of a drop
in several key component stocks.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrials fell 17.87 points, or
1.9 percent, to 927.62.
	   Hong Kong share prices closed slightly lower, with brokers
saying that continued government intervention in the market
prevented the key index from falling sharply.
	   The Hang Seng Seng Index slipped 13.77 points, or 0.2 percent,
closing at 7,210.92.
	   On Friday, the index had surged 8.5 percent after the government
intervened in the stock and futures markets for the first time ever
to crush speculators. The Hong Kong market was closed on Monday for
a public holiday.
	   Analysts said the testimony and national speech by U.S.
President Bill Clinton on his relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky had little effect on Asian markets.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower amid continuing uncertainty
over Taiwan's economy. The market's Weighted Stock Price Index fell
92.26 points, or 1.26 percent, to 7,181.59.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower because of
investor caution ahead of the earnings season. The NZSE-40 Capital
Index fell 9.52 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,928.45.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower on profit-taking, with
investors eager to cash in on recent gains posted mostly by
blue-chip issues. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30
selected stocks fell 12.54 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,323.17.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed broadly higher, helped
along by a rising stock market in Japan and a recovery in the
Australian dollar from an earlier fall. The All Ordinaries Index
rose 28.7 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,565.5.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed mixed following Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's remarks that the government is looking
at ways to support the stock market. The Composite Index ended at
315.66, down 0.58 points.
	   BANGKOK: Thai shares closed mixed. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand Index edged up 0.44 points, or 0.2 percent, to 235.68.

Israel demolishes Palestinian home in West Bank village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel demolished a Palestinian home in the
West Bank village of Qatana on Tuesday and ordered two more homes
razed because they were built without permits, witnesses said.
	   Israel has ignored calls by the United States to stop
demolishing Palestinian homes and expanding Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Since the start of the year, Israel has demolished 112
Palestinian homes in the West Bank and at least 14 in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem according, according to the Israeli human
rights group Betselem. The group said that there has been a steady
increase in house demolitions in recent years.
	   Israel says it cannot ignore widespread illegal building among
Palestinians. However, Palestinians say Israel makes it difficult
for them to build in areas where it wants to tighten its control.
	   In Qatana near Jerusalem, a bulldozer guarded by 20 Israeli
policemen on Tuesday leveled the one-story home of Mohammed Salah,
said his neighbor Fayez Shamasneh. Thirteen people lived in the
home.
	   Salah's house was first destroyed a year ago and he had rebuilt
one floor last month.
	   Shamasneh said he was told by Israeli authorities Tuesday that
his home and the house of his brother would also be demolished.
	   ``The army demolished my home, my brother's and my parent's home
last year. We rebuilt two rooms each because we could not stay in
the street,'' Shamasneh said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Shah spoke with reporters six days after he was dispatched here
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to urge Iraqi leaders to
reverse their position on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein announced on Aug. 5 that the country
no longer would cooperate with inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission, which is headed by Richard Butler, or the International
Atomic Energy Agency, which is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing trade sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.
	   The sanctions bar air travel to and from the country and limit
the sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   Iraq has long held that it has eliminated its biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   It announced its decision against cooperation after Butler on a
visit here earlier this month said he could not certify that the
Iraqis were in compliance with U.N. resolutions.

<TEXT>
	   Shah spoke with reporters six days after he was dispatched here
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to urge Iraqi leaders to
reverse their position on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein announced on Aug. 5 that the country
no longer would cooperate with inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission, which is headed by Richard Butler, or the International
Atomic Energy Agency, which is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing trade sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.
	   The sanctions bar air travel to and from the country and limit
the sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   Iraq has long held that it has eliminated its biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   It announced its decision against cooperation after Butler on a
visit here earlier this month said he could not certify that the
Iraqis were in compliance with U.N. resolutions.

Philippine peso recovers, stocks end lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix typo in overline

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso closed higher
against the U.S. dollar Tuesday, buoyed by the Japanese yen's gains
and sufficient supply of the U.S. currency, traders said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's admitting to a relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky virtually had no impact
on the peso-dollar rate, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 43.028 pesos on the Philippine Dealing
System, down 21.5 centavos from Monday's average of 43.243 pesos.
The dollar closed at 42.85 pesos.
	   Volume totaled dlrs 113 million compared with Monday's 109.8
million.
	   ``Banks lowered the offer rates for the dollar as soon as they
saw the yen gaining in early trading,'' a trader said, adding three
foreign banks dominated dollar selling in the market.
	   The banks offered the dollar at 43.10 pesos, the lowest level
for the day, preventing other banks from selling at a higher rate.
	   The yen's gains were triggered by Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa's statement that Japan will intervene to support the
Japanese currency in the foreign exchange markets if needed,
traders said.
	   The Russian ruble's devaluation did not affect trading, with the
market remaining focused on the yen's movement and its effect on
Southeast Asian currencies, a trader said.
	   Traders said the Philippine central bank's decision to keep its
key overnight borrowing rate high at 18 percent helped buoy the
peso as it limited domestic funds that could have been used to
speculate on the dollar.
	   Philippine shares, meanwhile, ended lower Tuesday on
profit-taking, with investors eager to cash in on recent gains
posted mostly by blue-chip issues, traders said.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index closed 12.54 points, or nearly 1 percent lower, at 1323.17,
to add to Monday's 2.21-point loss to 1335.71.
	   The market recovered Friday when the main index closed 34.63
points higher following a six-day losing streak, which shaved off
221.46 points, or 15 percent, from the market indicator.
	   Traders said the Russian ruble's devaluation and Pres. Clinton's
testimony on Lewinsky did not have any impact on the market.
	   What continues to weigh heavily on Asian stock markets is the
regional economic crisis, which is expected to continue hampering
the recovery of Asian stocks.

U.N. court is shown carnage from massacre in Muslim village

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The charred body of a child. The
toppled minaret of a mosque. Blood and bullet holes sprayed across
the wall of a cellar.
	   Judges at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Tuesday were shown
grim video footage of the carnage left by Bosnian Croat troops who
massacred more than 100 Muslims in 1993 and torched their village.
	   The horrific images were screened on the second day of the U.N.
trial of six Bosnian Croats accused of taking part in the killing
spree in the village of Ahmici on April 16, 1993.
	   British Army Col. Bryan Watters, the first prosecution witness
in the case, talked the three-judge panel through a series of video
images and still photographs.
	   ``The village, which did not appear to be defended, had been
systematically destroyed in a quite ruthless fashion,'' Watters
said.
	   The defendants _ brothers Zoran and Mirjan Kupreskic; their
cousin, Vlatko Kupreskic; and Vladimir Santic, Drago Josipovic and
Dragan Papic _ appeared unmoved by the images as they sat in court
surrounded by U.N. guards.
	   They have pleaded innocent to a total of 19 war crimes and
crimes against humanity charges relating to their alleged
involvement in the massacre. If convicted, each faces a maximum
sentence of life imprisonment.
	   The trial is the sixth currently under way at the tribunal,
which was set up in 1993 to bring to justice those accused of
committing atrocities in conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
	   Watters did not mention any of the defendants in his testimony,
which was aimed at setting the scene for judges. Muslim survivors
will testify later in the trial about the massacre itself and the
role of the defendants in it.
	   Just one small pocket of houses in Ahmici was left untouched by
the devastation. All of them were inhabited by Croats, Watters
said.
	   The minaret of one of the village's two mosques had been blown
up ``in a clinical fashion,'' Watters said. ``It was shocking. It
was an act of sacrilege against a religious building.''
	   Describing a series of photographs of charred bodies in the
cellar of one house in Ahmici, Watters explained how the four
victims had died.
	   ``It appeared that they had been lined up and shot and then
placed in a heap and burned,'' he said.
	   Two more bodies, burned beyond recognition, lay upstairs in the
house. One of them, the body of a child, lay across a single step,
its legs burned away below the knees.
	   Corpses and dead livestock also littered fields around the
village. British troops serving as United Nations peacekeepers
gathered the bodies and buried them in a mass grave because dogs
and other animals had begun feeding on them, Watters said.
	   He speculated that Ahmici had been earmarked by Bosnian Croat
forces for ``savage and total destruction'' because it was a
nationally significant Muslim center which provided many Islamic
leaders and teachers.
	   The attack allegedly was part of a campaign of terror launched
by Bosnian Croat forces to drive Muslims out of the central Bosnian
Lasva River Valley.
	   The Ahmici massacre ``was used, we believe, as an example of
what would happen if you did not leave,'' Watters said. ``It
certainly was an example of terror.''

Paying tribute, Albright visits bombing sites in East Africa

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright paid tribute Tuesday to bombing victims and embassy
staffers in East Africa, demonstrating American solidarity and
promising to track down the perpetrators.
	   ``Together, we promise to bring to justice the murderers of our
friends,'' she told about 200 American and Tanzanian embassy
workers, whom she presented with the State Department's award for
heroism.
	   Officials in Kenya and Tanzania also hoped she would ultimately
announce new aid to their countries, where the Aug. 7 terrorist
blasts killed 257 people in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   FBI agents, meanwhile, pushed ahead with their all-out
investigation into the bombings. In a joint statement with Kenyan
police, the bureau said Monday that a suspect who was returned from
Pakistan had not admitted any role in the crimes or implicated
anyone else after three days.
	   Albright, arriving after a 16-hour flight, spent about five
hours in Tanzania before heading to Nairobi in a small plane when
the Boeing 747 she had flown in from Washington was determined to
have mechanical problems.
	   In Dar es Salaam, she laid a wreath on the ground next to the
crater left by the blast that killed 10 people at the embassy. Then
she handed a folded American flag to a line of seven Marines
standing at attention and, wearing a white construction hard hat,
toured the damage inside.
	   Reporters also were allowed inside for the first time since the
explosion and found broken glass and smashed furniture scattered
throughout the embassy.
	   Albright helped hang a poster on an outside wall of the embassy
compound, advertising the previously announced reward of up to dlrs
2 million for information leading to the bombers' arrest.
	   She then lavished praise, and heroes' citations, on embassy
staffers at the residence of John Lang, head of the U.S. mission in
Tanzania, before meeting with bombing victims at the Muhimbili
Medical Center and with government officials.
	   ``America is very proud of you, all of you _ Americans and
Tanzanians,'' she told the staffers. ``I am truly in the presence
of heroes.''
	   Albright announced a gift of 500 pounds (225 kilograms) of
medical supplies to Tanzania and Kenya from the Walter Reed Army
Medical Center. She also pledged to ask Congress to approve a
still-undetermined amount of emergency funding to pay for
re-establishing embassy operations in Tanzania and Kenya and to
compensate victims' families.
	   Officials in the two African countries are counting on
substantial compensation along with assurances of aid for the
governments, whose key tourism industries were dealt a blow by the
bombings.
	   But Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete, speaking at a
joint news conference with Albright, said there are no ill feelings
in Tanzania toward Americans because of their handling of the
rescue, as there are among some Kenyans.
	   ``The bomb blast has not generated any hatred against ...
Americans in Tanzania,'' he said. ``We are friends. America is not
the enemy. We know that the perpetrators of the terrorism are the
enemy. We both hate them.''

Myanmar government says meeting held with senior opposition figure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime announced
what it described as ``the first in a series of meetings'' Tuesday
between a top general and the chairman of the opposition party of
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   A news release from the government received in Bangkok, Thailand
said Lt. Gen Khin Nyunt, a leading figure in the ruling junta, met
for 45 minutes Tuesday afternoon with Aung Shwe, chairman of Suu
Kyi's National League for democracy.
	   The statement said participants described Tuesday's talks
as``open, frank and cordial.''
	   The announcement, which could not immediately be confirmed, is
significant because such a meeting could be a breakthrough in
efforts to begin a dialogue between the government and the
country's pro-democratic opposition.
	   The meeting came as Suu Kyi remained encamped in a seventh day
of protest on a road outside the capital, protesting a government
ban on her traveling to meet her supporters in the countryside.
	   The league, which is the major opposition party in Myanmar, has
declined previous invitations this year to meet with the government
because Suu Kyi had not been invited. The party's position was that
the government should not dictate who should represent it in a
dialogue with the government.
	   Khin Nyunt was quoted as saying that ``We hope this is the first
in a series of confidence building talks between the government and
the NLD. We have had a fruitful meeting and we also have
appreciated the NLD's acceptance of our offer of a meeting.''

Government asks soldiers to regroup as rebels advance on Kinshasa

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With electricity out in the capital and a
rebel army advancing on the city, state radio cranked up a
generator Monday morning and broadcast a call for soldiers to
regroup at a Kinshasa military base.
	   State radio also promised rations of bread and sardines to all
new recruits, as the government sought more volunteers to try to
beat back the rebel army, made up of President Laurent Kabila's
former Rwandan allies, ethnic Tutsi fighters and disaffected
members of the president's own military.
	   The calls for soldiers comes as Kabila's military is in
increasing disarray. One of his most important battalions _ the
Zulu Battalion _ has defected to the rebel side, according to a
former military intelligence officer with close ties to the
government, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The entire Zulu Battalion has abandoned Kabila over the past few
days, the former officer said, leaving the towns of Inga and Nzongo
_ and their important electrical supply stations _ to fall to the
rebels.
	   The Zulu Battalion was among the first units to enter Kinshasa
last year when Kabila's army ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko and had been specifically dispatched by Kabila to beat back
the current rebel advance.
	   The rebels are now believed to be within 125 miles (200
kilometers) of Kinshasa, moving up from the west.
	   As for Kabila himself, his whereabouts are unknown. He had been
expected to return to Kinshasa on Monday night from the southern
Congolese city of Lubumbashi, his stronghold during his own rebel
days, but it was not clear if he had done so. Congolese officials
would only say Monday that he was in the country. Kabila, who had
been in Lubumbashi for much of last week, flew briefly to Kinshasa
on Monday before returning to the south.
	   Despite the rebels quick advance in the two weeks since the
rebellion began, Kabila has remained publicly defiant, saying his
soldiers would prevail and blaming the fighting on Rwandan and
Western plotting against him.
	   But Kabila has also been seeking outside support. He was in
Angola over the weekend to ask for troops and arms to shore up his
troubled army, according to a senior Kabila adviser, speaking on
condition of anonymity. In late July, he went to Cuba, where he
also reportedly sought help. One report indicated Kabila may have
ordered a MiG fighter jet during his visit.
	   But just how much, if any, support was promised was not known.
	   Angolan soldiers, along with former Rwandan and Ugandan allies,
helped Kabila in his eight-month fight last year to oust Mobutu,
who had destroyed the infrastructure and economy of the country
during his long, dictatorial rule.
	   Now, though, Kabila's former allies have turned against him.
While Rwanda denies involvement in the war, they are widely
believed to be helping the rebels, who have captured a number of
key towns in the east and, following a cross-country airlift, also
have been advancing on Kinshasa from the west as well.
	   Rebel chief Jean-Pierre Ondekane, speaking Monday in the eastern
town of Bunia, said he had warned his fellow rebel leaders not to
repeat the mistakes of Kabila, who they accuse of corruption and
nepotism.
	   ``I told them I will personally shoot them one by one if they
steal money and isolate themselves from the people,'' Ondekane
said.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Keppel Bank Ltd. on Tuesday reported a 41
percent fall in net profit for the first half of 1998, joining
other major Singapore banks which also posted big losses.
	   The bank said its net profit fell to 29 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 17 million) following an increase in provisions for
bad loans.
	   The bank made total provisions of 42 million Singapore dollars
(dlrs 24 million) in the first half of 1998, a rise of 136 percent
from 18 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 10 million) set aside in
the first half of 1997.
	   Other major banks in the city-state, including all of the ``big
four'' banks, have reported a significant drop in net profit for
the first half of the year, citing increased funds set aside to
cover unforeseen contingencies.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ American diplomats tried their best
Tuesday to persuade ethnic Albanian officials to meet their Serb
counterparts for talks on the future of the separatist Kosovo
province.
	   The U.S. diplomatic initiative was headed by envoy Christopher
Hill, who first met with the designated Albanian negotiators, then
conferred separately with Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader
despised by the Kosovo rebels.
	   Comments from Fehmi Agani, the head of the ethnic Albanians'
negotiating team, suggested it would be hard for the Americans to
convince him and his colleagues to meet Serbian government envoys
later in the day.
	   Even if the two sides meet, prospects are dim.
	   The negotiations are being boycotted by ethnic Albanian
opposition parties and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for
independence of the Serbian province, where Albanians account for
90 percent of the population of 2 million. Kosovo is in Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Rugova announced the Albanians' negotiating team last week, but
it comprises only his own associates.
	   Agani said Tuesday he and his team want an ``end of repression
against the Albanians and the withdrawal of the (Serbian) forces''
from Kosovo before a ``meaningful dialogue'' can begin.
	   ``If that is ignored, then this game with invitations to meet is
really senseless,'' he said, referring to an invitation from the
Serbian delegation to meet at government house in Pristina Tuesday
afternoon. He also said the time and pattern of negotiations should
be determined by Hill.
	   By Tuesday noon, there were no fresh reports of fighting, which
ebbed Monday, following a weekend push when Serbian forces captured
a series of key Albanian strongholds.
	   Tanjug said Monday that Serbian police ``crushed'' KLA bases in
the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all on the outskirts of
the province's second city of Pec on Sunday.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported sporadic
fighting and shooting in the border area near Junik, apparently
mop-up operations after government forces took control of the
village, formerly a major guerrilla stronghold.
	   The center also accused Serbs of setting ablaze parts of
villages from where the armed militants were purged.
	   Meanwhile, the two sides exchanged allegations of atrocities.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said an official of Rugova's
Democratic League of Kosovo died in a Pristina hospital after being
beaten by police in a prison of his hometown Urosevac, 35
kilometers (20 miles) to the south.
	   Conversely, Tanjug said the mutilated bodies of two Serb
policemen missing since July 6 were found Monday in Lodja where
government forces forced KLA rebels to retreat.
	   Another policeman, wounded in the same village July 6 but
evacuated and hospitalized, died Monday in the main military
hospital in Belgrade, it said.
	   Two other Serbian policemen were killed Sunday and Monday in
different parts of Kosovo, the pro-government Serbian Media Center
in Pristina reported.
	   The United Nations now estimates that more than 231,000 people
have been uprooted in the six months since the conflict began. Many
of them have fled across the mountainous border with Albanian,
where the KLA also maintains bases.

U.N. envoy says he couldn't change Iraq stance on inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. envoy said Tuesday that he had
failed to convince Iraq to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors and would leave Wednesday.
	   The envoy, Prakash Shah, told reporters that his next step would
be to brief the U.N. Security Council in New York on his talks this
week with Iraqi officials.
	   ``There was no change in their policy,'' Shah said.
	   Shah spoke with reporters six days after he was dispatched here
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to urge Iraqi leaders to
reverse their position on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein announced on Aug. 5 that the country
no longer would cooperate with inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission, which is headed by Richard Butler, or the International
Atomic Energy Agency, which is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing trade sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.
	   The sanctions bar air travel to and from the country and limit
the sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   Iraq has long held that it has eliminated its biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   It announced its decision against cooperation after Butler on a
visit here earlier this month said he could not certify that the
Iraqis were in compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Shah told reporters Tuesday that he met twice with Iraq's deputy
prime minister, Tariq Aziz, after his arrival last Thursday.
	   He said that during the meetings, he stressed Annan's proposal
to the U.N. Security Council that there be ``a comprehensive
review'' of the sanctions.
	   Shah also said he sent a letter on Monday to Annan to keep the
Security Council abreast of developments.
	   ``It is up to the Security Council to decide what to do next,''
Shah said.
	   Aziz on Monday briefed a cabinet meeting chaired by Saddam on
his meetings with Shah, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. It
gave no other details.
	   Annan in February defused the last crisis with Iraq, convincing
the regime to open up previously closed presidential palace
compounds to U.N. inspection.
	   The compromise Feb. 23 ended threats by the United States and
Britain to use force, if necessary, to get Iraq to cooperate.
	   U.N. Spokesman Fred Eckhard said Monday in New York that Annan
did not foresee a personal role in the current dispute.

Police arrest main suspects in killing of Peace Corps volunteer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested the two
main suspects in the killing of ten people, including a U.S. Peace
Corps volunteer, during a shooting rampage in the central
Philippines last week.
	   Ricky Braga and his cousin Feliciano Braga were found hiding
behind a kitchen wall in the house of his brother-in-law in Sara
town, Iloilo province, said Sara police chief Romaldo Bayting.
	   Bayting said officers found a hole leading to a small room where
the two men had been hiding. The hole had been covered by a large
cabinet. Officers then fired warning shots to force the two men to
come out without a fight.
	   Bayting said the Braga cousins confessed to the killings and
said one of two men already in police custody was also involved.
They said the second man, who was found to have fired a gun, was
innocent, Bayting added.
	   A group of men led by Ricky Braga and apparently drunk or high
on drugs is suspected of murdering the victims last Wednesday
	   Braga's group allegedly fired assault rifles and pistols at the
occupants of four passing vehicles. After the killing, the men
stole the victims' belongings.
	   Among those killed was Robert Bock, 33, of New York, a U.S.
Peace Corps volunteer who was working as a fishery consultant in
Concepcion, near Sara.
	   Bock, whose parents are from Virginia, was assigned to Iloilo
last year and was one of four American Peace Corps volunteers
working there, the U.S. Peace Corps office in Manila said.
	   The police earlier offered a reward of 600,000 pesos (dlrs
13,950) for the capture of the Braga cousins.
	   Iloilo is about 460 kilometers (285 miles) south of Manila.

Bosnia gears up for Euro qualifying match with Faeroe Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Entering the European Soccer
Championship qualifications for the first time in its history, the
Bosnia-Herzegovina soccer team geared up Tuesday for a match with
the Faeroe Islands.
	   Although a newcomer in the competition, Bosnia was considered a
favorite in the match, because all but one of its players are
currently participating in western European leagues or in Turkey.
	   Only the goalie, Mirsad Dedic, is playing in Bosnia and is
reported to be in great form.
	   Most expectations were being placed on the Bosnian attacking duo
coming from Germany: Hasan Salihamidzic playing for Bayern Munich
and Sergej Barbarez from Borussia Dortmund.
	   For years, Bosnia supplied good players for the Yugoslav
national team until it declared its independence in early 1992, a
move that was followed by a bloody war that lasted for 3 1/2 years.
	   ``We are a squad that still has to earn its name and rating,''
coach Dzemaludin Musovic told reporters.
	   Although the players from the Faeroe Islands are mostly
amateurs, Bosnian soccer officials said they would not be
underestimated, citing their good teamwork and physical strength.
	   The match was scheduled to start at 8.30 (1830 GMT) Wednesday in
Sarajevo's Kosevo stadium, the biggest, which was heavily damaged
during the war as some of the front-lines were only a few hundred
meters away.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally lower
Tuesday, but share prices rebounded sharply in Tokyo on the back of
a strong rally on Wall Street. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average surged 269.13 points, or 1.82 percent, to close at
15,063.79. On Monday, the average sank 329.27 points, or 2.18
percent. The U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average soared Monday
despite an announcement from the Russian government of its debt
moratorium and the devaluation of the ruble. Meanwhile, the U.S.
dollar fell against the yen after Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said Japan is ready to defend the value of the yen if
necessary. It was quoted at 145.78 yen in late-afternoon trading,
down 0.67 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 145.96. Share prices slumped in South Korea and
Indonesia, and closed slightly lower in Hong Kong. Singapore's
benchmark hit its lowest level in more than a decade. (ASIAN
MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW _ Russia's Communist Party leader calls the ruble's
devaluation the latest in a long line of failures for President
Boris Yeltsin. ``Our president has absolutely devalued himself,''
said Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who leads the largest
faction in the parliament's lower house. Yeltsin appeared to gear
down from crisis mode on Tuesday, accepting the resignation of his
longtime economic advisor, Alexander Livshits. The Interfax news
agency reported that Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Central
Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin had offered to resign, but Yeltsin
told them to stay. The government said Monday it would let the
ruble fall from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the dollar.
Russian newspapers had a mixed response, saying that it could give
a break to the battered economy and let the government pay back
wages. But they also warned it could backfire politically when
prices rise. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Russia's ruble devaluation, just a month after
promises of an additional dlrs 22.6 billion from the International
Monetary Fund, dramatically underscores the fact that the United
States and its rich allies are rapidly running out of solutions to
halt a deepening global economic crisis. U.S. officials insist the
key, as always, is for the countries in trouble to take the painful
reform steps necessary to put their economies back on track. But
critics note that, so far, more than dlrs 100 billion in bailouts
assembled by the IMF for troubled Asian nations, and the additional
support Russia received last month, have not restored confidence.
Russia has become the latest victim of a crisis that began 13
months ago in Thailand and has pushed a number of Asian countries,
including Japan, into severe recessions and rattled stock markets
from Hong Kong to New York. (RUSSIA-UNENDING CRISIS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Federal Reserve policy-makers almost
certainly won't increase interest rates this week, economists
agree, and may even cut rates by next year if the financial crises
roiling Asia, and now Russia, further erode U.S. economic health.
``I believe the Fed will eventually have to cut U.S. interest
rates, but they're not ready to do that yet,'' said economist Bruce
Steinberg of Merrill Lynch. Fed policy-makers were meeting
privately Tuesday to consider changes in the benchmark rate on
overnight loans between U.S. banks. It's been frozen at 5.5 percent
since March 1997. Labor shortages and gradually accelerating wages
have argued for an interest-rate hike, but inflation remains
contained as economic weakness spread from emerging markets in Asia
to Japan, the world's second-largest economy, and most recently to
Russia. (US-INTEREST RATES)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister warned
Tuesday that speculative attacks on developing countries were
spreading. ``The currency attack is now at dangerous and
irresponsible levels,'' said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who
has repeatedly blamed Western currency traders for triggering
Asia's financial troubles. ``I'm worried that if the attacks on
developing nations' currencies continue, the pressure will spread
to other countries that could have prevented it,'' Mahathir told a
gathering of workers to mark the country's labor day. On Monday,
Russia's government let the value of the ruble drop 34 percent.
Since Thailand devalued its baht last July, much of East Asia has
been hit with massive currency depreciations which have spread as
far as South Africa, Eastern Europe and now Russia. ``Russia has a
nuclear bomb, they may want to use it now,'' Mahathir joked.

Prime minister says government acting on cross controversy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said Tuesday
the government will try to terminate a lease for property where a
controversial cross stands near Auschwitz.
	   The cross has sparked a dispute between Poland and Israel,
inspiring conservative Catholics to erect dozens more smaller
crosses on the same site to protest efforts by Jewish groups to
have the original, larger cross removed.
	   Buzek's announcement indicated the Polish government wants to
take control of the land from a war victims' association to gain
more leverage in seeking a compromise acceptable to Jewish groups
and the Catholic church, a major power in Polish society.
	   Top church officials have condemned the smaller crosses erected
in recent weeks but want the larger cross, which was used in a 1979
Mass celebrated near Auschwitz by Pope John Paul II, to remain.
	   A newspaper report Tuesday quoted government spokesman Jaroslaw
Sellin as saying Buzek's Cabinet also wanted the smaller crosses
removed but for the papal cross to remain.
	   Buzek said the war victims' association violated a provision in
the lease that prohibited harming the church's authority. He also
said there were other violations that would allow the lease to be
terminated.
	   But Mieczyslaw Janosz, president of the war victims'
association, said Tuesday he would take the government to court if
it tried to terminate the lease.
	   Jewish groups complain the papal cross, which is eight meters
(26 feet) tall and can be seen from inside Auschwitz, violates the
memory of more than 1 million Jews killed at Auschwitz and nearby
Birkenau camps.
	   Jewish groups refused to sign a dlrs 93.5 million preservation
plan for Auschwitz this year because of the papal cross, which was
erected in 1988. In recent weeks, some Jewish leaders and the
Israeli government-funded Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in
Jerusalem formally complained to Poland's government about the
smaller crosses at the site.
	   The papal cross honors 152 Poles killed by the Nazis in 1941 on
property bordering Auschwitz that later became a Carmelite nunnery.
Polish-born Pope John Paul asked the nuns to leave the site in 1993
in response to Jewish protests, but the nuns leased the land for 30
years to a Polish war victims' association before moving about a
kilometer (half-mile) away.
	   Cardinal Jozef Glemp and other Polish church leaders have
criticized the additional crosses near the papal cross as
provocations by irresponsible people. But they defend the papal
cross as an appropriate symbol honoring Polish martyrdom.
	   Church leaders will meet later this month to discuss the issue.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Denying that he committed perjury and stopping
short of admitting to sex with Monica Lewinsky, President Bill
Clinton says he nonetheless takes responsibility for a relationship
that was ``wrong,'' and believes it is time to move on. But some
congressional critics weren't satisfied and bridled at Clinton's
attack on special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, who, sources say, may
try to force the president to give fuller answers in a second grand
jury appearance. During his testimony Monday, Clinton refused to
answer specific questions about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,
a former White House intern. Then, he told the nation that Starr's
investigation had gone on too long. ``This matter is between me,
the two people I love most _ my wife and our daughter _ and our
God,'' Clinton said. (US-CLINTON-INVESTIGATION)
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ With all 28 victims finally
identified and five suspects in custody, the family of a mother and
young daughter killed in a terrorist car bombing prepared to say
goodbye Tuesday in the first in a long line of funerals.
Thirty-year-old Avril Monaghan, pregnant with twins, and her
18-month-old daughter Maura were to be buried Tuesday. British
Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote in two Belfast newspapers Tuesday
that meeting the hospitalized bombing victims reinforced his
resolve to continue the peace process. At dawn Monday, police
arrested five suspects in the attack including 19-year-old Shane
Mackey, the son of a leading critic of April's peace agreement. No
information was released about the suspects, believed to be members
of the ``Real IRA,'' made up of defectors from the Irish Republican
Army. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With electricity out and a rebel army
advancing on the capital, state radio cranked up a generator
Tuesday and urged government soldiers to regroup at a Kinshasa
military base. The call comes amid reports that one of President
Laurent Kabila's most important battalions has defected to the
rebel side. After weekend meetings with Angolan President Jose
Eduardo Dos Santos, Kabila briefly returned to Kinshasa, his
embattled capital, to continue rallying support against an
advancing rebel army. In recent weeks, Kabila has been traipsing
from Cuba to southern Congo to Angola looking for friends to help
hold off the rebels _ an army of his former Rwandan allies, ethnic
Tutsi fighters and disaffected members of the president's own

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Rather than explicitly encouraging
inspectors to try to search suspected weapons sites now banned by
Iraq, the U.N. Security Council has merely voiced its ``full
support'' for the arms experts' mandate. The council's decision
Monday puts the onus back on inspectors to decide whether to try to
test Iraqi resolve in enforcing its inspections ban _ a thorny
decision that could lead to a renewed confrontation with Baghdad.
Iraq froze cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Aug. 5 after the
chief inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Baghdad
had destroyed its weapons of mass destruction. U.N. inspectors must
make that certification before the Security Council will lift
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the Gulf war. (UN-IRAQ)
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright prepared to pay tribute Tuesday to bombing victims in East
Africa, demonstrating American solidarity and promising to track
down the perpetrators. Officials in Kenya and Tanzania also hoped
she would announce new aid to their countries, where the Aug. 7
terrorist blasts killed 257 people. FBI agents and Kenyan police
investigating the attacks said Monday that a suspect who was
returned from Pakistan had not admitted any role in the crimes or
implicated anyone else after three days. That appeared to conflict
with reports out of Pakistan, where the man was apprehended, which
said suspect Mohammed Saddiq Odeh had confessed and named his
co-conspirators. (EMBASSY BOMBINGS)

U.N. envoy says he couldn't change Iraq stance on inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. envoy said Tuesday that he failed to
convince Iraq to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
and would leave Wednesday.
	   The envoy, Prakash Shah, told reporters that his next step would
be to brief the U.N. Security Council in New York of his talks this
week with Iraqi officials.
	   ``There was no change in their policy,'' Shah said.
	   Shah spoke with reporters six days after he was dispatched here
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to urge Iraqi leaders to
reverse their position on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein announced on Aug. 5 that the country
no longer would cooperate with inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission, which is headed by Richard Butler, or the International
Atomic Energy Agency, which is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing trade sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.
	   The sanctions bar air travel to and from the country and limit
the sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   Iraq has long held that it has eliminated its biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   It announced its decision against cooperation after Butler on a
visit here earlier this month said he could not certify that the
Iraqis were in compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Shah told reporters Tuesday that he met twice with Iraq's deputy
prime minister, Tariq Aziz, after his arrival last Thursday.
	   He said that during the meetings, he stressed Annan's proposal
to the U.N. Security Council that there be ``a comprehensive
review'' of the sanctions.
	   Shah also said he sent a letter on Monday to Annan to keep the
Security Council abreast of developments.
	   ``It is up to the Security Council'' to decide what to do next,
Shah said.
	   Aziz on Monday briefed a cabinet meeting chaired by Saddam on
his meetings with Shah, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. It
gave no other details.
	   Annan in February defused the last crisis with Iraq, convincing
the regime to open up previously closed presidential palace
compounds to U.N. inspection.
	   The compromise Feb. 23 ended threats by the United States and
Britain to use force, if necessary, to get Iraq to cooperate.
	   U.N. Spokesman Fred Eckhard said Monday in New York that Annan
did not foresee a personal role in the current dispute.
	   The Security Council on Monday voiced its ``full support'' for
the U.N. inspectors but did not explicitly urge them to resume spot
inspections.
	   Such inspections have been suspended since Saddam's Aug. 5
directive, although long-term monitoring of previously identified
weapons sites continues.

Northern Ireland buries first victims of terrorist strike

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Requiem Mass for mother and child; new color and

 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AUGHER, Northern Ireland (AP) _ In a stone church on a hill in
this tiny village overwhelmed with grief, Requiem Mass was said
Tuesday for a mother and her young daughter _ the first in a long
line of funerals for 28 victims of a terrorist car bombing.
	   The coffins of 30-year-old Avril Monaghan, pregnant with twins,
and her 18-month-old daughter Maura made the short trip from the
family home down a tree-lined lane flanked by mourners in total
silence. The mother's brown wooden casket dwarfed the small white
one in the flower-laden black hearse.
	   In St. Macarten's Catholic church, the congregation, which
included Mrs. Monaghan's husband, Michael, and their three other
young children, sang, ``My soul is longing for your peace.'' Men
and women, their heads bowed, stood among gravestones outside
listening to the service.
	   The Monaghans and Mrs. Monaghan's mother, Mary Grimes, 65, were
slain in the carnage in Omagh, 15 miles (24 kms) from here, when a
500-pound (200-kg) car bomb exploded Saturday. Most of the victims
of the worst atrocity in three decades of sectarian conflict in
Northern Ireland were women and children.
	   At dawn Monday, police arrested five people in connection with
the attack, suspected to be the work of the ``Real IRA.'' The group
comprises defectors from the Irish Republican Army opposed to
April's peace agreement providing for power-sharing between
Protestants and Catholics in this British province.
	   Under British anti-terrorist law, the five can be interrogated
for up to a week before being released or charged.
	   The Rev. James Grimes, one of the priests who celebrated the
Mass and who is Mrs. Monaghan's uncle, prayed that the Omagh
tragedy ``would be the last of the terrible agonies our people have
suffered over the past 30 years.''
	   ``Her faith was strong,'' he said of his niece. ``That faith
always showed in the smile and the happiness and the care and the
love of Avril.''
	   On Monday night, the Irish Republic town of Buncrana almost came
to a standstill as the hearses bearing the coffins of three local
boys killed in the bombing _ James Barker, 12, Sean McLoughlin, 11,
and Oran Doherty, 8.
	   The British and Irish prime ministers have pledged their utmost
to convict the bombers, and some politicians are calling for
internment without trial for suspects.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who met some of the 220
people injured in the blast, wrote in two Northern Ireland
newspapers Tuesday that the province's police chief, Ronnie
Flanagan, had told him the IRA was not responsible for the bomb,
and there was no evidence that IRA explosives were used.
	   ``I just can't get out of my head the pain, the suffering that
is going on,'' Mo Mowlam, Britain's top official in Northern
Ireland said after touring the destruction in Omagh on Monday
night.
	   Mowlam spent hours in talks Monday with police officials from
both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, grappling with how to
foil any further such deadly attacks.
	   After the session, she announced increased army and police
deployments along the border between the two states, but refused to
reveal other details.
	   Asked if both governments were discussing whether to change
their laws so that Real IRA suspects could be convicted simply on
testimony from anti-terrorist detectives, Mowlam said: ``You're in
the right ballpark.''
	   The suspects arrested included Shane Mackey, 19, son of an Omagh
councilman, Francis Mackey, a leading critic of the support by the
IRA and its political ally, Sinn Fein, of the April accord because
it does not provide for a united Ireland.
	   Mackey, reelected last year while still a member of Sinn Fein,
now aligns himself with the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, a
group opposed to the peace agreement. It is led by Bernadette
Sands-McKevitt, sister of the martyred IRA hunger striker Bobby
Sands _ and common-law wife of the Real IRA's reputed commander.
	   Talk of politics was markedly absent in many of the towns across
Northern Ireland that numbered residents among the victims. More
than 100 people remained hospitalized, including 11 in critical
condition. Nine children died, and a number of people were blinded
or crippled.
	   ``People are suffering in shock,'' said Gordon McLaren, a
shopkeeper in Augher. ``Has anyone talked of politics? No, they
have not.''

Myanmar university students sit for belated exams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Thousands of university students began
taking long-delayed final exams Tuesday, more than two years after
their education was interrupted by government-ordered school
closings.
	   Showing that the government is still nervous about the
possibility of political unrest when students gather, the exams
were given in the students' respective hometowns rather than at
their university or college campuses.
	   All universities and colleges in Yangon and the country's second
biggest city, Mandalay, were closed indefinitely in December 1996
after student unrest.
	   Educational institutions in other parts of the country,
unaffected by the unrest, continued their classes and held their
1997 final examinations. They did not, however, reopen for the
following school year.
	   No soldiers or riot police are visible at the test centers for
arts and sciences students Tuesday morning. Only traffic police and
several local ward elders on security duty were seen at the schools
which served as university exam centers.
	   Most of the examinations for technical schools took place
earlier this month at their respective campuses. Examinations at
the Yangon Institute of Technology, the engineering college which
was the hot spot of student unrest, were held early this month
without any incident.
	   Major student demonstrations which took place in 1988 and 1996
started at the institute.
	   There were more than 374,000 students attending arts and
sciences colleges and universities, and about 4,300 at the
technical institutes, including medical, dentistry, and engineering
colleges, before the closures, according to official statistics.
	   The government is extremely cautious about giving students
freedom of expression, fearful they may align themselves with the
pro-democracy movement of 1991 Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu
Kyi.
	   Students have spearheaded most political protest movements in
Myanmar _ also called Burma _ since before World War II, when it
was a British colony.

Military investigators finish questioning Suharto's son-in-law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with human rights activist saying he believes 14
missing activists are dead. Single name for Wiranto is correct.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Military investigators on Tuesday
wrapped up questioning of a son-in-law of former President Suharto
who is suspected in the kidnapping and torture of political
activists.
	   A seven-member military panel has been investigating Lt. Gen.
Prabowo Subianto about the abductions of dozens of anti-Suharto
activists in the months before his father-in-law quit in May amid
riots and protests.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions.
	   Investigators questioned Prabowo and two other senior officers
on Tuesday, said Lt. Gen. Djamari Chaniago, secretary-general of
the investigative panel known as the ``honor council.''
	   The council will present a report to Gen. Wiranto, the armed
forces chief, in the next couple of days, he said.
	   The head of the inquiry, Gen. Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, has
reportedly said he will recommend that Prabowo be court-martialled.
	   Prabowo rose fast through the ranks while Suharto was in power,
but his career suddenly stalled when the former leader ended his
32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Prabowo, 46, has since been the target of numerous allegations
of wrongdoing, the most serious relating to the abductions that
were allegedly carried out by troops under his command in
Indonesia's special forces, known as Kopassus.
	   Investigators have already arrested 10 special forces troops,
alleging they were involved in the kidnapping of more than two
dozen activists in 1997 and earlier this year.
	   Fourteen people remain missing and human rights activists
believe they are dead.
	   The Berita Buana newspaper on Tuesday quoted Munir, head of the
Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, as saying the missing activists
likely died in military custody. Military investigators have said
they don't know where the activists are.
	   Those that have been released said they were abducted, tortured
and questioned about their political activities. Prabowo was in
charge of the special forces at the time.

British inflation drops, nearing government's target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British inflation dipped to an annual rate of 2.6
percent last month, drawing close to the government's thus-far
elusive target of 2.5 percent, officials said Tuesday.
	   The underlying inflation rate in July compared with an annual
rate of 2.8 percent in June.
	   The chief secretary of the Treasury, Stephen Byers, said the
latest numbers show that the Labor government of Prime Minister
Tony Blair is on course for lowering inflation to the target level.
	   ``At a time of instability in the international economy, our own
economy is on track for economic stability which will see inflation
at its target level and sustainable growth,'' Byers said.
	   But opposition lawmakers pointed out that the inflation target
has not yet been achieved. They warned that for the near future,
interest rates are likely to stay higher than businesses and
mortgage holders would like.
	   In its efforts to keep inflation from spinning out of control,
Britain has raised interest rates six times since the Labor
government took office in May 1997.
	   That has strengthened the value of the British pound, dealing
harsh blows to British manufacturers and exporters, who now find it
difficult to price their goods competitively in foreign markets.

Tutu says blacks more reconciliatory than whites in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu,
who spent the last two years seeking racial reconciliation for
South Africa, on Monday said whites should be grateful they have
escaped violent revenge from blacks.
	   Speaking in an SABC radio interview, Tutu chided whites for
pouting over lost privilege and being unwilling to bridge the
racial gap.
	   ``It's an incredible thing that has happened, that (blacks) who
still live in shacks, squalor and poverty, come to work in your
beautiful homes, and they don't say, `We're going to murder all of
you in your beds,' '' Tutu said.
	   Tutu is wrapping up the first phase of his work as chairman of
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a panel that investigated
apartheid era crimes. The panel will continue to consider amnesty
applications over the next year.
	   Tutu on Wednesday was to travel to Atlanta to begin a year-long
sabbatical teaching at Emory University, but will return to present
the panel's report to President Nelson Mandela in October.
	   During Monday's interview, Tutu referred to a survey that showed
80 percent of blacks believed racial reconciliation was possible,
while only 20 percent of whites, mixed race and Asians _ the
``beneficiaries of apartheid'' _ believed the same.
	   ``I think that many white people can't actually bear to know
that they got benefits and privileges'' through the secret, brutal
policy of the apartheid government, Tutu said.
	   He said whites can no longer say _ as many Germans did after
Nazi rule _ they didn't know the truth.
	   ``They have been let down by their white leadership, who have
not in fact said, `How do we integrate this about ourselves, so
that we can come through this valley and emerge on the other side
as a stronger people?' '' Tutu said.
	   In recent years, some Afrikaners have apologized for apartheid.
But the official line of the National Party that ruled during
apartheid has been to express remorse for the pain and injustice
caused by apartheid, but not for the policy itself.
	   Tutu said he saw positive signs for reconciliation in events
like an international rugby game in Durban last weekend, when white
rugby players ``who used to be such nasties'' were singing the
Xhosa language words to the national anthem, Nkosi Sekelele.
	   Tutu, a leader in the anti-apartheid struggle for decades before
1994, said he needed a break from the pressure.
	   ``It's actually finding time to reflect. It's finding time also
to be able to cry, without too many people being aware of it,''
Tutu said.

Unemployment increases to 4.8 percent

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In the latest blow to Hong Kong's foundering
economy, the government announced Tuesday that unemployment rose to
an estimated 4.8 percent, a 15-year high, in the last three months.
	   The figure, announced in the midst of continued economic
turbulence, was in line with what most analysts were predicting.
However, some estimate it could go as high as 10 percent in coming
months.
	   Announcing figures for the May-July period, government officials
also lowered the unemployment figure for April through June by 0.1
percentage points from their original estimate of 4.5 percent. The
latest increase was attributed to the overall regional downturn and
the entry of recent graduates into the labor pool, said government
economist K. Y. Tang.
	   Already in recession, Hong Kong has seen the value of its main
stock index fall drastically this month. On Friday, the government
intervened heavily in both stock and futures markets to fight off
speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar's fixed peg to the U.S.
dollar.
	   About 161,000 people were estimated unemployed in the three
month period and another 88,000 people, or 2.6 percent of the
workforce, were estimated to be underemployed.
	   The economy shrank 2.8 percent in the first three months of the
year, and is expected to continue contracting, worsening
unemployment.
	   Analysts said the increased unemployment figures already were
factored into weak stock prices and may not have a major effect.
The Hang Seng Index, the main measure of Hong Kong's blue-chip
stocks, closed slightly down on Tuesday before the unemployment
figures were announced.
	   If unemployment continues to rise, it could test the
government's commitment to its pegged currency, analysts say. High
unemployment could present the government with a political impetus
to scrap the fixed currency system.
	   Interest rates are one of the main tools Hong Kong's currency
board uses to maintain the fixed peg to the U.S. dollar. However,
high interest rates hurt the banking and property sectors and
ultimately translate into a credit crunch, forcing companies to lay
off employees.
	   The construction, import-export, retail, restaurant and business
service sectors again were hit particularly hard, officials said.
	   The increase in unemployment this year largely has been the
result of external factors, such as a sharp decline in tourism.
However, domestic problems such as a cash flow shortage could
follow next year, pushing unemployment up to around 9 percent,
economists say.
	   Government officials remain confident that once the regional
financial situation stabilizes, Hong Kong will bounce back.
	   ``Hong Kong is going through a painful economic adjustment and
consolidation process brought on largely by the regional financial
turmoil,'' said Acting Secretary for Education and Manpower Matthew
Cheung Kin-Chung. ``However, we must not go into despair. Our
economy has been adjusting efficiently.''
	   The government reiterated its measures to step up training for
the unemployed, to create 40,000 new jobs over the next one and a
half years, and to provide 2.5 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs
321.8 million) in loans to small- and medium-sized businesses.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has squandered his
credibility by allowing the ruble to take a dive, the leader of the
parliament opposition said Tuesday.
	   ``Our president has absolutely devalued himself,'' said
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who leads the largest faction in
the parliament's lower house.
	   He said the ruble devaluation announced Monday is the latest in
a long line of Yeltsin failures, and repeated his call for mass
protests and the president's resignation. His previous calls have
triggered little response.
	   Yeltsin appeared to gear down from crisis mode on Tuesday,
accepting the resignation of his long-time economic advisor,
Alexander Livshits. Other personnel changes were not likely
immediately, his spokesman said.
	   The Interfax news agency reported that Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko and Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin had offered to
resign, but Yeltsin told them to stay.
	   The moves followed the announcement Monday that the government
would permit the price of the ruble to fall by a third _ from about
6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the dollar _ an effective devaluation
which Yeltsin had repeatedly pledged to avoid.
	   Russian newspapers had a mixed response, saying that it could
give a break to the battered economy and let the government pay off
its months-long wage arrears. But they also warned it could
backfire on Yeltsin politically when prices begin to rise.
	   ``We woke up in another country _ one standing on the eve of
price rises, deficit, cuts in import and black currency market,''
said the business daily Kommersant.
	   Many commentators assailed Yeltsin for putting himself in an
embarrassing position by denying that devaluation was on the agenda
just days before the move.
	   ``If Yeltsin had set a deliberate goal to undermine his own
prestige, he couldn't have invented anything better than to pledge
there would be no devaluation three days before it happened,'' said
the daily Russky Telegraf.
	   The government pledged to control the ruble's decline, and it
sank to 6.89 to the dollar on the Central Bank-controlled Moscow
currency exchange from 6.43 on Monday.
	   The larger and more important interbank currency market remained
frozen Tuesday. Russian commercial banks, many of whom face a
liquidity crisis, have suspended trading since last week.
	   The more sensitive street rate, which on Monday immediately
plunged to the bottom of the government-set band, fluctuated
between 8 and 10 rubles to the dollar at exchange booths around
Moscow. Demand was low as people waited for the ruble to stabilize
at a higher level.
	   Nonetheless, most banks were not paying out on dollar accounts,
and depositors were asked to fill out a form and come back in
several days. Bank managers said the Central Bank had limited their
ability to buy dollars in an effort to stem the run on the ruble.
	   Many customers were exasperated.
	   ``I trust the bank but I don't trust the government,'' said
depositor Lyudmila Sergeyeva as she stood in line at a downtown
office of a leading Russian commercial bank. ``The government has
spent its last credit of trust.''
	   Meanwhile, business continued as usual in Moscow stores, which
have mostly kept their price tags unchanged.
	   However, Kommersant said customers were emptying shelves in some
Russian cities and there was high demand for dollars in certain
regions even at the higher rates.
	   Analysts said consumer prices would rise over a number of weeks
as stores sell off their current inventories. The higher prices are
expected to deal a painful blow to the population because imports
account for a huge share of Russia's consumer market, including
more than half the food sold in stores.

Nigerian military ruler meets Abiola's family
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military ruler, on a
crowd-pleasing three-day visit to the southwest of the country,
stopped to pay his respects at the home of the late opposition
leader Moshood Abiola, whose death last month shook the country.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar was received at Abiola's palatial
mansion Monday by his eldest son, Kola.
	   Abubakar described Abiola's death as ``unfortunate,'' occurring
on the eve of an order for his release by the military government.
	   ``May his family remain united and may the almighty God continue
to bless this family,'' Abubakar told the family.
	   Abiola, Nigeria's most famous political prisoner, died July 7
while meeting a group of U.S. officials who were visiting him in
custody.
	   The timing of his death _ a month after the death of Abubakar's
predecessor dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, spawned numerous conspiracy
theories in Nigeria and triggered rioting that claimed dozens of
lives.
	   Results of an independent autopsy, conducted by an international
team of physicians, said Abiola died of natural causes, but his
family and supporters have said they still hold the military
responsible for his death.
	   Monday's visit was cordial, however, and Abiola's family thanked
him warmly for his visit, national radio reported.
	   Cheering crowds have been the order of the day for Nigeria's
military ruler since he began his three-day visit to the southwest
of the country Saturday _ the first by a Nigerian military ruler in
four years.
	   The southwest is home to Nigeria's pro-democracy movement and
anti-military sentiment there has been traditionally the strongest
in the country.
	   On Monday, while visiting the nation's largest army division in
Ibadan, Abubakar urged his soldiers to stand by his plan to return
the west African country to civilian rule.
	   ``We must not shrink in this responsibility. Your duty is to
ensure that this date is kept,'' he said.
	   He also announced impending salary increases for the armed
forces, police and other workers.
	   Abubakar was expected to visit the eastern city of Enugu
Tuesday, before returning to the capital Abuja.

Four African diplomats to meet with rebel leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Four African diplomats arrived in this
eastern Congolese town Tuesday to meet with rebel leaders opposed
to President Laurent Kabila to determine whether Rwanda and Uganda
have violated Congo's borders and are helping the rebels.
	   ``We're here to find out whether this is an invasion or an
internal insurgency,'' Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge
told reporters. ``We'll submit our finding to the (African) heads
of state.''
	   The group was expected to meet with self-styled rebel commander
Jean-Pierre Ondekane as well as civilian figures in the rebellion
who have just set up the Congolese Democratic Coalition.
	   Mudenge said the team, representing the Organization of African
Unity as well as the 13-nation Southern African Development
Community, had already met with Uganda and Rwandan leaders and
President Laurent Kabila in Kinshasa.
	   Mudenge and his colleagues from Zambia, Namibia and Tanzania
were also trying to find a peaceful solution to crisis, he said.
	   ``We don't think it is too late for a peaceful solution.
Otherwise we wouldn't be here,'' Mudenge said without elaborating.

China's announcement of aid to Indonesia sparks protest in Hong
</HEADLINE>
Kong &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A prominent politician on Tuesday urged China
to withhold an aid package it has promised to Indonesia until those
responsible for May violence against ethnic Chinese are
apprehended.
	   Christine Loh of the Citizens Party urged Beijing to impose
sanctions and withhold the U.S. dlrs 3 million in medicine and U.S.
dlrs 200 million in export credits promised to Indonesia until
rioters who assaulted ethnic Chinese are punished.
	   Outrage over the May attacks has galvanized ethnic Chinese
worldwide, sparking protests outside Indonesia's representative
offices abroad.
	   Following repeated calls to punish the rioters, Beijing
announced the aid package on Saturday to help prevent Indonesia's
recession from spawning a public health crisis. Doctors warn
Indonesia's economic slump _ the worst in 30 years _ could bring
new outbreaks of disease with millions of newly poor unable to
afford basic medicines.
	   In a petition presented to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Loh also called for an independent U.N. investigation into
the looting of Chinese-owned businesses and rape of ethnic Chinese
women.
	   ``We believe that the Indonesian government must take immediate
measures to protect the rights of Chinese Indonesians,'' the
petition said.
	   Many victims of the May riots which toppled President Suharto
were ethnic Chinese, targeted for their relative wealth and made
scapegoats for Indonesia's economic disaster. Hundreds of Chinese
homes and business were attacked and burned by rampaging mobs.
	   About 1,200 people are estimated to have been killed in the
rioting. Women's rights groups estimate that at least 160 women and
girls were raped.
	   Jakarta's announcement of heightened security during Indonesia's
Independence Day on Aug. 17 has done little to dispel rumors of
possible renewed attacks against the ethnic Chinese.
	   Loh urged the Hong Kong government to extend more flexible
immigration laws to Chinese Indonesians wishing to stay in Hong
Kong ``until they feel safe and free'' to return to Indonesia.
	   On Monday, more than 100 students defied a police ban and
gathered outside Indonesia's embassy in Beijing. Separately, a
group of Chinese women put up placards in a hotel to accusing the
Chinese government of reacting faintheartedly to the atrocities.
	   Indonesian President B. J. Habibie reportedly has ordered
Indonesian officials to ask intelligence officers from China,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and the United States to take part in an official
investigation into the rapes.

ADB approves dlrs 140 million China railway project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Asian Development Bank on Tuesday
approved a dlrs 140 million loan to partly fund the construction of
a railway in Guizhou province in China.
	   The railway in Guizhou, one of China's poorest provinces, is
expected to produce jobs and improve the living conditions of more
than 92,000 persons living in the project area, the Manila-based
bank said.
	   Over 20,000 new jobs are expected to be created with the
construction of the 121-kilometer (75-mile) railway, which will
improve access to the province, it said.
	   The railway will also be used to transport good quality coal
from Guizhou, which is estimated to have coal reserves of up to
five billion tons.
	   The ADB loan will finance 37 per cent of the dlrs 381 million
project cost. The loan is repayable over 25 years incluyding a
five-year grace period at an interest rate determined according to
the bank's pool-based variable lending rate system.
	   The balance will be financed by China's Guizhou Shuibai Railway
Corp. and the State Development Bank.

 &UR; Myanmar government holds talks with senior opposition figure
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with confirmation of meeting from
opposition; edits and adds details thruout

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar _ The chairman of the opposition party of
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi held a meeting Tuesday with a
top member of Myanmar's ruling junta, government and opposition
sources said.
	   Details of the meeting between Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt and Aung Shwe
were not available, but the event is significant because it might
mark a breakthrough in efforts to begin a dialogue between the
government and the National League for Democracy, the country's
main pro-democracy force.
	   Friends and critics alike of the military regime have been
urging it to open a dialogue with Suu Kyi's party, arguing that
talks were needed to break the country's political deadlock.
	   Tuesday's meeting came as Suu Kyi remained encamped for a
seventh day on a road outside the capital, protesting a government
ban on her traveling to meet supporters in the countryside.
	   The league has declined previous invitations this year to meet
with the government because Suu Kyi had not been invited.
	   The party's position was that the government should not dictate
who should represent it in a dialogue.
	   In Bangkok, Thailand, Thai Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kobsak
Chutikul described news of the meeting as ``very encouraging.''
	   The military in Myanmar _ also called Burma _ seized power in
1988 and held an election in 1990 which resulted in a landslide
victory by Suu Kyi's party.
	   But the military refused to let parliament be seated and stepped
up repression of members of the National League for Democracy and
other dissident figures.
	   A news release from the government received in Bangkok said
officials described Tuesday's talks as ``the first in a series of
meetings,'' and that participants described the talks as``open,
frank and cordial.''
	   The league's own brief announcement of the talks, released in
Yangon, noted only that Aung Shwe had met Khin Nyint for an hour
Tuesday afternoon and gave no details or characterization of their
talks.
	   The opposition party has described the government's previous
efforts at discussions with them as insincere.
	   ``We hope this is the first in a series of confidence building
talks between the government and the NLD,'' Khin Nyunt was quoted
in the government news release as saying. ``We have had a fruitful
meeting and we also have appreciated the NLD's acceptance of our
offer of a meeting.''
	   It said the meeting was also attended by Lt.-Gen. Win Myint, a
junior member of the ruling State Peace and Development Council,
Chief Justice Aung Toe and Attorney General Tha Tun.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Europe's fastest men went into early
action at the European Championship and Charalambos Papadias of
Greece led the favorites into the second round of the 100-meter
dash Tuesday.
	   As the six-day event opened, Papadias clocked the fastest time
in the first round of 100-meter qualifying, cruising home in 10.27
seconds.
	   Other favorites also advanced, in slow times on a hot and sunny
morning in the Hungarian capital.
	   They included Norway's Geir Moen (10.38) and Anninos Marcoulides
of Cyprus (10.38). But the Cypriot, who is second in Europe this
year with a 10.12, was only third in his heat, behind Marcin Nowak
of Poland (10.35) and Stefano Tilli of Italy, 10.37.
	   Stephane Diagana of France, the 400-meter hurdles world
champion, cleared the first round of qualifying by winning his heat
in 49.28.
	   Carlos Silva of Portugal led all qualifiers with a time of
49.00. His heat 3 turned out to be the fastest, with three other
runners beating Diagana's time.
	   Ruslan Mashchenko of Russia, who has the fastest time in Europe
this year of 48.06, won his heat to advance in a relatively slow
50.30.
	   In the men's shot put, all the favorites moved into the final
later Tuesday, with Oleksandr Bagach of Ukraine leading the field
with a heave of 20.47 meters. He was followed by Dragan Peric of
Yugoslavia at 20.44. Peric leads the European lists with 21.77 this
year, also the second best result in the world.
	   In minor upsets, Victor Bulat of Belarus and Mark Proctor of
Britain both failed to have a valid attempt and did not qualify.
	   In the women's javelin, the golden Finnish duo of Trine
Hattestad and Heli Rantanen moved into the final without pushing
themselves.
	   Hattestad, the world champion, had a throw of 62.55 meters,
while Rantanen, the Olympic champion, had 60.90.
	   Steffi Nerius of Germany led the field with 66.04.
	   In addition to the men's shot put, two other finals were later
in the day: the men's 20K walk and the men's 10,000, where Spanish
and Portuguese runners were expected to battle for the medals.
	   The quadrennial event is suffering from a lack of major stars.
	   The most notable absentees are Sergey Bubka, the Ukrainian world
record holder in the pole vault and a six-time world champion, and
Marie Jose-Perec, the 200 and 400-meter Olympic champion from
France.
	   It may fall to a Kenyan to provide some glitter to the
championship.
	   Wilson Kipketer is now a Danish citizen, but he was born in
Kenya.
	   Kipketer, the 800-meter world champion and world record-holder,
is eager to perform well at his first European championship as a
Danish citizen.
	   The field includes more than 1,300 athletes from 44 countries
with Germany fielding the largest team (123) followed by France
(103), Russia (101), Italy (83), Hungary (80) and Spain (76).

Iran does not intend to control Brunei, says Iranian envoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BAGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Iran's ambassador on Tuesday
dismissed allegations that ``shadowy'' Iranian diplomats were
trying to wrest control of the tiny oil-rich kingdom of Brunei.
	   ``I have not heard anything about the presence of any Iranian as
advisers or assistants with the Brunei Government,'' Iranian
ambassador Javad Ansari said.
	   ``The Iranian foreign policy is based on non-interference in the
internal affairs of other countries,'' Ansari said, observing that
both countries enjoyed a very good and cordial relationship with
each other.
	   The envoy was reacting to recent claims by an estranged brother
of the nation's ruler, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, that conservative
forces backed by Iranian foreign advisers were tightening their
grip on Brunei.
	   Prince Jefri Bolkiah, who now lives in self-exile, made these
charges earlier this month. He was dismissed by the sultan after
the company he controlled, Amedeo, posted losses amounting to dlrs
16 billion.
	   Last month, the family rift widened when the sultan dismissed
Jefri as chairman of the powerful Brunei Investment Agency, which
puts the sultanate's oil riches into hotels, banks, businesses and
U.S. Treasury bonds.
	   The Iranian ambassador refuted Jefri's allegations.
	   ``I am certain that His Majesty the Sultan, being a meritorious
and wise ruler would not require any Iranian advisers or
assistants,'' he added.
	   About 70 percent of Brunei's 300,000 people are Sunni Muslims,
whereas Iranians are predominantly Shiites.

Former Tiananmen student leaders appeal for colleague's release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two leaders of the Tiananmen Square democracy
movement have asked Chinese authorities to release a colleague
arrested last month for forming an opposition party, a rights group
reported Tuesday.
	   In an open letter to prosecutors, Ma Shaofang and Yang Tao
contended Wang Youcai openly and legally tried to register the
China Democracy Party, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   ``This was not a conspiracy to incite, much less a subversion of
government power,'' the Information Center quoted the letter as
saying.
	   Wang was formally charged two weeks ago with subversion, a crime
China has used in the past three years to prosecute high-profile
dissidents.
	   Wang and two other democracy campaigners announced the party's
formation on June 25, the day U.S. President Bill Clinton began a
nine-day China tour. In mid-July, a week after Clinton's departure,
Chinese police detained Wang and 11 others in connection with the
party. Only Wang remains in custody.
	   In their letter, Ma Shaofang and Yang Tao pointed out that
Wang's arrest is inconsistent with Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
pledge, repeated to Clinton, that China will sign a major U.N.
human rights document this fall.
	   They also noted that China needs more public supervision of
authorities if the government hopes to continue the successes of
its 20-year-old economic reform drive. Wang's China Democracy Party
was an attempt to push forward that supervision, they said.
	   Wang, Ma and Yang were all student organizers of the massive
democracy demonstrations that clogged Beijing's Tiananmen Square
for seven weeks in 1989. After the military quelled the protests,
all three were put on a list of 21 most-wanted organizers, captured
and jailed for up to 34 months.
	   Ma and Yang urged Chinese leaders not to try to settle scores
left over from the 1989 movement by prosecuting Wang.

Yeltsin Communist opponents try to take advantage of ruble fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's Communist opponents scrambled
Tuesday to take political advantage of the ruble devaluation,
calling for dismissing the president, taking power, and rewriting
Russia's constitution.
	   ``We propose ... a complete overhaul of the whole government
structure, starting with Yeltsin's resignation and up to amending
the constitution and exercising control over the executive power at
all levels,'' Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said.
	   Zyuganov reiterated his call for mass protests to back the
demands. He has been making such appeals for years, and his
previous calls have triggered little response.
	   Communist opposition in parliament has been seeking for months
to impeach Yeltsin, accusing him of instigating Soviet collapse.
The campaign started long before Russia's latest, unfolding
financial crisis.
	   Yeltsin's opponents in parliament are likely to step up that
campaign while postponing action on the government's crisis program
_ measures that Russia's lenders have demanded in order to continue
paying out on loans.
	   The parliament's lower house, the State Duma, was scheduled to
hold a special session later this week to review the government's
austerity package. But Zyuganov indicated that the Communists _
parliament's largest faction _ may try instead to use the session
to push for ousting the president.
	   ``The situation cannot be resolved through purely economic
measures,'' Zyuganov said. ``We will demand the resignation of
Yeltsin, and the formation of a new government.''
	   Zyuganov refused to say what he would do to stabilize Russia's
economy if he were in charge, saying only that his ``specific
measures'' for resolving the crisis are ousting Yeltsin and forming
a Communist-led government.
	   As the ruble plunged, some people tried to withdraw deposits
made in U.S. dollars. But despite their concern over the
devaluation, few expressed support for Zyuganov and the Communists.
	   ``What else can he say other than that he wants power?'' said a
woman who only gave her first name, Irina.

Spain denies allegations that its sports doctors encourage doping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government Tuesday angrily denied
allegations by the International Olympic Committee's anti-doping
chief that Spanish sports physicians encourage athletes to take
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   ``Under no circumstances will we allow the good name of Spain's
athletics federations and athletes to be smeared,'' said Deputy
Secretary of State for Sports Eduardo Ayuso.
	   The government will send the head of the IOC medical commission,
Prince Alexandre de Merode, a letter demanding that he explain his
comments about drugs in Spanish sports, Ayuso said.
	   De Merode said in Monday's edition of the French newspaper Le
Figaro that some Spanish doctors have ``rejected the ethics of
their profession.''
	   ``One must not forget that Spanish sports, for a long time, has
had tendencies toward doping,'' he was quoted as saying. ``A
president of the Spanish athletics federation has even been
excluded because he refused to select athletes who hadn't taken
doping substances.''
	   Ayuso said Spanish sports officials are mystified by these
remarks.
	   ``We simply do not understand why he said this,'' said Ayuso,
who heads Spain's anti-doping commission. ``In Spain the fight
against drugs in sports has been growing for years.''
	   He said the national testing laboratory was internationally
respected, and through bilateral agreements served as the official
testing facility for a number of countries, such as Portugal,
Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela.
	   De Merode for his part was responding to comments by IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who is Spanish, proposing a
reduction in the list of banned drugs.
	   Ayuso said the IOC official had misconstrued Samaranch's
comments, which came in an interview with a Spanish newspaper.
	   Ayuso said what Samaranch apparently is seeking is to update the
list by eliminating substances that athletes used to take to boost
their performance but which are now outdated and rarely used.
	   De Merode's comments came just three days before the IOC
executive board is due to meet to discuss the growing drug scandals
in sports. The IOC has scheduled a worldwide anti-doping summit in
January.

Bodies of two Spaniards killed in Omagh bombing are repatriated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Northern Ireland

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ The bodies of two young Spaniards who were
among the 28 people killed in the weekend car bombing in Northern
Ireland were repatriated on Tuesday.
	   Fernando Blasco Ramos, aged 12, and Rocio Abad Ramos, 23, the
first foreign tourists killed in a sectarian bombing in Northern
Ireland, will be buried and cremated respectively in Madrid on
Tuesday evening, the government said.
	   Six of the 12 Spanish youths who were wounded in Saturday's
bombing in the town of Omagh are expected to be able to return home
on Tuesday night, officials said.
	   The wounded received a hospital visit Monday from Deputy Prime
Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos, who offered to bring them and
their families home on his plane.
	   The Spanish victims were in Omagh as part of a field trip they
had taken across the border from the Irish Republic, where they
were spending a month studying English.

Philippines scientists develop new higher-yielding rice

<TEXT>
	   LOS BANOS, Philippines (AP) _ In an effort to keep up with
population growth, scientists in the Philippines are developing a
new strain of rice they believe will produce dramatically bigger
and quicker harvests.
	   The new variety can outperform the most prolific current strains
by up to 25 percent, said Gurdev Khush, chief rice breeder at the
International Rice Research Institute.
	   Rice is a staple for much of the world's population and provides
about 60 percent of Asians' diet. Unless output improves,
population growth will outstrip supplies and cause a sharp increase
in poverty, malnutrition and social unrest in the next 25 years,
institute scientists say.
	   The problem will be worsened by the decreasing amount of land
and water available for agriculture because of real estate
development, said Robert Havener, director of the institute, an
independent nonprofit center financed by government and private
donors.
	   ``Recent events in Indonesia, perhaps, are an example of where
economic chaos and food scarcity brought political instability, and
can bring down governments and cause civil strife,'' he said.
	   Boriboon Somrith, senior rice expert at the Department of
Agriculture in Thailand, said scientists in his country have not
yet duplicated the Philippine center's results but are hopeful
about its prospects.
	   ``The plant type is a welcome development, but it needs to
improve some more in grain quality and aroma to be acceptable to
Thailanders,'' he said.
	   In the past, some experts have criticized the rice varieties
developed by the institute because they needed more fertilizer and
pesticides, which hurt the environment and are sometimes too
expensive for poor peasants.
	   The institute's leaders say they learned the importance of a
genuine partnership with farmers, who should be consulted to
determine their needs instead of being dictated to by crop
researchers.
	   They say the institute is studying new rice-growing methods that
are safer and cheaper for farmers. It also is examining ways to
reduce insecticide and fertilizer use _ for example, by using
rice-friendly insects, crop diversity and plants that can help
reduce rice's fertilizer intake.
	   Development of the new rice strain began in 1988 with the study
of about 2,000 varieties of rice out of the more than 90,000 kept
in the Philippine-based institute's seed bank, Khush said.
	   Researchers made about 2,500 crosses to produce more than 50,000
breeding lines from which to develop the new rice.
	   The new strain produces more grains and is ready for harvest in
100 days, 30 days sooner than present high-yielding varieties and
40-80 days earlier than traditional rice.
	   The plant also has wider leaves and sturdier roots, making it
more resilient in tropical weather and more resistant to disease.
All of its stems are productive, with more clusters of rice than
normal plants.
	   ``It is estimated that by 2020 we will have to produce 50
percent more rice than what we are producing now,'' Khush said.
``That's why this new plant type is important.''
	   The new strain also has been bred to have immunity to blight and
other diseases and be resistant to a host of insect pests.
	   Farmers will be able to start planting the new strain on their
fields in two years, the institute says.
	   In the 1960s, the institute, in Los Banos, about 50 miles (80
kilometers) south of Manila, pioneered the development of new rice
plants capable of higher yields. The new strains helped overcome
food shortages caused by Asia's burgeoning population and shrinking
farmland.
	   The achievement was labeled the ``Green Revolution'' because
advocates said it helped alleviate poverty and reduce hunger,
thereby removing the seeds of violent social change.
	   But through the years, rising population caught up with
production, which has remained generally at 1980 levels.
	   The institute is also working on other new rice varieties that
can survive adverse conditions like drought, flooding and high
salinity and are less dependent on fertilizers, insecticides and
herbicides.
	   Work has also started on a possible perennial rice plant that
would eliminate the need for arduous annual planting.

<TEXT>
	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Denying that he committed perjury and stopping
short of admitting to sex with Monica Lewinsky, President Bill
Clinton says he nonetheless takes responsibility for a relationship
that was ``wrong,'' and believes it is time to move on. But some
congressional critics weren't satisfied and bridled at Clinton's
attack on special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, who, sources say, may
try to force the president to give fuller answers in a second grand
jury appearance. During his testimony Monday, Clinton refused to
answer specific questions about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,
a former White House intern. Then, he told the nation that Starr's
investigation had gone on too long. ``This matter is between me,
the two people I love most _ my wife and our daughter _ and our
God,'' Clinton said. (US-CLINTON-INVESTIGATION)
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ With all 28 victims finally
identified and five suspects in custody, the family of a mother and
young daughter killed in a terrorist car bombing prepared to say
goodbye Tuesday in the first in a long line of funerals.
Thirty-year-old Avril Monaghan, pregnant with twins, and her
18-month-old daughter Maura were to be buried Tuesday. British
Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote in two Belfast newspapers Tuesday
that meeting the hospitalized bombing victims reinforced his
resolve to continue the peace process. At dawn Monday, police
arrested five suspects in the attack including 19-year-old Shane
Mackey, the son of a leading critic of April's peace agreement. No
information was released about the suspects, believed to be members
of the ``Real IRA,'' made up of defectors from the Irish Republican
Army. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With electricity out and a rebel army
advancing on the capital, state radio cranked up a generator
Tuesday and urged government soldiers to regroup at a Kinshasa
military base. The call comes amid reports that one of President
Laurent Kabila's most important battalions has defected to the
rebel side. After weekend meetings with Angolan President Jose
Eduardo Dos Santos, Kabila briefly returned to Kinshasa, his
embattled capital, to continue rallying support against an
advancing rebel army. In recent weeks, Kabila has been traipsing
from Cuba to southern Congo to Angola looking for friends to help
hold off the rebels _ an army of his former Rwandan allies, ethnic
Tutsi fighters and disaffected members of the president's own
military. (CONGO)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Rather than explicitly encouraging
inspectors to try to search suspected weapons sites now banned by
Iraq, the U.N. Security Council has merely voiced its ``full
support'' for the arms experts' mandate. The council's decision
Monday puts the onus back on inspectors to decide whether to try to
test Iraqi resolve in enforcing its inspections ban _ a thorny
decision that could lead to a renewed confrontation with Baghdad.
Iraq froze cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Aug. 5 after the
chief inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Baghdad
had destroyed its weapons of mass destruction. U.N. inspectors must
make that certification before the Security Council will lift
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the Gulf war. (UN-IRAQ)
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright paid tribute Tuesday to bombing victims and embassy
staffers in East Africa, demonstrating American solidarity and
promising to track down the perpetrators. ``Together, we promise to
bring to justice the murderers of our friends,'' she told about 200
American and Tanzanian embassy workers, whom she presented with the
State Department's award for heroism. Officials in Kenya and
Tanzania also hoped she would announce new aid to their countries,
where the Aug. 7 terrorist blasts killed 257 people. FBI agents and
Kenyan police investigating the attacks said Monday that a suspect
who was returned from Pakistan had not admitted any role in the
crimes or implicated anyone else after three days. That appeared to
conflict with reports out of Pakistan, where the man was
apprehended, which said suspect Mohammed Saddiq Odeh had confessed
and named his co-conspirators. (EMBASSY BOMBINGS)

Banned list may increase says IOC official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The number of substances on the banned
list may be increased for the Sydney 2000 Olympics despite a push
for a reduction, an International Olympic Committee member said
Tuesday.
	   Australian Phil Coles, a member of the IOC and AOC, said the
current list of banned substances was too long but was only likely
to grow before the next Olympics.
	   ``There is an extensive list called prohibited substances which
is too long and very complicated,'' Coles said. ``The list belongs
to the IOC and its medical commission. It will be very hard to
reduce, in fact they might even add to it.''
	   Leading Australian officials want the IOC to remove substances
found in common medicines which provide no real performance-boost
but cause unwary athletes to test positive.
	   ``It's pretty hard to put a handle on it,'' said Coles. ``You
and I can go to a chemist when we have got a headache but athletes
can't.''
	   Coles criticized comments made by IOC medical commission chief
Prince Alexandre de Merode in an interview with French newspaper Le
Figaro this week.
	   De Merode said the IOC should continue its drive to stop the use
of doping substances and strive to standardize doping regulations
and improve education.
	   De Merode criticized IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch for
recently proposing a reduction in the list of banned drugs.
	   ``The president can have his opinions,'' de Merode told Le
Figaro. ``I do not understand, and they make me aghast.''
	   Coles said of de Merode: ``A lot of people are hoping he might
retire. He's been there such a long time. You never know what he's
going to say.''

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Four African diplomats met Tuesday with rebel
leaders opposed to President Laurent Kabila to determine whether
Rwanda and Uganda have violated Congo's borders and are helping the
rebels.
	   ``We're here to find out whether this is an invasion or an
internal insurgency,'' Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge
told reporters before the meeting in this eastern Congolese town.
``We'll submit our finding to the (African) heads of state.''
	   The group was meeting with self-styled rebel commander
Jean-Pierre Ondekane as well as civilian figures in the rebellion
who have just set up the Congolese Democratic Coalition.
	   ``We are the people battling for democracy in Congo. Democracy
is not negotiable,'' said Arthur Zahidi Ngoma, an opposition
politician close to the rebel movement.
	   ``One talks about an invasion, but it's the Congolese fighting
for freedom,'' he said.
	   Mudenge said the diplomatic team, representing the Organization
of African Unity as well as the 13-nation Southern African
Development Community, had already met with Uganda and Rwandan
leaders and Kabila in Kinshasa.
	   Mudenge and his colleagues from Zambia, Namibia and Tanzania
were also trying to find a peaceful solution to crisis, he said.
	   ``We don't think it is too late for a peaceful solution.
Otherwise we wouldn't be here,'' Mudenge said without elaborating.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The American University in Cairo has filed a
lawsuit to try to stop further showings of a new movie that uses
its name and logotype without permission, a university spokeswoman
said Tuesday.
	   The spokeswoman, Nihal Tamraz, said the case was filed Monday
against Mohammed el-Adl, producer of ``Saidi at the American
University.''
	   ``Saidi'' is the Arabic word for someone from southern Egypt,
and the film is a comedy about a bumbling southerner among highly
Westernized students at the university.
	   The lawsuit also names Ali Abu Shadi, head of Egyptian film
censorship, who allowed the movie into Egyptian theaters, where it
has been drawing large crowds.
	   Tamraz said the university is ``a well-known educational
institution'' and has the right to protect its name.
	   She added that AUC had warned the producer in June, before the
movie was distributed, not to use its name.
	   AUC has asked in the lawsuit that its name be removed from the
movie and from advertising posters.
	   Cairo's court for urgent cases will hear the case starting Sept.
6, Tamraz said.
	   AUC, which is chartered in Washington, D.C., was founded 79
years ago to foster Western-style education in the Middle East.
	   It has an enrollment of more than 3,500 in undergraduate and
graduate programs. More than half are Egyptians. Foreign students
include Westerners who come to study the Arabic language.

Stowaway accusations under question says Taiwan prosecutor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The unwillingness of Filipino sailors to
testify against Taiwanese ship officers accused of murdering
stowaways in voyages between Europe and Canada casts doubt on their
accusations, a Taiwanese prosecutor said Tuesday.
	   Richard Su, a district prosecutor in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, said the four Filipinos have not responded to his
interview requests, despite Canada's agreement not to deport them.
They claim their lives have been threatened at home.
	   The Filipinos accused officers on their Taiwanese cargo ship,
the Maersk Dubai, of setting Romanian stowaways adrift, throwing
them overboard or marooning them on an island in two separate
voyages from Europe to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1996.
	   Their testimony is crucial to indicting six Taiwanese officers,
who were charged with murder in Kaohsiung after a Canadian judge
set them free last year, ruling he didn't have the jurisdiction to
hear the case.
	   They said the ship's Taiwanese owner, Yangming Marine, had
threatened their families in the Philippines, and contended they
would be in danger if forced to return home.
	   Now assured of their safety, the men's continued unwillingness
to testify severely weakens the credibility of their accusations,
Su said. The four offered wildly contradictory accounts before the
Canadian judge, and may now be experiencing ``problems inside their
hearts,'' over their accusations, said Su.
	   The case is also being delayed by the failure of Romanian
prosecutors to provide necessary evidence about the alleged victims
and testimony from their families, Su said.
	   Su said he wanted to know whether family members have been
contacted by the men _ whose bodies were never found _ and whether
they wish to accuse the Taiwanese crew, an important factor in
prosecuting cases here.
	   Carl Schwengert, an official of Canada's representative office
in Taipei, said Canada has cooperated with Taiwan to the ``fullest
extent possible,'' and hoped for speedy progress in the case.
	   Canada does not recognize Taiwan, but the two maintain strong
unofficial relations.
	   The six accused Taiwanese continue to work for Yang Ming Lines,
but are barred from leaving the country, Su said.

U.N. envoy says he couldn't change Iraq stance on inspectors

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. envoy said Tuesday that he failed to
persuade Iraq to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
and would leave Wednesday for New York, where he would brief the
Security Council.
	   Shah spoke with reporters six days after he was dispatched here
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to urge Iraqi leaders to
reverse their freeze on cooperation with U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``There was no change in their policy,'' said the envoy, Prakash
Shah.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein announced on Aug. 5 that the country
no longer would cooperate with inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission, which is headed by Richard Butler, or the International
Atomic Energy Agency, which is based in Vienna, Austria.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing trade sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted. The sanctions bar
air travel to and from the country and limit the sale of oil,
Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   Iraq has long held that it has eliminated its biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   It announced its decision to suspend cooperation after Butler
said he could not certify that the Iraqis were in compliance with
U.N. resolutions.
	   Shah told reporters Tuesday that he met twice with Iraq's deputy
prime minister, Tariq Aziz, since arriving Thursday.
	   He said that during the meetings, he stressed that Annan had
proposed that the U.N. Security Council conduct ``a comprehensive
review'' of the sanctions.
	   Shah also said he sent Annan a letter Monday to keep the
Security Council abreast of developments.
	   ``It is up to the Security Council'' to decide what to do next,
Shah said.
	   Aziz on Monday briefed a cabinet meeting chaired by Saddam on
his meetings with Shah, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. It
gave no other details.
	   Annan in February defused the last crisis with Iraq, persuading
the regime to open up previously closed presidential palace
compounds to U.N. inspection.
	   The compromise Feb. 23 ended threats by the United States and
Britain to use force, if necessary, to get Iraq to cooperate.
	   U.N. Spokesman Fred Eckhard said Monday in New York that Annan
did not foresee a personal role in the current dispute.
	   The Security Council on Monday voiced its ``full support'' for
the U.N. inspectors but did not explicitly urge them to resume spot
inspections.
	   Such inspections have been suspended since Saddam's Aug. 5
directive, although long-term monitoring of previously identified
weapons sites continues.

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Estrada comment on arrests on main suspects in
3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested the two
main suspects in the killing of ten people, including a U.S. Peace
Corps volunteer, during a shooting rampage in the central
Philippines last week.
	   Ricky Braga and his cousin Feliciano Braga were found hiding
behind a kitchen wall in the house of his brother-in-law in Sara
town, Iloilo province, said Sara police chief Romaldo Bayting.
	   Bayting said officers found a hole leading to a small room where
the two men had been hiding. The hole had been covered by a large
cabinet. Officers then fired warning shots to force the two men to
come out without a fight.
	   Bayting said the Braga cousins confessed to the killings and
said one of two men already in police custody was also involved.
They said the second man, who was found to have fired a gun, was
innocent, Bayting added.
	   President Joseph Estrada commended policemen for the quick
arrest of the suspects.
	   ``The perpetrators of this terrible and inhuman crime should not
be allowed to menace society again,'' Estrada said.
	   A group of men led by Ricky Braga and apparently drunk or high
on drugs is suspected of murdering the victims last Wednesday
	   Braga's group allegedly fired assault rifles and pistols at the
occupants of four passing vehicles. After the killing, the men
stole the victims' belongings.
	   Among those killed was Robert Bock, 33, of New York, a U.S.
Peace Corps volunteer who was working as a fishery consultant in
Concepcion, near Sara.
	   Bock, whose parents are from Virginia, was assigned to Iloilo
last year and was one of four American Peace Corps volunteers
working there, the U.S. Peace Corps office in Manila said.
	   The police earlier offered a reward of 600,000 pesos (dlrs
13,950) for the capture of the Braga cousins.
	   Iloilo is about 460 kilometers (285 miles) south of Manila.

World Champion Deschamps questioned in doping investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ French midfielder and world champion Didier
Deschamps was questioned Tuesday by a prosecutor looking into
allegations that top players in Italy's first division soccer
league took performance-enhancing substances.
	   Deschamps, captain of the French national team and a Juventus
veteran, walked past reporters after a two-hour meeting with
prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello in Turin.
	   The doping investigation stemmed from an interview by AS Roma
coach Zdenek Zeman who said he was amazed by the quick muscular
development of players including Gianluca Vialli and Alessandro Del
Piero, a star-forward for Juventus.
	   Guriniello has already met with Vialli and Del Piero, who both
denied taking illegal substances. He also questioned Zeman, who
stuck to his allegations but did not say which banned drugs the
players allegedly use.
	   In a separate investigation, the anti-doping commission of the
Italian Olympic Committee was due to meet later Tuesday with
Juventus trainer Giampiero Ventrone and Inter coach Luigi Simoni.

Khamenei says Iran will not tolerate mischief by the Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, dismissed Afghanistan's Taliban force as ``degenerate''
on Tuesday and said his government would not tolerate the militia's
seizure of 47 Iranian citizens.
	   In a statement broadcast on state television, Khamenei told the
Taliban to free the Iranians who were detained when its forces
captured the north Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   ``It is in their interest to release and send (the detainees)
back respectfully because the Iranian nation, government and armed
forces will not tolerate any mischief and wickedness from even the
Americans, let alone by those degenerate and worthless people who
are being used as tools of the foreigners in Afghanistan these
days,'' the television quoted Khamenei as saying.
	   Tehran says the Taliban detained 11 Iranian diplomats, a
correspondent of the official Islamic Republic News Agency and 35
truck drivers who reportedly work for an international transport
company.
	   The Taliban say they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but they admit to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming the
Taliban's enemies.
	   Iran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the Iranians'
safety because Islamabad is widely believed to provide arms and
other support to the Taliban.
	   Iran itself is widely suspected of backing the northern-based
opposition to the Taliban.
	   Khamenei accused ``some neighboring countries'' of interfering
in Afghanistan's civil war, the television reported.
	   But he held the Taliban responsible for the Iranians's safety,
saying: ``It is in the interests of those deceived people to
respect the Iranians whom they have arrested and to return them to
their homeland.''
	   In a related development, Iran's deputy foreign minister,
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, said Tuesday that an Iranian official had met
the truck drivers in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on
Sunday.
	   Boroujerdi, who is responsible for Afghan affairs, said the
official found the drivers to be in good health, but the Taliban
did not allow him to meet the diplomats and correspondent, the
television said.
	   In the Iranian capital Tehran on Tuesday, some 25 relatives of
the truck drivers demonstrated outside the U.N. office to urge the
world body to intervene to secure the release of the captives, IRNA
said.

Ukrainian central bank raises interest rate amid concerns over
</HEADLINE>
hryvna &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Amid concerns about the stability of the
national currency, the hryvna, Ukraine's central bank raised a key
interest rate by 10 percent on Tuesday to respond to financial
turmoil in neighboring Russia.
	   ``It is rather a psychological form of reaction to the market's
financial situation,'' said National Bank chairman Viktor
Yushchenko.
	   Yushchenko said Ukraine's financial markets are expected to
respond to the ruble devaluation in Russia, and Ukraine's National
Bank had to take steps to avoid a crisis, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The increase brought the Lombard rate to 92 percent from 82
percent but left the discount rate unchanged at 82 percent from
early July.
	   Ukrainian officials are concerned that the ruble's dramatic
plunge would also undermine the hryvna, which already fell sharply
on Monday following the Russian devaluation announcement.
	   ``The National Bank board is worried by the possible
consequences of the Russian ruble's devaluation, although its
downfall to a certain level is not threatening us,'' Yushchenko
said in an interview published Tuesday by the government's Uryadovy
Kurier newspaper.
	   ``But the ruble's collapse might lead to a devaluation of the
hryvna or tough monetary policies,'' he said.
	   President Leonid Kuchma has ordered Yushchenko and Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko to maintain the stability of the
country's financial system and prevent the hryvna from falling.
	   Early on Tuesday, top economic officials held a special meeting
chaired by Pustovoitenko to discuss Ukraine's financial situation,
which they called relatively stable.
	   On Monday, however, the hryvna fell to 2.1805 to the U.S. dollar
at the main Interbank Currency Exchange, down from 2.1435 to the
dollar last week.
	   The trading was conducted late in the evening following a
National Bank ban on selling or buying rubles and dollars at the
exchange.
	   The hryvna has been falling steadily this year under strong
pressure from foreign investors, who have withdrawn an estimated
dlrs 2 billion from the country. National Bank officials say
non-residents now hold about 20 percent of domestic government
bonds, down from some 60 percent in early 1998.
	   Efforts by the National Bank to defend the currency resulted in
a sharp fall in its reserves from dlrs 2.34 billion at the
beginning of the year to dlrs 1.15 billion as of last week.
	   The hryvna still remains in the currency fluctuation band of 1.8
to 2.25 to the dollar, which was announced by the government for
1998.

Taylor looking for Warne cover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Shane Warne's absence is a far greater
concern to Australia than the fitness of Pakistan pacemen Waqar
Younis and Wasim Akram, captain Mark Taylor said Tuesday.
	   There are doubts over the availability of the two brilliant
Pakistanis ahead of Australia's tour next month but Taylor has the
pressure of leading a team without his best bowler.
	   Taylor has heard differing reports about the fitness of Waqar,
who returned home from English county cricket with an elbow injury,
and the availability of former captain Wasim, who is in dispute
with Pakistan Cricket Board officials.
	   Pakistan has named Aamir Sohail captain and former captain Javed
Miandad coach for the series against the Australians, but is yet to
name a squad.
	   ``I don't really know what's happening with Waqar or you never
know, he might be just going home for a rest before he hits us in
another couple of months.''
	   Taylor said Pakistan had some good potential replacements if the
two strike bowlers are missing.
	   More crucial is the performance of his bowlers, who were
punished on a losing tour of India earlier this year.
	   Without Warne, Australia's spin attack will rest with
inexperienced duo Gavin Robertson and Stuart MacGill.
	   ``It's not just a matter of Gavin Robertson and Stuart
MacGill,'' said Taylor. ``It's our whole side realising that Warne
has been an outstanding contributor for us over a number of years.
We have to make sure we lift for him.''
	   Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie both missed the Indian tour
through injury but are on the comeback trail while Mike Kasprowicz
had a strong tour despite tough conditions.
	   ``The good thing is a bloke like Kasprowicz is a much better
bowler than he was 12 months ago and Damien Fleming is back, fit
and when he bowls well he's very handy in places like the
subcontinent,'' Taylor said.
	   ``Gavin probably has had enough experience now but it's going to
be tougher for MacGill who's only had one test against England at
Adelaide. He had some exposure on the tour of India but only played
a couple of games.''

Second East German sports doping trial opens with confession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's second doping trial against former East
German sports functionaries opened Tuesday with a doctor's
confession that he systematically administered
performance-enhancing drugs to female swimmers.
	   However, Dr. Ulrich Suender, 58, denied that he knowingly
damaged the health of the athletes, some as young as 12 at the
time.
	   He said he knew only a little about possible side-effects of
steroids, and had heard they were reversible anyway.
	   ``I believed that,'' he said.
	   Suender, a second doctor and three coaches are charged with
causing bodily harm to as many as 17 young female swimmers on East
Germany's TSC Berlin team from 1978 to 1989. Prosecutors say they
gave the drugs without telling the minors or their parents what
they were taking.
	   In one case, one of the former swimmer's hormonal balance was so
disrupted by the steroids, which she started taking at 13, that she
is now sterile. Others suffered such side-effects as deeper voices,
serious acne and excessive hair growth.
	   Suender testified that he had no reservations about providing
anabolic steroids in pill form to the team doctors, which was part
of his responsibility. He denied ever giving steroid injections.
	   Only once in his 15-year career did he suspect the steroids of
causing a health problem, he said, when a girl came to him with
acute liver problems.
	   He also insisted he was sworn to secrecy about the doping, even
when it came to the athletes themselves or their parents.
	   On trial with Suender are Dr. Dorit Roesler, 50, and coaches
Peter Mattonet, 48, Berndt Christochowitz, 40 and Klaus Klemenz,
55.
	   All have indicated they would testify before the court, meaning
no other witnesses likely will be called. A verdict could come as
early as Thursday.
	   Although they could get up to three years in prison, the
defendants were expected to receive suspended sentences or fines.
	   The first trial, which began March 18, involves coaches and
doctors from the former communist nation's showcase Dynamo Berlin
swim team.
	   Only one, Dr. Dinus Bieter, has made a partial confession. He
admitted in court last month that he administered anabolic steroids
to athletes, but insisted the doses were too small to cause
physical harm and that no one showed ill effects.
	   His case was severed last week from other five _ four coaches
and another doctor, _ and a verdict could come down Aug. 24. The
trial for the other four coaches and doctors resumes the same day,
but no verdict was expected.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ About 200 Americans left Pakistan on
Tuesday after their government deemed the country unsafe, but U.S.
Ambassador Thomas Simons vowed they would be back.
	   Simons is among the diplomats who remained behind as their
families, nonessential staff and their relatives departed under
U.S. State Department orders following the Aug. 7 bombings of the
American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
The nearly simultaneous bombings killed 257 people and injured
thousands.
	   ``The Americans always come back. We have very important
business to conduct in this country,'' Simons told reporters after
arriving at the airport with the evacuees in a convoy of four
buses, the ambassador's car and a few police motorcycle outriders,
their sirens blaring. A plane carrying the evacuees took off hours
later; they will be gone at least one month.
	   The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said in a statement it understood
the need for caution, and was ``confident that this temporary
withdrawal ... will not in any way affect the extensive ongoing
cooperation between the two countries.''
	   Opposition leader and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,
though, was pessimistic.
	   ``The withdrawal and evacuation decision is an official
announcement by an important country ... that this country was no
longer safe for investors,'' Ms. Bhutto said in a statement.
	   The estimated 6,700 American business people, missionaries, aid
workers and others living in Pakistan also have been strongly
advised to leave. But few took up their government's offer of a
ride Tuesday on the charter plane booked to fly diplomatic staff
and relatives to Brussels.
	   Americans not connected with the embassy were briefed Monday by
Simons, hours after learning of the evacuation order. Many said
that despite the seriousness of the warning and the sudden
departure of much of the embassy staff, they were inclined to stay
for the time being because there had been no specific threat
against Americans in Pakistan.
	   ``It is a general pattern of threat that we're responding to,''
Simons said Tuesday.
	   Similar measures have been taken at U.S. Embassies in Asmara,
Eritrea; Tirana, Albania; and Ulan Bator, Mongolia
	   On Monday, Simons dismissed the possibility the United States
was planning to use Pakistan as a staging ground for an attack on a
man holed up in neighboring Afghanistan who has been identified as
a possible suspect in the African bombings. Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz added his country had not been asked to
facilitate any attack on Osama bin Laden, who the United States has
accused of sponsoring terrorism around the world inspired by his
conviction that Washington threatens Muslim interests.
	   Rumors of a U.S. attack on bin Laden are circulating in Pakistan
and elsewhere.
	   The Gulf newspaper Emirates News, quoting unnamed Pakistan
Foreign Ministry officials on Tuesday, reported Washington had
asked Islamabad for permission to use the Afghan border city of
Peshawar as a military staging ground. The newspaper's sources said
the go-ahead for an attack could come if the type of explosives
used in East Africa were found to match explosives used in other
attacks linked to bin Laden.
	   U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright, speaking to reporters in Dar
es Salaam, made an oblique reference to bin Laden. She said
Afghanistan's Taliban religious militia, which calls bin Laden its
guest, could show its desire to be part of the international
community by not harboring ``terrorist elements.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Delegates from Russia and Estonia resumed
negotiations over the border between the two countries on Tuesday,
hoping to ease relations that have worsened since the Soviet Union
collapsed, a news agency said.
	   Estonian officials indicated they were ready to sign a
definitive border treaty in the near future, the Interfax news
agency said, citing Estonian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marin
Myttus.
	   Relations between Estonia and Russia have been tense since the
Baltic nation split from the Soviet Union in 1991 and most ethnic
Russians lost their citizenship.
	   Russia is also upset by Estonia's bid to join the NATO military
alliance, which it perceives as a threat to its borders.

American diplomats try hard to set up Kosovo peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with American efforts, comments from
ethnic Albanian negotiator. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ American diplomats tried their best
Tuesday to persuade ethnic Albanian representatives to meet their
Serb counterparts for talks on the future of the separatist Kosovo
province.
	   The U.S. diplomatic initiative was headed by envoy Christopher
Hill, who first met with the designated Albanian negotiators, then
conferred separately with Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader
despised by the Kosovo rebels.
	   Comments from Fehmi Agani, the head of the ethnic Albanians'
negotiating team, suggested it would be hard for the Americans to
persuade him and his colleagues to meet Serbian government envoys
later in the day.
	   Even if the two sides meet, prospects are dim.
	   The negotiations are being boycotted by ethnic Albanian
opposition parties and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for
independence of the Serbian province, where Albanians account for
90 percent of the population of 2 million. Kosovo is in Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Rugova announced the Albanians' negotiating team last week, but
it comprises only his own associates.
	   Agani said Tuesday he and his team want an ``end of repression
against the Albanians and the withdrawal of the (Serbian) forces''
from Kosovo before a ``meaningful dialogue'' can begin.
	   ``If that is ignored, then this game with invitations to meet is
really senseless,'' he said, referring to an invitation from the
Serbian delegation to meet at government house in Pristina Tuesday
afternoon. He also said the time and pattern of negotiations should
be determined by Hill.
	   By Tuesday noon, there were no fresh reports of fighting, which
ebbed Monday, following a weekend push when Serbian forces captured
a series of key Albanian strongholds.
	   Tanjug said Monday that Serbian police ``crushed'' KLA bases in
the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all on the outskirts of
the province's second city of Pec on Sunday.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported sporadic
fighting and shooting in the border area near Junik, apparently
mop-up operations after government forces took control of the
village, formerly a major guerrilla stronghold.
	   The center also accused Serbs of setting ablaze parts of
villages from where the armed militants were purged.
	   Meanwhile, the two sides exchanged allegations of atrocities.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said an official of Rugova's
Democratic League of Kosovo died in a Pristina hospital after being
beaten by police in a prison of his hometown Urosevac, 35
kilometers (20 miles) to the south.
	   Conversely, Tanjug said the mutilated bodies of two Serb
policemen missing since July 6 were found Monday in Lodja where
government forces forced KLA rebels to retreat.
	   Another policeman, wounded in the same village July 6 but
evacuated and hospitalized, died Monday in the main military
hospital in Belgrade, it said.
	   Two other Serbian policemen were killed Sunday and Monday in
different parts of Kosovo, the pro-government Serbian Media Center
in Pristina reported.
	   The United Nations now estimates that more than 231,000 people
have been uprooted in the six months since the conflict began. Many
of them have fled across the mountainous border with Albanian,
where the KLA also maintains bases.

German economy still going strong despite financial crises abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The Russian and Asian financial crises
threaten Germany's economy, especially the export sector, but their
impact will remain slight, German Economics Minister Guenter
Rexrodt said Tuesday.
	   ``I consider them to be manageable,'' he said at a Bonn press
conference. The German economy is on ``solid ground,'' he added.
	   German exports have reached record heights this year: German
companies sold products worth 474.1 billion marks (dlrs 266
billion) during the first six months alone, an increase of 11,5
percent over the same period last year, according to government
figures released Tuesday.
	   The nation's gross domestic product has also improved,
increasing from 1.5 to 2 percent in the second quarter of the year,
compared to the same time period last year, Rexrodt said. Growth
was 0.5 percent higher than in the first quarter, he added.
	   ``We are right within our projected growth corridor,'' he said.
``I see further positive perspectives for the German economy.''
	   Rexrodt also said Russia's financial problems are unlikely to
have a wider effect, even on Eastern European neighbors.
	   ``In many countries of the former Eastern Bloc, the economic
situation is much more stable due to reform policies,'' he said.
	   However, it remains unclear what effect the Russian government's
decision to lift debt payments for three months will have, he said.
	   While a new round of international credits for Russia could not
be ruled out, bilateral credit agreements wouldn't solve the
country's financial problems, he said.
	   The country needs to quickly implement tax and budget changes
announced last month in return for a new loan from the
International Monetary Fund, he said.	   
	   Meanwhile, Monday's Ruble devaluation will bring temporary
relief to Russia's financial situation, but it won't solve the
country's structural problems, Rexrodt said.
	   ``The situation in Russia shows that markets won't tolerate the
absence of reform in the long run,'' he said. For that reason, he
said, a devalued Ruble will bring only short-term gain./

Government asks soldiers to regroup as rebels advance on Kinshasa

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With electricity out in the capital and a
rebel army advancing on the city, state radio cranked up a
generator Tuesday morning and broadcast a call for soldiers to
regroup at a Kinshasa military base.
	   State radio also promised rations of bread and sardines to all
new recruits, as the government sought more volunteers to try to
beat back the rebel army, made up of President Laurent Kabila's
former Rwandan allies, ethnic Tutsi fighters and disaffected
members of the president's own military.
	   Heavy fighting was reported Tuesday in Kimpese, about 200
kilometers (125) miles south of the city, with Kabila's soldiers
fleeing from the rebel troops, according to a local journalist who
had seen the combat.
	   Kabila's government was also in growing turmoil, with the deputy
minister of the interior, Faustin Munene, arrested and accused of
conspiring with the rebels.
	   Unconfirmed reports in the Congolese media said Munene, who was
in charge of security, was accused of trying to convince several
truckloads of new recruits to join the rebels Monday. Those same
recruits were fired on later the same day by jittery government
soldiers. Several recruits were injured.
	   The calls for more soldiers comes as Kabila's military is in
increasing disarray. One of his most important battalions _ the
Zulu Battalion _ has defected to the rebel side, according to a
former military intelligence officer with close ties to the
government, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The entire Zulu Battalion has abandoned Kabila over the past few
days, the former officer said, leaving the towns of Inga and Nzongo
_ and their important electrical supply stations _ to fall to the
rebels.
	   The Zulu Battalion was among the first units to enter Kinshasa
last year when Kabila's army ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko and had been specifically dispatched by Kabila to beat back
the current rebel advance.
	   The rebels are now believed to be within 125 miles (200
kilometers) of Kinshasa, moving up from the west.
	   As for Kabila, his whereabouts are unknown. He had been expected
to return to Kinshasa on Monday night from the southern Congolese
city of Lubumbashi, his stronghold during his own rebel days, but
it was not clear if he had done so. Congolese officials would only
say Monday that he was in the country.
	   Despite the rebels quick advance in the two weeks since the
rebellion began, Kabila has remained publicly defiant, saying his
soldiers would prevail and blaming the fighting on Rwanda and the
West plotting against him.
	   But Kabila has also been seeking outside support. He was in
Angola over the weekend to ask for troops and arms to shore up his
troubled army, according to a senior Kabila adviser, speaking on
condition of anonymity. In late July, he went to Cuba, where he
also reportedly sought help.
	   But just how much, if any, support was promised was not known.
	   Angolan soldiers, along with former Rwandan and Ugandan allies,
helped Kabila in his eight-month fight last year to oust Mobutu,
who had destroyed the infrastructure and economy of the country
during his long, dictatorial rule.
	   Now, though, Kabila's former allies have turned against him.
While Rwanda denies involvement in the war, they are widely
believed to be helping the rebels, who have captured a number of
key towns in the east and, following a cross-country airlift, also
have been advancing on Kinshasa from the west as well.
	   Diplomats from Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania and Nambia,
representing the Organization of African Unity and the Southern
African Development Community, were meeting in the eastern
Congolese city of Goma on Tuesday with rebel leaders, trying to
determine whether Rwanda and Uganda had violated Congo's borders.
	   ``We're here to find out whether this is an invasion or an
internal insurgency,'' Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge
told reporters.
	   Rwandan Tutsi troops _ once the core of Kabila's military _
defected en masse two weeks ago to join the ethnic Tutsi-led
rebellion, acting on concerns that Kabila has done little to secure
Congo's turbulent border with Rwanda.
	   Tutsis, an ethnic minority centered in eastern Congo and
neighboring countries, including Rwanda, have become the target of
attacks and arbitrary detentions in Kinshasa.
	   In Kinshasa, the situation has become increasingly tense. The
city's residents have been stocking up on food essentials for days,
fearing they will be cut off once the final assault comes. State
radio urged shops Monday morning not to hike prices _ but gasoline
and food prices have already been rising.

Chief rabbi asks pope to have crosses near Auschwitz removed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's chief rabbi on Tuesday asked the pope
to push for the removal of memorial crosses near Auschwitz, saying
it was ``a travesty'' to turn the former Nazi death camp where more
than 1 million Jews were killed into a Christian shrine.
	   Dozens of crosses have been erected in recent weeks in a small
field near Auschwitz by a conservative Roman Catholic group that
wants to honor 152 Poles killed by the Nazis.
	   Roman Catholic Church officials have asked the group, inspired
by an author of anti-Semitic pamphlets, to stop, but to no avail.
	   Israel's Holocaust memorial, Holocaust survivor groups and
Israel's Foreign Ministry have also asked for the removal of the
crosses.
	   On Tuesday, Israel's chief Ashkenazi rabbi, Meir Israel Lau, met
in his office with a group of Catholic priests from Rome _ members
of the peace group St. Egidio _ and handed them a letter for Pope
John Paul II, who was born in Poland.
	   Lau would not make the letter public, saying he first wanted the
pope to read it. The rabbi, who as a young child was an inmate in
the Nazi concentration camp of Buchenwald, said he asked the pope
to intervene in the dispute.
	   ``Erecting crosses at this Jewish graveyard, and making it into
a Christian site twists history, distorting the past and misleading
future generations,'' Lau told The Associated Press.
	   ``We would like this place to be one where the only thing
screaming out is silence,'' said Lau. ``To make it into a Christian
site with crosses raised high is something of a travesty. The pope,
who... is more familiar with the issue than any of us, certainly
knows this was primarily a death camp for Jews.''
	   On Monday, Lau met with the Polish ambassador to Israel,
Wojciech Adameicki, and suggested that a memorial to thousands of
children who were burned to death at the camp be erected in place
of the crosses. Adameicki said Tuesday he handed Lau's letter to
Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek.
	   ``We appreciate Rabbi Lau's interest in the matter, his good
will and his understanding of the complexity of the matter... what
is important to remember is that the issue cannot be solved in one
day,'' said Adameicki.
	   The Polish government issued a statement in Warsaw recently
indicating it would stay out of the dispute and leave it up to the
Roman Catholic church to deal with the issue.
	   The cross controversy began in 1988 when a 26-foot wooden cross,
used in a 1979 mass celebrated at Auschwitz by the pope, was
erected at a Carmelite nunnery that adjoined the camp. In recent
weeks, more than 50 smaller crosses have been erected at the site.
	   Lau expressed his hope that the pope who served as archbishop in
Krakow during the Holocaust will be sensitive to the problem.
	   In 1993, the pope resolved another dispute regarding Auschwitz
when he asked nuns to move out of the Carmelite convent they had
established at the edge of the camp.
	   About 1.5 million people were killed at Auschwitz in
Nazi-occupied Poland in World War II, 90 percent of them Jews.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government allowed
doctors to visit opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi at the site of
her roadside standoff Tuesday, while the country's state-controlled
press reported that some top generals urged people to
``annihilate'' her.
	   An exile student opposition group, meanwhile, said that the
government had sentenced two members of Suu Kyi's political party
to seven years in jail for handing out pro-democracy leaflets, the
same offense for which 18 foreigners were deported last week.
	   Suu Kyi, a fellow executive of her National League for Democracy
and two drivers have been holed up in a van 32 kilometers (19
miles) west of Yangon. They were stopped there by the authorities
last Wednesday while attempting to travel to the city of Bassein to
meet members of her political party.
	   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner has tried to travel outside
Yangon four times during the past two months and been blocked each
time.
	   A statement from Suu Kyi's political party said her two personal
physicians visited her Tuesday afternoon with government
permission.
	   The statement gave no details about her health, but said she
would have to be seen by doctors daily. It said they would apply to
the government for permission to do so.
	   During her last standoff at the end of July, Suu Kyi became ill
with severe dehydration and a 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees
Fahrenheit) fever.
	   A government spokesman said at the time that the military was
providing Suu Kyi with food and water, but she and her party later
said the government had attempted to starve her into submission.
	   Her doctors were initially allowed to visit her during that
standoff, but one was barred after the authorities found she was
bringing food to Suu Kyi.
	   The government ended the confrontation by seizing Suu Kyi's car
and driving her back to Yangon against her will.
	   Three generals in the ruling military council urged government
workers to annihilate Suu Kyi and her colleagues in speeches
reported in Tuesday's state-run New Light of Myanmar newspaper.
	   Ministers of Industry Numbers One and Two and the Minister of
Immigration and Population accused Suu Kyi of collaborating with
Western countries to impose neocolonialism upon Myanmar.
	   The All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exile opposition
group, meanwhile said two NLD members, Kyi Toe and Aung Than Nyunt,
were sentenced to seven years in jail last Thursday for
distributing leaflets containing a message from their party.
	   They were arrested with nine other NLD members, but the fate of
the others is not known, the student group said.
	   ``The tragic thing is that these two NLD members will to spend
the next seven years in prison merely for allegedly distributing a

Sudan opposition leaders call for continued struggle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAE GHALWASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese opposition leaders on Tuesday
rejected Sudan's new constitution, which is based on Islamic law,
and vowed to keep up their struggle for democracy.
	   The statements came in a communique following a three-day
meeting here by members of the National Democratic Alliance, an
umbrella group for Sudanese opposition parties.
	   The communique said the opposition leaders ``assert their
rejection of the shameful constitution, which the regime installed
under a police state (while) it was curtailing freedom.''
	   They vowed to ``continue steps on the path of national struggle
until our noble people reach their ambitions of ... democracy in
unity and peace.''
	   Egypt invited the opposition leaders to Cairo after peace talks
between the Sudanese rebels and the Khartoum government earlier
this month in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa failed to make
progress.
	   The meeting was attended by John Garang, leader of the Sudan
People's Liberation Army, which has been fighting since 1983 for
more freedom for the south's animists and Christians from the
Islamic north.
	   Also at the conference were Mohammed Osman al-Mirgani, who heads
the alliance, and former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi.
	   El-Mahdi was ousted in a 1989 military coup by Lt. Gen. Omar
el-Bashir, who has installed an Islamic regime in Khartoum.
	   The new constitution, adopted June 30, is based on Islamic
sharia law but promises to safeguard the rights of religious
minorities.
	   Promulgation of the constitution followed el-Bashir's move last
summer to sign a peace treaty with six southern rebel groups that
broke with Garang.
	   In their final communique, the opposition leaders accused
Khartoum of human rights abuses and discrimination against
non-Muslims and pledged to continue working for a united, secular
Sudan.
	   They also accused el-Bashir's regime of using ``food as a
weapon'' in its battle against the southern rebels.
	   Thousands of people face starvation in southern Sudan,
especially in Bahr el-Ghazal province. Khartoum and the rebels have
agreed to a three-month cease-fire to allow foreign aid workers to
get needed food and medicine to the area.
	   Sudan's parliament protested Egypt's hosting of the meeting,
saying it was tantamount to fostering the rebels.
	   But President Hosni Mubarak said in an interview published
Monday that he met with the rebels to try to keep the neighboring
nation unified.
	   ``This meeting was held in the interest of our brothers in
Sudan,'' he told the weekly newspaper Mayo.
	   Egypt worries that a breakup of Sudan could jeopardize the Nile,
it's main source of water.

Yorke poised to accept a better offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ The on-again, off-again transfer
negotiations between Manchester United and Aston Villa's star
striker Dwight Yorke are back on _ at least until Thursday.
	   Yorke said Monday he would see out his contract at Aston Villa
after Villa boss John Gregory turned down United's 10 million-pound
(dlrs 16.25 million) bid. But on Tuesday he said he still wanted to
join United.
	   And Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is reportedly
prepared to increase his bid to 12 million pounds (dlrs 19.5
million) to lure the 26-year-old striker to Old Trafford.
	   Ferguson was also preparing to make a double raid on Aston Villa
by making inquiries about the Birmingham club's Australian
goalkeeper Mark Bosnich, the Daily Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Yorke has told Gregory that he wants to sign for the Red Devils
by Thursday so he will be eligible to play in the European
Champions' League.
	   ``I have always said the Champions' League is the type of stage
I want. I spent all summer watching the World Cup, knowing I will
never get there with Trinidad and Tobago. That is why I need to
play at the highest club level I can,'' he said Tuesday.
	   ``There is no point moving just to play in the Premiership. I
can stay here and do that,'' he was quoted saying in the Sun
newspaper.
	   ``This is why the deal has to be done by Thursday. If I was miss
that deadline, I would not be able to play in Europe until March.''
	   Yorke said if the Manchester United deal did not come through by
Thursday, he would see out his contract at Villa.
	   Bosnich, who has refused to extend his contract with Aston
Villa, was registered with Manchester United in 1991 before he was
forced to return to Australia due to visa complications.
	   He returned to England and signed with Aston Villa in 1992.
	   Two years ago he caused a controversy by performing a Nazi-style
salute in a game against Tottenham Hostspur which outraged the
London club's Jewish supporters.
	   He was back in trouble after Villa's opening Premier League game
on Saturday when an off-duty police officer reported him for
swearing at Everton supporters during the match.

Opposition says Yeltsin ``devalues himself'' by permitting ruble's

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has squandered his
credibility by allowing the ruble to take a dive, a parliamentary
opposition leader said Tuesday.
	   ``Our president has absolutely devalued himself,'' said
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who leads the largest faction in
parliament's lower house.
	   Zyuganov said the ruble devaluation announced Monday is the
latest in a long line of Yeltsin failures, and repeated his call
for mass protests and the president's resignation. His previous
calls have triggered little response.
	   Yeltsin appeared to gear down from crisis mode on Tuesday,
accepting the resignation of his long-time economic adviser,
Alexander Livshits. The Interfax news agency reported that Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin
had offered to resign, but Yeltsin told them to stay.
	   The president was at his country residence outside Moscow on
Tuesday and expected to remain there through the end of the week.
Kiriyenko was informing him about the economic situation by
telephone.
	   The moves followed the announcement Monday that the government
would permit the ruble to fall by a third _ from about 6.3 to the
dollar to 9.5 to the dollar _ an effective devaluation which
Yeltsin had repeatedly pledged to avoid.
	   Russian newspapers had a mixed response, saying that it could
give a break to the battered economy and let the government pay its
months-long wage arrears. But they also warned it could backfire on
Yeltsin politically when prices begin to rise.
	   ``We woke up in another country _ one standing on the eve of
price rises, deficit, cuts in import and black currency market,''
said the business daily Kommersant.
	   Many commentators assailed Yeltsin for putting himself in an
embarrassing position by denying that devaluation was on the agenda
just days before the move.
	   ``If Yeltsin had set a deliberate goal to undermine his own
prestige, he couldn't have invented anything better than to pledge
there would be no devaluation three days before it happened,'' said
the daily Russky Telegraf.
	   The government pledged to control the ruble's decline, but it
sank to 6.89 to the dollar on the Central Bank-controlled Moscow
currency exchange from 6.43 on Monday.
	   The larger and more important interbank currency market remained
frozen Tuesday. Russian commercial banks, many of whom face a
liquidity crisis, have suspended trading since last week.
	   The more sensitive street rate, which on Monday immediately
plunged to the bottom of the government-set band, fluctuated
between 8 and 10 rubles to the dollar at exchange booths around
Moscow. Demand was low as people waited for the ruble to stabilize.
	   Nonetheless, most banks were not paying out on dollar accounts,
and depositors were asked to fill out a form and come back in
several days. Bank managers said the Central Bank had limited their
ability to buy dollars in an effort to stem the run on the ruble.
	   Many customers were exasperated.
	   ``I trust the bank but I don't trust the government,'' said
depositor Lyudmila Sergeyeva as she stood in line at a downtown
office of a leading Russian commercial bank. ``The government has
spent its last credit of trust.''
	   Meanwhile, business continued as usual in Moscow stores, which
have mostly kept their price tags unchanged.
	   However, Kommersant said customers were emptying shelves in some
Russian cities and there was high demand for dollars in certain
regions even at the higher rates.
	   Analysts said consumer prices would rise over a number of weeks
as stores sell their current inventories. The higher prices are
expected to deal a painful blow to the population because imports
account for a huge share of Russia's consumer market, including
more than half the food sold in stores.
	   Russian stocks continued to fall, and were down 6.9 percent at
1:30 p.m. (0930 GMT) on Tuesday.
	   ``Nobody wants to sell at these levels, and nobody wants to buy
because they are scared of what might happen, and nobody wants to
trade with one another because they are afraid of default,'' said
Martin Diggle, principal at Brunswick Warburg brokerage in Moscow.

Police find another marijuana field in eastern Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian police destroyed a field of 2,000
marijuana plants in the eastern Donetsk region, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Police discovered the field after destroying 10,000 marijuana
plants that were growing in the same region near Ukraine's border
with Russia. Police searched the entire area after the first
discovered and found the second field about 30 kilometers (19
miles) away, the daily Fakty said.
	   Ukrainian anti-drug officials say narcotics use and transit are
increasing in the former Soviet republic. Ukraine has 70,000 drug
abusers registered by the authorities, but the real number is
thought to be higher.

Shipley secures majority and strengthens hold on power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS and UPDATES with minority party members defecting to
give Shipley minority, edits slightly &QL; 
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Prime Minister Jenny Shipley
strengthened her hold on power Tuesday, securing enough defections
from a splintered junior government coalition party to guarantee
her rule.
	   New Zealand First legislators walked out on their leader, former
deputy prime minister and treasurer Winston Peters, in sufficient
number to give Shipley a one vote majority in the 120-vote national
Parliament.
	   The walk-out, which came at a tense NZ First caucus meeting late
Tuesday, ends the coalition that has ruled since December 1996, and
leaves Shipley in control of a minority government which rules with
the support of a hodgepodge of independents and minority parties.
	   ``New Zealand First is now not part of the government,'' Peters
told a news after the meeting.
	   But five NZ First members pledged their support for Shipley and
her National party on votes of confidence and money bills, giving
her the numbers in Parliament to win votes on the crucial issues of
confidence and money bills.
	   Peters was left with just nine of his original 17 legislators
still supporting his leadership.
	   Earlier Tuesday, two NZ First ministers deserted the Peters-led
party to throw their support behind National. In total, the
defectors, along with two independents and minor party New Zealand
ACT, give Shipley the minimum 61 votes she needs to remain in
office.
	   The defections are a victory for Shipley, giving her the option
of running a minority government until National, currently lagging
in the polls, decides it can risk an election.
	   The coalition had been in crisis for almost a week, after Peters
led a walk-out of Cabinet after a dispute over the sale of the
government's stake in Wellington airport.
	   Shipley sacked Peters and invoked dispute resolution procedures
under the coalition agreement which give the parties one week to
solve the row before the coalition can be formally ended.
	   Looking drawn and tense after a meeting Tuesday with his
legislators, Peters said earlier he wanted the dispute resolution
process to go ahead immediately.
	   The leaders went into a dispute resolution meeting after a fiery
session of Parliament, during which Peters again questioned
Shipley's credibility and she countered by accusing him of
stage-managing the Cabinet walkout.
	   Until Shipley secured a majority in parliament, the government
had survived because there had been no vote in Parliament on money
bills or a no-confidence motion.
	   Opposition parties are clamoring for such a test of the
government, but had no immediate way of forcing a vote.
	   Gambling on a show of strength, Shipley on Monday said Peters
and NZ First had a choice about their future.
	   ``If he wants to precipitate a general election, he can,'' she
said in a television interview.
	   The airport was sold to a private sector investment company
Friday, with Peters' approval, after safeguards about New Zealand
retaining majority ownership were built into the sale agreement.
	   NZ First, ranking only 2-3 percent in opinion polls, is regarded
by National Party members as losers at the next election, which
would otherwise be expected in mid-1999.
	   Three recent polls in Peters' home electorate show he would
finish third in an election. Until now his home base has been
secure, another indication his party has worn out voter patience
with its antics in government.

Striking Hyundai autoworkers brace for police raid

<TEXT>
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of striking Hyundai Motor
Co. workers braced for a police raid Tuesday after the government
apparently failed to resolve a month-long labor dispute at the
nation's largest automaker.
	   Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho met with Hyundai's managers and union
leaders until past midnight Monday and asked both sides to submit
their final proposals by noon Tuesday. Neither side complied.
	   ``Both sides seem to choose a collision course. The government
has now exhausted all the means it can use. We see little prospect
of bringing a negotiated end to this dispute,'' said Lee Soo-yong,
an official at the Labor Ministry.
	   Kim In-hwan, a union leader, dismissed the minister's mediating
efforts as ``a face-saving gesture to justify a police
intervention.''
	   Kim said 5,000 striking workers and their families picketing
Hyundai's main plants in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles)
southeast of Seoul, were prepared for a police raid.
	   ``We're prepared to die. Losing jobs is like facing death,'' he
said.
	   An estimated 15,000 riot police were massed around Hyundai's
plants in Ulsan to evict the striking workers and their families.
Union members threatened to set fire to dozens of cars and piles of
tires and welding gear placed at the plant's entrances if police
tried to move in.
	   Militant workers armed with metal pipes confronted the police,
shouting ``We say no to layoffs!'' and ``We will fight to the
end!''
	   Dozens of housewives carrying children on their backs joined the
protest in the front rank. Police urged family members to move out
before the planned raid. At the plant's main entrance, brief
shoving matches erupted between workers and police but no serious
violence was reported.
	   Hyundai Motor, a key subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, the
nation's largest conglomerate, has been idle since July 20 when its
26,000-member union went on strike to protest spreading layoffs.
	   Hyundai's union wants the company to take back 1,600 workers it
fired July 31 because of sharply falling domestic sales.
	   The company, which earlier got rid of 6,100 workers by offering
them enhanced early retirement packages, insists it has to reduce
its work force in line with slumping demand for its cars.
	   Before starting his mediation effort in Ulsan Monday night, the
labor minister told reporters that the union must accept ``some
form of layoffs.''
	   ``The international market is closely watching how the Hyundai
dispute is handled. A flexible labor market is our promise to the
international community,'' he said.
	   A flexible labor market is a key part of reforms South Korea
promised to make in return for a dlrs 58 billion bailout package by
the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   The number of jobless people has since doubled to 1.5 million
and is expected to reach 2 million by year's end, a shock to South
Korean workers long accustomed to lifetime employment.
	   Hyundai's experience will set an example for other
conglomerates, including Samsung and LG, which reportedly plan to
shed up to 30,000 workers each by the end of this year.
	   The government views the Hyundai strike as illegal because
workers did not seek mandatory government mediation.
	   ``Our principle stands firm that we will never tolerate illegal
activities at work sites,'' said presidential spokesman Park
Ji-won, urging labor to accept layoffs.
	   Armed with court-issued arrest warrants, police were seeking 64
Hyundai union leaders.

Second East German sports doping trial opens with confession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS last graf to CORRECT trial resumes Wednesday &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's second doping trial against former East
German sports functionaries opened Tuesday with a doctor's
confession that he systematically administered
performance-enhancing drugs to female swimmers.
	   However, Dr. Ulrich Suender, 58, denied that he knowingly
damaged the health of the athletes, some as young as 12 at the
time.
	   He said he knew only a little about possible side-effects of
steroids, and had heard they were reversible anyway.
	   ``I believed that,'' he said.
	   Suender, a second doctor and three coaches are charged with
causing bodily harm to as many as 17 young female swimmers on East
Germany's TSC Berlin team from 1978 to 1989. Prosecutors say they
gave the drugs without telling the minors or their parents what
they were taking.
	   In one case, one of the former swimmer's hormonal balance was so
disrupted by the steroids, which she started taking at 13, that she
is now sterile. Others suffered such side-effects as deeper voices,
serious acne and excessive hair growth.
	   Suender testified that he had no reservations about providing
anabolic steroids in pill form to the team doctors, which was part
of his responsibility. He denied ever giving steroid injections.
	   Only once in his 15-year career did he suspect the steroids of
causing a health problem, he said, when a girl came to him with
acute liver problems.
	   He also insisted he was sworn to secrecy about the doping, even
when it came to the athletes themselves or their parents.
	   On trial with Suender are Dr. Dorit Roesler, 50, and coaches
Peter Mattonet, 48, Berndt Christochowitz, 40 and Klaus Klemenz,
55.
	   All have indicated they would testify before the court, meaning
no other witnesses likely will be called. A verdict could come as
early as Thursday.
	   Although they could get up to three years in prison, the
defendants were expected to receive suspended sentences or fines.
	   The first trial, which began March 18, involves coaches and
doctors from the former communist nation's showcase Dynamo Berlin
swim team.
	   Only one, Dr. Dinus Bieter, has made a partial confession. He
admitted in court last month that he administered anabolic steroids
to athletes, but insisted the doses were too small to cause
physical harm and that no one showed ill effects.
	   His case was severed last week from other five _ four coaches
and another doctor _ and resumes Monday, when a verdict could be
handed down. The trial for the others resumes Wednesday, but no
verdict was expected.

Sewage swamps Israel's Red Sea resort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EILAT, Israel (AP) - Beaches in Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat
remained closed Tuesday after a broken pipeline spewed raw sewage
into the sea, raising e-coli bacteria to 50 times the allowed
level.
	   Large amounts of flowed into the into the sea after the main
pipeline broke Saturday and the Health Ministry on Monday ordered
most of the beaches closed for the first time in the resort's
history.
	   The sewage sent tourists scampering for hotel pools after it
spilled onto the city's main thoroughfare, Hatmarim Street, a
tourism plaza, the local airport and into the sea, which is known
for its coral reefs.
	   Although the main was fixed Sunday, it leaked large amounts of
sewage again Monday for three hours during a test and Hatmarim
Street was closed.
	   The Health Ministry said Tuesday the pipeline had not yet been
fixed and the beaches would be closed for a few more days.
	   Eilat Mayor Gabi Kadosh warned that the sewage was scaring away
tourists, most of whom are Israelis at this time of the year.
	   ``Until this incident, we have never been forced to close all
the city's main beaches,'' Kadosh said. ``This will have serious
implications for tourism in Eilat.''
	   Kadosh hopes to get the city nominated as next year's host for
the Miss Universe pageant.

Second East German sports doping trial opens with confession

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's second doping trial against former East
German sports functionaries opened Tuesday with a doctor's
confession that he systematically administered
performance-enhancing drugs to female swimmers.
	   However, Dr. Ulrich Suender, 58, denied that he knowingly
damaged the health of the athletes, some as young as 12 at the
time.
	   He said he knew only a little about possible side-effects of
steroids, and had heard they were reversible anyway.
	   ``I believed that,'' he said.
	   Suender, a second doctor and three coaches are charged with
causing bodily harm to as many as 17 young female swimmers on East
Germany's TSC Berlin team from 1978 to 1989. Prosecutors say they
gave the drugs without telling the minors or their parents what
they were taking.
	   In one case, one of the former swimmer's hormonal balance was so
disrupted by the steroids, which she started taking at 13, that she
is now sterile. Others suffered such side-effects as deeper voices,
serious acne and excessive hair growth.
	   Suender testified that he had no reservations about providing
anabolic steroids in pill form to the team doctors, which was part
of his responsibility. He denied ever giving steroid injections.
	   Only once in his 15-year career did he suspect the steroids of
causing a health problem, he said, when a girl came to him with
acute liver problems.
	   He also insisted he was sworn to secrecy about the doping, even
when it came to the athletes themselves or their parents.
	   On trial with Suender are Dr. Dorit Roesler, 50, and coaches
Peter Mattonet, 48, Berndt Christochowitz, 40 and Klaus Klemenz,
55.
	   All have indicated they would testify before the court, meaning
no other witnesses likely will be called. A verdict could come as
early as Thursday.
	   Although they could get up to three years in prison, the
defendants were expected to receive suspended sentences or fines.
	   The first trial, which began March 18, involves coaches and
doctors from the former communist nation's showcase Dynamo Berlin
swim team.
	   Only one, Dr. Dinus Bieter, has made a partial confession. He
admitted in court last month that he administered anabolic steroids
to athletes, but insisted the doses were too small to cause
physical harm and that no one showed ill effects.
	   His case was severed last week from other five _ four coaches
and another doctor _ and resumes Monday, when a verdict could be
handed down. The trial for the others resumes Wednesday, but no
verdict was expected.

Chief rabbi asks pope to have crosses near Auschwitz removed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's chief rabbi on Tuesday asked the pope
to push for the removal of memorial crosses near Auschwitz, saying
it was ``a travesty'' to turn into a Christian shrine the former
Nazi death camp where more than 1 million Jews were killed.
	   Dozens of crosses have been erected in recent weeks in a small
field near Auschwitz by a conservative Roman Catholic group that
wants to honor 152 Poles killed by the Nazis.
	   Church officials have asked the group, inspired by an author of
anti-Semitic pamphlets, to stop, but to no avail.
	   Holocaust survivor groups and Israel's Foreign Ministry have
also asked for the removal of the crosses.
	   On Tuesday, Israel's chief Ashkenazi rabbi, Meir Israel Lau, met
in his office with a group of Catholic priests from Rome _ members
of the peace group St. Egidio _ and handed them a letter for Pope
John Paul II, who was born in Poland.
	   Lau would not make the letter public, saying he first wanted the
pope to read it. The rabbi, who as a young child was an inmate in
the Nazi concentration camp of Buchenwald, said he asked the pope
to intervene in the dispute.
	   ``Erecting crosses at this Jewish graveyard, and making it into
a Christian site twists history, distorting the past and misleading
future generations,'' Lau told The Associated Press.
	   ``We would like this place to be one where the only thing
screaming out is silence,'' said Lau. ``To make it into a Christian
site with crosses raised high is something of a travesty. The pope,
who... is more familiar with the issue than any of us, certainly
knows this was primarily a death camp for Jews.''
	   On Monday, Lau met with the Polish ambassador to Israel,
Wojciech Adameicki, and suggested that a memorial to thousands of
children who were burned to death at the camp be erected in place
of the crosses. Adameicki said Tuesday he handed Lau's letter to
Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek.
	   ``We appreciate Rabbi Lau's interest in the matter, his good
will and his understanding of the complexity of the matter... what
is important to remember is that the issue cannot be solved in one
day,'' said Adameicki.
	   The Polish government recently indicated it would stay out of
the dispute and leave it up to the Roman Catholic church to deal
with the issue.
	   The cross controversy began in 1988 when a 26-foot (8-meter)
wooden cross, used in a 1979 mass celebrated at Auschwitz by the
pope, was erected at a Carmelite nunnery that adjoined the camp. In
recent weeks, more than 50 smaller crosses have been erected at the
site.
	   In 1993, the pope resolved another dispute regarding Auschwitz
when he asked nuns to move out of the Carmelite convent they had
established at the edge of the camp.
	   About 1.5 million people were killed at Auschwitz in
Nazi-occupied Poland in World War II, 90 percent of them Jews.

Egypt denies reports of Abu Nidal arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS starting graf 14 comments from Arafat, Israeli government
spokesman. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian security officials on Tuesday
denied that master terrorist Abu Nidal had been arrested in Egypt,
responding to news reports and several days of rumors that the
one-time Palestinian guerrilla was in custody.
	   They also said that followers of Abu Nidal _ the nom de guerre
of Sabri al-Banna _ had not been detained in Egypt.
	   The security officials spoke to The Associated Press on
customary condition their names not be used. A similar denial was
carried on Egypt's Middle East News Agency, quoting a security
source who called the reports ``untrue and baseless.''
	   The reports, by a foreign news agency Monday and the Arabic
daily Al-Hayat's Tuesday edition, also quoted unnamed sources. They
included comments by Egyptian and Palestinian officials denying any
knowledge of such an arrest.
	   Abu Nidal's capture would be a major victory for anti-terrorist
authorities. The U.S. State Department lists his group as ``the
most dangerous terrorist organization in existence,'' blamed for
killing 300 people and wounding 650 in 20 countries since 1973.
	   Rumors of Abu Nidal's alleged arrest in Egypt have been
circulating in the Palestinian community in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip as well as in Lebanon.
	   Some Palestinian sources said he was seized a month ago while
coming from Libya. Others said henchman of the terrorist leader
were arrested but not the man himself. All the sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   There has been no official confirmation of any of the reports,
and checks with sources in the U.S. intelligence community in
Washington turned up no one who had heard of such an arrest.
	   Abu Nidal's prime targets were Israelis, but he was accused in
recent years of becoming a hit man for various Arab regimes who
backed him. He also murdered close allies of Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat after he broke with Arafat in
the mid-1970s, accusing the PLO chief of weakness in confronting
Israel.
	   Abu Nidal _ the name means ``Father of Struggle'' in Arabic _ is
61 and was born in Jaffa, now on Israel's Mediterranean coast. He
has operated from Iraq, Syria and Libya.
	   His group was blamed for the Dec. 27, 1985, twin attacks on
ticket counters of the Israeli airline El Al at Rome and Vienna
airports. The seven attackers killed 18 people and wounded 120
others.
	   Abu Nidal also has been accused of the bombings of a Pan Am
jetliner on the ground at Rome Airport in 1973 that killed 32
passengers and of a TWA jet over the Aegean Sea the following year
that killed all 88 people aboard.
	   His group also has been blamed for a long string of attacks on
Western diplomats and Jewish worshipers stretching from Europe to
the Middle East.
	   In Gaza, Arafat was asked about reports of the alleged arrests
and replied: ``I have no information on that.''
	   In Israel, David Bar Illan, a senior adviser to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netnayahu, had a similar comment.
	   ``We have no knowledge of it,'' he said.

Malaysian government may support stock market, says PM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Warning that speculative attacks
on developing countries may spread, Malaysia's prime minister said
Tuesday that his government is examining ways to reinvigorate the
country's flagging stock market.
	   ``If we had more money, we may buy shares to raise the value of
the shares,'' Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told reporters after
a Labor Day address.
	   He said the government plans to use the state-run Tabung Haji, a
fund helping Muslims save enough money to make the pilgrimage to
Mecca, to help shore up the faltering stock market.
	   Hong Kong authorities have been intervening to support the
beleaguered Hang Seng Index, Mahathir said, adding that his
administration is now studying how Taiwan supports its stock market
during bouts of heavy selling pressure.
	   The Taiwanese government often asks state-linked companies and
funds to refrain from dumping stocks during runs on the market.
	   Following Mahathir's remarks, the prices of Malaysian stocks on
Tuesday sank to their lowest level yet in 10 years, dealers said.
Shares on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange have shed over 75 percent
in value since last February.
	   Nevertheless, the dealers noted that continuing uncertainties in
the global currency market after Russia devalued the ruble on
Monday may also have discouraged investors from venturing into the
Malaysian bourse.
	   Mahathir's proposal to use the Tabung Haji pilgrimage fund
appears to have won a degree of support from Malaysia's majority
Muslim community.
	   ``It should be supported as long as there aren't any
malpractices or fraud, if the fund doesn't get cheated or forced''
to buy shares, said Subky Latif, a spokesman for the opposition
Islamic Party Of Malaysia.
	   ``Muslims' assets should be protected and expanded. This is a
good deed,'' he added.
	   On Monday, Prime Minister's Department Minister Abdul Hamid
Othman said these investments are in line with the government's
policy of helping local companies. He didn't say how much money the
pilgrims' fund would invest.
	   Mahathir's move to prop up Malaysian shares using the pilgrimage
fund runs consistent with his belief that Malaysia will have to
look after itself.
	   The premier has repeatedly stressed that Malaysia could no
longer depend on ``foreign interests'' that are out to destabilize
developing countries, including his Southeast Asian nation.
	   Foreign currency speculators, Mahathir has argued, use the
global financial markets to wipe out wealth and topple governments.
	   In Southeast Asia, only Mahathir and Singapore's Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong, have managed to stay in office over the last year or
so.

Palestinians say Lewinsky affair harms peace process

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Top Palestinian officials voiced concern
Tuesday that U.S. President Bill Clinton's confession in a sex
scandal will weaken him to the point that he will be unable to
pressure Israel in the stalled Mideast peace process.
	   ``Obviously we have been paying the price of a besieged
administration incapable of taking bold positions in the peace
process,'' said Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi.
	   ``The peace process has been paying the price of a shaken
president and the diversion of attention,'' said Ashrawi who until
last month served in the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   When Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was asked in Gaza Tuesday
if he believed Clinton's admission would impede his efforts to
advance the peace process, he only said: ``We hope not.''

	   AUGHER, Northern Ireland (AP) _ This tiny, grieving village on
Tuesday laid to rest a mother and her young daughter in a church
graveyard on a hill _ the first in a long line of funerals for 28
victims of a terrorist car bombing.
	   As the funeral ended, Prince Charles arrived in Northern Ireland
to bring royal condolences to Omagh, the shattered town from where
a 500-pound (200 kg) exploded Saturday, killing mostly women and
children in the worst atrocity in three decades of sectarian
conflict.
	   Charles was to visit some of the 220 people injured in the
blast, and tour the shattered Market Street of Omagh, 15 miles (24
kms) from here. He was met an air base near the capital, Belfast,
by Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos, in this
British province because two Spaniards were among the victims.
	   The coffins of 30-year-old Avril Monaghan, pregnant with twins,
and her 18-month-old daughter Maura made the short trip from the
family home down a tree-lined lane flanked by mourners in total
silence. The mother's brown wooden casket dwarfed the small white
one in the flower-laden black hearse.
	   During the Requiem Mass in St. Macartan's Catholic church in
Augher, the congregation, which included Mrs. Monaghan's husband,
Michael, and their three other young children, sang, ``My soul is
longing for your peace.'' Men and women, their heads bowed, stood
among gravestones outside listening to the service.
	   Mrs. Monaghan's mother, Mary Grimes, 65, was also killed.
	   At dawn Monday, police arrested five people in connection with
the attack, suspected to be the work of the ``Real IRA.'' The group
comprises defectors from the Irish Republican Army opposed to
April's peace agreement providing for power-sharing between
Protestants and Catholics in this British province.
	   Under British anti-terrorist law, the five can be interrogated
for up to a week before being released or charged.
	   The Rev. James Grimes, one of the priests who celebrated the
Mass and who is Mrs. Monaghan's uncle, prayed that the Omagh
tragedy ``would be the last of the terrible agonies our people have
suffered over the past 30 years.''
	   ``Her faith was strong,'' he said of his niece. ``That faith
always showed in the smile and the happiness and the care and the
love of Avril.''
	   Reflecting a people in mourning, the Bishop of Clogher, the Most
Rev. Joseph Duffy, told the congregation, ``We are bereaved as a
nation ... Protestant and Catholic.''
	   In Belfast, several thousand people turned out for a lunchtime
open-air service.
	   ``This is a time for prayers, not speeches,'' said Lord Mayor
David Alderdice before the crowd stood in silent tribute. ``A time
to be quiet and to listen to the still, small voice.''
	   On Monday night, the Irish Republic town of Buncrana almost came
to a standstill as hearses brought home the coffins of three local
boys killed in the bombing _ James Barker, 12, Sean McLoughlin, 11,
and Oran Doherty, 8.

 &UR; Eds: American diplomats try hard to set up Kosovo peace talks
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albanians declining to meet government officials
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian negotiators refused
to meet their Serb counterparts Friday for talks on the future of
Kosovo, despite intense efforts by American diplomats to bring the
two sides together.
	   The U.S. diplomatic initiative was headed by envoy Christopher
Hill, who first met with the designated Albanian negotiators, then
conferred separately with Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader
despised by the Kosovo rebels.
	   A letter sent by Fehmi Agani, the chief Albanian negotiator, to
Ratko Markovic, his Serbian opposite number, made clear that no
talks would take place, at least on Tuesday.
	   ``In your letter yesterday, you expressed the wish that our
talks continue as soon as possible,'' Agani wrote, referring to
negotiations that were broken off in May following a Serbian
offensive in the embattled province.
	   ``However, I have pointed out the necessity that violence stop
against the Albanian civilian population and that the police
repression'' is halted, Agani said.
	   ``If you have nothing to say about this, maybe it would be
beneficial to stop this game with invitations to meet, apparently
timed to serve propaganda,'' he added.
	   Even if and when the two sides meet, prospects are dim.
	   The negotiations are being boycotted by ethnic Albanian
opposition parties and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for
independence of the Serbian province, where Albanians account for
90 percent of the population of 2 million. Kosovo is in Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Rugova announced the Albanians' negotiating team last week, but
it comprises only his own associates.
	   Earlier in the day, Agani said he and his team want an ``end of
repression against the Albanians and the withdrawal of the
(Serbian) forces'' from Kosovo before a ``meaningful dialogue'' can
begin.
	   On Tuesday, there were no fresh reports of fighting, which ebbed
Monday, following a weekend push when Serbian forces captured a
series of key Albanian strongholds.
	   Tanjug said Monday that Serbian police ``crushed'' KLA bases in
the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all on the outskirts of
the province's second city of Pec on Sunday.
	   The United Nations now estimates that more than 231,000 people
have been uprooted in the six months since the conflict began. Many
of them have fled across the mountainous border with Albanian,
where the KLA also maintains bases.

UNICEF: inability to get visas hindering famine relief efforts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Efforts to increase food aid to people in
famine-hit southern Sudan are being hindered by government delays
in granting travel permits to foreign aid workers, the U.N.
children's agency said Tuesday.
	   The inability to get visas is preventing some 40 extra medical
and logistics staff from UNICEF and other agencies from increasing
the number of feeding centers in Wau, the capital of the hard-hit
Bahr al-Ghazal region, Geneva-based UNICEF spokesman Patrick
McCormick said.
	   Nearly 80 percent of youngsters in the town are registered as
undernourished, McCormick said. Wau currently has six feeding
centers - UNICEF and other organizations want to at least double
this number.
	   Normally, getting permits for aid workers from the government in
Khartoum takes a fortnight, McCormick said. But difficulties being
experienced at the moment mean the process is taking longer. The
spokesman couldn't say what the problems are.
	   ``At the moment there is something going on which means there is
a backlog,'' McCormick said. ``We are urging them to do this
quickly. It's another example of the continuing difficulties that
have been put in our way in dealing with this famine.''
	   The Associated Press was unable Tuesday to contact the Sudanese
government for comment.
	   Since April, more than 70,000 people have entered the town, with
the daily number of arrivals now standing at 400, UNICEF says.
	   During the first week of August, UNICEF recorded 453 deaths at
reception centers in the area, but says it believes the toll is now
much higher.
	   Sudan's civil war started in 1983 when rebels took up arms
against the Muslim government in the north to demand more autonomy
for Christian and animist people in the south.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in the battles and
famines caused by them.
	   As of last month, 700,000 civilians faced starvation in Bahr
al-Ghazal's rebel-controlled areas.
	   International aid agencies have estimated 1.5 million people
face starvation across southern Sudan, about half in Bahr al-Ghazal
state where Wau sits on a plain of grass and bush, 1,000 kilometers
(620 miles) south of the capital, Khartoum.
	   Agencies have faced continued problems in supplying aid.
	   Southern Sudan lacks roads, airstrips and other basic
infrastructure. The Sudanese government has banned the use of
military transport aircraft, which have the largest capacity for
aid drops, to fly into southern Sudan because it claims rebels
could use them to ship in weapons.
	   Government forces often loot or burn food stocks if they fear
rebels will get them.
	   Under pressure from aid agencies, the United Nations and foreign
donors, the government and rebels from the Sudan People's
Liberation Army agreed in July to a three-month cease-fire and the
establishment of safe corridors for delivery of relief supplies.
	   But the World Food Program has expressed doubts that the
cease-fire can help.

Infant takes part in bull run, Spanish police seeking dad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEGANES, Spain (AP) _ Police are hunting for two men who took
part in a Pamplona-style running of the bulls with small children
in tow, one of them an infant.
	   The suspects were spotted Monday among a crowd pouring into the
bull ring in this town outside Madrid on the second day of a yearly
festival.
	   One of the men had a months-old baby in his arms, town hall
spokesman Santiago Llorente said. Another ran in with two children,
who looked to be three and five years old, holding their hands.
	   Llorente said he did not know if the children were boys or
girls.
	   Running with bulls is a centuries-old Spanish tradition that
found its most illustrious foreign aficionado in Ernest Hemingway,
who wrote about it in ``The Sun Also Rises.''
	   Spain's most famous bull running festival is held every July in
the northern city of Pamplona.
	   In Leganes, a pack of four fighting-class bulls and six oxen
lumber along a 600-meter route stretching from a holding pen to the
bull ring, accompanied by several thousand thrill-seekers. The
animals' run takes about a minute and 40 seconds.
	   Less-daring humans wait just outside the bull ring and scurry in
once they hear the pop of a small rocket, which signals that the
bulls have been released at the other end.
	   The two Leganes men being sought by police were among that
crowd, and were never actually near any bulls. Once they entered
the ring, they ran up into the stands, officials said.
	   Still, they exposed their children to the other big danger in a
bull run -- a human stampede at the entrance to the ring.
	   ``If someone had fallen, and there had been a pileup, and the
bulls had arrived, there would have been a problem,'' Llorente
said.
	   The town hall can fine the men up to two million pesetas for
endangering the lives of children. Llorente said the mayor wants to
throw the book at them.
	   Police are searching for them with the help of physical
descriptions provided by witnesses.
	   Llorente said that rather than trying to make their children
young daredevils, the men maybe just wanted to save a buck. It
costs 500 pesetas (dlrs 3.30) for a seat at the ring to watch the
animals and runners enter. But the runners themselves get in free.

Fight under way to recover missing pages of famed WWII diary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS throughout, ADDS background, quotes. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ They could be the biting words of
any spirited teen-ager scribbling grouchily about her parents in
her diary.
	   But when the author is the late Jewish diarist Anne Frank, and
her harrowing account of two years in hiding from the Nazis is an
international bestseller in 55 languages, even the banal takes on
special significance.
	   Startled scholars who thought they'd published the complete
``Diary of Anne Frank'' said Tuesday there's more to the story:
Five handwritten pages they didn't even know were missing have
turned up.
	   The discovery has touched off a legal battle for their return _
and added intrigue in the ongoing search to know as much as
possible about what amused and anguished the young girl who
unwittingly became the voice of the Holocaust.
	   The pages, in which Anne gives a harsh assessment of her
parents' marriage, were found to be in the possession of a former
employee of the Anne Frank Foundation, the Netherlands State
Institute for War Documentation disclosed Tuesday.
	   The foundation and the Netherlands State Institute for War
Documentation issued a joint demand for their return and said they
have hired a lawyer.
	   Once the pages are recovered, they will be included in a
forthcoming new edition of the famed diary, said David Barnouw, a
spokesman for the war documentation center who helped compile an
unabridged version of Anne's journal.
	   ``We thought we had a complete edition. Now this pops up,''
Barnouw said. He added: ``I don't doubt the authenticity of these
pages.''
	   Anne's diary, a modern literary classic that has become required
reading in schools worldwide, has inspired numerous books, films
and a hit Broadway musical. In it, Anne chronicles how she and her
family hid in a secret annex hidden behind a movable bookcase in an
Amsterdam canal house.
	   The house itself, which has been carefully preserved and
restored, is one of the Dutch capital's top tourist attractions and
draws several hundred thousand visitors each year.
	   The diary has become an enduring symbol of the human faces
behind the Nazis' extermination of the Jews.
	   It trails off in August 1944, just before the Franks were
betrayed and Anne was arrested and hauled off to the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp. Starving and freezing, she died there of
typhoid in the spring of 1945, just weeks before the camp was
liberated.
	   Because her story has attracted such attention over the years,
researchers assumed they had a definitive version of her diary and
were taken by surprise to learn of the existence of more pages.
	   In the five in question, Anne writes about her parents'
relationship in ``very critical'' terms, the war documentation
center said in a statement. It refused to release the pages or even
to elaborate, citing ``the sensitive nature of the material.''
	   The man now holding the pages said Anne's father, Otto Frank,
gave them to him shortly before his death in 1980. His name was not
released, and there was nothing to indicate that he had done
anything wrong.
	   Even so, ``it is highly improbable that Otto Frank made a gift
of this original manuscript to this former employee,'' the war
documentation center said. ``Rather, he may have just handed him
the pages to prevent the contents from becoming public.''
	   It was Otto Frank, the only family member to survive the war,
who first published the diary in 1947. He is known to have withheld
a few portions dealing with his marriage, wishing to keep some
aspects of the family's life private.
	   Complicating matters, Anne had begun rewriting her diary on
loose sheets of paper that easily could have been lost or
confiscated in the aftermath of her betrayal and arrest.
	   Although the version most-read by schoolchildren is known to be
abridged, other versions were believed to have been complete.
Barnouw said he couldn't rule out the possibility that still more
pages might be missing from the diary.
	   ``That's one of our biggest questions,'' he said. ``And we
thought we had the whole story.''

Ukrainian central bank raises interest rate amid concerns over
</HEADLINE>
hryvna &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tuesday's hryvna rate. TRIMS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The central bank raised a key interest rate
by 10 percent on Tuesday to respond to financial turmoil in
neighboring Russia that is putting pressure on the Ukrainian
currency.
	   ``It is rather a psychological form of reaction to the market's
financial situation,'' said National Bank chairman Viktor
Yushchenko, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The increase brought the Lombard rate to 92 percent from 82
percent.
	   Ukrainian officials are concerned that the Russian ruble's
dramatic plunge would also undermine the Ukrainian currency, the
hryvna, which also fell sharply on Monday following the Russian
devaluation announcement.
	   ``The National Bank board is worried by the possible
consequences of the Russian ruble's devaluation, although its
downfall to a certain level is not threatening us,'' Yushchenko
said in an interview published Tuesday by the government's Uryadovy
Kurier newspaper.
	   ``But the ruble's collapse might lead to a devaluation of the
hryvna or tough monetary policies,'' he said.
	   President Leonid Kuchma has ordered Yushchenko and Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko to maintain the stability of the
country's financial system and prevent the hryvna from falling.
	   Early Tuesday, top economic officials held a meeting chaired by
Pustovoitenko to discuss Ukraine's financial situation, which they
called relatively stable.
	   On Monday, however, the hryvna fell to 2.1805 to the U.S.
dollar, down from 2.1435 to the dollar last week. It traded at
2.1885 to the dollar Tuesday.
	   The hryvna has been falling steadily this year under strong
pressure from foreign investors, who have withdrawn an estimated
dlrs 2 billion from the country.
	   Efforts by the National Bank to defend the currency resulted in
a sharp fall in its reserves from dlrs 2.34 billion at the
beginning of the year to dlrs 1.15 billion as of last week.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
paid tribute Tuesday to bombing victims and embassy staffers on a
whirlwind visit to East Africa, and promised to track down the
perpetrators.
	   ``Together, we promise to bring to justice the murderers of our
friends,'' she told American and Tanzanian workers at the bomb-hit
U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   Officials in Tanzania and Kenya, where she arrived next, also
hoped she would produce new aid for their countries, where the Aug.
7 terrorist blasts killed 257 people in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   FBI agents, meanwhile, pushed ahead with their all-out
investigation into the bombings. Contrary to other reports, the FBI
and Kenyan police said Monday that a suspect who was returned from
Pakistan had not admitted any role in the crimes or implicated
anyone else after three days of questioning.
	   Albright, arriving after a 16-hour flight, spent about five
hours in Tanzania before heading to Nairobi in a small plane when
an engine of the Boeing 747 she had flown in from Washington
overheated.
	   She was scheduled to lay flowers at the bombed embassy, talk to
Kenyan embassy guards and others who survived the blast and meet
with President Daniel arap Moi in a five-hour visit before
returning home.
	   In Dar es Salaam, she laid a wreath next to the crater left by
the embassy blast that killed 10 people. Then she handed a folded
American flag to U.S. Marines and, wearing a white construction
hard hat, toured the damage inside.
	   Reporters also were allowed inside for the first time since the
explosion and found broken glass and smashed furniture scattered
throughout the embassy.
	   Albright helped hang a poster advertising a reward of up to dlrs
2 million for information leading to the bombers' arrest.
	   She then lavished praise, and the State Department's award for
heroism, on embassy staffers before meeting with bombing victims at
the Muhimbili Medical Center and with government officials.
	   ``America is very proud of you, all of you _ Americans and
Tanzanians,'' she told the staffers. ``I am truly in the presence
of heroes.''
	   Albright announced a gift of 500 pounds (225 kilograms) of
medical supplies to Tanzania and Kenya from the Walter Reed Army
Medical Center. She also pledged to ask Congress to approve a
still-undetermined amount of emergency funding to pay for
re-establishing embassy operations in Tanzania and Kenya and to
compensate victims' families.
	   Officials in the two African countries are counting on
substantial compensation along with assurances of aid for the
governments, whose key tourism industries were dealt a blow by the
bombings.
	   But Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete, speaking at a
joint news conference with Albright, said there are no ill feelings
in Tanzania toward Americans because of their handling of the
rescue, as there are among some Kenyans.
	   ``The bomb blast has not generated any hatred against ...
Americans in Tanzania,'' he said. ``We are friends.''
	   He also urged Albright to tell Americans that Tanzania is safe
and they should continue visiting and investing in the country.
	   Albright told the foreign minister the American people share in
the profound sorrow of the Tanzanians and said the United States
will maintain its presence throughout Africa and throughout the
world.
	   ``These bombings will not cause America to back down or
retreat,'' she declared.
	   The head of the FBI investigation in Dar es Salaam, Kenneth
Piernick, said the bureau has questioned more than 100 people
there, but indicated that most of the interrogations had led
nowhere.
	   ``Right now my evidence is scant, and I'm not going to draw
conclusions based on that,'' he said. He would not elaborate, or
comment on whether two suspects remained in detention, as was
previously reported.
	   In Nairobi, a top Kenyan police official denied a newspaper
report that more arrests had been made there. Officials said last
week that six people were in custody for questioning about the
bombing.
	   About 200 Americans _ nonessential U.S. Embassy staff and their
families _ left Pakistan today on orders from Washington following
a ``pattern of threats'' against Americans there since the Africa
bombings. The diplomats were flown to Brussels, Belgium. Other
Americans have also been urged to leave.

Magazine: German media giant eying U.S. network
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUETERSLOH, Germany (AP) _ After expanding its U.S. presence in
book publishing and the Internet, German media giant Bertelsmann AG
is turning its attention to television, a magazine reported
Tuesday.
	   In an interview with Manager magazine, Bertelsmann chairman Mark
Woessner said he wants to develop the media group's Europe-based
CLT-Ufa broadcast unit into a global player in the next few years.
	   The monthly magazine also quoted an unidentified Bertelsmann
manager as saying the U.S. network CBS would be ``a perfect fit.''
	   The magazine also reported Bertelsmann sales in fiscal 1998,
which ended June 30, will be flat at 22.4 billion marks (dlrs 12.6
billion), while operating profit will rise to a record 1.73 billion
marks (dlrs 972 million) on the back of portfolio adjustments _
divisions sold or spun off.
	   Woessner called the sales figures satisfactory, but said profits
weren't.
	   Operating profit in fiscal 1997 was 1.61 billion marks on sales
of 22.4 billion marks.
	   Costs from buying U.S. book publisher Random House and the
Internet service provider CompuServe hurt the 1998 operating profit
by 200 million to 300 million marks (dlrs 112 million to dlrs 169
million), he said.
	   Problems in Bertelsmann's book and music divisions are also
weighing on the 1998 results, Woessner said.
	   Meanwhile, Japan's financial crisis is weighing on the result of
Bertelsmann's BMG music unit, Woessner said.
	   Bertelsmann is expanding its electronic media activities with
plans to start selling books via the Internet in November.
	   The company is in talks over a possible cooperation with U.S.
Internet book seller Amazon.Com and U.S. book retailer Barnes &AMP;
Noble Inc., Bertelsmann said.
	   A company spokesman said details in the article were correct.
Bertelsmann will officially announce its earnings in September.

Palestinians say Lewinsky affair harms peace process

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Top Palestinian officials worried Tuesday that
U.S. President Bill Clinton's confession in a sex scandal will
weaken him to the point that he will be unable to pressure Israel
in the stalled Mideast peace process.
	   ``Obviously we have been paying the price of a besieged
administration incapable of taking bold positions in the peace
process,'' said Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi.
	   ``The peace process has been paying the price of a shaken
president and the diversion of attention,'' said Ashrawi who until
last month served in the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   When Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was asked Tuesday in Gaza
if he believed Clinton's admission would impede his efforts to
advance the peace process, he only said: ``We hope not.''

Egypt denies reports of Abu Nidal arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Arafat, Israeli comment at end. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian security officials on Tuesday
denied that master terrorist Abu Nidal had been arrested in Egypt,
responding to news reports and several days of rumors that the
one-time Palestinian guerrilla was in custody.
	   They also said that followers of Abu Nidal _ the nom de guerre
of Sabri al-Banna _ had not been detained in Egypt.
	   The security officials spoke to The Associated Press on
customary condition of anonymity. A similar denial was carried on
Egypt's Middle East News Agency, quoting a security source who
called the reports ``untrue and baseless.''
	   The reports, by a foreign news agency Monday and the Arabic
daily Al-Hayat's Tuesday edition, also quoted unnamed sources. They
included comments by Egyptian and Palestinian officials denying any
knowledge of such an arrest.
	   Abu Nidal's capture would be a major victory for anti-terrorist
authorities. The U.S. State Department lists his group as ``the
most dangerous terrorist organization in existence,'' blamed for
killing 300 people and wounding 650 in 20 countries since 1973.
	   Rumors of Abu Nidal's alleged arrest in Egypt have been
circulating in the Palestinian community in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip as well as in Lebanon.
	   Abu Nidal's prime targets were Israelis, but he was accused in
recent years of becoming a hit man for various Arab regimes who
backed him.
	   Abu Nidal _ the name means ``Father of Struggle'' in Arabic _ is
61 and was born in Jaffa, now on Israel's Mediterranean coast. He
has operated from Iraq, Syria and Libya.
	   His group was blamed for the Dec. 27, 1985, twin attacks on
ticket counters of the Israeli airline El Al at the Rome and Vienna
airports. The seven attackers killed 18 people and wounded 120
others.
	   Abu Nidal also has been accused of the bombings of a Pan Am
jetliner on the ground at Rome Airport in 1973 that killed 32
passengers and of a TWA jet over the Aegean Sea the following year
that killed all 88 people aboard.
	   His group also has been blamed for a long string of attacks on
Western diplomats and Jewish worshipers stretching from Europe to
the Middle East.
	   In Gaza, Arafat was asked about reports of the alleged arrests
and replied: ``I have no information on that.''
	   In Israel, David Bar Illan, a senior adviser to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netnayahu, had a similar comment.
	   ``We have no knowledge of it,'' he said.

Sewage swamps Israel's Red Sea resort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EILAT, Israel (AP) _ Beaches in Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat
remained closed Tuesday after a broken pipeline spewed raw sewage
into the sea, raising e-coli bacteria to 50 times the allowed
level.
	   Large amounts of flowed into the into the sea after the main
pipeline broke Saturday and the Health Ministry on Monday ordered
most of the beaches closed for the first time in the resort's
history.
	   Tourists scampered for hotel pools after the sewage spilled onto
the city's main thoroughfare, Hatmarim Street, a tourism plaza, the
local airport and into the sea, which is known for its coral reefs.
	   Although the main was fixed Sunday, it leaked large amounts of
sewage again Monday for three hours during a test and Hatmarim
Street was closed.
	   The Health Ministry said Tuesday the pipeline had not yet been
fixed and the beaches would be closed for a few more days.
	   Eilat Mayor Gabi Kadosh warned that the sewage was scaring away
tourists, most of whom are Israelis at this time of the year.
	   ``Until this incident, we have never been forced to close all
the city's main beaches,'' Kadosh said. ``This will have serious
implications for tourism in Eilat.''
	   Kadosh hopes the city will be nominated to host next year's Miss
Universe pageant.

Pilot jailed for two years for helping businessman Asil Nadir
</HEADLINE>
escape Britain

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A man who helped indicted businessman Asil Nadir
escape Britain in a sensational flight to northern Cyprus was
jailed for two years Tuesday.
	   Peter Dimond, 57, was convicted Aug. 3 at the Old Bailey for
obstructing justice by enabling Nadir, the former chairman of
collapsed food and electronics conglomerate Polly Peck, to flee the
reaches of British law in 1993.
	   ``At best you were naive,'' Judge Michael Hyam told Dimond, who
is a qualified pilot. ``At worst, you showed a cynical disregard to
the effect your actions might have on the administration of
justice.''
	   Nadir's escape, four months before he was scheduled to face
trial on charges of theft, was a wild climax to one of Britain's
more dramatic boom-and-bust stories. Polly Peck grew dramatically
in the early 1980s, but eventually collapsed in 1991 with debts of
dlrs 2.1 billion after investigators began probing irregularities
in Nadir's finances.
	   Nadir claimed he could not get a fair trial in Britain and in
May 1993 he jumped dlrs 5.2 million bail to flee the country.
Dimond arranged for a light aircraft to fly Nadir to northern
France, where the businessman boarded an executive jet bound for
northern Cyprus, a self-proclaimed nation recognized only by
Turkey.
	   Dimond did no flying on the journey, but accompanied Nadir and
remained with him in Cyprus until January 1998, when he returned to
Britain on business and was arrested.
	   Nadir still faces 13 charges of theft in Britain involving 30
million pounds, or about dlrs 48 million, from his companies. But
Britain has little chance of bringing Nadir to trial _ it has no
extradition treaty with northern Cyprus and Turkey has refused to
send him.
	   While Dimond has denied any wrongdoing, he said during his trial
that he believed Nadir had been treated unfairly by British
authorities and needed a chance to prepare his case before
returning to Britain to face trial.
	   ``I always thought it would be sorted. I never doubted his
integrity,'' Dimond told the court during his trial.

 &UR; Floods threaten major cities, oil field in northeast China
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with flooding, evacuations in
Harbin

<TEXT>
	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Soldiers struggled to keep a rain-swollen
river out of a key Chinese industrial center Tuesday after raging
waters two stories high submerged tourist sites on a nearby island.
	   The Songhua river washed over its banks in Harbin and threatened
to devastate the northeastern provincial capital of 9 million, but
hundreds of soldiers and police built a 1.5-meter-high
(5-foot-high) restraining wall of metal rods and wood planks.
	   Families fearing more torrential rains fled low-lying areas of
the city to camp in small tents by the roadside.
	   With the Songhua at a record 120.44 meters (397 1/2 feet) and
rising, Harbin braced for potentially the worst flooding in 50
years expected Wednesday.
	   As more than 260,000 people worked to protect Harbin, millions
manning dikes along the Yangtze River in central China held their
breath as flood waters crested for the sixth time this summer.
	   Embankments made higher by weeks of sandbagging contained the
record-high waters as the flood crest passed through areas
waterlogged by weeks of rain and flooding, state media reported.
Officials apparently put aside for now plans to dynamite some dikes
to save cities downstream.
	   Seasonal rains that began earlier and fell heavier than usual
have produced the worst flooding on the Yangtze in 44 years. More
than 2,000 people have died nationwide in the flooding and millions
have been made homeless.
	   Vice Premier Li Lanqing convened a meeting early Tuesday of the
State Council, the Cabinet, to check on efforts to prevent
outbreaks of disease in flooded areas.
	   China Central Television showed footage of medical teams
examining flood victims, distributing medicines and putting
purification chemicals in vats of drinking water.
	   The ruling Communist Party's No. 2 and No. 3 leaders _
legislative chairman Li Peng and Premier Zhu Rongji _ separately
telephoned officials in northeastern Jilin province to make sure
they were prepared for more flooding, the Xinhua News Agency said.
	   In Jilin, 155,000 people were evacuated last week from Tongyu
county in flooding on tributaries of the Nen River that destroyed
two rail lines, Xinhua reported.
	   In neighboring Heilongjiang province, flood waters already
washed over roads and rail lines connecting Harbin city with
Daqing, a city servicing China's largest oil field.
	   The Songhua rolled over Sun Island leaving just the bridge
connecting it to Harbin peaking above the waters. Soldiers
evacuated more than 700 families and 52 businesses from the island
_ famed for a winter festival of ice sculptures and sports. Also
moved were 52 Siberian tigers from a breeding center on the island.
	   More than 270,000 soldiers, oil workers and other civilians were
working night and day to prevent the Nen River from overwhelming
the Daqing oil fields.
	   The Nen punched a 50-meter-wide (50-yard-wide) hole in one
embankment Monday, and soldiers worked to repair it and build up
another dike that would be the final defense for the oil field and
the 2.3 million people of the city of Daqing.
	   Floods have inundated 1,391 wells, and production also has been
halted at an additional 280 wells, the official China Daily
reported.

<TEXT>
	   MERSA MATROUH, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday
discussed the stalled Middle East peace process with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Arafat told journalists that the two leaders discussed the
freeze in peace talks and Israel's refusal to accept a U.S.
proposal on troop withdrawals from the West Bank.
	   ``We have accepted this proposal, even though it does not comply
with all of the Palestinian needs.... But until now the Israelis
have not accepted it,'' Arafat said after two hours of talks with
Mubarak.
	   The two met at an undisclosed location near the airport in Mersa
Matrouh, a beach resort on the Mediterranean Sea 270 kilometers
(160 miles) west of Alexandria.
	   Mubarak did not speak to journalists.
	   The talks come amid rising Palestinian frustration over Israel's
refusal to accept the U.S. proposal, which calls for an additional
13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Israel has rejected the proposal citing security concerns.
	   Arafat also said the two discussed an Egyptian-French plan to
call an international summit to try to get the negotiations back on
track. The summit would involve Arab and Western nations but would
initially exclude Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty
with Israel and has long served as a mediator in Arab-Israeli
talks. Arafat often visits Egypt to consult with Mubarak.

Symcox hit 51 off 39 balls in South Africa's 244-7
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Pat Symcox hit a whirlwind 51 off
just 39 balls against England Tuesday to give South Africa an
outside chance of qualifying for the triangular limited-overs
series final.
	   Symcox hammered four sixes and two boundaries as South Africa _
needing to beat England by more than 47 runs to qualify for the
final _ scored 244 for seven in its allotted 50 overs after winning
the toss and electing to bat first.
	   Symcox and Shaun Pollock, 22 not out, figured in a 69-run stand
off just 59 balls after South Africa had been struggling on 172 for
six in the 40th over.
	   Symcox took 17 runs, inclusive of two sixes and a boundary off
successive balls, in one Peter Martin over as South Africa belted
46 runs off the last five overs.
	   England's first task at hand will be to score 198 runs to
qualify for the final. Regardless of the result, that score will
give the home side a positive net run rate and a place in the final
against Sri Lanka at Lord's on Thursday.
	   After medium paceman Darren Gough had claimed the two openers,
Gary Kirsten and Mike Rindel, in the space of nine balls, Daryll
Cullinan and Jonty Rhodes began to repair the damage with a 48-run
third wicket stand.
	   But the introduction of Alan Mullally removed Rhodes (15) before
Cullinan and skipper Hansie Cronje settled down to stabilize the
innings.
	   Cullinan moved into top gear with an almost a run-a-ball 70
before Gough returned for his second spell to take Cullinan's
wicket.
	   Cullinan's innings included eight boundaries and a six off Adam
Hollioake, who went for 22 runs in his two overs.
	   South Africa lost three wickets in the middle overs, including
Cronje, who was leg before wicket to Robert Croft as he missed a
reverse sweep. He was trapped in front for 31 off 68 balls.
	   Symcox, dropped on five by Hollioake on the long on boundary off
Croft, hit sixes off Croft, Gough and Martin before Mullally bowled
him in the last over with a low full toss.
	   Gough, who took 3-51 in the 36-run win over the world champions

Liberian soccer star says he'll no longer play for Liberia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ George Weah, the soccer star who became
an important symbol of Liberian unity during its years of civil
war, says he will no longer play for his home team.
	   Weah, 32, announced his resignation at a Monday press briefing
in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, saying he was getting too old.
	   ``I will no longer play for the national team. I can't keep
traveling, coming here to play,'' Weah told reporters.
	   ``I hope the Liberian people will not feel bad. I have served my
country and people without getting anything,'' he said.
	   He will continue to play for the professional Italian soccer
team AC Milan.
	   The announcement stunned fans, who had watched him lead the
national team, The Lone Star, to a 2-0 victory Sunday against Niger
in a preliminary match for the African Cup of Nations tournament.
	   Weah also lashed out at his government for not giving greater
attention to sports.
	   ``Until sports are prioritized and budgeted, I will remain
out,'' said Weah, who has been plagued by back trouble in recent
months.
	   Weah, who was voted FIFA Player Of the Year in 1995, is perhaps
the only Liberian who all his countrymen could look to as a hero
during its seven years of bloody civil war, which ended in 1996.
Weah was actively involved in helping call attention to the
humanitarian crisis in his country.
	   He also owns several businesses, including a Monrovia nightclub.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police found a toddler with head and other
injuries in an apartment next to the bodies of three people who had
been dead for two to four days, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   Police said the 2-year-old was the son of one of the victims, a
20-year-old woman. The other victims were the 24-year-old owner of
the apartment and a 19-year-old man, police said, according to
ITAR-Tass.
	   Two jobless brothers have been arrested, ITAR-Tass said. It said
the brothers and the victims had recently been seen drinking
together.

	   AUGHER, Northern Ireland (AP) _ This tiny, grieving village on
Tuesday laid to rest a mother and her young daughter in a church
graveyard on a hill _ the first in a long line of funerals for 28
victims of a terrorist car bombing.
	   Soon after the funeral, Prince Charles arrived in Omagh to bring
royal condolences to the shattered town from where a 500-pound (200
kg) exploded Saturday, killing mostly women and children in the
worst atrocity in three decades of sectarian conflict.
	   ``I'm shattered and horrified and the least I can do is to come
here and offer my sympathy and support,'' said Charles, adding the
atrocity had for him recalled particularly the IRA assassination in
1979 of his great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten.
	   ``I do have some understanding of the awful horror that people
have to put up with when their relatives are killed,'' he added.

Ukrainian central bank raises interest rate amid concerns over
</HEADLINE>
hryvna &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with finance minister's comments in new 7th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The central bank raised a key interest rate
by 10 percent on Tuesday in response to financial turmoil in
neighboring Russia that is putting pressure on the Ukrainian
currency.
	   ``It is rather a psychological form of reaction to the market's
financial situation,'' said National Bank chairman Viktor
Yushchenko, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The increase brought the Lombard rate to 92 percent from 82
percent.
	   Ukrainian officials are concerned that the Russian ruble's
dramatic plunge would also undermine the Ukrainian currency, the
hryvna, which also fell sharply on Monday following the Russian
devaluation announcement.
	   ``The National Bank board is worried by the possible
consequences of the Russian ruble's devaluation, although its
downfall to a certain level is not threatening us,'' Yushchenko
said in an interview published Tuesday by the government's Uryadovy
Kurier newspaper.
	   ``But the ruble's collapse might lead to a devaluation of the
hryvna or tough monetary policies,'' he said.
	   Finance Minister Ihor Mytyukov also said Tuesday the Russian
crisis might ``negatively affect Ukraine's financial market,'' but
insisted that market conditions in Ukraine were different from
those in Russia and did not require new monetary measures.
	   President Leonid Kuchma has ordered Yushchenko and Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko to maintain the stability of the
country's financial system and prevent the hryvna from falling.
	   Early Tuesday, top economic officials held a meeting chaired by
Pustovoitenko to discuss Ukraine's financial situation, which they
called relatively stable.
	   On Monday, however, the hryvna fell to 2.1805 to the U.S.
dollar, down from 2.1435 to the dollar last week. It traded at
2.1885 to the dollar Tuesday.
	   The hryvna has been falling steadily this year under strong
pressure from foreign investors, who have withdrawn an estimated
dlrs 2 billion from the country.
	   Efforts by the National Bank to defend the currency resulted in
a sharp fall in its reserves from dlrs 2.34 billion at the
beginning of the year to dlrs 1.15 billion as of last week.

Swiss vice-president: banks' settlement `heartening'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland's vice-president on Tuesday welcomed
the two biggest Swiss banks' settlement of Holocaust survivors'
claims against them, and was quoted as saying that the banks were
repairing their own mistakes.
	   In an interview with Geneva daily Le Temps, Ruth Dreifuss
expressed confidence that last week's settlement, in which United
Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse agreed to pay dlrs 1.25
billion, will end the pressure on Switzerland over Holocaust-era
assets.
	   ``The banks' mistake has been repaired by the banks,'' said
Dreifuss, herself Jewish. ``In a country where they carry such
weight and such potential for development, that's heartening.''
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   The banks say they expect other Swiss companies and institutions
to help finance the sum.
	   Many politicians remain cautious, and all four parties in the
coalition government have rejected suggestions the Swiss National
Bank, the country's central bank, should contribute.
	   ``The agreement creates no obligation for the SNB,'' Dreifuss
said, stressing the central bank's autonomy. The bank has called a
special board meeting for Friday to discuss the settlement.
	   Meanwhile, SNB board chairman Jakob Schoenenberger confirmed a
report in the capital's daily Berner Zeitung that he and bank
president Hans Meyer oppose making a contribution.
	   The government's only official response to the settlement has
been a brief statement restating its position that the accord is a
matter for those involved, adding that it is committed to nothing
by the agreement.
	   In a poll of 573 people in Switzerland's German- and
French-speaking regions published Tuesday, 45 percent of those
questioned said they were satisfied with the settlement and 41
percent said they were dissatisfied.
	   Carried out from Thursday to Saturday by the MIS Trend research
institute for the Lausanne weekly L'Illustre, it gave a margin of
error of 4 percent.
	   Dreifuss appeared to distance herself from Swiss government
decisions earlier this year not to compensate two Jewish wartime
refugees whose asylum pleas were rejected.
	   The governing Federal Council, or cabinet, rejected compensation
claims by Joseph Spring and Charles Sonabend, refused refuge by the
country during World War II. Dreifuss is one of the seven members
on the cabinet.
	   ``I would have liked the state to materially repair the errors
some of its agents may have committed in putting refugees' lives in
danger by returning them,'' Dreifuss said.
	   ``I'm thinking in particular of what Swiss police inflicted on
the family of Joseph Spring, that of Sonabend and others.''
	   Spring and Sonabend, who separately escaped to Switzerland with
their families during World II, were sent back by Swiss authorities
to Nazi-controlled territory. They survived, but relatives who were
with them subsequently died in concentration camps.

German author to campaign for opposition

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ One of Germany's most prominent
authors, Guenther Grass, said Tuesday he would go on the road to
drum up support in eastern Germany for ousting Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in next month's elections.
	   ``I'm supporting `red-green,''' Grass, an outspoken leftist,
told Hesse Radio, referring to a possible coalition of the main
opposition Social Democrats and the ecology-minded Greens.
	   Although the Social Democrats lead Kohl's Christian Democrats in
the eastern states, the Greens have been struggling to win votes in
the economically depressed region.
	   Should they fail to get 5 percent of the national vote, which a
party needs to enter parliament, the Social Democrats could turn to
the Christian Democrats to form a ``grand coalition'' _ something
Grass said he didn't want to see.
	   He said he would visit Weimar, Schwerin and Jena on his election
tour, indicating he would try to help the Greens.

Khamenei says Iran will not tolerate mischief by the Taliban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rafsanjani, parliament warning Taliban grafs 2-4;
no pickup

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, dismissed Afghanistan's Taliban force as ``degenerate''
on Tuesday and said his government would not tolerate the militia's
seizure of 47 Iranian citizens.
	   In similar vein, Iran's former President Hashemi Rafsanjani
warned that Iran might resort to force to free its citizens, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   ``Those who have seen the power of Iran know that the Iranian
nation is strong enough to forcibly free its children,'' said
Rafsanjani, who heads the influential Expediency Council.
	   In a third warning Tuesday, Iran's parliament discussed the
plight of the Iranians _ who were detained when the Taliban
captured the north Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8 _ and
said that Iran would do whatever was necessary to secure their
release, IRNA reported.
	   State television quoted Khamenei as saying that the Taliban
would be wise to ``release and send (the detainees) back
respectfully because the Iranian nation, government and armed
forces will not tolerate any mischief and wickedness from even the
Americans, let alone by those degenerate and worthless people who
are being used as tools of the foreigners in Afghanistan these
days.''
	   Tehran says the Taliban detained 11 Iranian diplomats, a
correspondent of the official Islamic Republic News Agency and 35
truck drivers who reportedly work for an international transport
company.
	   The Taliban say they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but they admit to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming the
Taliban's enemies.
	   Iran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the Iranians'
safety because Islamabad is widely believed to provide arms and
other support to the Taliban.
	   Iran itself is widely suspected of backing the northern-based
opposition to the Taliban.
	   Khamenei accused ``some neighboring countries'' of interfering
in Afghanistan's civil war, the television reported.
	   But he held the Taliban responsible for the Iranians's safety,
saying: ``It is in the interests of those deceived people to
respect the Iranians whom they have arrested and to return them to
their homeland.''
	   In a related development, Iran's deputy foreign minister,
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, said Tuesday that an Iranian official had met
the truck drivers in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on
Sunday.
	   Boroujerdi, who is responsible for Afghan affairs, said the
official found the drivers to be in good health, but the Taliban
did not allow him to meet the diplomats and correspondent, the
television said.
	   In the Iranian capital Tehran on Tuesday, some 25 relatives of
the truck drivers demonstrated outside the U.N. office to urge the
world body to intervene to secure the release of the captives, IRNA
said.

Unemployment falls to 10.1 percent in July

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland's unemployment rate fell to
10.1 percent in July, from 12 percent in June and 10.8 percent in
July last year, the government statistics agency said.
	   The latest figure means that 265,000 people were out of work in
a population of 5.1 million, Statistics Finland said.
	   Part of the drop was caused by the government agency's adoption
of European Union statistics practices which has lowered Finnish
joblessness figures by an average 1.5 percentage points.
	   Seasonal fluctuation also tends to peak during the summer,
affecting all unemployment polls, the agency said.
	   The government statistics agency numbers differed by over 5
percentage points from the unemployment figures reported by the
Ministry of Labor, 15.3 percent.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ In a move that could help ease Myanmar's
political crisis, the chairman of the pro-democracy party of
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi met Tuesday with a top member of
the country's ruling junta.
	   The meeting between Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt and Aung Shwe came as
Suu Kyi remained encamped for a seventh day on a road outside the
capital, protesting government orders preventing her from traveling
to meet supporters in the countryside.
	   Details of the talks between government and opposition were not
released. But the meeting could mark a breakthrough in efforts to
begin a dialogue between Myanmar's rulers and the National League
for Democracy, the country's main pro-democracy force.
	   State television Tuesday opened its evening news broadcast with
the story, showing Aung Shwe shaking hands with his government
hosts.
	   Friends and critics alike of the military regime have been
urging it to open a dialogue with Suu Kyi's party, arguing that
talks were needed to break the country's longstanding political
deadlock.
	   In a reminder of the gulf between the positions of the two
sides, the league issued a statement Tuesday evening appealing to
the public to back its call for parliament to be convened.
	   ``Emergence of the parliament means the existence of
democracy,'' it said.
	   The military in Myanmar _ also called Burma _ did not let
parliament meet after Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory in a
1990 election. Instead it stepped up repression of members of the
National League for Democracy and other dissident figures.
	   Suu Kyi earlier this year demanded that by Aug. 21 the
government allow the members of parliament to take their seats. She
did not say what the league would do if the deadline was not met.
	   Also Tuesday, the state-controlled press continued to publish
blistering personal and political attacks on Suu Kyi. It published
speeches by senior generals accusing Suu Kyi of collaborating with
Western countries to impose neocolonialism upon Myanmar and urging
government workers to annihilate her and her colleagues.
	   The league has declined previous invitations this year to meet
with the government because Suu Kyi had not been invited.
	   The party's position was that the government should not dictate
who should represent it in a dialogue.
	   In Bangkok, Thailand, Thai Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kobsak
Chutikul described news of Tuesday's meeting as ``very
encouraging.''
	   A Myanmar government news release received in Bangkok said that
officials described Tuesday's talks as ``the first in a series of
meetings,'' and that participants called the talks ``open, frank
and cordial.''
	   The league's own brief announcement of the talks, released in
Yangon, noted only that Aung Shwe had met Khin Nyint for an hour
Tuesday afternoon and gave no details or characterization of their
talks.
	   The opposition party has described the government's previous
efforts at discussions with them as insincere.
	   In a clear show of solidarity, the later statement by the league
calling for parliament to be convened was signed by 10 of the
party's 13 central executive committee members.
	   Those who didn't sign were Suu Kyi, isolated in her van 32
kilometers (19 miles) west of the capital; Kyi Maung, who became
estranged from the party last year; and a third member believed to
be abroad.
	   ``We hope this is the first in a series of confidence building
talks between the government and the NLD,'' the government news
release quoted Khin Nyunt as saying of Tuesday's talks. ``We have
had a fruitful meeting and we also have appreciated the NLD's
acceptance of our offer of a meeting.''
	   It said the meeting was also attended by Lt.-Gen. Win Myint, a
junior member of the ruling State Peace and Development Council,
Chief Justice Aung Toe and Attorney General Tha Tun.

Greece: Missiles could be reconsidered if Cyprus talks start
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The potentially war-provoking deployment
of anti-aircraft missiles on Cyprus could be called off if Turkish
Cypriots open talks on military reductions and reunification of the
island, a senior Greek official said Tuesday.
	   The installation of the Russian-made S-300 missiles, scheduled
for November, could lead to a serious military showdown between
Greece and Turkey over the divided eastern Mediterranean island.
	   ``If they start talking, then the decision could be
reconsidered,'' said Greece's deputy foreign minister, Yannos
Kranidiotis. ``We still have more than two months where we hope
diplomacy to work.''
	   Turkey, the lone backer of the breakaway region of Turkish
Cyprus in the north, has warned it will take military action to
prevent the missiles' deployment.
	   Ankara fears they will be used to protect Greek jet fighters at
a newly built air force base. The jets would disturb Turkey's
strategic superiority and shift the balance of forces on the
island.
	   Greece has a defense pact with the Greek Cypriots and has
promised retaliation to any military action.
	   ``Any offensive by Turkey on Cyprus means a Greco-Turkish war,''
emphasized the Cypriot-born Kranidiotis.
	   Kranidiotis' suggestion that the missile deployment could be
frozen reinforced a widely held belief that Greek Cypriots have
been using the long-range missiles as a bargain chip to restart
deadlocked U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the
island.
	   Kranidiotis said two kinds of talks could lead to a cancellation
of the deployment: restarting intercommunal talks to reunify the
island and negotiations to reduce forces on Cyprus.
	   ``The level (of talks) doesn't matter as long as it serves the
purposes I mentioned,'' he told reporters.
	   A U.S.-led initiative to solve the impasse has foundered on the
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's insistence on recognition
for his northern breakaway state.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek- and Turkish-speaking sectors
since the Turkish occupation of its northern third in 1974
following a failed Greek-backed coup. Turkey keeps about 35,000
troops in the north.
	   On Monday, Turkey rejected an American proposal for a no-fly
zone over the island as a tension reducer.
	   Sukra Sina, Turkey's Cyprus Minister, rejected the American plan
shortly before the arrival in Ankara of special U.S. envoy Thomas
Miller.
	   ``We can not accept this kind of bargaining regarding the
missiles,'' Sina said. ``We will continue to take all the necessary
measures.
	   Cyprus earlier this week accused Turkey of bolstering its forces
in northern Cyprus with tanks and artillery.

Police identify tourists kidnapped while gorilla tracking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Police on Tuesday identified two Swedes,
a Canadian and a New Zealander who were kidnapped last week by Hutu
rebels while viewing rare mountain gorillas.
	   Spokesman Bob Ngobi identified them as Ann Charlotte Jonsson of
Jonkopping, Sweden, Jens Olsson of Gothenburg, Sweden, Douglas John
of New Zealand and Joan Donaldo of Canada. The home towns for the
latter two were not immediately available.
	   Ngobi said two Ugandan park rangers, two Congolese drivers and
three Congolese porters were also abducted Aug. 11.
	   Arthur Mugisha, acting deputy director of the Uganda Wildlife
Authority, told the government-owned New Vision newspaper Tuesday
the group was kidnapped near the Djomba post, 20 kilometers inside
the Democratic Republic of Congo.
	   Mugisha said the tourists had first travelled to Kisoro, 480
kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Kampala to the Bwindi
Impenetrable National Park, which borders on Virunga National Park
and the Parc des Volcans in Rwanda. An estimated 600 gorillas roam
through all three.
	   The tourists were reportedly travelling with two tour operators,
Guerba located in the United Kingdom, and Far Out Safaris, based in
Sweden.
	   In neighboring Kenya, Swedish embassy spokesman Kai Persson said
he understood the missing group got separated from two other groups
of tourists.
	   The Hutu rebels, who are remnants of the former Rwandan Hutu
army, have camps in the reserves from which they attack Rwanda.
	   According to Mugisha, a group of six, including the four
kidnapped tourists, separated from the others and went off on their
own. When they returned to Djomba, their vehicle was fired on. Four
of them ran, and two hid, he said. Later, they walked out of the
area and informed authorities about their four missing companions
and the guides.
	   Mugisha said the Wildlife Authority was sending a team to
investigate.

Opposition says Yeltsin ``devalues himself'' by permitting ruble's

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has squandered his
credibility by allowing the ruble to take a dive, a parliamentary
opposition leader said Tuesday.
	   ``Our president has absolutely devalued himself,'' said
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who leads the largest faction in
parliament's lower house.
	   Zyuganov said the ruble devaluation announced Monday is the
latest in a long line of Yeltsin failures, and repeated his call
for mass protests and the president's resignation. His previous
calls have triggered little response.
	   Yeltsin appeared to gear down from crisis mode on Tuesday,
accepting the resignation of his long-time economic adviser,
Alexander Livshits. The Interfax news agency reported that Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin
had offered to resign, but Yeltsin told them to stay.
	   The president was at his country residence outside Moscow on
Tuesday and expected to remain there through the end of the week.
Kiriyenko was informing him about the economic situation by
telephone.
	   The moves followed the announcement Monday that the government
would permit the ruble to fall by a third _ from about 6.3 to the
dollar to 9.5 to the dollar _ an effective devaluation which
Yeltsin had repeatedly pledged to avoid.
	   Russian newspapers had a mixed response, saying that it could
give a break to the battered economy and let the government pay its
months-long wage arrears. But they also warned it could backfire on
Yeltsin politically when prices begin to rise.
	   ``We woke up in another country _ one standing on the eve of
price rises, deficit, cuts in import and black currency market,''
said the business daily Kommersant.
	   Many commentators assailed Yeltsin for putting himself in an
embarrassing position by denying that devaluation was on the agenda
just days before the move.
	   ``If Yeltsin had set a deliberate goal to undermine his own
prestige, he couldn't have invented anything better than to pledge
there would be no devaluation three days before it happened,'' said
the daily Russky Telegraf.
	   The government pledged to control the ruble's decline, but it
sank to 6.89 to the dollar on the Central Bank-controlled Moscow
currency exchange from 6.43 on Monday.
	   The larger and more important interbank currency market remained
frozen Tuesday. Russian commercial banks, many of whom face a
liquidity crisis, have suspended trading since last week.
	   The more sensitive street rate, which on Monday immediately
plunged to the bottom of the government-set band, fluctuated
between 8 and 10 rubles to the dollar at exchange booths around
Moscow. Demand was low as people waited for the ruble to stabilize.
	   Nonetheless, most banks were not paying out on dollar accounts,
and depositors were asked to fill out a form and come back in
several days. Bank managers said the Central Bank had limited their
ability to buy dollars in an effort to stem the run on the ruble.
	   Many customers were exasperated.
	   ``I trust the bank but I don't trust the government,'' said
depositor Lyudmila Sergeyeva as she stood in line at a downtown
office of a leading Russian commercial bank. ``The government has
spent its last credit of trust.''
	   The Finance Ministry and central bank called Tuesday for a
meeting of leading local and foreign banks for talks about the
rescheduling of Russian banks' foreign debt. The government
announced a 90-day moratorium Monday on Russian banks' and
companies' foreign debt payments.
	   Meanwhile, business continued as usual in Moscow stores, which
have mostly kept their price tags unchanged.
	   However, Kommersant said customers were emptying shelves in some
Russian cities and there was high demand for dollars in certain
regions even at the higher rates.
	   Analysts said consumer prices would rise over a number of weeks
as stores sell their current inventories. The higher prices are
expected to deal a painful blow to the population because imports
account for a huge share of Russia's consumer market, including
more than half the food sold in stores.
	   Russian stocks continued to fall, and were down 6.9 percent at
1:30 p.m. (0930 GMT) on Tuesday.
	   ``Nobody wants to sell at these levels, and nobody wants to buy
because they are scared of what might happen, and nobody wants to
trade with one another because they are afraid of default,'' said
Martin Diggle, principal at Brunswick Warburg brokerage in Moscow.

Sudan opposition leaders call for continued struggle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAE GHALWASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese opposition leaders on Tuesday
rejected the Islamic regime's new constitution and vowed to keep up
their struggle for a united, secular Sudan.
	   The National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella group for Sudanese
opposition parties, released its statement after a three-day
meeting in Cairo. Egypt invited the opposition leaders there after
peace talks between the Sudanese rebels and the Khartoum government
earlier this month in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa failed to
make progress.
	   The communique said opposition leaders ``assert their rejection
of the shameful constitution, which the regime installed under a
police state (while) it was curtailing freedom.''
	   They vowed to ``continue steps on the path of national struggle
until our noble people reach their ambitions of ... democracy in
unity and peace.''
	   The meeting was attended by John Garang, leader of the Sudan
People's Liberation Army, which has been fighting since 1983 for
more freedom for the south's animists and Christians from the
Islamic north.
	   Also at the conference were Mohammed Osman al-Mirgani, who heads
the alliance, and former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi.
	   El-Mahdi was ousted in a 1989 military coup by Lt. Gen. Omar
el-Bashir, who has installed an Islamic regime in Khartoum.
	   The new constitution, adopted June 30, is based on Islamic
sharia law but promises to safeguard the rights of religious
minorities.
	   Promulgation of the constitution followed el-Bashir's move last
summer to sign a peace treaty with six southern rebel groups that
broke with Garang.
	   In their final communique, the opposition leaders accused
Khartoum of human rights abuses and discrimination against
non-Muslims and pledged to continue working for a united, secular
Sudan.
	   They also accused el-Bashir's regime of using ``food as a
weapon'' in its battle against the southern rebels.
	   Thousands of people face starvation in southern Sudan,
especially in Bahr el-Ghazal province. Khartoum and the rebels have
agreed to a three-month cease-fire to let foreign aid workers get
needed food and medicine to the area.
	   Sudan's parliament protested Egypt's hosting of the meeting,
saying it was tantamount to fostering the rebels.
	   But President Hosni Mubarak said in an interview published
Monday that he met with the rebels to try to keep the neighboring
nation unified.
	   ``This meeting was held in the interest of our brothers in
Sudan,'' he told the weekly newspaper Mayo.
	   Egypt worries that a breakup of Sudan could jeopardize the Nile,
its main source of water.

New controversy erupts over charter of Arafat's Fatah group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah group
on Tuesday defended a decision to post its 1965 founding charter,
which calls for Israel's destruction, on the Internet.
	   The charter was published on the Fatah website as part of an
information package on the group's history, said Jamal Shoubaki, a
member of the Fatah Central Committee. The group has since changed
its priorities, but has never updated its charter, Shoubaki said.
	   One article in the Fatah charter calls for Israel's destruction.
Three other articles say armed struggle is the way to ``liberate
Palestine from the Zionists.''
	   A copy of the charter was presented Tuesday to the Defense and
Foreign Affairs Committee of Israel's parliament and sparked anger
among hawkish and dovish legislators alike.
	   Israel radio said the document was described to the committee as
an updated Fatah charter.
	   ``This is very grave and requires all of us, regardless of our
political views, to demand that Arafat who controls Fatah, disown
this charter,'' said opposition Labor Party legislator Haim Ramon.
	   Shoubaki said Fatah supported the peace talks with Israel, and
that some of the group's new priorities included fighting
corruption in the Palestinian Authority and pushing for political
pluralism.
	   However, David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said the Fatah website did not indicate that
the charter was a historical document that was no longer valid.
	   ``What we are saying is that the existing constitution has not
lost validity,'' Bar-Illan said.

UNICEF: inability to get visas hindering famine relief efforts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sudan-Rebels &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Efforts to increase food aid to people in
famine-hit southern Sudan are being hindered by government delays
in granting travel permits to foreign aid workers, the U.N.
children's agency said Tuesday.
	   The inability to get visas is preventing some 40 extra medical
and logistics staff from UNICEF and other agencies from increasing
the number of feeding centers in Wau, the capital of the hard-hit
Bahr al-Ghazal region, Geneva-based UNICEF spokesman Patrick
McCormick said.
	   Nearly 80 percent of youngsters in the town are registered as
undernourished, McCormick said. Wau currently has six feeding
centers; UNICEF and other organizations want to at least double
this number.
	   Normally, getting permits for aid workers from the government in
Khartoum takes two weeks, McCormick said. But difficulties being
experienced at the moment mean the process is taking longer. The
spokesman couldn't say what the problems are.
	   ``At the moment there is something going on which means there is
a backlog,'' McCormick said. ``We are urging them to do this
quickly. It's another example of the continuing difficulties that
have been put in our way in dealing with this famine.''
	   The Associated Press was unable Tuesday to contact the Sudanese
government for comment.
	   Since April, more than 70,000 people have entered the town, with
the daily number of arrivals now standing at 400, UNICEF says.
	   During the first week of August, UNICEF recorded 453 deaths at
reception centers in the area, but says it believes the toll is now
much higher.
	   Sudan's civil war started in 1983 when rebels took up arms
against the Muslim government in the north to demand more autonomy
for Christian and animist people in the south.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in the battles and
famines caused by them.
	   As of last month, 700,000 civilians faced starvation in Bahr
al-Ghazal's rebel-controlled areas.
	   International aid agencies have estimated 1.5 million people
face starvation across southern Sudan, about half in Bahr al-Ghazal
state where Wau sits on a plain of grass and bush, 1,000 kilometers
(620 miles) south of the capital, Khartoum.
	   Agencies have faced continued problems in supplying aid.
	   Southern Sudan lacks roads, airstrips and other basic
infrastructure. The Sudanese government has banned the use of
military transport aircraft, which have the largest capacity for
aid drops, to fly into southern Sudan because it claims rebels
could use them to ship in weapons.
	   Government forces often loot or burn food stocks if they fear
rebels will get them.
	   Under pressure from aid agencies, the United Nations and foreign
donors, the government and rebels from the Sudan People's
Liberation Army agreed in July to a three-month cease-fire and the
establishment of safe corridors for delivery of relief supplies.
	   But the World Food Program has expressed doubts that the
cease-fire can help.

U.N. demands release of Bosnian Croat arrested from war-crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The United Nations demanded
Tuesday that Bosnian Serb police release a Bosnian Croat being held
on war-crimes charges issued by a local court.
	   Serb police detained Robert Rebic, from the Croat-controlled
city of Capljina as he crossed into the Serb-held territory last
Friday. He was jailed immediately in Foca, where he remains.
	   The arrest is in violation of an 1996 agreement between Bosina's
Serbs, Muslims and Croats, which states only the International War
Crimes Tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands has jurisdiction to file
charges on war crimes. Called the ``Rules of the Road,'' the
agreement was designed to prevent biased local courts across the
country from issuing charges and making arrests that would
discourage people from freely crossing the former front lines.
	   All Bosnian authorities have been made aware of the ``Rules,''
but the judge who filed the charges told U.N. International Police
officers he had never heard of such an agreement. His name was not
released for security reasons.
	   ``He was actually not even aware of the procedures which are
part of the `Rules of the Road' and not even aware that he has to
provide all the evidence to The Hague tribunal, to the prosecutors
offices, before an arrest is conducted,'' said Alexander Ivanko,
spokesman for the United Nations in Sarajevo.
	   The United Nations has demanded that Rebic be released
immediately, and any files on him be submitted to The Hague, Ivanko
said.

Judge cancels furlough for jailed jet-set banker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A judge Tuesday canceled a prison leave
program for Mario Conde, a once high-flying banker serving time for
embezzlement, on grounds that Conde's in the middle of another
corruption trial.
	   In February Conde began serving a term of four years and two
months for defrauding 600 million pesetas (dlrs 4.3 million) from a
firm linked to Banesto, the bank he was running at the time.
	   The furlough program was to have let Conde out on weekend leave
twice a month, and grant him an additional 48 days of what amounted
to vacation. He got out for the first time on Aug. 7.
	   But that day a prosecutor objected on grounds that Conde and 10
other suspects are still on trial on other corruption charges
involving Banesto. If convicted in the second trial, Conde could
get more than 40 years.
	   A Madrid judge who oversees penal affairs, Francisco Racionero,
sided with the prosecutor on Tuesday.
	   Opposition parties had howled in protest when the prisons system
first granted Conde leave.
	   The Socialist party and other groups accused the conservative
government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of giving Conde
preferential treatment because of the close ties Aznar used to have
with Conde.
	   The National Prison Directorate had said its decision was
routine for a case such as Conde's, involving a nonviolent crime
with a relatively short sentence and good behavior by the inmate.
	   With his slicked-back hair and high-society friends, Conde was
for many a garish symbol of the get-rich-quick mentality that
characterized much of Spanish business in the 1980s.
	   The former Socialist government oversaw the Bank of Spain's
seizure of Banesto in 1993 after a massive shortfall in funds was
found in the bank's books.

Lisbon dockers stage strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Lisbon dock workers began a four-day
strike Tuesday, forcing cargo ships to head for other ports or
anchor off the coast until the stoppage ends.
	   Some 275 stevedores, warehouse workers and shipping clerks
walked off the job in protest at new legislation which allows
ships' crews to perform some loading and unloading operations.
	   The Lisbon port authority said six vessels were heading for
other Portuguese ports while three ships docked in the harbor were
halfway through unloading when the strike was called.
	   The new legislation is part of the government's restructuring
program for the country's ports which also prompted a two-week
strike last month by harbor pilots.

UEFA to debate threat of breakaway super league next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ European soccer's governing body, UEFA, will seek
to head off the threat of a breakaway super league next week by
discussing possible changes in the format of its three major club
competitions.
	   UEFA's policy-making executive committee will meet Aug. 29 in
Monaco with the behind-the-scenes plans of big European clubs on
top of the agenda.
	   ``It is a scheduled meeting of the executive committee, but the
super league will be discussed,'' said UEFA spokeswoman Tanya
Baima.
	   Immediately after the meeting, UEFA will hold a press conference
at which it could announce changes to the format of its three
competitions.
	   One idea is to increase the number of teams in the Champions'
League from 24 to 32, and merge the Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Cup.
	   Big European clubs - many of whom feel that they are outgrowing
their domestic leagues - are looking to profit from more
money-spinning matches against each other.
	   English giants Arsenal and Manchester United have confirmed that
they have had discussions about joining such a league.
	   Other clubs that would likely be involved include AC Milan,
Inter Milan and Juventus of Italy, Spain's Real Madrid and
Barcelona, Germany's Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, France's
Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille, Ajax Amsterdam of the
Netherlands and Portugal's Benfica.
	   Italian TV magnate Silvio Berlusconi is thought to be one of the
main proponents behind the scheme, which would likely be backed by
new revenues from pay-per-view TV.
	   Soccer's governing bodies oppose the scheme, which would greatly
reduce their power.
	   FIFA has already warned players who take part that they may be
barred from international competitions, including the World Cup.
	   UEFA is already persuading clubs not to go their own way.
	   ``UEFA's route to the future is based on consultation and
co-operation'' and there is ``no need for any club to sign an
agreement which it might regret afterwards,'' said UEFA general
secretary Gerhard Aigner.
	   In an article published Monday in Germany's Kicker magazine,
UEFA president Lennart Johannsen said any league should be based on
merit, and not a club's wealth and tradition.
	   Games should also be shown on free TV, he said.
	   But to assuage the demands of big clubs, entry to the top
Champions' League competition might be based on historical success
rather than the previous season's performance, which is the system
currently used.
	   FIFA's new president Sepp Blatter said that the current
discussions between clubs are ``an alarm bell'' for soccer.
	   ``All the structures could crumble with a project of this
type,'' he said in an article published Tuesday by the French
sports daily L'Equipe.
	   Blatter said he had been invited to attend the Monaco meeting.
	   ``It will be the first time that a FIFA president has ever been
to a UEFA executive meeting. It is proof of our willingness to work
together for the good of football,'' he said.
	   At the meeting ``I will say that we must take the initiative. We
must react. This idea has existed for a long time but today it has
come to the forefront of attention.''
	   Blatter sharply criticized the idea of a breakaway league,
arguing that it is an attempt by rich clubs to forget the sport's
grass roots in their pursuit of more money.

Ronaldo admits he took tranqulizer before World Cup final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo took a tranquilizer
before his country's 3-0 defeat in the World Cup final to France,
according to World Soccer magazine.
	   The British magazine quoted Brazil's doctor, Lidio Toledo, as
saying Ronaldo took the sedative after suffering a convulsion a few
hours before kickoff.
	   ``He gave me half a bluey tablet before I went to the clinic,''
Ronaldo was quoted as saying.
	   The magazine suggested that could explain why Ronaldo looked so
sluggish in the game.
	   Ronaldo had been omitted from Brazil's original team sheet. Then
his name appeared on a revised team sheet released before kick-off.
In the meantime, Brazil did not warm up on the field amid
speculation of a rift between players over the exclusion, or
inclusion, of Ronaldo.
	   And then the 21-year-old ace, rated the best player in the world
last season, had a very lethargic game.
	   World Soccer said players, team officials and hotel staff knew
that Ronaldo had some kind of fit at lunch-time on the day of the
game.
	   Brazil's World Cup '98 assistant manager Zico said emergency
tests gave Ronaldo a clean bill of health but he was doubtful the
player should have taken the field.
	   ``It's always a mistake to play somebody who's not 100 percent
fit,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was proved that even if he's
the best player in the world, he can't go onto the field if he's
not well.
	   ``Ronaldo was sleepy, really groggy. He was in no condition to
play. The medical department could have said no. If they had said
`Don't play him,' (coach Mario) Zagallo wouldn't have played him.
At no time did the doctors say no.''
	   Ronaldo, who is due back at Italian Serie A club Inter Milan
this week, says medical tests confirmed he is in perfect shape.
	   ``I think there's been an exageration in all this,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``I can't explain what caused that (the fit).
Only God knows what made me ill. In priciple, I'm not doing any
more tests.''

Missing pages of young Jewish girl's famed diary are found
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ World War II researchers on
Tuesday reported finding five missing pages of Anne Frank's famed
diary, in which the young Jewish girl harshly describes her
parents' marriage.
	   The handwritten pages _ previously not known to exist _ were in
the possession of a former employee of the Anne Frank Foundation,
according to the foundation and the Netherlands State Institute for
War Documentation.
	   The man holding the pages said Anne's father, Otto Frank, gave
them to him shortly before his death in 1980.
	   The two historical groups have demanded their return. Once the
pages are recovered, they will be included in a new edition of
``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' the institute said.
	   ``We thought we had a complete edition. Now this pops up,'' said
a bewildered David Barnouw, a spokesman for the war documentation
agency and an editor of an unabridged version of the diary. ``I
don't doubt the authenticity of the pages.''
	   The former employee's name was not released, and there was
nothing to indicate he had done anything wrong.
	   Even so, ``it is highly improbable that Otto Frank made a gift
of this original manuscript to this former employee,'' the war
documentation center said in a statement. ``Rather, he may have
just handed him the pages to prevent the contents from becoming
public.''
	   Barnouw said he couldn't rule out the possibility that still
more pages may be missing from the diary, which has been translated
into more than 50 languages and is required reading in schools
worldwide.
	   It was first published in 1947 by Otto Frank, the only member of
the family to survive the war, and has since become the subject of
films, books and even a Broadway play.
	   Scholars have long said Frank withheld pages of the diary
dealing with his marriage, wishing to keep private some aspects of
the family's life. Although the version most-read by schoolchildren
is known to be abridged, other versions were believed to have been
complete, so the latest discovery took everyone by surprise.
	   Complicating matters, Anne had begun rewriting her diary on
loose sheets of paper that easily could have been lost or
confiscated in the confusion of her eventual betrayal and arrest.
	   The war documentation agency said Anne wrote about her parents'
relationship in ``very critical'' terms, but declined to elaborate
``given the sensitive nature of the material.''
	   Tuesday's revelations came ahead of the publication this fall of
a new bookecret annex
hidden behind a movable bookcase in an Amsterdam canal house, is
one of the Dutch capital's most popular tourist attractions.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Julio Franco smashed a two-run home run in the
sixth inning and Tomohiro Kuroki hurled a three-hitter as the Chiba
Lotte Marines blanked the Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham
Fighters 5-0 at Sendai Tuesday.
	   Franco, formerly with the Milwaukee Brewers, now has 17 homers
for the season. Kuroki is 9-6.
	   The Fighters suffered their sixth straight defeat, but still
have a 4 1/2 game lead over the second-place Kintetsu Buffaloes who
rapped out 16 hits to beat the Orix BlueWave 12-0 at Nagoya Dome.
	   At Seibu Dome, Taisei Takagi hit a grand slam home run in a
five-run fifth inning as the Seibu Lions trounced the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks 8-1. Takagi has 10 homers.
	   In the Central League, Takayuki Shimizu doubled home two runs in
the third inning as the Yomiuri Giants beat the front-running
Yokohama BayStars 5-2 at Tokyo Dome and extended their winning
streak to five.
	   The BayStars are four games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons who lost to the Yakult Swallows 7-5 in 10 innings at
Tokyo's Jingu Stadium.
	   Leo Gomez hit a two-run home run in the third inning to give the
Dragons a 5-0 lead, but the Swallows tied 5-5 in the seventh on a
three-run home run by Takahiro Ikeyama.
	   In the bottom of the 10th, Swallows infielder Eric Anthony,
formerly with the Los Angeles Dodgers, hit a winning two-run home
run, his third of the season.
	   Gomez, formerly with the Chicago Cubs, has 20 homers and Ikeyama
has 14 homers.
	   At Kurashiki, the Hanshin Tigers ended their losing streak at 12
with a 3-2 victory over the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in 10 innings.
	   The Tigers' Tomochika Tsuboi drove in the winning run in the
bottom of the 10th on a grounder.

Prospect for Kosovo talks dim, despite intense U.S. effort
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from U.S. envoy Hill, details, Albanians
declining to meet government officials, fixes time element in lede.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian negotiators refused
to meet their Serb counterparts Tuesday for talks on the future of
Kosovo, despite intense efforts by American diplomats to bring the
two sides together.
	   The U.S. diplomatic initiative was headed by envoy Christopher
Hill, who first met with the designated Albanian negotiators, then
conferred separately with Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader
despised by the Kosovo rebels.
	   After meeting the Albanian leaders, Hill conceded to reporters
no immediate progress had been made, but vowed foreign powers will
``stay at it and we're going to stay at it until we succeed.''
	   Hill, who has been shuttling between leaders on both sides,
reiterated that neither side should count on achieving anything by
force.
	   But while there were no reports of fighting between rebel ethnic
Albanians and Serb security forces, the two sides made it clear
that they were no closer to sitting down for talks.
	   In a letter sent to his Serbian counterpart, Fehmi Agani, the
chief Albanian negotiator refuted an Serb invitation to resume
negotiations that were broken off in May following a Serbian
offensive in the embattled province, unless attacks stopped.
	   ``I have pointed out the necessity that violence stop against
the Albanian civilian population and that the police repression''
is halted, Agani said.
	   ``If you have nothing to say about this, maybe it would be
beneficial to stop this game with invitations to meet, apparently
timed to serve propaganda,'' he added.
	   Even if and when the two sides meet, prospects are dim.
	   The negotiations are being boycotted by ethnic Albanian
opposition parties and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for
independence of the Serbian province, where Albanians account for
90 percent of the population of 2 million. Kosovo is in Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Rugova announced the Albanians' negotiating team last week, but
it comprises only his own associates.
	   Earlier in the day, Agani said he and his team want an ``end of
repression against the Albanians and the withdrawal of the
(Serbian) forces'' from Kosovo before a ``meaningful dialogue'' can
begin.
	   On Tuesday, there were no fresh reports of fighting, which ebbed
Monday, following a weekend push when Serbian forces captured a
series of key Albanian strongholds.
	   Tanjug said Monday that Serbian police ``crushed'' KLA bases in
the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all on the outskirts of
the province's second city of Pec on Sunday.
	   The United Nations now estimates that more than 231,000 people
have been uprooted in the six months since the conflict began. Many
of them have fled across the mountainous border with Albanian,
where the KLA also maintains bases.

Cambodian opposition calls post-coup contracts `illegal'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Thailand's concern about delay in forming government in
last 4 grafs

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's top two opposition
leaders warned foreign investors Tuesday that all contracts signed
following last year's coup d'etat with what they described as an
``illegal'' government are ``subject to revision and possible
annulment.''
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who together won close
to half the seats in the National Assembly in last month's
parliamentary elections, urged potential investors to wait until a
new government is formed in October before signing any new
agreements.
	   Co-Premier Hun Sen's ruling party won in a slight majority in
last month's parliamentary elections, but not the two-thirds needed
to form a government.
	   The July 26 elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted his
co-prime minister Ranariddh, shattering their tense dual
premiership formed after the U.N-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Hun Sen called the elections to restore his legitimacy in the
eyes of the international community and win back foreign aid.
	   ``We advise all investors or potential investors to ensure that
they consider carefully the legal ramifications of entering into
contracts with the present illegal Phnom Penh government,''
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy wrote in a joint statement.
	   Hun Sen has asked Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy
Party _ which together won 58 seats in the 122-seat National
Assembly _ to join him in a coalition government.
	   They have so far refused even to recognize the polls which they
said were marred with irregularities, and have threatened to
boycott Parliament unless their complaints are properly
investigated.
	   ``It is our duty to defend the national interest of Cambodia by
ensuring that contracts are signed through legal procedures, on
behalf of the people, not for the benefit of a small group led by
partisan interests,'' they wrote.
	   In Bangkok, Thailand's Foreign Ministry meanwhile expressed
concern over the delay in forming a new Cambodian government.
	   In a written statement, it noted that the election took place
three weeks ago but final results have not yet been formally
announced.
	   Thailand and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have
called on all concerned parties to resolve their differences and
move forward in establishing a new government based on the outcome
of the election, it said.
	   ``The Thai government and ASEAN have tried to help solve the
dispute in Cambodia from the very beginning, as requested by the
Cambodian government,'' the statement said. ``This includes the
support of the recently concluded election, which is deemed
satisfactory.''

Three more candidates registered for Azerbaijan presidential vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ The Central Election Commission
announced Tuesday that it has registered three more candidates for
Oct. 11 presidential elections, raising the total number of
contenders to six.
	   The new candidates include an economist, an engineer with
Communist leanings and a journalist, said Arif Guseinov, press
secretary for the Central Election Commission.
	   The other three are President Geidar Aliev, who is seeking a
second term, and two other government officials sympathetic to him.
	   Opposition leaders have said they will boycott the vote. They
claim the former Soviet republic is undemocratic and elections will
not be fair.
	   More than 300 people were reportedly arrested at a huge
opposition-led demonstration in Baku on Saturday, although police
later said they detained just over 100.
	   Aliev, a Soviet-era Communist Party boss who returned to power
in 1993 in a bloodless coup, has angered western watchdog groups
with alleged human rights violations.
	   Aliev has recently been trying to improve his democratic
credentials and recently issued a decree abolishing most forms of
censorship in the oil-rich country of 7 million people on the
Caspian Sea.

Indian film industry protests video piracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) - India's film industry closed shop Tuesday
and its top stars, producers and directors took to the streets to
protest the government's failure to combat cable and video piracy.
	   Nearly 10,000 fans lined up along the streets to cheer leading
actors and actresses as they traveled in a caravan of 50 cars,
jeeps and coaches from a suburban studio to downtown Bombay. They
were joined at a rally by thousands of backstage workers _ make-up
artists, clap boys, technicians _ chanting, ``Down with the cable
thieves.''
	   Among the protesters were Madhuri Dixit, Aamir Khan and Sunil
Shetty, all household names in even the poorest Indian villages.
	   The Bombay-based film industry, known as Bollywood, churns out
nearly 200 feature films in Hindi and other Indian languages every
year.
	   Producers say most of the films run to nearly empty theaters
since people prefer to watch them at home on pirated video
cassettes screened by cable.
	   ``At this rate nobody will come to a theater to see a film. Why
should they if they can see four movies a day at home after paying
rupees 100 (dls 2.3) a month to cable operators,'' said K.S.
Shorey, who heads the Film Federation of India.
	   Shorey faulted the authorities for failing to enforce
anti-piracy laws.
	   Producers say the cable operators illegally buy cassettes from
overseas distributors to whom they sell their movies and smuggled
them back into India.
	   Jagjit Singh, president of Cablenet, one of the four major cable
operators in Bombay, blamed thousands of small cable operators for
unauthorized screening of the films. ``We screen only those films
whose copyrights we buy,'' said Singh.

Photographer who chronicled Greece between the wars dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Elli Souyioutzoglou-Seidari, a
photographer whose work chronicled Greece between the world wars
and brought new life to its ancient ruins, has died at the age of
99.
	   Her death was announced Tuesday by the Benaki Museum, where she
donated her life's work. It said Souyioutzoglou-Seidari _
universally known as Nelly _ died at her home of natural causes in
her sleep late Monday.
	   ``She was a mythical figure in the area of photographic art,''
said Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who announced the
photographer would receive a state funeral Thursday.
	   Born Nov. 23, 1899, in Aydin in what is now Turkey, Nelly's
moved in 1920 to Dresden, Germany, to study art. Instead, she
decided photography offered a better income and she studied with
Hugo Erfurth and Franz Fiedler, two well-know photographers of the
time.
	   She moved to Athens in 1925 and opened her first studio and
exhibition hall.
	   In 1927, Nelly began to make her mark on Greek photography,
shooting pictures of Greek refugees from Asia Minor.
	   Two years later, Nelly shot a series of pictures of a semi-naked
Hungarian dancer on the ancient Acropolis that would make her
internationally known.
	   Her pictures also graced the Greek kiosk at the 1939
International Trade Fair in New York, where she lived until 1966.
	   Her 1940 shot of a traditionally dressed Greek soldier blowing a
bugle on the Parthenon was on the cover of Life magazine.
	   The last international exhibit in her honor was hosted in New
York's International Center of Photography last year.
	   She is survived by her nephew, Alekos Malaspinas of Atlanta, and
a niece in Britain.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Flooding from rain-swollen rivers
in southwestern and northwestern Ethiopia has displaced at least
73,000 people, the Ethiopian News Agency said Tuesday.
	   At least 66,000 of those displaced were forced out by rising
waters of the Baro River in southwestern Gambella region.
	   The agency said another 7,000 people had been forced to flee the
Tekeze River valley near Gonder in the northwest.
	   The overflowing Tekeze partially destroyed a bridge linking
Gonder and the northern Tigray region.
	   The Ministry of Water Resources, quoted by the agency, said the
level of the Awash River in north central Ethiopia was rising fast
and warned people living downriver to move to higher ground.
	   The National Meteorological Service says seasonal rains have
been heavier
	   than normal this year and has predicted flash-flooding
throughout the country.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military ruler will make his
first official visit abroad later this month when he heads to South
Africa for the Non-Aligned Movement summit, a Lagos newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar accepted an invitation to the summit
from South African President Nelson Mandela, Thisday newspaper
said.
	   The meeting is to be held in the coastal city of Durban.
	   Abubakar came to power in June after the sudden death of his
predecessor,
	   Gen. Sani Abacha. Abubakar has pledged to return his country to
democracy next year, and has earned praise in the west for his
moves to release prisoners and meet with international envoys.
	   ------
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ The capital was calm Tuesday after
Monday's clash by police and opposition party protesters which
reprotedly killed two people, police said.
	   ``The shops are open today and even the traffic is flowing
normally,'' police spokesman Sekoateng Serabeli told the South
African Press Association.
	   Opposition party members were protesting at the gates to King
Letsie III's Royal Palace for the 15th consecutive day on Tuesday,
demanding the annulment of the May general election which they
claim was rigged.
	   Opposition spokesmen claimed two people died Monday when police
moved in to disperse the protestors and attacked a supporter of the
opposition Basotholand Congress Party who refused orders not to
join the crowd.
	   A police spokesman told Soth African radio the police had acted
in self-defense as a group of protestors had been about to attack
them with guns, sticks and bottles.
	   In the May election, the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy
won 79 of the 80 National Assembly seats.
	   An advisor to Lesotho's opposition parties, Mamello Morrison,
has appealed to South African President Nelson Mandela to intervene
in his capacity as chairman of the Southern African Development
Community.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South African military bases
should beef up measures to prevent weapons from being stolen by
people at the bases, according to a South African National Defense
Force report released Tuesday.
	   The SANDF's logistics chief, Gen. Pieter Coetser, also said
there are far too many weapons in circulation.
	   Coetser briefed Parliament's joint committee on defense on a
probe into security measures to combat weapons thefts from military
bases countrywide.
	   Two SANDF members with alleged right-wing connections were
arrested in connection with thefts this year from one base, in
which two soldiers were murdered.
	   It was clear that in addition to guarding against thefts from
the outside, security measures should also be geared towards inside
jobs, Coetser said.
	   Coetser said he would be in favor of personnel screening, though
was not sure how this could be implemented.
	   ``How do you determine loyalty of people who have hidden
agendas, or whether they support the cause or not,'' he asked.
	   In most instances where SANDF personnel were involved in weapons
thefts, the motives were financial gain, he said.
	   Since January 1997 to May 1998, weapons losses included 198 R1
rifles, 480 R4 rifles and 234 9mm pistols.
	   These losses were not only due to theft, but could also be the
result of poor accounting procedures, which meant weapons could not
immediately be traced.

Greece: Missiles could be reconsidered if Cyprus talks start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES name of Turkish minister in 14th and 15th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The potentially war-provoking deployment
of anti-aircraft missiles on Cyprus could be called off if Turkish
Cypriots open talks on military reductions and reunification of the
island, a senior Greek official said Tuesday.
	   The installation of the Russian-made S-300 missiles, scheduled
for November, could lead to a serious military showdown between
Greece and Turkey over the divided eastern Mediterranean island.
	   ``If they start talking, then the decision could be
reconsidered,'' said Greece's deputy foreign minister, Yannos
Kranidiotis. ``We still have more than two months where we hope
diplomacy to work.''
	   Turkey, the lone backer of the breakaway region of Turkish
Cyprus in the north, has warned it will take military action to
prevent the missiles' deployment.
	   Ankara fears they will be used to protect Greek jet fighters at
a newly built air force base. The jets would disturb Turkey's
strategic superiority and shift the balance of forces on the
island.
	   Greece has a defense pact with the Greek Cypriots and has
promised retaliation to any military action.
	   ``Any offensive by Turkey on Cyprus means a Greco-Turkish war,''
emphasized the Cypriot-born Kranidiotis.
	   Kranidiotis' suggestion that the missile deployment could be
frozen reinforced a widely held belief that Greek Cypriots have
been using the long-range missiles as a bargain chip to restart
deadlocked U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the
island.
	   Kranidiotis said two kinds of talks could lead to a cancellation
of the deployment: restarting intercommunal talks to reunify the
island and negotiations to reduce forces on Cyprus.
	   ``The level (of talks) doesn't matter as long as it serves the
purposes I mentioned,'' he told reporters.
	   A U.S.-led initiative to solve the impasse has foundered on the
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's insistence on recognition
for his northern breakaway state.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek- and Turkish-speaking sectors
since the Turkish occupation of its northern third in 1974
following a failed Greek-backed coup. Turkey keeps about 35,000
troops in the north.
	   On Monday, Turkey rejected an American proposal for a no-fly
zone over the island as a tension reducer.
	   Sukru Sina Gurel, Turkey's Cyprus Minister, rejected the
American plan shortly before the arrival in Ankara of special U.S.
envoy Thomas Miller.
	   ``We can not accept this kind of bargaining regarding the
missiles,'' Gurel said. ``We will continue to take all the
necessary measures.
	   Cyprus earlier this week accused Turkey of bolstering its forces
in northern Cyprus with tanks and artillery.

Palestinians blame Israel for severe West Bank water shortage
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DEHEISHE REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank (AP) _ Dirty dishes were piled
up around Mona Abdel Muhsein's sink, and a foul smell came from the
bathroom. When she turned on the water faucet, only a few drops
sputtered out.
	   ``I do the dishes every three days, and afterward use the water
to flush the toilet,'' Mrs. Abdel Muhsein told a group of visiting
Israeli legislators on Tuesday. ``The children take a bath every
week or 10 days.''
	   Her husband, Jamal Abdel Muhsein, said there has been no running
water for three months at the Deheishe refugee camp just south of
Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians blame Israel for severe water shortages in the West
Bank, a charge vehemently denied by Israeli officials, and the
problem threatens to become the latest pitfall in the foundering
Israel-Palestinian peace process.
	   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat ``is very worried
about this,'' his adviser, Ahmed Tibi, said Tuesday. ``He is saying
so to everyone. This is one of the most crucial issues _ people are
suffering.''
	   Tibi accused Israel of reducing the amount of water to the
Palestinian areas by 50 percent in recent months.
	   ``Meanwhile, the settlers are enjoying their swimming pools,''
he said.
	   Although the Palestinians have autonomy in the major cities and
towns in the West Bank, Israel retains control of the water sources
there, which account for one-third of Israel's total water supply.
	   Mustafa Natche, the mayor of the West Bank town of Hebron, said
said the municipality needs 25,000 cubic meters of drinking water
daily, but that Israel supplies only 9,000 cubic meters _ and that
only 3,400 cubic meters actually reach Hebron because of thefts by
settlers and Palestinians and leaks in the water system.
	   The water shortage has left Hebron's Ali Hospital without
running water for four months, forcing the hospital to buy water on
the black market, director Yousef Sharawi said Tuesday.
	   ``This is unhygienic and does not meet hospital standards, but
we have no choice,'' he said.
	   Sharawi blamed the water shortage for three recent deaths at the
hospital.
	   Israeli Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, however, said
Tuesday that Israel was supplying Hebron with 22,000 cubic meters
of water daily _ more even than the 17,000 it is obligated to
provide under the Israel-Palestinian peace agreements.
	   ``The Palestinians can get as much as they need,'' said his
adviser, Ranaan Gissin.
	   Sharon said Israeli authorities estimated that at least 2,000
cubic meters was stolen daily from the water supply by
Palestinians, and denied that Israel discriminated by supplying
more water to the Jewish settlements.
	   ``Arafat is looking for an excuse not to proceed with the
negotiations,'' he said. ``The water is just another excuse.''
	   Meir Ben Meir, Israel's water commissioner, noted that the
Palestinians use only about 30 to 35 cubic meters of water per
person per year, while Israelis use about 100 cubic meters.
	   ``It depends on the standard of living,'' he said, adding later
that the Palestinians would eventually need more water as their
society became more developed.

Report: Japan accidental infant deaths among highest in developed
</HEADLINE>
world

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ More infants die in accidents in Japan than in
almost any other developed country, with bathtub drownings
accounting for the largest share, the Asahi newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Only New Zealand has a higher incidence of infants dying in
accidents among the 15 industrialized countries studied by Japan's
Institute of Public Health, the the paper said.
	   The study, compiled with 1995 data, showed that 25.8 Japanese
infants out of 10,000 died from accidents such as falls, drownings,
or burns before their first birthday, eight times higher than
Norway, the country with the lowest level of accidental infant
deaths, the papers said.
	   Among children 4-years-old and younger, about one-third of
accidental deaths were by drowning, the report said.
	   Officials from the Institute of Public Health were unavailable
for comment Tuesday evening.

Report: Toshiba, Hitachi planning nuclear power venture with GE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two Japanese corporate giants, Toshiba Corp. and
Hitachi Ltd., plan to tie up with General Electric Co. to build
nuclear power plants, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The three companies aim to cut the costs of developing and
building nuclear power plants through the joint venture, Kyodo news
reported citing officials from Toshiba and Hitachi.
	   The three companies may integrate their nuclear power plant
divisions, the report quoted a Toshiba executive as saying.
	   Hitachi is Japan's biggest electric machinery maker, producing
everything from refrigerators to semiconductors to ships and power
plants. Toshiba is number two and has a similar range of products.
	   The two Japanese companies have built, separately or jointly, a
total of 25 nuclear power reactors in Japan, Kyodo said.
	   Company officials were not available for comment late Tuesday.
	   The Japanese companies hope an alliance with GE would help them
land orders for nuclear power plants from China, the report said.
	   Opposition to nuclear power in Japan and the United States has
all but halted construction of new plants in the two countries.

Thailand grants final approval for import of Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Food and Drug Administration
has given final approval for the import of the new impotence drug
Viagra, agency officials said Tuesday.
	   Pfizer, the maker of Viagra, applied for FDA approval in
February. Since then, a black market has developed for the drug,
with a single pill selling for about 1,200 baht (dlrs 30).
	   Thai media also reported last week that local counterfeiters are
producing fake Viagra pills composed primarily of flour, and
selling them for the same price as the real ones. Authorities have
seized more than 150 fake tablets.
	   The go-ahead to import Viagra should help diminish the black
market, FDA officials said.
	   Under FDA rules, Viagra will not be available in drug stores,
but will be sold only in hospital pharmacies with a prescription
from either a urologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist or
psychiatrist.
	   The pill will be priced at 400 baht (dlrs 10) each, the same as
in the United States.
	   Mongkol na Songkhla, secretary general of the FDA, estimated in
June that there are about 100,000 Thais who qualify for
prescriptions.
	   He said the FDA will continue to monitor the drug after its
approval because of questions about its safety.

Khamenei says Iran will not tolerate mischief by the Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, dismissed Afghanistan's Taliban force as ``degenerate''
and said Tuesday that his government would not tolerate the
militia's seizure of 47 Iranian citizens.
	   In similar vein, Iran's former President Hashemi Rafsanjani
warned that Iran might resort to force to free its citizens, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   ``Those who have seen the power of Iran know that the Iranian
nation is strong enough to forcibly free its children,'' said
Rafsanjani, who heads the influential Expediency Council.
	   The Taliban, who profess an extreme version of Islam, could soon
control all of Afghanistan if they vanquish their northern-based
opposition. The religious militia has held the capital of Kabul
since 1996.
	   In a third warning Tuesday, Iran's parliament discussed the
plight of the Iranians _ who were detained when the Taliban
captured the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8 _ and
said that Iran would do whatever was necessary to secure their
release, IRNA reported.
	   State television quoted Khamenei as saying that the Taliban
would be wise to ``release and send (the detainees) back
respectfully because the Iranian nation, government and armed
forces will not tolerate any mischief and wickedness from even the
Americans, let alone by those degenerate and worthless people who
are being used as tools of the foreigners in Afghanistan these
days.''
	   Tehran says the Taliban detained 11 Iranian diplomats, a
correspondent of the official Islamic Republic News Agency and 35
truck drivers who reportedly work for an international transport
company.
	   The Taliban say they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but they admit to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming the
Taliban's enemies.
	   Iran says it holds Pakistan responsible for the Iranians' safety
because Islamabad is widely believed to provide arms and other
support to the Taliban. Iran itself is widely suspected of backing
the anti-Taliban forces.
	   Khamenei accused ``some neighboring countries'' of interfering
in Afghanistan's civil war, the television reported.
	   But he held the Taliban responsible for the Iranians' safety,
saying: ``It is in the interests of those deceived people to
respect the Iranians whom they have arrested and to return them to
their homeland.''
	   In the Iranian capital Tehran on Tuesday, 25 relatives of the
truck drivers demonstrated outside the U.N. office to urge the
world body to intervene to secure the release of the captives, IRNA
said.

Social Democratic face the vote of confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - The Czech Parliament on Tuesday
opened the debate ahead of the vote of confidence in the minority
center-left Social Democratic Cabinet of Premier Milos Zeman.
	   The vote was expected late Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on
the length of the debate.
	   The Cabinet is expected to easily win the vote thanks to a
``toleration pact'' signed last month with the strongest opposition
group, the Civic Democratic Party of former Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   Under the agreement, Klaus' party will allow the Social
Democrats to form a single-party government by pulling out its
deputies during the vote.
	   To win the vote, Zeman will need a simple majority of the
deputies present.
	   In exchange, the Civic Democratic Party was allowed to appoint
the speaker of the Parliament and the chairmen of key parliamentary
committees.
	   The confidence vote comes two months after the election of the
first center-left government since the fall of Communism in 1989.
	   A three-party coalition government led by Klaus collapsed last
November and was replaced by an interim government designed to lead
the country until a new government could be chosen in early
elections.
	   Social Democrats emerged as the winner of the ballot, gaining 74
seats in the 200-seat legislature. Klaus' Civic Democratic Party
came in a close second.
	   Czech law requires that after a government takes office,
parliament must conduct a confidence vote to determine whether the
cabinet has enough political power to implement its programs.
	   The center-right Christian Democrats and Freedom Union, which
hold a total of 39 seats in the parliament, have already said they
would vote against the Cabinet, citing disagreement with the
government's policies. The Communists, with 24 deputies, are likely
to abstain.
	   In foreign policy, the Social Democrats' priorities, such as
integration into the European Union and NATO, are similar to those
of the previous governments.
	   On the domestic front, Zeman has pledged to fight crime and
corruption in the privatization process, and slow down
liberalization of prices.
	   But the Social Democratic intention to strengthen the role of
the state and trade unions in the fledgling free market of the
post-communist era is likely to meet with opposition.

Russia's gas revenue drops by 20 percent in first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia collected a fifth less revenue from natural
gas exports in the first half of 1998 compared to the same period
last year, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   Russian trade officials blamed the 18.4 percent revenue drop on
a 16 percent cut in average export prices, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The overall volume of gas sales was down almost 2 percent in the
first six months of 1998, to 101 billion cubic meters (3.5 trillion
cubic feet). Those sales garnered Russia dlrs 7 billion.
	   Russia exported 40 billion cubic meters (1.2 trillion cubic
feet) of the gas to other parts of the former Soviet Union within
that time, a figure down 5.3 percent compared to the first half of
1997.

ILO: prostitution major contributor to Southeast Asian economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT, Wednesday August 19. &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Prostitution in Southeast Asia has burgeoned so
rapidly that it is now one of the region's big employers and
money-earners, a U.N. report published Wednesday says.
	   Commercial sex is crucial to the livelihoods of millions of
workers beyond prostitutes themselves and provides governments with
substantial revenue, the 232-page International Labor Organization
study says.
	   It accounts for between two to 14 percent of gross domestic
product in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the
report says.
	   Despite the region's current economic woes, demand may rise as
changing currency values ``make sex tourism an even cheaper thrill
for customers from other regions.''
	   Child prostitution in particular could grow as poverty and
unemployment caused by the crisis strain family incomes and force
children onto the streets, the report warns.
	   It recommends that governments draw up separate strategies to
target adult and child prostitution, saying stopping youngsters
getting involved would reduce adult prostitution.
	   ``All forms of child prostitution are an unacceptable form of
child labor and should be eliminated,'' said the ILO official who
directed the study, Lin Leam Lim.
	   The report, entitled The Sex Sector, is based on detailed
studies of prostitution and commercial sex in the four countries.
The authors stress it reflects the situation in many other
countries.
	   In Thailand, the report says the unofficial total of 200,000 to
300,000 women working in the sex industry in cities and towns give
some dlrs 300 million a year to families in the countryside, ``a
sum that in most cases exceeds the budgets of government-funded
development programs.''
	   From 1993 to 1995, prostitution in Thailand yielded an annual
income between dlrs 22.5 and 27 billion, it said.
	   In Indonesia, the sex industry's financial turnover is estimated
at between dlrs 1.2 billion and dlrs 3.3 billion per year,
representing between 0.8 and 2.4 percent of the country's GDP.
	   In all four countries studied, sex work provided significantly
higher earnings than other forms of unskilled labor, the study
said.
	   The report said it isn't possible to specify exact figures on
the extent of child prostitution. It said a 1997 study put the
number of child prostitutes at 75,000 in the Philippines. In
Thailand, a 1993 estimate said between 30-35,000 children were
involved in prostitution.
	   It suggested governments should keep records about it and target
any programs not only towards prostitutes but also their clients.
	   ``The stark reality is that the sex sector is a big business,''
the study said. ``The health dimensions...are too serious and
urgent to ignore.''

Norwegian whale hunt ends short of quota
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's whalers ended this year's season of
the often-controversial hunt on Monday with a kill of 624, short of
the quota of 671 allowed by the government.
	   The whales were killed by hunters on 35 boats, said Per
Rolandsen of the Norwegian Fishermen's Sales Organization in
Svolvaer.
	   Norway enraged activists by resuming its commercial whale hunts
in 1993, despite a global ban imposed by the International Whaling
Commission in 1986.
	   Norway said the population of minke whales was large enough that
they could be hunted without endangering the species' survival.
That position has gained grudging acceptance among many.
	   The hunt's quota has been raised each year, from 293 in 1993.
This year's hunt began in May.
	   Of this year's hunt, 285 whales were killed in the Barents Sea.
The rest were taken along Norway's coast, Jan Mayen island or the
Svalbard archipelago.
	   Because export of whale products is banned, all the meat is sold
in Norway.
	   Rolandsen says that as long as the quota does not get bigger,
the whalers will have no trouble selling the meat to consumers. The
blubber, however, has no market in Norway and ends up in storage,
at the same time as demand in Japan is not satisfied.

Hoddle says no adverse reaction from players to his book
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BURNHAM BEECHES, England (AP) _ England soccer coach Glenn
Hoddle said Tuesday he has not received any angry reactions from
players over his controversial World Cup book.
	   His book, ``The 1998 World Cup Story,'' sparked criticism when
details of how Paul Gascoigne went beserk when he was axed from
England's squad were published in the Sun newspaper.
	   But Hoddle, speaking at England's Euro 2000 training base, said
criticism of his book was unjustified and the players did not have
any problems with it. He also said the controversy would not affect
his position as England coach.
	   ``There has been no adverse feelings among the players, they
have been very positive,'' he said. ``I asked any players to come
and see me if they had a problem and not one came forward.
	   ``Hardly anybody had actually seen the book until recent days.
I'm encouraging all the players to read any mention of themselves.
If they want to talk to me...I'm available.
	   ``No confidences have been betrayed. It is a positive book _
positive about the England team and its players, positive about our
future prospects in Euro 2000.''
	   The British media, the players' association and several past and
present players said Hoddle had breached the trust of players by
publishing inside information about the team.
	   There were calls for Hoddle to be fired as national coach.
	   ``Over the past few days my major concern has been about the
England players, and their reaction to some of the wild comments
about my new book,'' Hoddle said Tuesday.
	   Hoddle would not speculate on his future as England coach after
Euro 2000.
	   ``None of this controversy will affect my decision as to whether
or not I sign a new contract,'' he said.
	   ``I have two years of my current contract still remaining and
that is how things stand at this moment in time.
	   ``The only thing in my mind at the moment is working with the
players I have here and qualifying for the European Championship.''
	   Hoddle has been working with a squad of players since Sunday
night in preparation for England's first Euro 2000 qualifying match
against Sweden on Sept. 5.

VW expanding into commercial vehicle market with or without
</HEADLINE>
partner &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen AG intends to expand into
the commercial vehicle market with two new models by 2010 _ with or
without a partner, VW chairman Ferdinand Piech said in an interview
published Tuesday.
	   ``We will broaden our commercial vehicle range irrespective of
whether VW enters additional cooperations or makes further
acquisitions,'' Piech was quoted as saying in the German monthly
magazine Capital.
	   Volkswagen, Europe's largest automaker, has a commercial-vehicle
division currently that specializes in light vans and minibuses.
	   Piech has indicated before that he wants to enter the market for
medium and heavy trucks, and recent reports have suggested VW was
considering a deal with Volvo, one of the world leaders in that
area, as well as other companies.
	   Having recently been accused of spending too much to acquire
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, Piech said he was in no rush to buy
anything else, adding that potential targets were too expensive.
	   ``I'm patient enough to wait for the next crisis,'' he said.
	   VW this year paid dlrs 790 million for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars,
but will have to let BMW take over production of Rolls-Royces in a
few years because the rival automaker owns the rights to the famous
marquee
	   A spokesman at VW wasn't immediately available for comment.
	   Piech also repeated that he will build the New Beetle in at the
company's flagship plant in Wolfsburg if unions agree to
concessions on extra pay for Saturday shifts.
	   At present, VW manufactures the New Beetle at its Mexican plant
in Puebla. Piech is looking for additional production capacity as
the new model will hit the German market in November. Practically
all of Puebla's annual production of 70,000 units is sold in the
U.S. market.

Israeli defense minister calls on Syria to return to peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's defense minister on Tuesday called on
Syria to resume peace talks, but denied he has softened his
position on an Israeli troop withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
	   Earlier this week, the minister, Yitzhak Mordechai created
confusion when he told the German news magazine Focus that he had
``invented'' a formula concerning a Golan pullback that was used by
the previous, more dovish government of the late Yitzhak Rabin.
	   The phrase said that the depth of withdrawal from the Golan
depended on the depth of peace offered by Syria. It was widely
interpreted as meaning that for full peace, Syria would get back
all of the Golan which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Mordechai told a news conference Tuesday that the formula
guiding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government was
different from that of the Rabin era.
	   He implied that the Netanyahu government would not give up the
entire Golan under any circumstances. ``I see the Golan as
strategic territory vital for the defense of northern Israel,'' he
said.
	   ``We have our formula and they (Netanyahu's predecessors) have
theirs,'' Mordechai said.
	   The minister called on Syria to resume peace talks. ``It is
better for the sides to talk than to make war,'' he said.
	   Peace negotiations with Syria broke down in February 1996, at a
time when, according to Syrian claims, Netanyahu's predecessors had
already agreed to hand over all of the Golan for a peace treaty.
	   Syria wants negotiations to resume at the point where they left
off. However, the Netanyahu government denies such a commitment was
made and insists the talks resume without preconditions.
	   After the news conference, Mordechai flew to the Golan to watch
an army exercise.

 &UR; American novelist to be buried in an Austrian church &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) _ French novelist Julien Green, who
died last Thursday in Paris, will be buried in the chapel of an
Austrian Church in this town he described as a ``refuge of peace,''
the Austria Press Agency reported Tuesday.
	   He will be laid to rest in the Marian Chapel of the Catholic St.
Egydius municipal parish church in this capital city of Austria's
southernmost Carinthia (Kaernten) province.
	   Green was first in Klagenfurt in 1990 to attend the staging of
one of his plays at the municipal theater. At that time, the
novelist was deeply moved by an old painting of Virgin Mary and
expressed his wish to be buried there.
	   ``In this precarious and unsafe world, Klagenfurt is for me a
refuge of happiness and peace,'' Green reportedly explained his
choice.
	   To mark the rare occasion, the funeral rites will be conducted
by Klagenfurt bishop Egon Kapellari.
	   Green commissioned construction of a tomb in the St. Egydius
Marian Chapel. A bronze sculpture was created by an artist from
Eastern Tyrol.
	   A marble slab will carry the name ``Julian Green,'' the original
American spelling of his name.

Some 1,000 Iranian pilgrims cross into Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some 1,000 Iranian pilgrims crossed the
Iranian border into Iraq on Tuesday, the largest such group to
traverse the frontier in almost two decades, Iraq's official news
agency reported.
	   The pilgrims are to visit sites sacred to Shiite Muslims.
	   On Saturday, 750 Iranian pilgrims were allowed into Iraq. It was
the first such group to cross the border since the September 1980
start of the eight-year Iran-Iraq War.
	   Some 250 pilgrims arrived on Sunday and another 1,000 are
expected Thursday, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Iraq and Iran agreed to allow 3,000 Iranian pilgrims to visit
holy shrines every week.
	   The pilgrims will visit shrines in Samara, Karbala, Najaf and
Baghdad _ sites that are for Shiite Muslims second only to holy
shrines in Saudi Arabia.
	   Hundreds of Iranian pilgrims have also traveled to Iraq via
Syria.

Volkswagen Mexico reaches labor agreement, averts strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An agreement between Volkswagen and the
largest union at the carmaker's only North American plant averted a
strike just a few hours before a deadline.
	   The deal reached late Monday, after more than a week of talks,
calls for a 21 percent salary increase plus other non-wage
benefits, Volkswagen Mexico spokesman Michael Wijers said Tuesday.
	   Wages were the main issue. The Independent Union of Volkswagen
Workers entered talks seeking a 35 percent pay increase.
	   The wage rise will take effect Sept. 1. Both parties also agreed
on additional benefits, such as increases in the company's
profit-sharing program, an additional vacation day and a 21 percent
increase in a food distribution program.
	   Further details on the negotiations would be released later,
Wijers said.
	   Europe's largest carmaker employs 15,800 people at its Puebla
plant southeast of Mexico City, about 10,000 of whom belong to the
union.
	   Puebla is VW's only production site for the New Beetle. The
plant also manufactures Jettas and Golfs for the local and export
market as well as regular Beetles for the domestic market.
	   Talks to renew the two-year contract formally began last week.
Negotiators also met throughout the weekend.

Swiss vice president: Banks' settlement `heartening'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland's vice president on Tuesday welcomed
the two biggest Swiss banks' settlement of Holocaust survivors'
claims against them, and reportedly said the banks were repairing
their own mistakes.
	   In an interview with Geneva daily Le Temps, Ruth Dreifuss
expressed confidence that last week's settlement, in which United
Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse agreed to pay dlrs 1.25
billion, will end the pressure on Switzerland over Holocaust-era
assets.
	   ``The banks' mistake has been repaired by the banks,'' said
Dreifuss, herself Jewish. ``In a country where they carry such
weight and such potential for development, that's heartening.''
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   The banks say they expect other Swiss companies and institutions
to help finance the sum.
	   Many politicians remain cautious, and all four parties in the
coalition government have rejected suggestions the Swiss National
Bank, the country's central bank, should contribute.
	   ``The agreement creates no obligation for the SNB,'' Dreifuss
said, stressing the central bank's autonomy. The bank has called a
special board meeting for Friday to discuss the settlement.
	   Meanwhile, SNB board chairman Jakob Schoenenberger confirmed a
report in the capital's daily Berner Zeitung that he and bank
president Hans Meyer oppose making a contribution.
	   The government's only official response to the settlement has
been a brief statement restating its position that the accord is a
matter for those involved, adding that it is committed to nothing
by the agreement.
	   In a poll of 573 people in Switzerland's German- and
French-speaking regions published Tuesday, 45 percent of those
questioned said they were satisfied with the settlement and 41
percent said they were dissatisfied.
	   Carried out from Thursday to Saturday by the MIS Trend research
institute for the Lausanne weekly L'Illustre, it gave a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
	   Dreifuss appeared to distance herself from Swiss government
decisions earlier this year not to compensate two Jewish wartime
refugees whose asylum pleas were rejected.
	   The governing Federal Council, or cabinet, rejected compensation
claims by Joseph Spring and Charles Sonabend, refused refuge by the
country during World War II. Dreifuss is one of the seven members
on the cabinet.
	   ``I would have liked the state to materially repair the errors
some of its agents may have committed in putting refugees' lives in
danger by returning them,'' Dreifuss said.
	   ``I'm thinking in particular of what Swiss police inflicted on
the family of Joseph Spring, that of Sonabend and others.''
	   Spring and Sonabend, who separately escaped to Switzerland with
their families during World II, were sent back by Swiss authorities
to Nazi-controlled territory. They survived, but relatives who were
with them subsequently died in concentration camps.

Riot breaks out at Lithuanian refugee center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Detainees at a holding center for
illegal immigrants rioted into early Tuesday after more than a
dozen escaped from the facility, the Baltic News Service reported.
	   Several of those who escaped from the center in Pabrad, near
Vilnius, on Monday were captured and returned that evening. Others
in the facility began hurling chairs and dishes when the escapees
were brought back, BNS said.
	   The facility holds about 300 illegal immigrants from
Afghanistan, Vietnam and Iraq.
	   Troops were brought in after about three hours of rioting, but
the turmoil continued.
	   An Afghan refugee was brought in to talk to the angry rioters
and was instrumental in calming the situation, BNS said.
	   Lithuania has become a favorite transit point for illegal
immigrants trying to reach western Europe.

Russian border guard chief discusses strengthening Afghan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of Russia's border guards discussed ways
Tuesday of strengthening the borders between former Soviet
republics and Afghanistan, a news agency said.
	   Col. Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha was in Dushanbe, the capital of
Tajikistan, for talks with President Emomali Rakhmonov. Russia has
25,000 troops in Tajikistan already to guards its border with
Afghanistan.
	   The former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear that if the
Taliban Islamic army gains full control of Afghanistan there will
be an influx of refugees and weapons across their borders.
	   Bordyuzha, head of Russia's Federal Border Service, said that he
and Rakhmonov worked out measures to be implemented in the most
``explosive'' parts of the Tajik border if necessary, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Moscow is also sending a first deputy foreign minister and the
head of the general staff of the Russian armed forces to Tajikistan
for talks this week.

Croatian, Yugoslav foreign ministers discuss remaining disputes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Prevlaka to be further discussed in
grafs 3-4; trade agreements signed. Adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The foreign ministers of Croatia and
Yugoslavia failed Tuesday to find a solution to their countries'
last major dispute _ the controversial Prevlaka peninsula.
	   Prevlaka remains the last major argument between the two
countries and it topped the agenda when Croatian Foreign Minister
Mate Granic's met his Yugoslav counterpart Zivadin Jovanovic in the
Croatia capital.
	   Prevlaka borders Yugoslavia to the south and controls the
straight allowing access to the port where the Yugoslav navy has
its headquarters. The Yugoslavs want control of the narrow strip of
land to safeguard its navy, while Croatia is determined not to
relinquish authority over its southernmost peninsula.
	   Croatia and Yugoslavia established diplomatic relations in
August 1996, almost five years after a bloody war in which
Yugoslavia backed minority Serb rebels in Croatia. But they have
failed to agree on the peninsula.
	   On Tuesday, both Granic and Jovanovic acknowledged that
Prevlaka, as well as some minor border disputes in the north, are
priority and that the negotiations should continue. But after
3-hour discussions, they agreed only that their experts should meet
within a month to work on a solution.
	   During the war, the Serb briefly seized Prevlaka, but the two
sides later agreed to let the United Nations deploy observers there
until the dispute could be resolved.
	   The U.N. Security Council recognizes Prevlaka as a part of
Croatia, but it insists that the two sides reach an agreement so
the 28-man U.N. observer mission can leave.
	   Croatia recently proposed the area to be demilitarized, but
Yugoslavia wants talks on who would ultimately control it.
	   Jovanovic said that although different, the two proposals would
be the base for their expert teams' talks.
	   The two ministers also signed agreements on boosting bilateral
trade and investments between their countries. Bilateral trade in
the first half of 1998 showed a sharp increase _ 160 times more
than in the same period last year.
	   Nevertheless, Granic mountains that Croatia would have to side
with western governments if they decide to reimpose sanctions on
Yugoslavia.
	   The two also agreed to release all prisoners of war remaining in
their prisons and discussed opening consulates on each others'
territory; a Croatian consulate in the northern Yugoslav town of
Subotica and a Yugoslav consulate in the eastern Croat town of
Vukovar.

<TEXT>
	   MERSA MATROUH, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's president and Yasser Arafat
on Tuesday discussed freezing the stalled Middle East peace
process, the Palestinian leader said.
	   Arafat told journalists that the two leaders discussed Israel's
refusal to accept a U.S. proposal on troop withdrawal from the West
Bank.
	   ``We have accepted this proposal, even though it does not comply
with all of the Palestinian needs. ... But until now the Israelis
have not accepted it,'' Arafat said after two hours of talks with
Hosni Mubarak.
	   The two met at an undisclosed location near the airport in Mersa
Matrouh, a Mediterranean resort 270 kilometers (160 miles) west of
Alexandria.
	   Mubarak did not speak to journalists.
	   The talks come amid rising Palestinian frustration over Israel's
refusal to accept the U.S. proposal, which calls for an additional
13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Israel has rejected the proposal citing security concerns.
	   Arafat also said the two discussed an Egyptian-French plan to
call an international summit to try to get the negotiations back on
track. The summit would involve Arab and Western nations but would
initially exclude Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty
with Israel and has long served as a mediator in Arab-Israeli
talks. Arafat often visits Egypt to consult with Mubarak.

As other favorites advance, Bartova fails
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bartova failing to qualify in the women's pole
vault &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Europe's fastest men went into early
action at the European Championship and Charalambos Papadias of
Greece led the favorites into the second round of the 100-meter
dash Tuesday.
	   As the six-day event opened, Papadias clocked the fastest time
in the first round of 100-meter qualifying, cruising home in 10.27
seconds.
	   In the first upset of the championship, Daniela Bartova, the
Czech pole vaulter who broke the world record 10 times in 1995,
failed to qualify for the final.
	   Other favorites advanced, in slow times on a hot and sunny
morning in the Hungarian capital.
	   They included Norway's Geir Moen (10.38) and Anninos Marcoulides
of Cyprus (10.38). But the Cypriot, who is second in Europe this
year with a 10.12, was only third in his heat, behind Marcin Nowak
of Poland (10.35) and Stefano Tilli of Italy, 10.37.
	   Stephane Diagana of France, the 400-meter hurdles world
champion, cleared the first round of qualifying by winning his heat
in 49.28.
	   Carlos Silva of Portugal led all qualifiers with a time of
49.00. His heat 3 turned out to be the fastest, with three other
runners beating Diagana's time.
	   Ruslan Mashchenko of Russia, who has the fastest time in Europe
this year of 48.06, won his heat to advance in a relatively slow
50.30.
	   In the men's shot put, all the favorites moved into the final
later Tuesday, with Oleksandr Bagach of Ukraine leading the field
with a heave of 20.47 meters. He was followed by Dragan Peric of
Yugoslavia at 20.44. Peric leads the European lists with 21.77 this
year, also the second best result in the world.
	   In minor upsets, Victor Bulat of Belarus and Mark Proctor of
Britain both failed to have a valid attempt and did not qualify.
	   In the women's javelin, the golden Finnish duo of Trine
Hattestad and Heli Rantanen moved into the final without pushing
themselves.
	   Hattestad, the world champion, had a throw of 62.55 meters,
while Rantanen, the Olympic champion, had 60.90.
	   Steffi Nerius of Germany led the field with 66.04.
	   In addition to the men's shot put, two other finals were later
in the day: the men's 20K walk and the men's 10,000, where Spanish
and Portuguese runners were expected to battle for the medals.
	   Bartova, who set the European record at 4.51 meters in June, the
fourth best vault this year in the world, cleared 4.00 in her final
attempt, then skipped 4.10. She failed in all three attempts at
4.15, a height that would have qualified her.
	   The quadrennial event is suffering from a lack of major stars.
	   The most notable absentees are Sergey Bubka, the Ukrainian world
record holder in the pole vault and a six-time world champion, and
Marie Jose-Perec, the 200 and 400-meter Olympic champion from
France.
	   It may fall to a Kenyan to provide some glitter to the
championship.
	   Wilson Kipketer is now a Danish citizen, but he was born in
Kenya.
	   Kipketer, the 800-meter world champion and world record-holder,
is eager to perform well at his first European championship as a
Danish citizen.
	   The field includes more than 1,300 athletes from 44 countries
with Germany fielding the largest team (123) followed by France
(103), Russia (101), Italy (83), Hungary (80) and Spain (76).

Prospect for Kosovo talks dim, despite intense U.S. effort

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albanians declining to meet government officials
to resume talks on Kosovo; ADDS quotes from U.S. envoy Hill,
details. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian negotiators refused
to meet their Serb counterparts for talks on the future of Kosovo
on Tuesday, despite intense efforts by U.S. diplomats to bring the
sides together.
	   The diplomatic initiative was headed by envoy Christopher Hill,
who met with the Albanian negotiators, then conferred separately
with Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader who appointed them.
	   After meeting the Albanian leaders, Hill conceded no immediate
progress had been made, but vowed foreign powers will ``stay at it
and we're going to stay at it until we succeed.''
	   If and when the two sides do eventually meet, prospects for
peace are dim.
	   The talks are being boycotted by ethnic Albanian opposition
parties and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence in
the Serbian republic, where Albanians account for 90 percent of the
population of 2 million. Kosovo is in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   Rugova announced the Albanians' negotiating team last week, but
it comprises only his own associates.
	   Hill, who has been shuttling between leaders on both sides,
reiterated that neither side should count on achieving anything by
force.
	   But while there were no reports of fighting between rebel ethnic
Albanians and Serb security forces, the two sides made it clear
they were no closer to sitting down for talks.
	   In a letter to his Serbian counterpart, chief Albanian
negotiator Fehmi Agani refused a Serb invitation to resume
negotiations, broken off in May following a Serbian offensive in
the embattled province, until the attacks stop.
	   ``I have pointed out the necessity that violence stop against
the Albanian civilian population,'' Agani said. ``If you have
nothing to say about this, maybe it would be beneficial to stop
this game with invitations to meet, apparently timed to serve
propaganda.''
	   There were no fresh reports of fighting Tuesday, after a weekend
push during which Serbian forces captured a series of key Albanian
strongholds.
	   The United Nations now estimates more than 231,000 people have
been uprooted in the six months since the conflict began. Many have
fled across the mountainous border with Albania, where the KLA also
maintains bases.

More than 120 drown in separate Sierra Leone incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ More than 100 people who had been
kidnapped from their villages by Sierra Leonean rebels drowned with
their captors over the weekend when the boat taking them away
struck a rock and sank, police said Tuesday.
	   Over 20 people drowned in a separate weekend incident when their
boat capsized, newspapers said.
	   The kidnap victims drowned in a river accident about 80 miles
(130 kilometers) north of Freetown, police said.
	   The victims, mostly women and children, were kidnapped last week
from villages northeast of Freetown by rebels.
	   They drowned while being taken to an unknown destination,
survivors told police.
	   Police were still investigating the accident and retrieving
bodies, which had turned up in the nearby Port Loko river.
	   Since President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was restored to power earlier
this year by a West African intervention force, members of Sierra
Leone's ousted junta and their rebels allies have been killing,
maiming and kidnapping thousands of civilians in remote areas.
	   Efforts by the regional force, known as ECOMOG, have been
unsuccessful in completely wiping out the rebels.
	   In the other incident, a radio report Tuesday said that over 20
people drowned when their boat capsized mid-stream on a river in
southern Sierra Leone
	   Kanoh Brimah, one of only two people who survived the Sunday
accident, told state-owned radio that the victims were all illegal
diamond miners on their way to work in the village of Mokpendeh, in
the southern province of Bo, about 150 miles (250 kilometers) from
Freetown.
	   Bo authorities said bad weather and heavy rainfall contributed
to the accident. They have banned all mining in the district until
after the rainy season because of the weekend accident and a
similar incident in June, the report said.

Jane's: China wants to buy more than 20 Su-30 Russian fighters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ China wants to buy more than 20 Sukhoi Su-30
multi-role fighter aicraft from Russia, Jane's Defense Weekly
reported Tuesday.
	   The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding to open
formal negotiations on China's proposed purchase during the recent
visit of a Russian military delegation to China, the respected
military magazine said.
	   Russia may also transfer Su-30 production technology to China,
it said.
	   During the visit, the two countries agreed to cooperate in the
joint research, development and production of military equipment,
Jane's quoted a senior Russian general as saying.
	   ``The Russian-Chinese military-technical coopration will get a
new impetus,'' deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, Col. Gen.
Valery Manilov, was quoted as saying.
	   The cooperation agreement, which runs until 2005, also covers
the training of Chinese military personnel in Russian defense
establishments, Manilov told Jane's.
	   During the past three years, Russia has earned at least dlrs 1
billion annually from arms sales to China's People's Liberation
Army, Jane's said.
	   Aircraft and air defense systems account for 70 percent of the
Russian exports. China is also buying submarines and destroyers
from Russia, it said.

Denmark to get first Roman Catholic abbess in 462 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Denmark will get its first Roman
Catholic abbess in 462 years when Mother Theresa of the Cistercians
order is ordained in October, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The order's international leadership recently decided to elevate
the status of Holy Virgin's Sacred Heart convent near Grenaa,
central Denmark, to have an abbess.
	   Mother Theresa, who in the past 11 years has been the leader of
Denmark's sole Cistercian convent, was elected abbess by its 13
nuns, the Kristeligt Dagblad newspaper said.
	   The ordination will be performed by Denmark's Roman Catholic
Bishop Czeslaw Kozon on Oct. 3.
	   There are some 31,000 Roman Catholics in Denmark. Almost 90
percent of the country's 5.2 million inhabitants belong to the
State Lutheran Church.

Kuchma discusses Ukraine's economic, social situation with Kohl
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma discussed
the world financial crisis and his country's economic and social
situation Tuesday with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the
presidential press service said.
	   Ukraine, like Germany, has been hurt by financial turmoil in
Russia and its sharp devaluation of the ruble.
	   In a telephone conversation, Kuchma told Kohl about measures
taken by the government to support Ukraine's economy, the press
service said. Ukraine's National Bank raised a key interest rate by
10 percent Tuesday to protect the battered hryvna currency.
	   Kohl promised to try to speed up the International Monetary
Fund's decision about releasing dlrs 2.2 billion in new credits for
Ukraine.
	   An IMF mission recommended the disbursement of the loan earlier
this month, and both Kohl and Kuchma stressed that a positive
decision by the IMF board of directors would be important to
protect Ukraine's economy, the report said.

At least 178 feared killed in Indian landslide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RAISES number of dead or missing to 178. ADDS details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A mountain of mud buried a village on a
popular Hindu pilgrimage route Tuesday in northern India, trapping
at least 178 villagers and pilgrims who were feared dead.
	   Paramilitary troops launched a furious rescue effort and
recovered seven bodies, but officials said 171 others were believed
to be under the collapsed mountain, said Naresh Dayal, top official
of the Interior Department in the northern Uttar Pradesh state.
	   Nine injured people were taken to hospitals, Dayal said.
	   Those missing include 60 Hindu devotees returning from a
pilgrimage to the deeply revered religious shrine of Kailash
Mansarovar in the Chinese province of Tibet.
	   The mud slide, triggered by overnight torrential rains, buried
the pilgrims camped in a Himalayan village near Pithoragarh, 325
kilometers (200 miles) east of New Delhi, said Ashok Kumar, the
state's relief commissioner.
	   The road to Pithoragarh was washed away, hampering efforts by
rescue crews to reach the site. Telephone lines also were down, and
further details were not available.
	   ``Two Army teams sent there have not been able to reach because
road links are disrupted. Indian Air Force helicopters could not
take off,'' Dayal said.
	   This was the second disaster to hit the mountainous region of
Uttar Pradesh in one week. A landslide killed at least 42 people
and hundreds of animals on Aug. 12, and destroyed several houses
and shops in the nearby Ukhimutt region. The downpour knocked down
telephone and electricity poles and blocked roads.
	   Ukhimutt is near Rudraprayag, one of the most important Hindu
pilgrimage centers, and is close to a region where a 1991
earthquake killed 341 people.

Cries for crackdown on animal abuse follow deaths in Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ROM 104-105, 109 &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Summer in Italy, and the living is easy -- well,
maybe not for animals.
	   Every year, newspapers in the vacation months are filled with
photos of women in bikinis, maps showing the beaches where the VIPs
are sunning themselves, reports on the latest ice cream flavor and
accounts of suffering animals.
	   The news Tuesday of the deaths of a second horse from the
running of the tourist-popular Palio race in Siena and of 12 dogs
left for days without drinkable water in a kennel near Milan
sharpened cries for better treatment of animals in Italy.
	   A deputy in Parliament, Maretta Scoca, called on her colleagues
to join her after the legislative summer recess to quickly pass a
law to protect animals.
	   ``Animals are beings with their own dignity and sensibility, and
they are an integral part of human life,'' said Scoca, blamed the
horse deaths from Sunday's running of the Palio and the kennel
problem on ``inadequate laws in favor of animals.''
	   She demanded systematic inspections of kennels.
	   Another parliamentary deputy has requested a report on how
horses are treated during the Palio, a fiercely competitive
medieval pageant race in Tuscany, which has cost the lives of 38
horses since 1975.
	   Bareback riders often whip their mounts, and spills on the
dirt-covered cobblestone square are frequent.
	   Milan daily Corriere della Sera ran descriptions of the golden
retriever, seven German shepherds and other pets which died in the
kennel in hopes the vacationing owners would spot the news. Of the
surviving boarders, 51 dogs and cats were being treated for
dehydration. The kennel owner blamed the deaths on water
contaminated after a pump broke.
	   Poor treatment of animals ``is a cultural problem in Italy,''
said Maria Falvo, a spokeswoman for the Anti-vivisection League
which has denounced the Palio race and other local traditions
involving animals, such as one in which firecrackers are tied to
pigeons before the fireworks are lit.
	   ``It's the peasant culture,'' Falvo said, referring to Italy's
strong agricultural traditions which dominated the country until
only a few decades ago. ``Horses were good for carrying water,''
she added, urging education in schools on how to treat pets.
	   Last year, 150,000 dogs and 300,000 cats were counted as
abandoned in Italy out of a pet population of nearly 15 million.
	   The concept of kennels in Italy is relatively new. A not
uncommon sight in early summer are dogs, often well-groomed and
with collars, wandering through streets or along highways after
owners let them out of cars and drove away.
	   In a town near Milan, a turtle got a new lease on life Tuesday
in a pond cared for by the World Wide Fund for Nature after a
lifeguard found it in a public pool. The pet had been tossed in the
pool at night, presumably by its owners.

Georgian capital records outbreak of rare liver disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Authorities are warning Georgians to
avoid drinking tap water after dozens of people have been diagnosed
with a rare and difficult to treat liver ailment.
	   In the past 15 days, 63 people have been diagnosed with liver
abscesses, most of them in Tbilisi, said health ministry official
Ramaz Urushadze.
	   Liver abscesses are usually a complication of other problems,
but Georgian officials believe this outbreak was caused by bacteria
in polluted water.
	   Authorities suspect that many more people may have contracted
the disease, and are urging Georgians to seek medical help if they
feel any abdominal pain.
	   Health officials are also urging people to buy bottled water, or
at least boil tap water before drinking.
	   Treatment of the disease is complicated and requires surgery.
Twenty-six of the victims have already been operated on, Urushadze
said, and the government is offering to pay for surgery to
encourage people to seek medical help.

 &UR; Belgium seek authorization for 6th evacuation flight from Kinshasa &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium said Tuesday it was seeking
authorization for a sixth charter flight in four days to complete
the evacuation of some 1,000 foreigners from Kinshasa.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Huub Cooeremans said five planes,
chartered by Belgium, have ferried 981 foreigners from Kinshasa to
Libreville, Gabon, since the weekend.
	   About 70 foreigners, who want to leave, remained in Kinshasa and
the Belgian government was trying to get authorization for a sixth
evacuation flight, said Cooremans.
	   ``We have received many pleas from other countries to get their
nationals out of Congo,'' said Cooremans.
	   He said Belgium, Congo's former ruler, was the only country
allowed to charter evacuation planes.
	   ``We have opted to charter civilian aircraft on purpose. That
has worked very well for until now the evacuations have been
carried out without incidents,'' Cooremans told a press conference.
	   The Belgian government has chartered planes from the no-frills
Belgian carrier City Bird to fly foreigners from Kinshasa to
Libreville and from there to Paris and Brussels.
	   Cooremans could not give a cost estimate for the flights but
said the Belgian government would not charge evacuees anything.
	   He said negotiations with officials in Congo for the evacuation
flights ``were difficult. For each flight we have to negotiate.''

Some 1,000 Iranian pilgrims cross into Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some 1,000 Iranian pilgrims crossed the
Iranian border into Iraq on Tuesday, the largest such group to
traverse the frontier in almost two decades, Iraq's official news
agency reported.
	   The pilgrims are to visit sites sacred to Shiite Muslims.
	   On Saturday, 750 Iranian pilgrims were allowed into Iraq. It was
the first such group to cross the border since the September 1980
start of the eight-year Iran-Iraq War.
	   Some 250 pilgrims arrived on Sunday and another 1,000 are
expected Thursday, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Iraq and Iran agreed to allow 3,000 Iranian pilgrims to visit
holy shrines every week.
	   The pilgrims will visit shrines in Samara, Karbala, Najaf and
Baghdad _ sites that are for Shiite Muslims second only to holy
shrines in Saudi Arabia.
	   Hundreds of Iranian pilgrims have also traveled to Iraq via
Syria.

Minister defends Milan's other airport EU's negative vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A preliminary EU vote against Milan's expanded
Malpensa airport will not keep Italy from seeking to transform it
into the country's main hub, Transport Minister Claudio Burlando
said Tuesday.
	   A European Union commission on Monday criticized Malpensa for
the airport's distance from downtown Milan -- 53 kilometers (33
miles) -- and lack of an adequate highway or railway link to the
city center.
	   It also said that Burlando's plans to reroute all international
flights from Milan's nearby Linate airport to Malpensa _ except for
carriers which fly at least 2 million passengers per year from
Linate _ discriminated against foreign airlines.
	   Only Italy's flagship airline Alitalia would meet that
criterion, prompting complaints from carriers including British
Airways, Lufthansa and Iberia that they would be shut out of
Linate.
	   At only 10 kilometers (six miles) from downtown Milan, Linate is
the more popular hub among passengers.
	   ``The game is not over,'' said Burlando. ``We still have three
weeks to understand whether we can reach an agreement or whether we
are heading towards a very deep split between our country and the
EU.''
	   The European Union is expected to make a final decision on
Malpensa Sept. 9. Its commission has been insisting on better
transport links be made with Malpensa. A rail link is under
construction but won't be ready till late 1999.
	   Under Burlando's plans, Alitalia would also reroute 10 percent
of its international flights from Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport
to Malpensa, which is set to reopen Oct. 25. Many living in Rome,
including the diplomatic corps, have protested the plan as being
inconvenient.

Play on Gandhi's assassin banned in Indian province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A controversial play about the assassin of
Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi has been banned in the
country's most populous state, officials said Tuesday.
	   Permission to stage the play in Lucknow, the state capital of
Uttar Pradesh, was sought by the right-wing Shiv Sena party, seen
as the closest political movement today to the Hindu extremist who
killed Gandhi, Nathuram Godse. The state government is run by the
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, a close ally of the Shiv
Sena.
	   The play about Godse, who was hanged for pumping three bullets
into Gandhi at a 1948 prayer meeting, was banned in the western
state of Maharashtra last month after producers were forced to
cancel a performance by hundreds of furious protesters.
	   ``There is no need to start a fresh controversy by allowing the
Shiv Sena to stage the play here,'' provincial BJP leader Lalji
Tandon said. ``We cannot allow the people's sensibilities to be
hurt by glorifying Godse.''
	   Permission was denied after consultation with the federal
government in New Delhi led by the BJP, said state Home Secretary
Naresh Dayal.
	   Lawmakers had complained last month that the play denigrates
Gandhi, known as the Mahatma, or great soul, and glorifies his
killer. Playwrights have been split on the issue, with a large
number opposing curbs on the right to artistic expression.
	   Godse, a Hindu nationalist, was enraged by Gandhi's overtures to
Muslims after the partition of Britain's Indian empire into
predominately Hindu India and officially Islamic Pakistan.
	   The play's author, Pradeep Dalvi, had challenged in court a ban
imposed in 1987 by the then-Maharashtra state government run by the
Congress Party. He withdrew his petition after censors cleared the
play last year when the right-wing BJP-Shiv Sena government came to
power in the state.
	   The producers have staged 80 performances of the play in Bombay
and in Gandhi's home state of Gujarat in the Gujarati language in
the past year. The success of the play prompted producers to stage
it in Marathi and Hindi languages.

Musicologist Iosif Sava dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A well-known musicologist who
supported soprano Angela Gheorghiu and numerous other Romanian
artists had died. He was 65.
	   Iosif Sava died of a Tuesday blocked intestinal track after 40
days hospitalization, Bucharest Municipal Hospital said in a
statement.
	   There was an immediate outpouring of sentiment for the man who
was loved as much for his sharp wit seen on his weekly TV shows as
for his musical knowledge.
	   ``It's a great loss for music in general,'' said Adrian
Iorgulescu, head of the Composers and Musicologists Union by
telephone. ```He kept alive culture with an overwhelming energy and
power.''
	   Sava graduated from Romania's conservatory of music, Ciprian
Borumbescu in 1966. He lived in Bucharest.
	   Under dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Sava was the only person
promoting opera and classical music through his radio and TV
broadcasts. But Ceausescu forbade his shows in 1988, allowing only
allowing patriotic songs that praised him and the Communist Party.
	   After the fall of communism, Sava hosted a weekly TV talk show
featuring artists and musicians, who would angered the former
ruling party with their frank comments about the difficulties they
faced living in Romania. As a result, this show was also restricted
by the authorities.
	   In his year 44-year career, Sava wrote 60 books about music,
artists and composers and published thousands of articles. But he
was best known for supporting generations of Romanian artists,
including sopranos Angela Gheorghiu and Lina Vaduva and violinist
Silivia Marcovici.
	   Sava is to be buried Wednesday at the Filantropia Jewish
cemetery in Bucharest, national news agency Rompres reported.
	   He is survived by his wife.

 &UR; Wounded Spanish children flown home from Northern Ireland &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with departure of wounded, meeting with
prince &QL; 
 &UR; With Northern Ireland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Spanish children wounded in the
Omagh bombing flew home from Northern Ireland on Tuesday after a
meeting with Prince Charles.
	   The bodies of two slain Spaniards, Fernando Blasco Ramos, aged
12, and his teacher, Rocio Abad Ramos, 23, had already been
returned to Spain. They were among 28 people killed in Saturday's
bombing at Omagh, 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast.
	   The children and their supervisors had been in Omagh on a field
trip during an exchange visit to Ireland to improve their English.
Twelve of the group were among the 220 injured.
	   When Prince Charles arrived at Aldergrove air force base on the
outskirts of Belfast Tuesday afternoon, he visited with eight of
the Spanish wounded at the base medical center where they awaited
transport home.
	   The prince and Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam also met
with Spanish officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Francisco
Alvarez Cascos and relatives of the wounded, before the Spanish
group departed.
	   Some of the more seriously injured children were moved from the
three ambulances that took them to the runway by stretcher onto a
specially adapted Spanish air ambulance with a medical crew from
the country's air force on board.
	   They left behind four survivors.
	   Marta Ordonez, 9, is being treated in the Royal Victoria
Hospital in Belfast for burns over 25 percent of her body. At the
same hospital is Beatriz Puech, 11, who suffered head injuries and
is in a stable condition.
	   Gonzalo Blanco Moya, 13, is in a serious condition in hospital
in Londonderry with burns, a broken leg and cut feet. His sister,
Teresa, 15, has eye injuries.
	   Alvarez Cascos, who arrived Monday, toured Omagh with relatives
of the dead and the wounded. He and Spain's ambassador to Britain,
Alberto Aza, spoke with the injured as they were put aboard the
aircraft.
	   Alvarez Cascos said the Spanish victims and their families were
grateful for the kindness of the people who had cared for them.
	   ``This morning they may of course be worried for the children's
health at the present moment but they are very optimistic about the
outcome,'' said Alvarez Cascos, whose remarks were interpreted by
Aza.
	   Alvarez Cascos and his staff left soon after the wounded in an
official Spanish plane.
	   The young Spaniards were in the thoughts and prayers of mourners
at the first funeral of the bomb's victims, in the small town of
Augher, 50 miles (80 kms) west of Belfast.
	   ``They trusted in our welcome,'' said the Most Rev. James Duffy,
bishop of Clogher during services for Avril Monaghan, 30, and her
18-month old daughter, Maura.
	   The Spaniards were the first foreign tourists to be killed in
three decades of Northern Ireland's conflict.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair, in the south of France, spoke by
telephone with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar for 15
minutes on Tuesday.
	   Aznar told Blair that he wanted to convey his solidarity after
the bombing, and his gratitude to those who helped the Spanish
victims.

Paying tribute, Albright visits bombing sites in East Africa
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
visited the wreckage of two bomb-struck embassies in East Africa
Tuesday, conveying grief and support and defending the conduct of
U.S. Marines in the attack's aftermath.
	   In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and again in Nairobi, Albright vowed
that the perpetrators would be caught.
	   ``Together, we pledge to bring to justice the murderers of our
colleagues, loved ones and friends,'' she said during a whirlwind
trip from Washington, standing near a mound of rubble and memorial
behind the embassy in Nairobi.
	   The visit was anxiously awaited by officials in Tanzania and
Kenya, partly in hopes she would bring specifics of new aid for
their countries, where the nearly simultaneous blasts killed 257
people, mostly Africans. Without citing amounts publicly, Albright
promised the administration would request ``substantial'' emergency
funds from Congress when it reconvenes next month.
	   FBI agents, meanwhile, pushed ahead with their all-out
investigation into the Aug. 7 bombings. But officials declined to
comment on its progress or discuss the interrogation of a suspect
who was returned Friday from Pakistan.
	   The head of the FBI investigation in Dar es Salaam, Kenneth
Piernick, said the bureau has questioned more than 100 people
there, but indicated that most of the interrogations had led
nowhere.
	   ``Right now my evidence is scant, and I'm not going to draw
conclusions based on that,'' he said, without elaborating.
Previously, officials have said they had two suspects still in
detention in Dar es Salaam and six in Nairobi.
	   In Nairobi, mourners packed a church Tuesday for the funeral of
Rose Wanjiku Mwangi, the woman whose vain struggle to stay alive
beneath a collapsed building became a symbol of the tragedy of the
embassy bombing.
	   Rescue workers fought for five days to free the 36-year-old
woman from the rubble of the five-story Ufundi Cooperative House,
but she died by the time they located her last Wednesday.
	   In his homily, Anglican pastor Peter Njoka said people around
the world had prayed for Rose from the moment rescue workers first
heard a tapping sound coming from beneath the mounds of concrete
and twisted steel a day after the bombing.
	   He called her death ``courageous.''
	   Albright, arriving after a 16-hour flight, spent about five
hours in Tanzania before heading to Nairobi in a small plane when
an engine of the Boeing 747 she had flown in from Washington
overheated.
	   After meeting with President Daniel arap Moi, she laid flowers
outside the bombed embassy and toured the wreckage-strewn site,
wearing a hard hat and dust mask.
	   In a brief ceremony outside, with bombing survivors and Kenyan
officials looking on, she had warm words for Kenya but also took
the opportunity to defend the Americans against widespread
accusations their focus after the explosion was more on protecting
the site than in rescuing victims, most of them Kenyans.
	   ``I cannot say we acted perfectly,'' Albright said. ``But I
believe that allegations of callousness are wrong.''
	   ``The U.S. Marines limited access to the embassy not out of
indifference, but because they were afraid the weakened building
would collapse and trap new victims,'' Albright said, adding that
they also feared a second terrorist attack.
	   Later, she met with victims at Kenyatta Hospital before planning
to return home Tuesday night.
	   In Dar es Salaam, she laid a wreath next to the crater left by
the embassy blast that killed 10 people. Then she handed a folded
American flag to U.S. Marines and, wearing a white construction
hard hat, toured the damage inside.
	   Reporters also were allowed inside for the first time since the
explosion and found broken glass and smashed furniture scattered
throughout the embassy.
	   Albright helped hang a poster advertising a reward of up to dlrs
2 million for information leading to the bombers' arrest.
	   She then lavished praise, and the State Department's award for
heroism, on about 200 American and Tanzanian embassy staffers
before meeting with bombing victims at the Muhimbili Medical Center
and with government officials.
	   Albright announced a gift of 500 pounds (225 kilograms) of
medical supplies to Tanzania and Kenya from the Walter Reed Army
Medical Center, along with pledging to ask Congress for general
funding.
	   Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana, speaking at the embassy
ceremony, said his nation was counting on Washington for
significant support. Both countries' tourism industries were dealt
a blow by the bombings.
	   ``We share the grief with you even though ... as the host
country we have borne the brunt of this cowardly terrorist act,''
he said.
	   But Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete, speaking at the
Dar es Salaam ceremony, said there are no ill feelings in Tanzania
toward Americans, as there are among some Kenyans.

Prominent German TV quiz show host dies at 77
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) -- Hans-Joachim Kulenkampff, Germany's
best known TV quiz show host for more than 20 years, has died at
his home here of stomach cancer at age 77, it was announced
Tuesday.
	   Kulenkampff died Friday but his family requested that his death
not be announced until after his funeral, according to South German
Radio, which produced his quiz show, ``One will win,'' from 1964
until 1969 and again from 1979 until 1987.
	   Although the show was aired by Eurovision only in Germany,
Austria and Switzerland, it also drew fans in neighboring countries
that could receive the broadcasts.
	   Kulenkampff, the son of a merchant, was born in 1921 in the
north German city of Bremen. He attended acting school at the
German National Theater but his career was interrupted by military
service in World War II.
	   His television career began in 1953 as master of ceremonies of a
quiz show, ``Who's against whom,'' on Hessian Radio before going on
to the ``One will win'' program.
	   At the height of his popularity as a TV personality, he would
take time off to appear in German language films and on the stage.
	   In a farewell letter to his fans, Kulenkampff wrote that ``what
I regret is that I don't have enough time to thank all those who
have helped me live my life as I did, so that I can say now `it was
so very beautiful. I wish that I had been able to enjoy it a bit
longer.''
	   He is survived by his wife, Traudl, daughter Merle and son Kai
Joachim.

Second East German sports doping trial opens with confession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with other testimony, additional background &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's second doping trial against former East
German sports functionaries opened Tuesday with coaches and doctors
confessing they systematically administered performance-enhancing
drugs to female swimmers.
	   All five defendants denied, however, that they knowingly damaged
the health of the athletes, some of whom were as young as 12 when
they started taking the pink and blue anabolic steroid pills.
	   Dr. Ulrich Suender, the first to take the stand, said he knew
only a little about possible side-effects of steroids, and had
thought they were were reversible.
	   ``I believed that,'' he said in testimony echoed by his
co-defendants.
	   Suender, a second doctor and three coaches are charged with
causing bodily harm to as many as 17 young female swimmers on East
Germany's TSC Berlin team from 1978 to 1989.
	   One is now sterile because her hormonal balance was disrupted by
the steroids, which she started taking at 13. Others suffered such
side-effects as deeper voices, serious acne and excessive hair
growth.
	   Prosecutors say the defendants administered the drugs _ without
telling the minors or their parents what they were taking _ as part
of communist East Germany's state-sponsored push to create Olympic
champions.
	   Despite widespread suspicions raised by the unusually broad
shoulders, big muscles and deep voices of some East German athletes
over the years, few were ever caught in drug tests. But since
German unification, evidence of the systematic use of steroids to
enhance performance has been found in once-secret East German
government files.
	   On Tuesday, Suender, 58, testified that he had no reservations
about providing anabolic steroids in pill form to the team doctors,
which was part of his responsibility. He denied ever giving steroid
injections, as prosecutors have charged.
	   Former team doctor Dorit Roesler, 50, said she passed them on to
the coaches, who admitted giving them to the swimmers.
	   Coaches Peter Mattonet, 48; Berndt Christochowitz, 40 and Klaus
Klemenz, 55, said they assumed the pills were to improve athletic
endurance. However, Christochowitz, who now works for an insurance
firm, insisted he didn't know the pills were anabolic steroids.
	   Former East German swimmer Karen Koenig, who is a co-plaintiff
in the case, at one point asked Roesler why she never checked for
ill effects from the steroids.
	   Roesler insisted the athletes had regular medical exams and
nothing worrying was found.
	   Suender said only once in his 15-year career did he suspect the
steroids of causing a health problem, when a girl came to him with
acute liver problems.
	   He and the others also insisted they were sworn to secrecy about
the doping, even when it came to the athletes themselves or their
parents.
	   Because all five made statements before the court, no other
witnesses were likely to be called. A verdict could come as early
as Thursday.
	   Although they could get up to three years in prison, the
defendants were expected to receive suspended sentences or fines.
	   The first trial, which began March 18, involves coaches and
doctors from the former communist nation's showcase Dynamo Berlin
swim team.
	   Only one, Dr. Dinus Bieter, has made a partial confession. He
admitted in court last month that he administered anabolic steroids
to athletes, but insisted the doses were too small to cause
physical harm and that no one showed ill effects.
	   His case was severed last week from other five _ four coaches
and another doctor _ and resumes Monday, when a verdict could be
handed down. The trial for the others resumes Wednesday, but no
verdict was expected.

	   HERTFORD, England (AP) _ British boxing promoter Frank Warren on
Tuesday announced the signing of three world title contenders.
	   South African heavyweight Francois Botha, Mexican
super-bantamweight Marco Antonio Barrera and American featherweight
Angel Vazquez have all recently joined Warren's stable.
	   Botha, a mandatory challenger for the winner of the Sept. 19 IBF
title fight between defending champion Evander Holyfield and Vaughn
Bean, has a record of 39 wins, 25 by knockout, and one loss. He is
the WBA North American champion.
	   Barrera, who is scheduled to fight Richie Wenton for the vacant
WBO world super bantamweight title, has already won three world
title fights and has a record of 45 wins, including 33 stoppages,
and two losses.
	   Vazquez is undefeated after 15 pro fights and is considered
Naseem Hamed's biggest rival for the WBO featherweight crown.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Seeking to end a controversy that has
touched the painful memory of the Holocaust, the government said
Tuesday it will terminate a lease for property where a
controversial cross stands near Auschwitz.
	   The cross has sparked a dispute between Poland and Israel,
inspiring conservative Catholics to erect dozens more smaller
crosses on the same site to protest efforts by Jewish groups to
have the original, larger cross removed.
	   Tuesday's announcement indicated the Polish government wants to
take control of the land from a war victims' association to gain
more leverage in seeking a compromise acceptable to Jewish groups
and the Catholic church, a major power in Polish society.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said the war victims' association
violated a provision in the lease that prohibited harming the
church's authority. He made the comments before a government
meeting.
	   Top church officials have condemned the smaller crosses erected
in recent weeks but want the larger cross, which was used in a 1979
Mass celebrated near Auschwitz by Pope John Paul II, to remain.
	   Government spokesman Jaroslaw Sellin told journalists after the
Cabinet meeting that the government also wanted the smaller crosses
removed but for the papal cross to remain.
	   Sellin said the government will terminate the lease unilaterally
in the next two days, giving the war victims' association the right
to sue the Cabinet.
	   ``It depends on the court how long the proceedings will take,''
Sellin said, adding the government was unable to take further steps
until settling the question of who controls the land.
	   Mieczyslaw Janosz, the war victims' association president, said
he would take the government to court if terminated the lease.
	   While the government's announcement may delay immediate steps to
resolve the conflict, it was welcomed by a senior aide to Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Israel ``would welcome any move by the Polish government to
remove the crosses which undermine the character of the memorial at
Auschwitz where 90 percent of victims were Jewish,'' said David
Bar-Illan.
	   Also Tuesday, Israel's chief rabbi asked the pope to push for
the removal of memorial crosses near Auschwitz, saying it was ``a
travesty'' to turn the former Nazi death camp into a Christian
shrine.
	   Meir Israel Lau, a survivor of the Buchenwald concentration
camp, met with a group of Catholic priests from Rome _ members of
the peace group St. Egidio _ and handed them a letter for John
Paul.
	   But removing the smaller crosses will only take the dispute back
to the original question what to do with the papal cross.
	   Jewish groups complain the papal cross, which is eight meters
(26 feet) tall and can be seen from inside Auschwitz, violates the
memory of murdered Jews killed at Auschwitz and nearby Birkenau
camps.
	   Jewish groups refused to sign a dlrs 93.5 million preservation
plan for Auschwitz this year because of the papal cross, which was
erected in 1988. In recent weeks, some Jewish leaders and the
Israeli government-funded Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in
Jerusalem formally complained to Poland's government about the
smaller crosses at the site.
	   The papal cross honors 152 Poles killed by the Nazis in 1941 on
property bordering Auschwitz that later became a Carmelite nunnery.
John Paul asked the nuns to leave the site in 1993 in response to
Jewish protests, but the nuns leased the land for 30 years to a
Polish war victims' association before moving about a kilometer
(half-mile) away.
	   Cardinal Jozef Glemp and other Polish church leaders have
criticized the additional crosses near the papal cross as
provocations by irresponsible people. But they defend the papal
cross as an appropriate symbol honoring Polish martyrdom.
	   Church leaders will meet later this month to discuss the issue.

World Champion Deschamps questioned in doping investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comments from Deschamps, quotes from Juventus
trainer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ French midfielder and world champion Didier
Deschamps was questioned Tuesday by a prosecutor looking into
allegations that top players in Italy's first division soccer
league took performance-enhancing substances.
	   During a two-hour meeting with prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello,
Deschamps described the training methods of his Italian club
Juventus, according to news reports.
	   ``It's a serious and tough training which is at the base of our
victories,'' said Deschamps, the captain of the French national
team and a Juventus veteran.
	   In the last two seasons, Juventus has been the Italian champion
and the runner-up in the Champions League.
	   The doping investigation stemmed from an interview by AS Roma
coach Zdenek Zeman who said he was amazed by the quick muscular
development of players including Gianluca Vialli and Alessandro Del
Piero, a star-forward for Juventus.
	   Guariniello has already met with Vialli and Del Piero, who both
denied taking illegal substances. He also questioned Zeman, who
stuck to his allegations but did not say which banned drugs the
players allegedly use.
	   In a separate investigation, the anti-doping commission of the
Italian Olympic Committee met Tuesday with Juventus trainer
Giampiero Ventrone.
	   Ventrone said Juventus players have taken amino acids, minerals
and other substances.
	   ``Leaving aside that these are legal substances,'' Ventrone was
quoted by Italian news agencies as saying, ``their use is so
limited that one can't possibly talk about doping.''
	   Asked about the two players singled out by Zeman, Ventrone said
Vialli was already ``robust and powerful'' when he got to Juventus,
whereas Del Piero had to work hard to grow stronger.
	   Del Piero has also said before his strength is the result of
``years of hard work.''
	   The anti-doping commission was expected to meet later Tuesday
with Inter coach Luigi Simoni.
	   Other players were summoned for Wednesday, including Lazio of
Rome's Giuseppe Favalli and Paolo Negro. The long-time coach of
Italy's volleyball national team and current manager at Lazio,
Julio Velasco, was also summoned.

Ruble begins slide as opposition heaps blame on Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES and RECASTS thruout with tax police looking for
price-gouging, remarks from German economics minister, details
about debt restructuring, quote from Seleznyov. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble took a battering Tuesday, the day after
it was effectively devalued, and President Boris Yeltsin endured a
political lashing at the hands of his Communist-led opposition.
	   The price of the ruble slid from 6.43 to the U.S. dollar to 6.88
per dollar, taking dlr 1 out of a Russian's pocket for every dlrs
15 he or she earns. It also ensured a rise in inflation, since it
will now take more rubles to buy imported goods.
	   Russia's tax police sent out teams of inspectors to look for
signs of price-gauging by retailers eager to jump the gun on
inflation. And foreign traders held their breath as they awaited
details of a planned restructuring of the country's foreign debt.
	   Although many Western economists believe President Boris Yeltsin
did the right thing Monday when he gave in to inexorable pressure
on the ruble and allowed its value to float downward, the move has
shaken any remaining confidence in the Russian economy and could
have international repercussions.
	   German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said the weakening of
the ruble, along with the financial slump in Asian markets, would
hurt the German economy, although not seriously. He said he hoped
the crisis would force the Russian government to implement tax and
budget reforms.
	   ``The situation in Russia shows that markets won't tolerate the
absence of reform in the long run,'' Rexrodt said in Bonn.
	   Russia is a growing market for imports from Europe, the United
States and elsewhere. Companies that sell to Russia could be hurt,
as could international banks that have loaned money to Russia.
	   Among the measures the government took Monday was to announce a
90-day moratorium on foreign debt payments by Russian banks and
companies, giving them time to negotiate a new schedule of
payments.
	   The Finance Ministry and Central Bank offered Tuesday to sponsor
a series of meetings between foreign and Russian banks to discuss
the repayments.
	   The government also said it would restructure the debt on
treasury bills held by both foreign and domestic investors. Foreign
investors fear the government will give preferential treatment to
Russian banks and force foreigners to take a loss.
	   The new economic climate began to be felt by average Russians on
Tuesday. Banks were giving fewer rubles in exchange for dollars,
and charging sharply higher prices to customers seeking dollars in
exchange for rubles. In addition, there were reports that some
stores had begun to raise their prices.
	   Still, there were no signs of panic _ just disgust.
	   ``I trust the bank but I don't trust the government,'' said
Lyudmila Sergeyeva as she stood in line at a downtown office of a
leading Russian commercial bank. ``The government has spent its
last credit of trust.''
	   That was the message from the Communist-led opposition as well.
	   ``Our president has absolutely devalued himself,'' said
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who leads the largest faction in
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov was nearly as harsh. ``Let
Yeltsin admit that the country is facing the deepest socio-economic
crisis,'' he said on the Echo Moscow radio station. ``It is
impossible to live when one person is gorging himself on black
caviar while yet another can't buy a loaf of bread.''
	   Yeltsin appeared to gear down from crisis mode on Tuesday. He
returned to his vacation residence north of Moscow and will
probably spend most of the week there, presidential spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   Yastrzhembsky added that Yeltsin was keeping in close touch with
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko. The Interfax news agency reported
that Kiriyenko and Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin had offered
to resign, but Yeltsin told them to stay.
	   The president did accept the resignation of his long-time
economic adviser, Alexander Livshits.

ILO: prostitution major contributor to Southeast Asian economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source. HOLD FOR RELEASE until 0001 GMT,
Wednesday. &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Prostitution in Southeast Asia has burgeoned so
rapidly that it is now one of the region's big employers and
money-earners, a U.N. report published Wednesday says.
	   Commercial sex is crucial to the livelihoods of millions of
workers beyond prostitutes themselves and brings billions of
dollars into each nation, the International Labor Organization
said.
	   Revenue from prostitution accounts for two percent to 14 percent
of gross domestic product in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines
and Thailand, according to the 232-page report.
	   Despite the region's current economic woes, demand may rise as
changing currency values ``make sex tourism an even cheaper thrill
for customers from other regions.''
	   Child prostitution in particular could grow as poverty and
unemployment caused by the crisis strain family incomes and force
children onto the streets, the report warns.
	   It recommends that governments draw up separate strategies to
reduce adult prostitution and to keep children from getting
involved.
	   ``All forms of child prostitution are an unacceptable form of
child labor and should be eliminated,'' said the ILO official who
directed the study, Lin Leam Lim.
	   The report, entitled The Sex Sector, is based on detailed
studies of prostitution and commercial sex in the four countries.
Its authors, however, stress that its findings apply to many other
countries not included in the report.
	   In Thailand, a total of 200,000 to 300,000 female sex workers in
cities and towns send some dlrs 300 million a year to families in
the countryside, ``a sum that in most cases exceeds the budgets of
government-funded development programs.''
	   From 1993 to 1995, prostitution in Thailand yielded an annual
income between dlrs 22.5 and 27 billion, it said.
	   In Indonesia, the sex industry takes in between dlrs 1.2 billion
and dlrs 3.3 billion per year, representing between 0.8 and 2.4
percent of the gross domestic product.
	   In all four countries studied, sex work provided significantly
higher earnings than other forms of unskilled labor, the study
said.
	   The report said it isn't possible to specify exact figures on
child prostitution. It said a 1997 study put the number of child
prostitutes at 75,000 in the Philippines. In Thailand, a 1993
estimate said 30,000 to 35,000 children were involved in
prostitution.
	   It suggested governments should keep records about it and target
programs at both prostitutes and their clients.
	   ``The stark reality is that the sex sector is a big business,''
the study said. ``The health dimensions ... are too serious and
urgent to ignore.''

U.S. cities top homicide list complied by British Home Office

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Big cities in the United States are far more
dangerous than most European capitals, according to a Home Office
survey of homicide rates.
	   The government department compared cases of murder, infanticide
and manslaughter per 100,000 people in 29 North American and
European cities _ and found U.S. cities came out on top. The
figures were published Wednesday.
	   Washington D.C. outranked all the others with 69.3 homicides per
100,000 population _ more than 170 times greater than Brussels with
only 0.4 homicides per 100,000 people.
	   Washington was followed by Philadelphia with 27.4, Dallas with
24.8 and Los Angeles with 22.8.
	   The European capital with the worst record, eighth among the 29
surveyed, was Moscow with 18.1. Along with Moscow, the only other
European cities to make the top 12 were Helsinki with 12.5, and
Lisbon with 9.7 homicides per 100,000 population.
	   Sara Jones, a spokeswoman for the Home Office, said the survey
compared cases over a two year period. For some countries, the data
was taken from 1994 to 1996; others used data from 1995 to 1997.
Britain decided to compile the information to see how British
cities ranked, she said.
	   ``These were figures we had available and it made sense to put
them together,'' Ms. Jones said.
	   For Britain, the results were favorable. London came in the
bottom five, with 2.1 homicide cases per 100,000 people. Belfast
was the most dangerous U.K. city in the survey with a homicide rate
of 4.4, compared with Edinburgh at 2.4.
	   The other cities at the bottom of the list were Dublin with 1.9,
Vienna with 1.8, Rome with 1.7 and Athens with 1.4 homicides per
100,000 population.
	   Results for the other cities in the survey were: Chicago 20.5,
Phoenix 19.1, Houston 18, New York City 16.8, Lisbon 9.7, San Diego
8.0, Amsterdam 7.7, Geneva 4.2, Copenhagen 4, Berlin 3.8, Paris
3.3, Stockholm 3, Prague 2.9, Budapest 2.8, Oslo 2.1.

French striker Pouget given six-month ban for drug use
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French striker Cyrille Pouget has been banned from
soccer for six months after testing positive for an illegal doping
substance, French state radio reported Tuesday.
	   The French Football Federation found that the 25-year-old Le
Havre striker had taken the doping product nandrolone, according to
France Info radio.
	   Pouget, a former Metz and Paris Saint Germain striker, has won
three international caps for France, and scored 31 goals in 103
French first division matches.
	   The ban comes one day after Italian investigators began looking
into allegations of illegal drug use in Serie A.

American found dead in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from U.N. spokesman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ An American security officer with
the United Nations' observer force in Tajikistan was found dead in
his apartment with a single bullet wound in his head, security
officials said Tuesday.
	   Local police found Jore de Marco in his apartment in Dushanbe on
Monday night, according to Security Minister Saidomir Zukhurov.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York that de Marco was
an American who served as the personal bodyguard to the
secretary-general's representative in Tajikistan.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said the bullet came from de Marco's
pistol, and there was no sign of a struggle. Investigators have not
ruled out suicide.
	   Zukhurov said the death did not appear related to Tajikistan's
tense political situation.
	   ITAR-Tass said de Marco was alone in his apartment when he died.
But neighbors said they heard voices from the apartment around the
time the death occurred.
	   Eckhard said de Marco was a former Marine who had served in
Beirut and who had been working in Tajikistan since April.
Officials gave his age as both 37 and 38.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
last year's peace deal, which ended five years of civil war in the
impoverished former Soviet republic in Central Asia.
	   Despite the peace accord, there are periodic clashes between the
hard-line government and the mostly Islamic opposition. Numerous
warlords who do not recognize the peace deal wage turf battles with
one another.
	   In July, three U.N. military observers and their Tajik
translator were shot at point-blank range while on patrol in the
Pamir mountains in eastern Tajikistan.
	   Eckhard said it was too early to speculate whether de Marco's
death was linked to those shootings.
	   ``The initial indications are that it is not linked to these
other killings, but before we can say anything definitive on that I
think we have to await the outcome of the investigation,'' he said.

Kenyans attend funeral of woman, symbol of bomb tragedy

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rose Wanjiku Mwangi, whose vain struggle
to stay alive beneath a collapsed building made her come to
symbolize the tragedy of the U.S. Embassy bombing, was buried at
her small farm Tuesday.
	   After 1,500 mourners attended her funeral in a Nairobi church,
hundreds of mourners gathered around the 36-year-old woman's grave
at Ongata Rongai, 15 kilometers (9 miles) outside the capital. The
grave was dug behind her uncompleted house, surrounded by acacia
trees.
	   Most of the 300 mourners _ elerly women, men, barefoot children
_ trekked to the funeral along narrow paths, through patches of
corn under the shadow of Ngong Hills, which were commemorated for
their beauty by the Danish writer Karen Blixen.
	   Anglican pastor Maurice Mwangi, who conducted the burial
service, condemned the bombing and described terrorism as an
expression of lack of wisdom.
	   ``Whoever did it, whoever sponsored it and whoever supported it,
lacked wisdom,'' Mwangi said.
	   Mwangi said no amount of ``terrorism or revenge, be it
international, national or personal, for that matter, can bring
freedom to mankind. It is only the truth, and truth alone, that can
set mankind free.''
	   Bob Nasser, a Kenyan Red Cross volunteers who passed messages to
Rose while she lay in the rubble, expressed sorrow for the failure
by rescuers to save her.
	   ``I would like to apologize to the family since we tried to save
her but failed,'' Nasser said, fighting back tears. ``It was very
difficult, as you saw. I am sorry.''
	   Rescue workers, including Nasser, fought for five days to free
Rose from the rubble of the five-story Ufundi Cooperative House,
but by the time they located her early last Wednesday morning, she
was dead.
	   Sam Muthee, a local musician, read a poem he dedicated to Rose.
``Goodbye Rose. You gave us love. You brought us together,'' the
poem read in part.
	   Among those who turned up at All Saints Cathedral earlier to pay
tribute was U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, who left flowers.
	   Bushnell, who suffered cuts on her face in the Aug. 7 blast, was
unable to stay for the funeral because she had to meet Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who arrived from Tanzania to bring
condolences to the people of Kenya.
	   A total of 257 people, all but 10 of them in Nairobi, died in
the two blasts or later from injuries.
	   Francis Munyiri, a bank director who had known Rose for some
time, called her ``a hard-working friend'' and said he would miss
her.
	   In his homily, Anglican pastor Peter Njoka said people around
the world had prayed for Rose from the moment rescue workers first
heard a tapping sound coming from beneath the mounds of concrete
and twisted steel a day after the bombing.
	   He called her death ``courageous.''
	   Rose is survived by three children.

Russians show little concern for expected bank failures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ There is probably no economic event so terrifying
as a bank failure. So why aren't more Russians losing sleep over
predictions that a third or more of the country's banks might soon
collapse?
	   The fact is, most Russians sleep quite soundly knowing that
their savings are stuffed in the mattress beneath them. And some
economists say massive bank closings could only help the national
economy by cleansing it of dubious financial operators who scarcely
meet anyone's definition of a banker.
	   Perhaps that explains why there was little panic here Tuesday in
the wake of the effective devaluation of the ruble, despite the
near certainty that it would send many banks over the edge into
bankruptcy.
	   ``I don't keep my money in banks as a matter of principle,''
said Tatyana Borobyova, a flower seller who spoke during a lull in
her street sales. ``I don't trust either the banks or our
government because they have cheated us many times.''
	   Hers is a common view. Only about 30 percent of all Russian
savings are deposited in banks, according to Inna Francis, an
analyst with United Financial Group, a Moscow investment brokerage.
And much of that money is deposited in the national Sberbank, which
guarantees its deposits and is unlikely to fail.
	   Moreover, only a few Russian banks meet the Western definition
of a bank at all. Many are essentially fronts for highly risky
speculation in the stock and money markets. It is this activity
that is expected to be their downfall. It also explains why few
Russians will shed tears for them.
	   ``They don't do commercial lending, credit cards, hold consumer
deposits _ nothing of what we would consider banking services. They
just move money back and forth,'' said Alan Rousso, director of the
Moscow office of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
	   ``More than half the banks may fail,'' he added, ``but this, in
some measure, will be good for the Russian economy.''

U.N. court is shown carnage from massacre in Muslim village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The charred body of a child. The
toppled minaret of a mosque. Blood and bullet holes sprayed across
the wall of a cellar.
	   Judges at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal were shown grim video
footage Tuesday of the carnage left by Bosnian Croat troops who
massacred more than 100 Muslims in 1993 and torched their village.
	   The horrific images were screened on the second day of the U.N.
trial of six Bosnian Croats accused of taking part in the killing
spree in the village of Ahmici on April 16, 1993.
	   The trial is the sixth currently under way at the tribunal,
which was set up in 1993 to bring to justice those accused of
committing atrocities during the 3 1/2-year conflict in the former
Yugoslavia.
	   British Army Col. Bryan Watters, the first prosecution witness
in the case, talked the three-judge panel through a series of video
images and still photographs.
	   ``The village, which did not appear to be defended, had been
systematically destroyed in a quite ruthless fashion,'' Watters
said.
	   The defendants _ brothers Zoran and Mirjan Kupreskic; their
cousin, Vlatko Kupreskic; and Vladimir Santic, Drago Josipovic and
Dragan Papic _ appeared unmoved by the images as they sat in court
surrounded by U.N. guards.
	   They have pleaded innocent to a total of 19 war crimes and
crimes against humanity charges relating to their alleged
involvement in the massacre. If convicted, each faces a maximum
sentence of life imprisonment.
	   Watters did not mention any of the defendants in his testimony,
which was aimed at setting the scene for judges. Muslim survivors
will testify later in the trial about the massacre itself and the
role of the defendants in it.
	   Just one small pocket of houses in Ahmici was left untouched by
the devastation. All of them were inhabited by Croats, Watters
said.
	   The minaret of one of the village's two mosques had been blown
up systematically, ``in a clinical fashion,'' Watters said. ``It
was shocking. It was an act of sacrilege against a religious
building.''
	   Describing a series of photographs of charred bodies in the
cellar of one house in Ahmici, Watters explained how the four
victims had died.
	   ``It appeared that they had been lined up and shot and then
placed in a heap and burned,'' he said.
	   Two more bodies, burned beyond recognition, lay upstairs in the
house. One of them, the body of a child, lay across a single step,
its legs burned away below the knees.
	   Corpses and dead livestock also littered fields around the
village. British troops serving as U.N. peacekeepers gathered the
bodies and buried them in a mass grave because dogs and other
animals had begun feeding on them, Watters said.
	   He speculated that Ahmici had been earmarked by Bosnian Croat
forces for ``savage and total destruction'' because it was a
nationally significant Muslim center which provided many Islamic
leaders and teachers.
	   The attack allegedly was part of a campaign of terror launched
by Bosnian Croat forces to drive Muslims out of the central Bosnian
Lasva River Valley.
	   The Ahmici massacre ``was used, we believe, as an example of
what would happen if you did not leave,'' Watters said. ``It
certainly was an example of terror.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble took a battering Tuesday, the day after
it was effectively devalued, and President Boris Yeltsin endured a
political lashing at the hands of his Communist-led opposition.
	   The price of the ruble slid from 6.43 to the U.S. dollar to 6.88
per dollar, taking dlr 1 out of a Russian's pocket for every dlrs
15 he or she earns. It also ensured a rise in inflation, since it
will now take more rubles to buy imported goods.
	   Russia's tax police sent out teams of inspectors to look for
signs of price-gouging by retailers eager to jump the gun on
inflation. And foreign traders held their breath as they awaited
details of a planned restructuring of the country's foreign debt.
	   Although many Western economists believe President Boris Yeltsin
did the right thing Monday when he gave in to inexorable pressure
on the ruble and allowed its value to float downward, the move has
shaken any remaining confidence in the Russian economy and could
have international repercussions.
	   German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said the weakening of
the ruble, along with the financial slump in Asian markets, would
hurt the German economy, although not seriously. He said he hoped
the crisis would force the Russian government to implement tax and
budget reforms.
	   ``The situation in Russia shows that markets won't tolerate the
absence of reform in the long run,'' Rexrodt said in Bonn.
	   Russia is a growing market for imports from Europe, the United
States and elsewhere. Companies that sell to Russia could be hurt,
as could international banks that have loaned money to Russia.
	   Among the measures the government took Monday was to announce a
90-day moratorium on foreign debt payments by Russian banks and
companies, giving them time to negotiate a new schedule of
payments.
	   The Finance Ministry and Central Bank offered Tuesday to sponsor
a series of meetings between foreign and Russian banks to discuss
the repayments. And the Central Bank is planning to announce the
creation of a fund of about 700 million rubles (dlrs 103 million)
to support a pool of big Russian banks, its deputy chairman, Denis
Kiselyov, said.
	   The debt payments that will be affected by the 90-day moratorium
``exceed dlrs 1 billion,'' Kiselyov said.
	   The government also said it would restructure the debt on
treasury bills held by both foreign and domestic investors. Foreign
investors fear the government will give preferential treatment to
Russian banks and force foreigners to take a loss.
	   The new economic climate began to be felt by average Russians on
Tuesday. Banks were giving fewer rubles in exchange for dollars,
and charging sharply higher prices to customers seeking dollars in
exchange for rubles. In addition, there were reports that some
stores had begun to raise their prices.
	   Prices on the Russian stock exchange fell nearly 10 percent.
	   Still, there were no signs of panic _ just disgust.
	   ``I trust the bank but I don't trust the government,'' said
Lyudmila Sergeyeva as she stood in line at a downtown office of a
leading Russian commercial bank. ``The government has spent its
last credit of trust.''
	   That was the message from the Communist-led opposition as well.
	   ``Our president has absolutely devalued himself,'' said
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who leads the largest faction in
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov was nearly as harsh. ``Let
Yeltsin admit that the country is facing the deepest socio-economic
crisis,'' he said on the Echo Moscow radio station. ``It is
impossible to live when one person is gorging himself on black
caviar while yet another can't buy a loaf of bread.''
	   Yeltsin appeared to gear down from crisis mode on Tuesday. He
returned to his vacation residence north of Moscow and will
probably spend most of the week there, presidential spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   Yastrzhembsky added that Yeltsin was keeping in close touch with
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko. The Interfax news agency reported
that Kiriyenko and Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin had offered
to resign, but Yeltsin told them to stay.
	   The president did accept the resignation of his long-time
economic adviser, Alexander Livshits.

Spanish police seek father of infant carried in bull run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEGANES, Spain (AP) _ Police were searching Tuesday for two men
who ran with the bulls _ with an infant and two other small
children in tow.
	   The men were spotted in a crowd pouring into the bull ring
Monday in Leganes, outside Madrid, on the second day of an annual
festival.
	   One of the men had a baby in his arms, town hall spokesman
Santiago Llorente said. Another man ran in holding the hands of two
children, who appeared about 3 and 5 years old.
	   The men never were near any bulls and ran into the stands once
they entered the ring, officials said. Still, they exposed the
children to the other big danger in a bull run _ the human stampede
at the ring entrance.
	   ``If someone had fallen, and there had been a pileup and the
bulls had arrived, there would have been a problem,'' Llorente
said.
	   Rather than trying to make their children young daredevils,
Llorente said the men may have wanted to save a buck: It costs
about dlrs 3 a seat to watch the show, but runners get in free.
	   Spain's most famous bull-running festival is held every July in
the northern city of Pamplona. Running with bulls is a
centuries-old Spanish tradition made famous in Ernest Hemingway's
novel ``The Sun Also Rises.''

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Speaker of the Czech Parliament
Vaclav Klaus has been chosen as the first Czech to sit in the
cockpit of a Formula-1 car on Czech soil.
	   CTK news agency reported Tuesday that Klaus is to be driven by

South African defense, foreign ministers seek end to Cngo war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's defense and
foreign ministers travelled to the Great Lakes region on Tuesday to
try to forge a political solution to the Congo war.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, meanwhile, threw cold water
on President Laurent Kabila's request for South African aid,
including military assistance.
	   ``We have very strict regulations in terms of which we can
supply military equipment,'' Pahad told The South African Press
Association. ``We are saying a military solution is not possible.''
	   Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister Joe Modise, who
on Aug. 7 spoke with Kabila in his southern Congo stronghold of
Lubumbashi, planned to hold talks with government officials from
Rwanda and Uganda, accused by Kabila of backing the rebel uprisings
in Congo.
	   In other developments:
	   _Defense ministers of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola and Kabila's
son Joseph _ recently appointed second-in-command of Congo's armed
forces _ met in Zimbabwe's capital Harare on Tuesday. They
apparently did not reach agreement in how, or whether, to intervene
in the Congo war.
	   _Namibian Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Guribab was in Kinshasa,
Congo's capital, and would likely remain there until Friday, his
office said. Details weren't disclosed.
	   _Namibia's largest daily reported that two planes landed in
Namibia last weekend to be loaded with 21 tons of arms and
ammunition.
	   Namibian Defense Force troops loaded the planes and at least one
of them then took off again for Lubumbashi, Die Republikein
reported.
	   A Namibian Defense Ministry spokesman, Vincent Mwange, said he
was unaware of the incident.
	   Nambia was one of the first countries to recognize Kabila's
government after he ousted long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last
year.

Social Democratic Cabinet faces vote of confidence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with the vote taking place Wednesday; ADDS
quotes, BYLINE. no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - The Czech Parliament began a
debate Tuesday on the program of the new minority center-left
Social Democratic government of Premier Milos Zeman. A vote of
confidence was set for Wednesday.
	   The vote was originally set for Tuesday but had to be postponed
because so many deputies wanted to speak.
	   The Cabinet is expected to easily win the vote thanks to a
toleration pact signed last month with the strongest opposition
group, the Civic Democratic Party, led by former Premier Vaclav
Klaus.
	   ``We will alllow the Social Democrats to govern despite their
policies, not becuse of them,'' Klaus said, adding that his party's
efforts at forming a center-right coaliton were ``thwarted by two
smaller center-right parties.''
	   Under the pact, the Civic Democratic Party will allow the Social
Democrats to form a single-party government by pulling out its
deputies during the vote.
	   To win the vote, Zeman will need a simple majority of the
deputies present. In exchange, Klaus' was allowed to appoint the
speaker of the Parliament and the chairmen of key parliamentary
committees.
	   The confidence vote comes two months after the election of the
first center-left government since the fall of Communism in 1989.
	   A three-party coalition government led by Klaus collapsed last
November and was replaced by an interim government designed to lead
the country until a new government could be chosen in early
elections.
	   The Social Democrats emerged as the winner of the ballot,
gaining 74 seats in the 200-seat legislature. Klaus' Civic
Democratic Party came in a close second.
	   Czech law requires that after a government takes office,
parliament must conduct a confidence vote to determine whether the
cabinet has enough political power to implement its programs.
	   ``We believe that we will be able to hand this country over to
the next government in a much better shape than it's now,'' Zeman
said.
	   The center-right Christian Democrats and Freedom Union, which
hold a total of 39 seats in the parliament, have already said they
would vote against the Cabinet, citing disagreement with the
government's policies.
	   ``The Social Democratic policy is to promise everyting to
everybody,'' said a Freedon Union deputy, Vladimir Mlynar. ``That's
just not feasible.''
	   The Communists, with 24 deputies, are likely to abstain.
	   In foreign policy, the Social Democrats' priorities, such as
integration into the European Union and NATO, are similar to those
of the previous governments.
	   On the domestic front, Zeman has pledged to fight crime and
corruption in the privatization process, and slow down
liberalization of prices.
	   But the Social Democratic intention to strenghten the role of
the state and trade unions in the fledgling free market of the
post-communist era is likely to meet with opposition.

Jane's: Israel testing new anti-tank missile in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Israel is testing a new, long-range, guided
anti-tank missile in occupied South Lebanon, Jane's Defense Weekly
reported Tuesday.
	   Four of the missiles have been fired in the region since
February, at least one going out of control and one killing a
civilian, the respected military magazine said.
	   The new missile is believed to be the NT-D Dandy, manufactured
by Israel's state-owned Rafael armaments company and intended to be
air launched, it said.
	   Beirut's Daily Star newspaper reported Aug. 5 that Israel was
testing a new secret guided missile in South Lebanon before placing
it on the international arms market. But Rafael spokesman Noah
Shachar denied Israel is manufacturing or developing the missile.
	   Jane's Defense Weekly, however, reported that the NT-D is
believed to already be fitted to some Israeli Cobra and Super Cobra
helicopter gunships.
	   The Lebanese army and members of the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, have also collected fragments
from one of the missiles, the magazine said.
	   Jane's said the missile is intended for export, and is believed
to be part of a deal worth up to dlrs 800 million that Israeli
defense contractors, including Rafael, are trying to secure with
Poland to equip 100 Huzar helicopters.
	   According to the magazine, Israel first launched the missile on
Feb. 25 from an Israeli position at the village of Taibe in the
border enclave that Israel occupies in southern Lebanon. It
exploded near a civilian car 7.5 kilometers (4.7 miles) away,
Jane's said.
	   On May 19, the magazine said, one of two missiles fired from
Taibe exploded near a group of infiltrators outside Majdel Silim,
near the Irish U.N. battalion headquarters at Tibnine, about 16
kilometers (10 miles) from the Israeli border. Finnish UNIFIL
troops reported that one of the missiles spun off course and
crashed harmlessly, Jane's said.
	   On May 27, a missile apparently fired from a helicopter gunship
10 kilometers (6 miles) away killed one civilian and wounded
another, the magazine said. It did not give the location.
	   In the most recent incident on July 6, Jane's said, one of the
missiles exploded in the eastern sector of the U.N. operational
zone, which overlaps Israel's self-designated security zone.
	   Israel's Defense Force sad the weapon had gone out of control
and warned the Norwegian battalion manning that sector to stay away
from the impact site until Israeli troops had collected the remains
of the missile, Jane's said.

Too few candidates, council again pushes back Rwanda deadline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Difficulties in finding candidates for the
international tribunal fro Rwanda have forced the Security Council
has had to extend the deadline for the second time.
	   The council agreed Tuesday to delay the deadline to get the
required 18 candidates for another month, until Sept. 14. U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said the U.N. chief thought there was a good
chance they would get the remaining four candidates needed.
	   Getting judges to sit on the bench is tough: Terms run through
May 24, 2003, and judges can't hold any other job during that time.
	   The tribunal has also been plagued with criticism for its slow
pace and winning only one conviction in more than three years.
	   The court is in Arusha, Tanzania and _ unlike the U.N. tribunal
for Yugoslavia at the Hague, Netherlands _ has less than adequate
facilities, administrative and other support systems, court
staffers have complained.
	   Last month, the council pushed back the deadline to come up with
new judges because only five countries had offered candidates.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was established
November 1994 to try those accused of masterminding and carrying
out the slaughter by Hutu extremists of more than 500,000 Rwandan
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   The tribunal has indicted 35 people and has 31 suspects in
custody and awaiting trial. All face maximum life sentences. Only
one person has been convicted, the former prime minister, and he
pleaded guilty to genocide and crimes against humanity.

False bomb threat forces partial evacuation of U.S. embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A bomb threat by an anonymous caller
Tuesday prompted the U.S. Embassy to evacuate part of its Amman
compound.
	   U.S. Marines and Jordanian security officials, however, found no
evidence of a bomb in the embassy compound in Amman's upscale
Abdoun district, a Jordanian official said.
	   Applicants were evacuated from the visa section of the compound,
but embassy employees remained in the building, the official said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Work at the visa section resumed after a two-hour break, the
official said.
	   ``It was a false alarm,'' the official said.
	   It was not clear how many people were evacuated, but there are
usually about a hundred applicants in the visa section on an
average day.
	   Embassy spokesman Stephen Thibeault said the ``embassy did not
close its offices today and it did not evacuate its personnel.''
	   The bomb threat comes amid tight security precautions at U.S.
embassies following bombings at the U.S. missions in Kenya and
Tanzania. More than 257 people were killed in the Aug. 7 blasts.
	   The U.S. Embassy complex in Amman, dubbed ``Fort Apache'' and
``Fort Knox'' by diplomats, features solid steel doors and walls
and windows designed to repel artillery shells.

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Four African diplomats met Tuesday with rebel
leaders opposed to President Laurent Kabila to try to find out
whether Rwanda and Uganda have violated Congo's borders and are
helping the rebels.
	   ``We're here to find out whether this is an invasion or an
internal insurgency,'' Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge
told reporters before the meeting in this eastern Congolese town.
``We'll submit our finding to the (African) heads of state.''
	   The group met with self-styled rebel commander Jean-Pierre
Ondekane as well as civilian figures in the rebellion who have just
set up the Congolese Democratic Coalition.
	   Ondekane took military officers traveling with the diplomats to
the Sake army base just west of Goma and to the Goma airport where
they talked to troops, some of whom were preparing to be airflifted
to the western Congo.
	   ``It's a success for us because Kabila is trying to fool the
people and fool the world that we're with foreign troops and that
other countries have invaded Congo,'' Ondekane said. ``They (the
military officials) were happy with what they had seen.''
	   It was not possible to talk with either the diplomats or the
military men, who were due to leave Goma later Tuesday.
	   ``We are the people battling for democracy in Congo. Democracy
is not negotiable,'' said Arthur Zahidi Ngoma, an opposition
politician close to the rebel movement.
	   ``They talk about an invasion, but it's the Congolese fighting
for freedom,'' he said.
	   Mudenge said the diplomatic team, representing the Organization
of African Unity as well as the 13-nation Southern African
Development Community, had already met with Uganda and Rwandan
leaders and Kabila in Kinshasa.
	   Mudenge and his colleagues from Zambia, Namibia and Tanzania
were also trying to find a peaceful solution to crisis, he said.
	   ``We don't think it is too late for a peaceful solution.
Otherwise we wouldn't be here,'' Mudenge said without elaborating.
	   Meanwhile, in Harare, Zimbabwe, defense ministers from Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe waited for the diplomats to brief them on the
crisis.
	   The Harare meeting had fueled speculations that Kabila has asked
his southern neighbors for military assistance. Ondekane has
accused Zimbabwe of sending planeloads of weapons and ammunition to
the southern town of Lubumbashi in Katanga, Kabila's home region.
	   In other developments, South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo
and Defense Minister Joe Modise flew to neighboring Rwanda for
talks with Rwandan leaders in Kigali. No details were available.
	   In a separate attempt to stop the fighting in Congo, Nzo and
Modise held talks with Kabila in Lubumbashi on Aug. 7.
	   South Africa was not invited to the Harare meeting because it is
seen to have close ties with Rwanda and Uganda, who Kabila claims
are underwriting the rebellion.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details on drug nandrolone, recasts.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French striker Cyrille Pouget on Tuesday was banned
from soccer for six months after testing positive for an anabolic
steroid.
	   The French Football Federation found that the 25-year-old Le
Havre striker had taken the steroid nandrolone.
	   Traces of the drug were found in a urine sample given by Pouget
after a match between Bordeaux and Le Havre last September.
	   Nandrolone is an anabolic steroid that helps muscle development
and reduces fatigue, Jacques Lienard, president of the French
Football Federation's anti-doping commission, said.
	   Pouget, a former Metz and Paris Saint Germain striker, has won
three international caps for France, and scored 31 goals in 103
French first division matches.
	   The ban came one day after Italian investigators began looking
into allegations of illegal drug use in Serie A.

Minister: Israel plans to carry-out 13 percent West Bank withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A powerful member of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's Cabinet said Tuesday that Israel had agreed to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank, but an aide to the premier said
no decision on the scope of a pullout had been made yet.
	   The United States, as part of its efforts to restart
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, suggested Israel withdraw troops
from 13 percent of West Bank land while the Palestinians increase
efforts to combat terror. The Palestinians accepted the proposals
but Netanyahu balked, saying a redeployment of that size would harm
Israel's security.
	   Instead, wants to break-up the land parcel, handing-over 10
percent to Palestinian control and turning the remaining 3 percent
into a nature reserve where the Palestinians would be prevented
from policing or building. The Palestinians have passed on the
idea, saying they would not accept changes to the original American
plan.
	   But Tuesday, Sharon, who staunchly opposes any withdrawal from
more than nine percent and has threatened to topple Netanyahu in
the event of a larger pullback, suggested that Israel has now
agreed to carry-out the American initiative and withdraw from a
total of 13 percent.
	   ``The Palestinians know that Israel agreed to withdraw from 13
percent of the territory ... they know it very clearly,'' Sharon
told reporters Tuesday.
	   In Egypt for talks with President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat said that Israel had not changed its position,
and was continuing to reject the U.S. plan. ``We have accepted this
proposal, even though it does not comply with all of the
Palestinian needs. ... But until now the Israelis have not accepted
it.''
	   In Jerusalem, David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Netanyahu said
Israel was still interested in the nature reserve concept.
	   The Palestinians have blamed Netanyahu for the fizzling of the
peace talks and accuse him of wasting time in the hopes of
eventually wriggling out of his commitment to hand over more land.
	   Sharon however, said it was the Palestinians who were
foot-dragging on a deal.
	   ``The current delays in the negotiations are absolutely not a
result of the Israeli position. It's their (the Palestinians)
problem, apparently they have their own reasons (for stalling),''
Sharon said.
	   The two sides briefly entered direct negotiations last month in
an effort to reach agreement on the long over-due Israeli
withdrawal but failed to make any progress.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rose Wanjiku Mwangi, who came to symbolize
the tragedy of the U.S. Embassy bombing through her vain struggle
to stay alive beneath a collapsed building, was buried Tuesday at
her small farm.
	   After 1,500 people attended her funeral in a Nairobi church,
hundreds of mourners gathered around the 36-year-old woman's grave
at Ongata Rongai, 15 kilometers (9 miles) outside the Kenyan
capital. The grave was dug behind her uncompleted house, surrounded
by acacia trees.
	   Most of the 300 mourners _ elerly women, men, barefoot children
_ trekked to the funeral along narrow paths through patches of corn
under the shadow of Ngong Hills made famous by Danish author Karen
Blixen in ``Out of Africa.''
	   Anglican pastor Maurice Mwangi condemned the bombing and
described terrorism as an expression of lack of wisdom.
	   ``Whoever did it, whoever sponsored it and whoever supported it,
lacked wisdom,'' Mwangi said at the burial service.
	   Mwangi said no amount of ``terrorism or revenge, be it
international, national or personal, for that matter, can bring
freedom to mankind. It is only the truth, and truth alone, that can
set mankind free.''
	   Bob Nasser, a Kenyan Red Cross volunteer who passed messages to
Rose while she lay beneath the rubble, expressed regret for the
failure to save her.
	   ``I would like to apologize to the family since we tried to save
her but failed,'' Nasser said, fighting back tears. ``It was very
difficult, as you saw. I am sorry.''
	   Nasser and other rescue workers fought for five days to free
Rose from the rubble of the five-story Ufundi Cooperative House,
but by the time they located her early Aug. 12, she was dead.
	   Sam Muthee, a local musician, read a poem he dedicated to Rose.
``Goodbye Rose. You gave us love. You brought us together,'' it
read in part.
	   Among those who turned up at All Saints Cathedral earlier to pay
tribute was U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, who left flowers.
	   Bushnell was unable to stay for the funeral because she had to
meet Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived from Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, to bring condolences to the people of Kenya for
the Aug. 7 bombing.
	   A total of 257 people, all but 10 of them in Nairobi, died in
the two blasts or later from injuries.
	   Francis Munyiri, a bank director who had known Rose for some
time, called her ``a hard-working friend'' and said he would miss
her.
	   In his funeral homily, Anglican pastor Peter Njoka said people
around the world had prayed for Rose from the moment rescue workers
first heard a tapping sound coming from beneath the mounds of
concrete and twisted steel a day after the bombing.
	   He called her death ``courageous.''
	   Rose is survived by three children.

India's opposition unites to take on prime minister over bribe

Up. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian lawmakers were pressing the prime
minister Tuesday for an investigation into allegations that several
of his close associates were bribed to transfer the head of an
agency that investigates financial crimes.
	   The accusation of bribery in Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee's inner circle was made by Jayaram Jayalalitha, a former
movie star and powerful regional leader who is now in the prime
minister's coalition.
	   Opposition lawmakers demanded Monday that the prime minister
form a committee to investigate the corruption charges.
	   On Tuesday, India's Supreme Court also expressed reservations
about the abrupt transfer of M.K. Bezbaruah, head of the
Enforcement Directorate which is the investigating arm of the
Finance Ministry that was looking into Jayalalitha's affairs.
	   Without addressing the bribery charges, the court described as
``very, very distressing'' Bezbaruah's transfer, despite a ban on
moving officials investigating corruption cases against politicians
and bureaucrats. It asked the government to explain its decision by
next week.
	   The accusation of bribery in Vajpayee's inner circle brought the
5-month-old government to yet another crisis. It has come close to
collapsing several times over Jayalalitha's erratic behavior.
	   On Sunday, Jayalalitha accused Vajpayee in an open letter of
transferring Bezbaruah because the owners of a ``well-known group
of publications'' had ``paid hefty bribes to persons very close to
the prime minister.'' She did not name the owners or the persons
who allegedly accepted bribes.
	   Vajpayee's office replied with a curt letter asking Jayalalitha
to prove her charges.
	   The exchange was part of weeks-old sparring between Vajpayee's
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and Jayalalitha, who faces
several charges of financial wrongdoing during an earlier tenure as
the top elected official of the southern Tamil Nadu state.
	   Vajpayee's political rivals immediately sought a parliamentary
inquiry into the charges of bribery in his office. Even a junior
partner in the governing alliance suggested he seek a vote of
confidence in Parliament.
	   ``The charges cannot be dismissed lightly'' since they come from
within Vajpayee's own coalition, said Laloo Prasad Yadav, leader of
an influential opposition party from the north.
	   Although Jayalalitha claims the transfer came following the
payment of bribes, there have been reports the transfer actually
came at her behest. Bezbaruah has charged some of Jayalalitha's
close business associates and family friends with violating complex
foreign exchange laws.
	   Soon after she lost power in Tamil Nadu two years ago, federal
police raided her houses and found about 500 million rupees (dlrs
14 million) worth of goods not accounted for in tax returns,
according to court documents.
	   The items included several kilograms (pounds) of gold and
diamond bangles and bracelets, 10,000 Indian dresses known as saris
and 750 pairs of shoes, all of which earned her the nickname
``Imelda Marcos of India'' and ``The Walking Jewelry Store.''
	   Jayalalitha has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the
government over several local issues. She has not carried out her
threat so far. Each political crisis has prompted Vajpayee to send
his top cabinet ministers to mollify her.
	   Jayalalitha's All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham and four
local allies together have 30 lawmakers whose support is crucial
for Vajpayee's government in the 545-member federal Parliament.
	   On Thursday, Jayalalitha suspended her latest threat to abandon
the coalition after her supporters warned against the move. Shortly
after the her announcement, Vajpayee moved Bezbaruah to the
transport department, saying his expertise was wanted there.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The ``Real IRA,'' a splinter
gtroup opposed to Northern Ireland's peace accord, on Tuesday
claimed responsibility for the Omagh bombing that killed 28 people
and injured 220, and apologized for the horrific casualties.
	   Britain's top official in this province rejected the apology as
a ``pathetic attempt to apologize for and excuse mass murder.''
	   ``It is contemptible and it is an insult to the people of
Omagh,'' said Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, who was
accompanying Prince Charles on a visit to this shattered town when
the claim was made.
	   ``The sole responsibility lies with the bombers and we and the
Irish government willc continue to do what we can to hunt them
down,'' she added.
	   The ``Real IRA'' claimed responsibility in a statement to the
Dublin office of a Northern Ireland newspaper, Irish News, using a
recognized codeword. News media said the claim appeared authentic
and to reflect embarrassment by the group over the bombing.
	   In the statement, the group asserted that it gave three warnings
and had not meant to kill civilians.
	   ``We offer apologies to these civilians,'' it said.
	   Police have said the bombers gave a deliberately wrong warning,
driving civilians into the the heart of the blast, the worst
atrocity in three decades of sectarian violence.
	   The group comprises defectors from the Irish Republican Army
opposed to April's peace agreement providing for power-sharing
between Protestants and Catholics in this British province.
	   On Monday, police arrested five suspected members of the ``Real
IRA'' in connection with the attack. They can be held for
interrogation for five days under British anti-terrorist laws.
	   The responsibililty claim came soon after a young mother and her
child were laid to rest in a hilltop churchyard, the first of a
string of funerals.
	   ``There were three warnings and there were 40 minutes warning on
each of them _ two to UTV (Ulster Television) and one to the
Samaritans in Coleraine. Each time this was made clear and people
talked back,'' the statement said.
	   ``It was a commercial target. Despite media reports it was not
our intention at any time to kill any civilians,'' the statement
added. ``It was a commercial target, part of an ongoing war against
the Brits''.
	   ``Despite media reports it was not our intention at any time to
kill any civilians,'' the statement added. ``It was a commercial
target, part of an ongoing war against the Brits''.
	   Prince Charles, in Omagh to bring royal condolences to the
shattered town, said the bombing had for him recalled particularly
the IRA assassination in 1979 of his great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten.
	   ``I do have some understanding of the awful horror that people
have to put up with when their relatives are killed,'' he added.
	   In Augher, 15 miles (24 kms) from Omagh, a tiny, grieving
village buried the first two victims.
	   The coffins of 30-year-old Avril Monaghan, pregnant with twins,
and her 18-month-old daughter Maura made the short trip from the
family home down a tree-lined lane flanked by mourners in total
silence. The mother's brown wooden casket dwarfed the small white
one in the flower-laden black hearse.
	   During the Requiem Mass in St. Macartan's Catholic church in
Augher, the congregation, which included Mrs. Monaghan's husband,
Michael, and their three other young children, sang, ``My soul is
longing for your peace.'' Men and women, their heads bowed, stood
among gravestones outside listening to the service.
	   Mrs. Monaghan's mother, Mary Grimes, 65, was also killed.
	   The Rev. James Grimes, one of the priests who celebrated the
Mass and who is Mrs. Monaghan's uncle, prayed that the Omagh
tragedy ``would be the last of the terrible agonies our people have
suffered over the past 30 years.''
	   The British and Irish prime ministers have pledged their utmost
to convict the bombers, and some politicians are calling for
internment without trial for suspects.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who met some of the 220
people injured in the blast, wrote in two Northern Ireland
newspapers Tuesday that the province's police chief, Ronnie
Flanagan, had told him the IRA was not responsible for the bomb,
and there was no evidence that IRA explosives were used.
	   The suspects arrested included Shane Mackey, 19, son of an Omagh
councilman, Francis Mackey, a leading critic of the support by the
IRA and its political ally, Sinn Fein, of the April accord because
it does not provide for a united Ireland.
	   Mackey, reelected last year while still a member of Sinn Fein,
now aligns himself with the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, a
group opposed to the peace agreement. It is led by Bernadette
Sands-McKevitt, sister of the martyred IRA hunger striker Bobby
Sands _ and common-law wife of the Real IRA's reputed commander.

Russian border guard chief discusses strengthening Afghan border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of Russia's border guards vowed Tuesday
to give Tajikistan whatever help it needs, including military help,
to protect its border with Afghanistan, a news agency said.
	   Col. Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha was in Dushanbe, the capital of
Tajikistan, for talks with President Emomali Rakhmonov. Russia has
25,000 troops in Tajikistan already to guards its border with
Afghanistan.
	   The former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear that if the
Taliban Islamic army gains full control of Afghanistan there will
be an influx of refugees and weapons across their borders.
	   Bordyuzha, head of Russia's Federal Border Service, said that he
and Rakhmonov worked out measures to be implemented in the most
``explosive'' parts of the Tajik border if necessary, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Interfax said he offered whatever help Russia could give,
according to Mizrob Kabirov, Tajikistan's adviser on defense and
law enforcement.
	   Kabirov said there was no immediate threat to the border, but
that the situation could change rapidly. He said the Taliban and
opposition Northern Alliance were fighting 20 kilometers (12 miles)
from the border with Tajikistan.
	   ``Several tens of thousands of refugees could flow into
Tajikistan, since the Taliban movement is conducting a forceful
deportation of ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks from the captured areas,''
Kabirov said.
	   ``Tajikistan cannot accept and temporarily accommodate them
without help from the CIS, above all from Russia,'' he said.
	   Moscow is also sending a first deputy foreign minister and the
head of the general staff of the Russian armed forces to Tajikistan
for talks this week.

Jordanian consumer group sues officials for polluted water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A consumer group said Tuesday that it has
filed a lawsuit against a former minister and six other officials
it accuses of supplying Jordanians with water ``unfit for human
consumption.''
	   Residents of Amman's posh western suburbs have complained that
for the past six weeks their tap water has had a bad odor. Experts
said the water contained worms and worn larvae.
	   The government has denied that the water contains worms and King
Hussein has ordered a committee to investigate the allegations,
which have shaken a weak government that already has been accused
of poorly managing the economy.
	   The suit against former Water and Irrigation Minister Munther
Haddadin and six officials at the ministries of water and health
was filed at Amman's District Court on Monday, said Mohammed
Obeidat, president of the National Society of Consumer Protection.
	   The suit holds the officials responsible for ``negligence in
performing their duties'' and accuses them of supplying Jordanians
with water ``unfit for human consumption,'' he said.
	   Haddadin, the water minister, resigned last week following
widespread public accusations that his ministry was negligent in
providing drinking water to the western districts.
	   The Consumer Protection Society is a private group formed in
1989.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's most-wanted kidnapper _ known for
his band's custom of cutting of the ears of their hostages _ has
been arrested north of Mexico City, ending a monthslong manhunt.
	   Police captured Daniel Arizmendi, known as the Earlopper, late
Monday in Naucalpan, a city just outside the capital. Sixteen
suspected members of his criminal band also were arrested in the
police operation which ended early Tuesday, the federal Attorney
General's Office said.
	   Arizmendi was being taken to a maximum-security prison in Mexico
state.
	   Police had been searching for Arizmendi, a former Morelos state
police officer, across Mexico since May 21, when he narrowly
escaped a raid on a safehouse in Cuernavaca, the capital of Morelos
state 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of Mexico City. His wife, son
and daughter-in-law were arrested.
	   In June, his brother and sidekick, Aurelio, was caught in a
shootout with police in Mexico City. One of his attorneys, Angel
Vivanco Navarro, was arrested in July on charges of participating
in some kidnappings.
	   Police recovered millions of dollars in the raid on Arizmendi's
safehouse and also have seized property and bank accounts allegedly
belonging to him.
	   During Arizmendi's flight, a man identifying himself as the
notorious kidnapper gave a lengthy interview by telephone to the
Mexico City daily Reforma, confessing to about 20 kidnappings.
	   Some authorities have accused him of as many as 200 kidnappings
during the past few years. The victims either were released or
killed.
	   Arizmendi's wife, Maria de Lourdes Arias Garcia, is a former
nurse who allegedly was in charge of cutting off the hostages'
ears, which then were sent to their families in order to pressure
them to meet the ransom demand.

Norwegian whale hunt ends short of quota
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's whalers have ended this year's
season of the often-controversial hunt with a kill of 624, short of
the quota of 671 allowed by the government.
	   The whales were killed by hunters on 35 boats, said Per
Rolandsen of the Norwegian Fishermen's Sales Organization in
Svolvaer.
	   Norway enraged activists by resuming its commercial whale hunts
in 1993, despite a global ban imposed by the International Whaling
Commission in 1986.
	   Norway said the population of minke whales was large enough that
they could be hunted without endangering the species' survival.
That position has gained grudging acceptance among many.
	   The hunt's quota has been raised each year, from 293 in 1993.
This year's hunt began in May.
	   Of this year's hunt, 285 whales were killed in the Barents Sea.
The rest were taken along Norway's coast, Jan Mayen island or the
Svalbard archipelago.
	   Because export of whale products is banned, all the meat is sold
in Norway.
	   Rolandsen says that as long as the quota does not get bigger,
the whalers will have no trouble selling the meat to consumers. The
blubber, however, has no market in Norway and ends up in storage,
at the same time as demand in Japan is not satisfied.

World's top math prizes awarded in Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Two British mathematicians from Cambridge
University and two teaching in the United States were named Tuesday
as winners of the Fields Medal, the most prestigious prize for
mathematicians.
	   The medals are given every four years at the International
Congress of Mathematicians to mathematicians not older than 40.
	   Richard Ewen Borcherds, a Royal Society Research Professor at
Cambridge since 1996, was honored for work in the fields of algebra
and geometry, specifically his 1989 proof of the so-called
Moonshine conjecture.
	   Formulated about 20 years ago, it presents two mathematical
structures in such an unexpected relationship that experts called
it ``moonshine.''
	   Borcherds, 38, also has held a professorship at the University
of California in Berkeley since 1993.
	   William Timothy Gowers, 34, has contributed to functional
analysis, making extensive use of methods from combination theory.
He is a math lecturer at Cambridge and will become professor in
October.
	   Maxim Kontsevich, a 33-year-old expert in ``string theory'' and
theoretical physics, made his name with contributions to four
problems in geometry.
	   He is a professor at the Institute des Hautes Etudes Scientific
in Paris and visiting professor at Rutgers University in New
Jersey.
	   Curtis T. McMullen, 40, was awarded a medal primarily for his
work in the fields of geometry and ``complex dynamics,'' better
known as chaos theory.
	   He was also at Berkeley before becoming a visiting professor at
Harvard University this year.
	   The Fields medals are named after John C. Fields, the organizer
of the eighth mathematics world congress in Toronto in 1924.
	   Thousands of mathematicians are attending the 23rd congress,
which runs until Aug. 27.
	   Also at the congress, Peter Shor, 38, a mathematician from the
AT&AMP;T Labs in Florham Park, New Jersey, was awarded the Nevanlinna
Prize for outstanding work in the fields of theoretical computer
science.

Minister: Israel plans to carry-out 13 percent West Bank withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES 1st reference to Ariel Sharon in graf 4; ADDS
background in graf 6, EDITS to conform
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A powerful member of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's Cabinet said Tuesday that Israel had agreed to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank, but an aide to the premier said
no decision on the scope of a pullout had been made yet.
	   The United States, as part of its efforts to restart
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, suggested Israel withdraw troops
from 13 percent of West Bank land. The Palestinians accepted the
proposal but Netanyahu balked, saying a redeployment of that size
would harm Israel's security.
	   Instead, Israel wants to break-up the land parcel and hand-over
10 percent to Palestinian control and turn the remaining 3 percent
into a nature reserve where the Palestinians would be prevented
from policing or building. The Palestinians have rejected the idea,
saying they would not accept changes to the original American plan.
	   But Tuesday, Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon suggested
that Israel has now agreed to carry-out the American initiative and
withdraw from a total of 13 percent.
	   ``The Palestinians know that Israel agreed to withdraw from 13
percent of the territory ... they know it very clearly,'' Sharon
told reporters Tuesday.
	   Sharon, a right-wing hawk in Netanyahu's Cabinet, staunchly
opposes the U.S. plan, saying it would endanger Israel, and has
threatened to topple Netanyahu in the event of a 13 percent
pullback. His comments were prominently covered in the Israeli
media and seemed aimed at the Israeli public, who place great
weight on the ex-general's opinions regarding security.
	   In Egypt for talks with President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat said that Israel had not changed its position,
and was continuing to reject the U.S. plan. ``We have accepted this
proposal, even though it does not comply with all of the
Palestinian needs. ... But until now the Israelis have not accepted
it.''
	   In Jerusalem, David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Netanyahu said
Israel was still interested in the nature reserve concept.
	   The Palestinians have blamed Netanyahu for the fizzling of the
peace talks and accuse him of wasting time in the hopes of
eventually wriggling out of his commitment to hand over more land.
	   Sharon however, said it was the Palestinians who were
foot-dragging on a deal.
	   ``The current delays in the negotiations are absolutely not a
result of the Israeli position. It's their (the Palestinians)
problem, apparently they have their own reasons (for stalling),''
Sharon said.
	   The two sides briefly entered direct negotiations last month in
an effort to reach agreement on the long over-due Israeli
withdrawal but failed to make any progress.

Musicologist Iosif Sava dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: SUBS penultimate graf funeral on Thursday sted Wednesday.
Fixes typos.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A well-known musicologist who
supported soprano Angela Gheorghiu and numerous other Romanian
artists had died. He was 65.
	   Iosif Sava died of a Tuesday blocked intestinal track after 40
days hospitalization, Bucharest Municipal Hospital said in a
statement.
	   There was an immediate outpouring of sentiment for the man who
was loved as much for his sharp wit seen on his weekly TV shows as
for his musical knowledge.
	   ``It's a great loss for music in general,'' said Adrian
Iorgulescu, head of the Composers and Musicologists Union by
telephone. ```He kept alive culture with an overwhelming energy and
power.''
	   Sava graduated from Romania's conservatory of music, Ciprian
Porumbescu in 1966. He lived in Bucharest.
	   Under dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Sava was the only person
promoting opera and classical music through his radio and TV
broadcasts. But Ceausescu forbade his shows in 1988, allowing only
patriotic songs that praised him and the Communist Party.
	   After the fall of communism, Sava hosted a weekly TV talk show
featuring artists and musicians, who would angered the former
ruling party with their frank comments about the difficulties they
faced living in Romania. As a result, this show was also restricted
by the authorities.
	   In his year 44-year career, Sava wrote 60 books about music,
artists and composers and published thousands of articles. But he
was best known for supporting generations of Romanian artists,
including sopranos Angela Gheorghiu and Lina Vaduva and violinist
Silivia Marcovici.
	   Sava is to be buried Thursday at the Filantropia Jewish cemetery
in Bucharest, Iorgulescu said.
	   He is survived by his wife.

Swiss unfreeze Kosovo account
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss authorities said Tuesday they had
unfrozen a bank account they previously had suspected of being used
to buy arms for ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Evidence, however, is mounting against a number of Swiss-based
Yugoslav nationals under investigation on suspicion of financing
illegal trafficking of arms to the resistance movement in the
province, said the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office. It didn't
specify how many people are involved.
	   The Swiss authorities said they unfroze the account, reportedly
containing 8 million Swiss francs (dlrs 5.3 million) on condition
it be used only for humanitarian purposes.
	   A second account, which also has been blocked since last month,
remains frozen, said the prosecutors office.

Prospect for Kosovo talks dim, despite intense U.S. effort
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with fresh Hill quotes, details. New
reports of border incidents on both sides of the border with
Albania. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. diplomats trying to bring
ethnic Albanian negotiators and their Serb counterparts together
for talks on Kosovo's future vowed Tuesday to ``stay at it until we
succeed.''
	   Efforts by American diplomats, led by envoy Christopher Hill,
were not enough to convince appointed Albanian negotiators to sit
down with their Serb counterparts to restart talks that were broken
off three months ago.
	   Speaking to reporters after separate meetings with the Albanian
team and pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova, who appointed them, Hill
conceded that no immediate progress had been made, but said they
would ``stay at it and we're going to stay at it until we
succeed.''
	   He said his team was considering a ``two-phase process'' that
would first ``democratize the situation'' by trying to get
institutions working again, and save tackling ``some of the
broader, tougher issues related to the status'' of the province. He
gave no further details.
	   Hill, who has been shuttling between leaders on both sides,
reiterated that neither side should count on achieving anything by
force, but keep working at negotiations.
	   ``The process has just began, we have a long way to go, but it
has begun,'' he said.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army have been fighting Serb
security forces in Kosovo since the Serbs launched a crackdown on
Feb. 28. Both the KLA rebels and followers of Rugova want
independence for the Serbian province, where Albanians account for
90 percent of the population of 2 million. Kosovo is in Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   In a letter sent to his Serbian counterpart Tuesday, Fehmi
Agani, the chief Albanian negotiator refuted an earlier Serb
invitation to resume negotiations that broke down in May following
a Serbian offensive in the embattled province, unless attacks
stopped.
	   ``I have pointed out the necessity that violence stop against
the Albanian civilian population and that the police repression''
is halted, Agani said.
	   A Serb official, speaking on behalf of Ratko Markovic, the head
of Serbian negotiating team, criticized the Albanians for not
showing up for talks, saying the invitation ``of course, remains
open.''
	   Even if and when the two sides meet, there is still the question
of the KLA, who are not part of the Albanian negotiating team
appointed last week by Rugova.
	   Adem Demaci, the appointed representative of the rebel
organization, told reporters in Pristina Tuesday, ``I am not ready
for talks with the Serbian side.''
	   Fighting in the province ebbed Monday, following a weekend push
when Serbian forces captured a series of key Albanian stronghold.
But both Yugoslavs and Albania reported flare-ups at their shared
border Tuesday.
	   The Serb's Media Center in Pristina reported five Albanian
militants died in a shootout early Tuesday when trying to cross
from Albania into Yugoslavia, but there were no reports of major
clashes.
	   The center also said several shells were fired at the Yugoslav
border from neighboring Albania, targeting border guards who were
not hurt and did not return fire. Neither of the reports could be
independently confirmed.
	   An Albanian interior ministry source, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, said three Serb mortars exploded early Tuesday a
kilometer (2/3 mile) within the Albanian territory near the
villages of Padesh and Kamenica. Local police were sent to the
villages to calm residents and begin evacuating elderly and
children.
	   The United Nations now estimates that more than 231,000 people
have been uprooted in the six months since the conflict began. Many
of them have fled across the mountainous border with Albanian,
where the KLA also maintains bases.

German jobless could drop below 4 million in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The president of Germany's Federal
Labor Office said Tuesday that unemployment could drop below 4
million in September, but would probably rise again by winter.
	   Bernhard Jagoda said he derived his forecasts from
month-on-month changes in 1997, which he said showed improvements
in August and September on an unadjusted level.
	   He said he expected August jobless at around 4.1 million and
September jobless below 4 million.
	   But Jagoda said it's doubtful whether the number of jobless
would remain under 4 million because of the traditional year-end
rise.
	   In July, the number of jobless fell 37,000, but the unadjusted
jobless figure rose to 4.13 million, or 10.7 percent, from the
month-earlier 4.08 million, or 10.5 percent.

Albright pledges justice for embassy bombers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Embassy Bombings &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
pledged on Tuesday that the United States will find and punish
terrorists who bombed two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
	   ``It's a war,'' said Albright as she toured the rubble that had
been the Nairobi embassy. ``As somebody who actually saw bombs in
London during the war, that's what it looked like,'' she said.
Albright's family fled Czechoslovakia and was living in London
during WWII.
	   The two Aug. 7 bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam killed 257
people, including 12 Americans in Nairobi, and injured more than
5,500.
	   After touring both sites and speaking to Tanzanians and Kenyans,
Albright, U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Prudence Bushnell and Kenyan
Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana laid a wreath at a makeshift
memorial made of piled rubble at the Ufundi building, also
destroyed in the Nairobi blast.
	   One sign said, ``Kenyan's want peace not bombs.''
	   Albright repeatedly said to Kenyans, ``Pole sana,'' Swahili for
``deepest sympathy.''
	   In a speech, she noted that almost every Kenyan's life was
touched by the tragedy, saying, ``So many, so loved, have been
lost.''
	   Responding to criticism that American rescue workers sometimes
ignored Kenyan victims, Albright said, ``I cannot say we acted
perfectly. But I believe that allegations of callousness are
wrong.''
	   In Dar es Salaam, she said, ``America is very proud of you, all
of you _ Americans and Tanzanians, am truly in the presence of
heroes. Together, we promise to bring to justice the murderers of
our friends.''
	   She spoke to about 200 embassy workers at the home of John
Lange, head of the U.S. mission in Tanzania, presenting Lange and
workers the State Department's award for heroism.
	   ``Your bravery and compassion and courage have been recognized
around the world,'' she said. ``And the terrorists who would like
to drive us apart have, in fact, brought us all closer,''
	   Her one-day tour of Dar es Salaam and Nairobi was aimed at
showing support for East Africans devastated by the terrorists
attacks and to demonstrate resolve in the face of terrorism.''
	   During her visit to Dar es Salaam, Albright visited Tanzanians
still recovering at the Muhimbili Medical Center. She also
announced a gift of 500 pounds (225 kgs) of medical supplies to
Tanzania and Kenya from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center near
Washington.

Symcox inspires South Africa to a consolation win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with result
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ South Africa's cricketers won a
battle but lost the war Tuesday, beating England in the last round
of the limited-overs series but failing to qualify for the final.
	   South Africa, inspired by a man-of-the-match performance by
veteran all-rounder Pat Symcox, beat England by 14 runs at
Edgbaston after hitting 244 for seven in the first innings.
	   The Proteas needed to beat England by 47 runs to qualify for the
final against Sri Lanka at Lord's on Thursday, which meant England
only needed 198 Tuesday to advance.
	   England was eventually bowled out for 230.
	   All three teams finished with one win each, but England and Sri
Lanka's positive run-rate put them in the final.
	   Nick Knight and Graeme Hick had hit half centuries to put
England on track for its second successive win of the tournament,
but another all-too-familiar home side collapse deprived them of
it.
	   From a commanding 161 for two, England lost the last eight
wickets for 69 runs. This followed the 7-24 collapse in under six
overs against Sri Lanka at Lord's on Sunday.
	   Symcox, who had bolstered South Africa's total with a lightning
51 off 39 balls, also grabbed 2-36 in 10 overs with the ball. His
scalps included the prized wicket of Knight, England's top scorer
with 74 runs off 117 balls.
	   Knight and the inform Hick, 64 off 72 balls, figured in a third
wicket stand before the introduction of skipper hansie Cronje and
Symcox checked the smooth England progress.
	   Hick, who imperiously hooked Shaun Pollock for six to reach his
half century, lobbed a catch to Symcox off Cronje. Symcox bowled
Knight soon after as the batsman stepped back to make room for a
cut shot.
	   Hick's innings followed his 86 off 97 balls against Sri Lanka,
and included five boundaries and a six. Knight hit seven fours.
	   Allan Donald knocked out England's tail-order when he returned
for his final spell.
	   Earlier, Symcox came to the rescue of the side, hitting out in
the last 10 overs.
	   Symcox, considered a one-day specialist, hammered four sixes and
two boundaries as South African innings got a face lift in the
final five overs.
	   Symcox and Pollock, 22 not out, figured in a 69-run stand off
just 59 balls, after South Africa had been struggling on 172 for
six in the 40th over.
	   Symcox's innings included 17 runs off a Peter Martin over,
inclusive of two sixes and a boundary off successive balls.
	   England medium paceman Darren Gough got the home side away to a
brilliant start, dismissing both openers in the space of nine
balls.
	   But Daryll Cullinan and Jonty Rhodes (15) began the repair work
with a 48-run partnership.
	   Alan Mullally removed Rhodes but Cullinan and Cronje settled
down to stabilize the innings.
	   Cullinan, moved to top gear with an almost a run-a-ball 70
before Gough bowled him after returning for a second spell.
	   Cullinan's innings included eight boundaries, three of them in
succession off Gough, and a six off Adam Hollioake.
	   Cronje contributed a watchful 31 off 68 balls and once he was
trapped leg before wicket by off spinner Robert Croft, South Africa
had slumped to 160 for five in 36 overs.
	   Symcox, dropped on five by Adam Hollioake on the long on
boundary off Croft, made England pay for the miss, hitting sixes
off Croft, Gough and Martin before Mullally bowled him in the last
over with a low full toss.
	   Gough, who took 3-51 in the 36-run over the world champions Sri
Lanka at Lord's on Sunday, finished with 3-43 while Mullally, once
again outstanding, took 2-33.

Albania to tighten controls on foreigners entering country
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Albania will tighten controls on
foreigners and bolster security around embassies following
Washington's decision to remove most of its diplomats because of
security fears, the foreign minister was quoted Tuesday as saying.
	   ``We're working to have a more effective system to control the
foreigners who enter the country,'' Foreign Minister Paskal Milo
told the country's largest circulation newspaper, Koha Jone.
	   He blamed the government of former President Sali Berisha for
enabling foreigners who may be linked to terrorism and
international criminal syndicates to enter this former Communist
country.
	   ``I can say that individuals who have committed terrorist acts
in their countries have found shelter here,'' he said without
elaboration.
	   Milo was apparently referring to reports that several Egyptians
were arrested and deported for alleged involvement in Islamic
extremist groups back home.
	   Concern about a possible Albanian connection to terrorism has
been heightened following the devastating explosions at U.S.
Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   One day before the blasts, the Arabic language newspaper
al-Hayat, based in London, published a letter from the
``International Islamic Front for Jihad'' vowing revenge against
the United States for the arrests of several of its members in
Albania.
	   In the wake of the East African attacks and the letter, the
United States withdrew most of its diplomats and their families
from Tirana and warned Americans against traveling to Albania.
	   The State Department offered to assist any of the 890 U.S.
citizens registered with the embassy here to leave the country.
	   In the interview, Milo said Albanian embassies abroad had also
received threatening telephone calls. But he refused to say more
citing security concerns.
	   Berisha's Democratic Party has accused the government of
mishandling the security issue and harming relations between the
United States and Albania.
	   Albania is one of Europe's poorest countries. Its 3 million
people are about 60 percent Muslim.
	   Milo said Albania was anxious to develop relations with Muslim
countries although it has not taken parts in meetings of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference since Prime Minister Fatos
Nano took office last year.
	   But he did not say Albania would resign from the OIC, which the
Berisha government joined in 1992, two years after the fall of the
Communist state.

Fewer fires reported in Russia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A total of 151,168 fires have been reported in
Russia so far this year, 0.5 percent less than in the same period
of 1997, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Those fires killed 7,910 people, including 424 children, and
injured 8,088 others, the ministry said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   That is a 1 percent increase in fire deaths and 1.6 percent
increase in injuries. However, the number of children killed is
10.4 percent lower.
	   Fires destroyed 40,976 buildings, 3,751 machinery pieces and
6,250 cattle.
	   Most of the fires were caused by negligence or by the improper
use of household appliances, ITAR-Tass said.

 &UR; Belgium seek authorization for 6th evacuation flight from Kinshasa

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium said Tuesday it was seeking
authorization for a sixth charter flight in four days to complete
the evacuation of some 1,000 foreigners from Kinshasa.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Huub Cooeremans said five planes,
chartered by Belgium, have ferried 981 foreigners from Kinshasa to
Libreville, Gabon, since the weekend.
	   About 70 foreigners, who want to leave, remained in Kinshasa and
the Belgian government was trying to get authorization for a sixth
evacuation flight, said Cooremans.
	   ``We have received many pleas from other countries to get their
nationals out of Congo,'' said Cooremans.
	   He said Belgium, Congo's former ruler, was the only country
allowed to charter evacuation planes.
	   ``We have opted to charter civilian aircraft on purpose. That
has worked very well for until now the evacuations have been
carried out without incidents,'' Cooremans told a press conference.
	   The Belgian government has chartered planes from the no-frills
Belgian carrier City Bird to fly foreigners from Kinshasa to
Libreville and from there to Paris and Brussels.
	   Cooremans could not give a cost estimate for the flights but
said the Belgian government would not charge evacuees anything.
	   He said negotiations with officials in Congo for the evacuation
flights ``were difficult. For each flight we have to negotiate.''

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ As a hot August sun beat down on Madrid,
some 250 people gathered Tuesday for the funerals of 12-year-old
Fernando Blasco and Rocio Abad Ramos, 23, the two Spaniards killed
in the Omagh car-bomb blast last weekend in Northern Ireland.
	   Over 50 people joined the Blasco Baselga family as their child
was laid to rest in the San Justo cemetery on the southwestern
outskirts of Madrid some 12 hours after his body was flown back to
Spain from Northern Ireland.
	   Rocio Abad Ramos, a 23 year-old Spanish teacher killed in the
same blast, was cremated in eastern Madrid's Almudena cemetery in a
service attended by some 200 people many of whom, for space
reasons, had to stand outside the cremation building while prayers
were read.
	   Twenty-eight people were killed in the blast which took place in
the center of the busy market town of Omagh, 110 kilometers (70
miles) west of Belfast. Twelve Spaniards were among 220 injured in
the explosion.
	   The Spaniards had traveled to Omagh while on an exchange visit
to Ireland to improve their English.
	   At both funerals, the families of the victims were joined in
silence by relatives, friends and sympathizers, including many
local government politicians.
	   Speaking at Blasco Baselga's funeral, Madrid's Auxiliary Bishop
Fidel Herriez, said he hoped the family's Christian faith would
help them overcome the suffering.

Swiss unfreeze Kosovo account
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details, background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss authorities said Tuesday they had
unfrozen a bank account they previously had suspected of being used
to buy arms for ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Evidence, however, is mounting against a number of Swiss-based
Yugoslav nationals under investigation on suspicion of financing
illegal trafficking of arms to the resistance movement in the
province, said the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office. It didn't
specify how many people are involved.
	   Money from abroad is the guerrilla army's main source of
support.
	   The Swiss authorities said they unfroze the account, reportedly
containing 8 million Swiss francs (dlrs 5.3 million) on condition
it be used only for humanitarian purposes.
	   A second account, which also has been blocked since last month,
remains frozen, said the prosecutor's office. Spokesman Juerg
Blaser said suspicions remained against the use of the second
account belonging the Vendlindja Therret association.
	   That account, reportedly worth at least 100,000 francs (dlrs
67,000), is said to be run by the Popular Movement of Kosovo, a
group supporting the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Freeing up the funds of the Foundation for Kosovo makes it
possible to avert greater damages to people suffering from the
conflict between the Kosovo Liberation Army and Yugoslav forces,
Blaser said.
	   The foundation has agreed to withdraw it legal challenge against
the Swiss government for blocking the account, the office said.
	   Xhafer Shatri, a Geneva-based spokesman for the Kosovo
Information Center which runs the foundation, has insisted the
money had always been used for ``humanitarian, social, cultural and
educational purposes.''
	   The center is close to moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   The Swiss moves to tie up the money had prompted the legal
challenges, as well as demonstrations by ethnic Albanians and a
protest from U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who said the funds were
needed to relieve the suffering of Kosovo citizens.
	   The prosecutor's office said investigations continue against
Yugoslav residents of Switzerland. Blaser said the foundation
remains under investigation.

Ciba Specialty Chemicals to shed 1,100 jobs worldwide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss firm Ciba Specialty Chemicals
announced Tuesday it is shedding 1,100 jobs worldwide as part of a
restructuring program.
	   The job losses, mainly in Switzerland, Britain and the United
States, will be covered as far as possible by early retirement and
internal transfers, but some workers will be laid off, chairman
Rolf A. Meyer told a news conference.
	   The company said it expects its program to boost operating
income by 100 million Swiss francs (dlrs 67 million) a year
starting in 1999.
	   Ciba reported an unexpectedly high net loss of 791 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 531 million) for the first half of 1998 after charges
related to its acquisition in March of Britain's Allied Colloids.
	   Last year, it reported a first-half profit of 172 million francs
(dlrs 115 million).
	   Ciba Specialty Chemicals was created as a separate company when
Ciba and Sandoz merged in 1996 to form the pharmaceutical giant
Novartis. It has some 21,400 employees worldwide.

Russian wins first gold medal, in 20K walk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with shot put gold going to Ukrainian Bagach &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Ilya Markov of Russia, the Olympic
silver medalist, won the first gold medal at the European
Championship by taking the men's 20-kilometer walk Tuesday.
	   The men's shot put gold medal went to Oleksandr Bagach of
Ukraine with a heave of 21.17 meters.
	   Markov, a 26-year-old former junior world champion, won after
taking the lead in the late stage, pushing past Latvia's Aigars
Fadejevs inside Nep stadium.
	   Francisco Fernandez of Spain clinched the bronze medal.
	   Markov posted a time of one hour, 21 minutes, 10 seconds on a
humid and warm afternoon on a course that went through the streets
of the Hungarian capital.
	   Fadejevs, who was trying to become Latvia's first gold medalist
since a countryman won the walk in the inaugural championship in
1934, had to settle for the silver, finishing in 1:21.25.
	   Fernandez took the bronze with a time of 1:21.39.
	   Bagach went into the lead with a throw of 20.99 in his third
attempt, a distance that would have given him the gold. But he
first improved to 21.10 and then threw 21.17 in his last attempt.
	   Oliver-Sven Buder of Germany won the silver at 20.98, while the
bronze went to another Ukrainian, Yuriy Belonog, at 20.92.
	   Dragan Peric of Yugoslavia, the top European and second-best in
the world this year with 21.77, had to settle for fourth place with
a best effort of 20.65.
	   The sprinters went into early early action as the six-day event
began and the men completed the first two rounds of 100-meter
qualifying.
	   Three British sprinters led the field into the semifinals. Dwain
Chambers and Darren Campbell both won their heats in 10.26 seconds,
while Marlon Devonish won his in 10.28.
	   Geir Moen of Norway also advanced, along with Charalambos
Papadias of Greece, winner of the last heat in 10.31.
	   One surprise was the failure of Anninos Marcoulides of Cyprus to
pass the second round.
	   The Cypriot, who is second in Europe this year with a 10.12, was
only third in his first-round heat and fifth in the second round,
just outside the top four that advanced. His time was 10.41.
	   In the women's 100-meter first-round qualifying, reigning
champion Irina Privalova of Russia, back after a serious hamstring
injury, won her heat in 11.22 seconds to advance.
	   Ekaterini Thanou of Greece qualified with the fastest time,
11.04, while Zhanna Pintusevich of Ukraine, the world champion,
clocked 11.06.
	   In the first major upset of the championship, Daniela Bartova,
the Czech pole vaulter who broke the world record 10 times in 1995,
failed to qualify for the final.
	   Other favorites advanced.
	   Stephane Diagana of France, the 400-meter hurdles world
champion, cleared the first round of qualifying by winning his heat
in 49.28.
	   Carlos Silva of Portugal led all qualifiers with a time of
49.00. His heat 3 turned out to be the fastest, with three other
runners beating Diagana's time.
	   Ruslan Mashchenko of Russia, who has the fastest time in Europe
this year of 48.06, won his heat to advance in a relatively slow
50.30.
	   In the women's javelin, the golden Finnish duo of Trine
Hattestad and Heli Rantanen moved into the final without pushing
themselves.
	   Hattestad, the world champion, had a throw of 62.55 meters,
while Rantanen, the Olympic champion, had 60.90.
	   Steffi Nerius of Germany led the field with 66.04.
	   After the men's shot put, the men's 10,000 gold medal was
expected to be contested by Spanish and Portuguese runners.
	   Bartova, who set the European record at 4.51 meters in June, the
fourth best vault this year in the world, cleared 4.00 in her final
attempt, then skipped 4.10. She failed in all three attempts at
4.15, a height that would have qualified her.
	   The men's 1,500 semifinals saw three Spanish and three British
runners advance to the final.
	   Fermin Cacho, the 1992 Olympic champion from Spain, led all
qualifiers with a time of 3:38.52. Cacho was also silver medalist
at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and also took silver at the world
championship lasts year.

Too few candidates, council again pushes back Rwanda deadline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Difficulties in finding candidates for the
international tribunal for Rwanda have forced the Security Council
to extend the deadline for the second time.
	   The council agreed Tuesday to delay the deadline to get the
required 18 candidates for another month, until Sept. 14. U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said the U.N. chief thought there was a good
chance they would get the remaining four candidates needed.
	   Getting judges to sit on the bench is tough: Terms run through
May 24, 2003, and judges can't hold any other job during that time.
	   The tribunal has also been plagued with criticism for its slow
pace and winning only one conviction in more than three years.
	   The court is in Arusha, Tanzania and _ unlike the U.N. tribunal
for Yugoslavia at the Hague, Netherlands _ has less than adequate
facilities, administrative and other support systems, court
staffers have complained.
	   Last month, the council pushed back the deadline to come up with
new judges because only five countries had offered candidates.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was established
in November 1994 to try those accused of masterminding and carrying
out the slaughter by Hutu extremists of more than 500,000 Rwandan
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   The tribunal has indicted 35 people and has 31 suspects in
custody and awaiting trial. All face maximum life sentences. Only
one person has been convicted, the former prime minister, and he
pleaded guilty to genocide and crimes against humanity.

World Champion Deschamps questioned in doping investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comments from Agnelli, owner of Juventus &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ French midfielder and world champion Didier
Deschamps was questioned Tuesday by a prosecutor looking into
allegations that top players in Italy's first division soccer
league took performance-enhancing substances.
	   During a two-hour meeting with prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello,
Deschamps described the training methods of his Italian club
Juventus, according to news reports.
	   ``It's a serious and tough training which is at the base of our
victories,'' said Deschamps, the captain of the French national
team and a Juventus veteran.
	   In the last two seasons, Juventus has been the Italian champion
and the runner-up in the Champions League.
	   The doping investigation stemmed from an interview by AS Roma
coach Zdenek Zeman who said he was amazed by the quick muscular
development of players including Gianluca Vialli and Alessandro Del
Piero, a star-forward for Juventus.
	   Guariniello has already met with Vialli and Del Piero, who both
denied taking illegal substances. He also questioned Zeman, who
stuck to his allegations but did not say which banned drugs the
players allegedly use.
	   In a separate investigation, the anti-doping commission of the
Italian Olympic Committee met Tuesday with Juventus trainer
Giampiero Ventrone.
	   Ventrone said Juventus players have taken amino acids, minerals
and other substances.
	   ``Leaving aside that these are legal substances,'' Ventrone was
quoted by Italian news agencies as saying, ``their use is so
limited that one can't possibly talk about doping.''
	   Asked about the two players singled out by Zeman, Ventrone said
Vialli was already ``robust and powerful'' when he got to Juventus,
whereas Del Piero had to work hard to grow stronger.
	   Del Piero has also said before his strength is the result of
``years of hard work.''
	   Giovanni Agnelli, whose family owns Juventus, said the club did
not administer banned drugs to its players.
	   ``There has been so much talk on this issue,'' Agnelli said.
``But the prosecutors will show that Juventus is clean.''
	   The anti-doping commission was expected to meet later Tuesday
with Inter coach Luigi Simoni.
	   Other players were summoned for Wednesday, including Lazio of
Rome's Giuseppe Favalli and Paolo Negro. The long-time coach of
Italy's volleyball national team and current manager at Lazio,
Julio Velasco, was also summoned.

Yugoslavia lashes out on recent Annan report on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Yugoslavia lashed out Tuesday at a recent
report by the secretary-general condemning Yugoslavia's ``wanton
destruction'' and ``scorched earth policy'' in the separatist
province of Kosovo.
	   Kofi Annan's report was ``full of incomplete data and arbitrary
assessments and stands in stark contrast with the situation on the
ground, from which inappropriate inferences are made,''
Yugoslavia's deputy representative, Vladislav Jovanovic, said in a
letter to the Security Council.
	   In his report last week, Annan said international agencies have
failed to make good on promises to monitor an arms embargo against
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-1, have been
fighting for independence.
	   Fighting in the last six months has killed hundreds and driven
hundreds of thousands more from their homes in Kosovo.
	   In his report, Annan expressed his dismay with both sides in the
Kosovo conflict, but reserved his harshest language for Yugoslavia,
describing its actions as ``wanton destruction'' that embodied a
``scorched earth policy.''
	   The Security Council, in response, singled out Milosevic's
regime as using ``excessive force.''
	   Jovanovic, however, blamed much of the violence on the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army ``who have carried out over 650 acts of
terrorism and taken over 150 people hostage. They have killed a
great number of civilians of various ethnic origin, more than half
of them ethnic Albanians.''
	   Also, Annan's report was ``evasive in defining the operations of
security forces as being in accordance with their legal authority,
aimed at protecting citizens and their property,'' Jovanovic said
in his letter.
	   The Security Council has come under some pressure to act more
decisively in responding to the Kosovo crisis, in part because of
the criticism it received for its inaction during the Bosnian war.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
donned a hard hat to walk through two bombed-out U.S. embassies
Tuesday. She pledged to fight terrorism and held out a hand to
Africans feeling slighted by all the attention paid to Amercan
victims of the bombings.
	   ``It's a war. That's what it looks like,'' Albright said, face
grim, remembering her childhood when her family fled Czechoslovakia
only to get caught in the nightmare of World War II in Britain.
	   ``As somebody who actually saw bombs in London during the war,
that's what it looked like.''
	   Responding in part to African concerns, Albright pledged next
month to seek emergency funding from Congress to pay for
reestablishing embassy operations in Tanzania and in Kenya and to
compensate families who ``suffered irreparable harm.''
	   She did not suggest any amount, saying U.S. officials are still
calculating.
	   With a hard hat and worker's gloves, Albright toured American
embassies in both Nairobi and Dar es Salaam to see for herself what
terrorists had wrought Aug. 7 with near simultaneous bombs that
killed 257 people and injured more than 5,000.
	   Pledging to fight terror and find the bombers, Albright decried
the deaths and suffering of East Africans who suffered the heaviest
losses in the attacks. Some Africans had criticized U.S. rescue
workers and officials for focusing too much on the 12 Americans
killed.
	   ``Pole sana, pole sana,'' Albright said over and over to the
people of Kenya and Tanzania, using a Swahili expression of deep
sympathy.
	   ``So many, so loved, have been lost,'' Albright said outside the
Nairobi embassy before leaving a wreath at a memorial next door
where the Ufundi Cooperative building, site of many of the Kenyan
deaths, once stood. She and U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, who
fought tears, walked arm in arm through the devastation.
	   ``Kenyans want peace, not bombs,'' a memorial sign said.
	   Answering complaints by some Kenyans that U.S. Marines kept
people away from the site right after the bombing and prevented
help from getting though, Albright attributed the anger to
misunderstanding.
	   ``I cannot say we acted perfectly,'' she said. ``But I believe
that allegations of callousness are wrong.''
	   Instead, she explained, ``the U.S. Marines limited access to the
embassy not out of indifference but because they were afraid the
weakened building would collapse and trap more victims.''
	   Nairobi's two leading English-language dailies carried
editorials Tuesday demanding compensation from the United States as
target of the bombs.
	   The East African Standard, private but close to the government
of President Daniel arap Moi, said the United States must ``not
only pursue the perpetrators of this brutal and heinous act but
also compensate families who relatives died in the blast.''
	   A statement issued Tuesday by 52 members of Parliament blamed
``lax security system at the American embassy'' for the bombing.
	   ``We consider the American government morally responsible for
the loss and damage caused to Kenya,'' the statement said.
``America bears the primary responsibility for assisting Kenya in
compensation for the victims and reconstruction of the destroyed
facilities around their embassy building.''
	   Albright brought with her 500 pounds (225 kilograms) of medical
supplies for Kenya and Tanzania, donated by Walter Reed Army
Medical Center.
	   Tanzania Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete said he was happy with
the U.S. response and he added the bomb blast ``has not generated
in any way any hatred against America in Tanzania.''
	   ``You have comforted us so much,'' Kikwete said at a joint news
conference with Albright at State House.
	   ``This is a common tragedy. We need to work together closely,
for the terrorists do the same,'' he said.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The text of the statement received at a
newspaper office in Dublin from the Real IRA, taking responsibility
for Saturday's bombing in Omagh, Northern Ireland, which killed 28
people.
	   ``This is about the explosion. This is Oglaigh na hEireann
(IRA).
	   ``There were three warnings and there were 40 minutes warning on
each of them _ two to UTV (Ulster TV) and one to the Samaritans in
Coleraine. Each time this was made clear and people talked back.
	   ``The location was 300 to 400 yards (meters) from the courthouse
on the main street.
	   ``At no time was it said it was near the courthouse.
	   ``It was a commercial target. Despite media reports it was not
our intention at any time to kill any civilians.
	   ``It was a commercial target, part of an ongoing war against the
Brits.
	   ``We offer apologies to the civilians.''

Taliban officials say families too poor to go to Pakistan

 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JALALABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Hundreds of minorities fleeing the
Taliban advance in northern Afghanistan are being held at a bare
desert camp on the way to neighboring Pakistan, with Taliban
authorities giving conflicting and guarded explanations for the
detentions.
	   At a checkpoint along the main highway to the Pakistani border,
guard Hazrat Walli scrutinized identification cards Tuesday and
said he was on the lookout for names and addresses indicating that
the bearers were ethnic Hazaras, Tajiks or Uzbeks. The
southern-based Taliban, like most Afghans, is comprised of ethnic
Pashtuns who have been accused of harassing and killing minorities
in their sweep across Afghanistan that began in 1994.
	   The Taliban controls most of the country, including the capital,
Kabul. The militia's recent victories over their northern-based
opposition, a coalition of minority ethnic and religious groups,
has put them within reach of their goal of uniting all of
Afghanistan under their severe form of Islamic law.
	   Walli said about 80 men had been sent to a jail in Jalalabad for
``investigations'' to ensure that they were not opposition
fighters.
	   ``We sent about 1,000 others, including women and children, to
this camp,'' he said, gesturing to 100 or so mud-walled huts on a
stretch of treeless desert 100 meters (yards) from his post. He
would not allow a reporter and photographer to go any closer, and
the photographer was not allowed to take pictures.
	   The closest market was 15 kilometers (nine miles) east in
Jalalabad.
	   ``We provide them bread and rice every day,'' Walli said.
	   Walli, who like several other guards at the post was armed with
a Kalashnikov rifle, said the detainees could not go on to Pakistan
because ``they have no money.''
	   It was not clear if they would be allowed to leave the camp to
head back into Afghanistan.
	   Jalalabad, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kabul and 50
kilometers (30 miles) west of the border, is the biggest town on
the busy highway linking Kabul to Pakistan. Pakistan has for
decades been a haven for Afghans fleeing a series of civil wars.
	   In Jalalabad, local governor Maulvi Satar-i-Azam appeared angry
to hear a guard had reported that nearly 1,000 people were being
held _ he said there were only 60 families at the camp. He denied
that minorities were being targeted.
	   ``There are no differences between Pashtun and Uzbek and
Tajik,'' the Taliban governor said. ``We stop them so they do not
become tramps in other countries. They are poor. They can go all
over Afghanistan, but not out of the country.''
	   Satar-i-Azam added, without explanation: ``We have doubts about
some of the people who are coming from the north.''
	   Justin Cockerell, head of the international Red Cross delegation
in Jalalabad, said his staff had been able to visit the camp and
found its inmates in good health. He said the U.N. World Food
Program and others were providing food and medicine to those in the
camp, who he said began arriving from northern areas on Aug. 10, a
few days after the Taliban captured the biggest town in the north,
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   In a statement Monday, Amnesty International it had heard
reports that the Taliban was detaining minorities, saying some were
stopped at Jalalabad on the way to Pakistan and sent to the Taliban
stronghold of Kandahar. Amnesty said thousands of prisoners were
reportedly being held in Kandahar, 450 kilometers (280 miles) south
of Kabul.
	   ``Any detainee who has not been actively involved in combat
should be released immediately and unconditionally,'' the
London-based human rights group said.

Study concludes all heart attack survivors should take beta

 &UR; With MED-Hormones-Heart
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Challenging the conventional medical wisdom, a
major study has concluded that beta blocker pills are so effective
at saving lives that virtually every heart attack survivor should
take them, no matter what other diseases they have.
	   Heart experts unanimously agree that beta blockers are used too
little after heart attacks, in part because they are cheap and not
heavily promoted by drug companies. Doctors prescribe them to about
one-third of heart attack victims.
	   But these experts are also often leery of giving beta blockers
to those who have other medical conditions _ as many heart attack
patients do _ such as diabetes and asthma. The drugs have not been
rigorously tested in these people, and many doctors fear they could
do more harm than good and actually kill patients.
	   The latest study, based on the medical records of 201,752
Medicare patients, concludes that beta blockers should be part of
the standard care of every heart attack patient, regardless of
medical history.
	   It found that the benefits appear to far outweigh any possible
hazards. Over a two-year period, death rates were about 40 percent
lower.
	   Beta blockers reduce the heart's work load. They have been in
use since the 1960s, often to treat chest pain and high blood
pressure. A month's supply costs less than dlrs 5.
	   ``There is no doubt in my mind that this incredibly inexpensive
treatment can be tolerated by the vast majority of patients and can
improve survival in patients with almost any other disease,'' said
Dr. Stephen S. Gottlieb of the University of Maryland, who directed
the study.
	   Others, however, were divided over what to make of the results,
which will be published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
	   ``I think this paper will have a significant impact,'' said Dr.
Valentin Fuster of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City.
``It will awaken many physicians to the fact of beta blockers.''
	   Fuster, who is president of the American Heart Association, said
the results will change the way he takes care of heart attack
patients.
	   ``I will be much more inclined to use beta blockers in the
high-risk population, although these patients will have to be
followed very carefully,'' he said.
	   Current guidelines of the AHA and American College of Cardiology
urge caution in prescribing beta blockers to heart attack patients
with a variety of so-called contraindications, including congestive
heart failure, lung disease and diabetes.
	   Dr. W. Douglas Weaver of Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, a
co-author of those guidelines, said he found the new results
convincing.
	   ``Until we have better data, there is no reason not to use beta
blockers much more widely,'' he said, including in all elderly
heart attack patients.
	   However, Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz of Yale School of Medicine said
doctors should remain reluctant to give beta blockers to people
with widely accepted contraindications.
	   ``We shouldn't run to treat all the people with all these
contraindications without considering the gradations'' of severity
of their conditions, he said.
	   In a report in this week's issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Association, Krumholz found that beta blockers are vastly
underused even among those who are otherwise in good shape. In a
group of 115,015 heart attack victims on Medicare, he found that
only half of those with no contraindications were sent home from
the hospital with beta blockers.
	   Gottlieb's study found that the death rate two years after
hospital discharge was strikingly lower for all patients who got
beta blockers. In those with diabetes, beta blockers appeared to
lower the risk from 27 percent to 17 percent; lung disease, from 28
percent to 17 percent; and congestive heart failure, from 25
percent to 15 percent.
	   ``We couldn't identify a single subgroup who did not benefit,''
Gottlieb said.
	   Krunholz criticized the study for failing to distinguish clearly
the severity of the patients' complications. He said those who got
beta blockers might have been less sick than those who did not. If
so, their overall health, not their treatment, could have accounted
for their better survival.

General director of leading private TV station ousted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The general director of Slovakia's
largest private TV station arrived at work Tuesday, to find the
building controlled by a private security system and himself out of
a job.
	   Pavol Rusko, former general director of Markiza Slovakia
television was prevented from entering the station Tuesday, when
the new guards informed him a regional court in Bratislava had
prohibited him from acting as general director and legal advisor to
the company.
	   The move comes four days after the court awarded the Gamatex
Group, run by Sylvia Volzova 51 percent stock in the company, to
bail it out of debt. Rusko's CME Media Enterprises, formerly the
leading shareholder, holds the remaining 49 percent. Volzova has
replaced Rusko.
	   Eye-witnesses reported that the guards would not allow Rusko
into the building. Rusko said that if he was little bit ``more
hardheaded and would not give in in the morning, even shooting
would take place.''
	   Rusko's lawyer, Martin Radvan, said that ``from the legal point
of view, nobody can prevent Rusko from entering the building and
act as a general director. But obviously, since those gunned men
are still there, he will not shoot his way through.''
	   Rusko, refused the allegations by saying that ``38 days before
the elections, it must have a political background.''
	   According to sources at Markia, Volzova and Rusko did not get
along and there have been speculations that she was involved in his
loss of the position.
	   The court's decision is valid until the next shareholder's
meeting.

Surprising study appears to cast doubt on whether hormones protect

 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2000 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ A surprising new study appears to cast doubt on
the widely held medical belief that hormone supplements containing
estrogen protect women from heart disease after menopause.
	   The authors of the study and other experts rushed to say that
the findings are far from conclusive, and that a much larger study
just getting under way will help settle the question.
	   Millions of women take estrogen supplements to replace the
hormones their bodies stop making at menopause. The supplements
relieve symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness and
protect against thinning bones.
	   Previous studies found that women taking these supplements
suffered 60 percent fewer heart attacks.
	   The latest study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association, involved 2,763 postmenopausal women
with heart disease. All of them had suffered heart attacks or chest
pain caused by blocked arteries, or had undergone bypass surgery or
angioplasty.
	   Those who were randomly assigned to take a supplement containing
estrogen and a type of hormone called a progestin suffered no fewer
heart attacks over four years than the other women.
	   To researchers' surprise, women taking the supplements actually
suffered more heart attacks during the first year. But they had
fewer heart attacks later, and the effects balanced out over four
years.
	   The study's lead author, Dr. Stephen B. Hulley, chairman of
epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at
San Francisco, cautioned that the findings are directly applicable
only to women who already have heart disease.
	   He said more research is needed to determine whether the
findings also hold true among women who do not yet have heart
disease.
	   While the research ``does somewhat dampen enthusiasm'' for the
belief that estrogen supplements ward off heart disease, the study
may just have been too short to show the benefits, said Dr. JoAnn
E. Manson, an endocrinologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston.
	   For now, Hulley said, a woman's decision about whether to take
hormone supplements should be made with her doctor, based on her
individual traits, preferences and the evidence available.
	   Estrogen alone is no longer prescribed to most postmenopausal
women because it can promote uterine cancer. Progestin offsets the
cancer-causing effect. But progestin also may diminish the heart
protective effect associated with estrogen alone, Manson said.
	   The previous studies on estrogen and the heart involved women
who were taking hormones even before they were enrolled in the
research. People who opt for preventive therapy tend to have
healthy habits generally. That may explain most of the heart
advantages attributed to estrogen, experts said.
	   It is too soon to say whether the risks associated with
estrogen-containing supplements, including the increased risk of
breast cancer, are outweighed by the benefits, experts agreed.
	   A far larger study of the question, a nine-year, U.S. government
funded project called the Women's Health Initiative, will look at
the pluses and minuses. It involves 160,000 women, including 27,000
taking hormone supplements, and will conclude seven years from now.
	   It will examine at the effects of hormones on heart disease,
osteoporosis, breast cancer, memory, Alzheimer's disease and
quality of life, said Manson, one of the chief researchers.

``Real IRA'' claims responsibility for bombing; Charles visits;

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The ``Real IRA,'' a splinter
group opposed to Northern Ireland's peace accord, on Tuesday said
it carried out the bombing that killed 28 people here and injured
220. It apologized for the dreadful toll, asserting its warnings
were not properly reported.
	   ``Despite media reports, it was not our intention at any time to
kill any civilians,'' the group said in a statement telephoned to a
newspaper office in Dublin. ``It was a commercial target, part of
an ongoing war against the Brits.''
	   ``We offer apologies to these civilians,'' the statement added.
	   Britain's top official in the province, accompanying Prince
Charles on a tour of this shattered town when the claim was made,
denounced the apology as a ``pathetic attempt to ... excuse mass
murder.'' The police and Ulster Television in Belfast also rejected
the group's claim that it gave clear warnings.
	   ``It is contemptible and it is an insult to the people of
Omagh,'' said Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, breaking off
briefly from visiting survivors with Charles. ``The sole
responsibility lies with the bombers and we and the Irish
government will continue to do what we can to hunt them down.''
	   The ``Real IRA'' called the Dublin office of a Northern Ireland
newspaper, Irish News, using a recognized codeword.
	   News media said the responsibility claim appeared authentic and
to reflect embarrassment over the bombing, which killed mainly
women and children and was worst atrocity in three decades of
sectarian conflict.
	   On Monday, police arrested five suspected members of the ``Real
IRA,'' a group which rejects the acceptance by the Irish Republican
Army and political ally Sinn Fein of April's peace accord because
it does not provide for a united Ireland. The reputed commander is
a former IRA quartermaster, Michael McKevitt, who broke away in
October.
	   In its statement, the group maintained it warned Ulster
Television twice and a branch of the Samaritans that the bomb was
some 300-400 yards (meters) from Omagh's courthouse.
	   Both the police and Ulster TV said the warnings stipulated the
bomb was at the courthouse. Police cordoned off the building,
unwittingly driving people into the heart of the blast in crowded
shops at the end of Market Street, which slopes down from the
courthouse.
	   In a statement, the Royal Ulster Constabulary reiterated that
the warnings said the bomb was ``near the courthouse.''
	   As dusk fell, some 5,000 people gathered in the center of Omagh
in a candlelit vigil for the victims.
	   Earlier in Augher, a tiny, grieving village 15 miles (24 kms)
from here, 30-year-old Avril Monaghan and her 18-month-old daughter
were laid to rest in a hilltop rural cemetery, the first of a
string of funerals. At least 12 more victims, including Mrs.
Monaghan's 65-year-old mother, will be buried Wednesday.
	   The brown wooden casket of the young woman, heavily pregnant
with twin daughters, dwarfed the white coffin of her child Maura as
the procession entered St. Macartan's Catholic church.
	   Her husband, Michael, clasped the couple's other young children,
two girls and a boy. He joined in singing ``My soul is longing for
peace'' at the Requiem Mass.
	   ``We are bereaved as a nation as a whole, Protestant and
Catholic,'' said Bishop James Duffy, bishop of Clogher.
	   The Rev. James Grimes, Mrs. Monaghan's uncle and one of the
priests who celebrated the Mass, prayed that the Omagh tragedy
``would be the last of the terrible agonies our people have
suffered over the past 30 years.''
	   Such hopes have risen from the despair of every mass killing in
the Northern Ireland.
	   Charles recalled the 1979 assassination by the Irish Republican
Army of his great-uncle Lord Moutbatten.
	   ``I remember hoping 19 years ago that something positive would
come out of that,'' Charles told reporters after visiting survivors
in hospital here. ``But unfortunately things have gone on. Let us
pray this time will be an end to all the horrors that poor Ireland
has had to suffer.''
	   The British and Irish governments have pledged to do all they
can to track down the bombers. They are discussing changing laws to
make it easier to convict suspected terrorists by allowing courts
to accept as evidence simply the word of a police officer.

Second East German sports doping trial opens with confession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with other testimony, additional background; ALSO
moving on general news lines with ``i'' category code. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's second doping trial against former East
German sports functionaries opened Tuesday with coaches and doctors
confessing they systematically administered performance-enhancing
drugs to female swimmers.
	   All five defendants denied, however, that they knowingly damaged
the health of the athletes, some of whom were as young as 12 when
they started taking the pink and blue anabolic steroid pills.
	   Dr. Ulrich Suender, the first to take the stand, said he knew
only a little about possible side-effects of steroids, and had
thought they were were reversible.
	   ``I believed that,'' he said in testimony echoed by his
co-defendants.
	   Suender, a second doctor and three coaches are charged with
causing bodily harm to as many as 17 young female swimmers on East
Germany's TSC Berlin team from 1978 to 1989.
	   One is now sterile because her hormonal balance was disrupted by
the steroids, which she started taking at 13. Others suffered such
side-effects as deeper voices, serious acne and excessive hair
growth.
	   Prosecutors say the defendants administered the drugs _ without
telling the minors or their parents what they were taking _ as part
of communist East Germany's state-sponsored push to create Olympic
champions.
	   Despite widespread suspicions raised by the unusually broad
shoulders, big muscles and deep voices of some East German athletes
over the years, few were ever caught in drug tests. But since
German unification, evidence of the systematic use of steroids to
enhance performance has been found in once-secret East German
government files.
	   On Tuesday, Suender, 58, testified that he had no reservations
about providing anabolic steroids in pill form to the team doctors,
which was part of his responsibility. He denied ever giving steroid
injections, as prosecutors have charged.
	   Former team doctor Dorit Roesler, 50, said she passed them on to
the coaches, who admitted giving them to the swimmers.
	   Coaches Peter Mattonet, 48; Berndt Christochowitz, 40 and Klaus
Klemenz, 55, said they assumed the pills were to improve athletic
endurance. However, Christochowitz, who now works for an insurance
firm, insisted he didn't know the pills were anabolic steroids.
	   Former East German swimmer Karen Koenig, who is a co-plaintiff
in the case, at one point asked Roesler why she never checked for
ill effects from the steroids.
	   Roesler insisted the athletes had regular medical exams and
nothing worrying was found.
	   Suender said only once in his 15-year career did he suspect the
steroids of causing a health problem, when a girl came to him with
acute liver problems.
	   He and the others also insisted they were sworn to secrecy about
the doping, even when it came to the athletes themselves or their
parents.
	   Because all five made statements before the court, no other
witnesses were likely to be called. A verdict could come as early
as Thursday.
	   Although they could get up to three years in prison, the
defendants were expected to receive suspended sentences or fines.
	   The first trial, which began March 18, involves coaches and
doctors from the former communist nation's showcase Dynamo Berlin
swim team.
	   Only one, Dr. Dinus Bieter, has made a partial confession. He
admitted in court last month that he administered anabolic steroids
to athletes, but insisted the doses were too small to cause
physical harm and that no one showed ill effects.
	   His case was severed last week from other five _ four coaches
and another doctor _ and resumes Monday, when a verdict could be
handed down. The trial for the others resumes Wednesday, but no
verdict was expected.

Poland wins 2-0 over Israel in soccer friendly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's national soccer team overcame the
country's domestic soccer turmoil to score a 2-0 win over Israel in
an international friendly at Wilsa stadium, Krakow, on Tuesday.
	   After a dull opening, Poland took the lead in the 24th minute
when Miroslaw Trzeciak slipped the ball past the Israeli goalie.
	   Poland extended its lead to 2-0 in the 71st minute when Rafal
Siadaczka drove home the goal and put the issue beyond doubt.
	   Only half of the expected 12,000 spectators turned-out for the
match because the game's organizers decided only to allow underage
fans entry if they were accompanied by an adult.
	   Poland's domestic competition is in turmoil, with first division
teams boycotting league matches and demanding that national soccer
federation president Marian Dziurowicz resign amid speculation of
corruption and mismanagement.
	   But Dziurowicz said he would continue as president until
elections for new federation leaders on Nov. 12. He said he would
not seek re-election then.
	   Poland's Sports Minister Jacek Debski suspended the entire
federation eadership in May for refusing to allow an investigation
into alleged mismanagement. The federation leaders claimed they
were independent of the government review.
	   World soccer's governing body, FIFA, stepped in and threatened
to ban Polish teams from international competition unless the
government and the Polish FA reached a compromise on the issue.
	   Debski reinstated them Aug. 8 to avoid a FIFA suspension but
only after the federation agreed to let state controllers examine
its books and records.
	   Poland's national team has failed to qualify for the World Cup
since 1982. Debski blames soccer officials for the general decline
of the sports.

Indian women's groups welcome ban on chemical used for
</HEADLINE>
sterilization &QL; 
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian women's groups Tuesday celebrated
the ban on quinacrine, a chemical used for sterilization, but
criticized the government for delaying action for so long.
	   On Monday, India apparently became the first country to ban
quinacrine, opposed by health activists because of its possible
dangers, which include cancer.
	   ``It's a huge achievement,'' said Brinda Karat, whose All India
Democratic Women's Association asked the Supreme Court in March to
ban the drug.
	   Pellets of quinacrine, originally intended to fight malaria, are
inserted into the uterus and prevent pregnancies by scarring the
fallopian tubes.
	   No anesthesia is used, and the irreversible procedure is
painful. Some women faint; for many, short-term side effects
include abnormal bleeding, backaches, fever, abdominal pain and
headaches.
	   Quinacrine is not approved for use in the United States. Nearly
all major family-planning organizations, many foreign governments
and the World Health Organization also oppose its use for
sterilization.
	   Karat said quinacrine pellets had already been inserted into
thousands of Indian women, mainly in the West Bengal state.
	   Health activists say the drug was being circulated in India for
years without permission from Indian authorities.
	   ``Doctors who used it were so secretive and non-transparent that
there was no way of finding out the numbers of sterilized women,
except from guessing from their papers at international
conferences,'' Karat said.
	   But she added that the Indian government had ignored AIDWA's
demand for a ban on Quinacrine for years and the announcement came
five months after federal officials assured the Supreme Court the
drug would be prohibited in the country.
	   Thousands of women are feared to have been affected during this
period, she said.
	   ``The government's carelessness borders on criminal
negligence,'' Karat said.
	   The use of quinacrine _ distributed at low costs in poor
countries _ has shot up in recent years.
	   Stephen Mumford, who operates the Center for Research on
Population and Security from his home in Chapel Hill, North
Carolina, estimated in June that he supplied more than 100,000 poor
women around the world with quinacrine.
	   Swiss company Sipharm Sisseln has said it has produced around 5
million pellets in all for Mumford's center and two similar
laboratories.

Ikea founder admits to former Nazi sympathies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The founder of Ikea admits in a new
book that he had a 30-year battle with alcoholism and was a Nazi
sympathizer in the 1940s.
	   ``The History of Ikea,'' published Monday, contains two chapters
dealing with founder Ingvar Kamprad's Nazi ties. In 1994, a Swedish
newspaper reported he had attended Nazi meetings in 1945-1948,
which Kamprad admitted and said he regretted.
	   ``Now I have told all I can,'' the furniture store magnate said
at a book launching in suburban Stockholm. ``Can one ever get
forgiveness for such stupidity?''
	   The book also contains details about Kamprad's 30-year struggle
with alcohol and his successes and failures in business.
	   The normally reclusive Kamprad, 72, gave the book's author,
Bertil Torekull, access to Ikea archives for the project and
participated in long interviews.
	   Ikea plans to expand into Russia, and Kamprad said he wasn't
deterred by Russia's decision Monday to devalue the ruble.
	   ``In Russia, people need millions of small apartments, and an
Ikea specialty is in how to live in a small space,'' he said.

Artifacts of World War II Italian fascist leader sold at auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCARBOROUGH, England (AP) _ A black, boat-shaped hat owned by
Italy's World War II fascist leader Benito Mussolini sold at
auction in this northern English town for 2,300 pounds (dlrs 3,600)
Tuesday.
	   The felt hat, bough by a buyer who wished to remain anonymous,
was among a collection of books and private papers taken from
Mussolini's personal library at Villa Carpena, near his native
village of Predappio, by a Royal Air Force pilot, Richard Beck, at
the end of the war.
	   Other items included in the sale were unpublished photographs of
Mussolini and his mistress, family photographs and personal
letters, H.C. Chapman and Son auctioneer Ian Pearce said Tuesday.
	   ``I had my own estimates and everything has gone really well.
I'm particularly pleased and amazed with the 2,300 (pounds) for the
hat, it's a lot of money for a hat,'' said auctioneer Ian Pearce.
``For a lot of people, it was a chance to pick up a piece of
history for not a lot of money.''
	   The 57 lots, put up for sale by the late Capt. Beck's family,
raised a total of 7,500 pounds (dlrs 12,000).

Latvian nationalists say way clear for controversial referendum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Nationalist politicians said Tueday they
have collected enough signatures to force a referendum on
naturalization law changes that were approved by parliament amid
pressure from Russia.
	   Latvia's giant neighbor this spring launched fierce criticism
and threatened economic sanctions over the Baltic country's
treatment of its large Russian-speaking minority, most of whom do
not have Latvian citizenship.
	   Non-citizens would not be able to vote in the plebiscite.
	   The parliament in June passed changes to the law that hindered
many ethnic Russians from applying for naturalization, but
nationalists who oppose the changes launched a drive for a
referendum.
	   Palmira Lace, a spokesman for the Fatherland and Freedom Party,
told The Associated Press that as of the Tuesday deadline, about
140,000 signatures had been collected, about 7,000 more than
needed.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Russians came to Latvia when it was
part of the Soviet Union, especially during Josef Stalin's
Russification program. Their presence is bitterly resented by many
ethnic Latvians.
	   When Latvia became independent in 1991, the ethnic Russians who
had moved to Latvia, and their descendants, were not granted
citizenship. They could apply under the so-called ``windows''
system under which older people have to wait longer to apply, an
arrangement that many see as intended to punish those who had moved
to Latvia from Russia.
	   The changes passed by parliament call for ending the windows
system and granting immediate citzenship to all stateless children
born in the country since independence.
	   Latvia's president and foreign minister have strongly opposed a
referendum, saying it would keep the divisive citizenship issue
alive, which could damage Latvia's prestige, including its chances
of joining the European Union.
	   Latvian Prime Minister Guntars Krasts supports the referendum
and signed the plebiscite petition.

International observers invited for Slovak elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The Slovak government decided
Tuesday to invite observers from a leading international
organization to monitor the country's upcoming parliamentary
elections.
	   The decision came at the end of Tuesday's government's session,
following a lengthy discussion. Last Friday, Slovak Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar invited observers from 18 European countries, but
left out the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which includes the United States and Canada.
	   Already in May, Ivan Gasparovic, speaker of parliament refused
to invite the organization, despite an earlier government
announcement that such observers will not be banned.
	   Under OSCE rules their observers must be invited to monitor the
Sept. 25 and 26 parliamentary elections.
	   The Slovak government said Tuesday in a statement that it
decided to invite the observers from the OECE to observe and to
witness the ``democratic and free character of the Slovak
elections.''
	   Slovakia is not a top contender for membership of either the
European Union or NATO because of widespread foreign concerns about
undemocratic behavior by Meciar.

Government asks troops to regroup as rebels advance on Kinshasa

soldiers ...'

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With President Laurent Kabila still away
from his crippled capital, the government Tuesday began regrouping
its military and arrested a senior official accused of conspiring
with the rebels.
	   Kabila was reportedly in the southern city of Lubumbashi and his
overwhelmed government was showing signs of stress as tensions
among troops and civilians began to take a toll.
	   Gunfire rattled through the crowded Matonge district in the
heart of the capital early Tuesday, wounding several people.
	   A government spokesman would not comment on the incident and
there was no immediate explanation.
	   Several men were wounded when troops loyal to Kabila opened
fired on a convoy of new army recruits heading out of the city to
the southeast, witnesses said.
	   That shooting was apparently in connection with the arrest of
Deputy Interior Minister Faustin Munene, who was accused of
conspiring with the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters,
Rwandan soldiers and disaffected members of Kabila's army.
	   A government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Munene was arrested after he tried to bribe some loyalist troops
into joining the rebel movement.
	   Wounded soldiers from frontline fighting about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) from Kinshasa were being treated by doctors hindered by
a city-wide power outage, an official with the International
Committee of the Red Cross said.
	   A number of wounded troops were admitted to Kinshasa's General
Hospital with bullet wounds. Crowds of people lined up to donate
blood.
	   A former military intelligence officer with close ties to
Kabila's government said the army suffered a serious setback in
recent days when its key Zulu Battalion joined the rebels.
	   The battalion had been one of the first units to enter Kinshasa
when Kabila's forces ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko 15
months ago, and was more recently deployed to defend the town of
Inga, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of Kimpese, the former
intelligence officer said.
	   Inga, which fell to the rebels late last week, is home to one of
Congo's primary power-generating dams.
	   Kinshasa, struggling through a second straight day without
electricity, was feeling the strain. Thousands of people flocked to
gas stations and food stores to stock up on supplies.
	   The cost of necessities has shot up, with the price of bread and
cooking fuel doubling overnight in some places.
	   ``The people are struggling,'' Marie Ngoyo said as he surveyed a
row of bread sticks at a local shop. ``All we want is our lives to
be normal.''
	   State-controlled Voice of the People radio, broadcasting with
the help of a generator, appealed to store owners not to inflate
prices unnecessarily.
	   Denouncing the price hikes as ``profiteering,'' state radio said
the government would begin distributing bread and sardines to new
army recruits and some families.
	   Southwest of the capital, rebel forces continued their drive
toward Kinshasa.
	   Heavy fighting was reported Tuesday in Kimpese, about 200
kilometers (125 miles) south of Kinshasa. Kabila's soldiers fled
from the rebels, according to a local journalist who had seen the
combat.
	   Kabila has defiantly insisted his troops will hold off the
advance and has urged the public to arm themselves against the
rebels.
	   Seeking outside support, Kabila was in Angola over the weekend
to ask for troops and arms to shore up his troubled army.
	   In late July, he went to Cuba, where he also reportedly sought
help.
	   One of Kabila's closest allies, Namibia, delivered 21 tons of
arms and ammunition in two planes that landed in Kinshasa last
weekend, Namibia's largest newspaper reported. The delivery could
not be immediately confirmed.
	   Namibia's Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Guribab was visiting in
Kinshasa on Tuesday and would likely remain there until Friday, his
office said.
	   But many of Kabila's former friends have turned against him.

Palestinians blame Israel for severe West Bank water shortage

<TEXT>
	   DEHEISHE REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank (AP) _ Dirty dishes were piled
up around Mona Abdel Muhsein's sink, and a foul smell came from the
bathroom. When she turned on the water faucet, only a few drops
sputtered out.
	   ``I do the dishes every three days, and afterward use the water
to flush the toilet,'' Mrs. Abdel Muhsein told a group of visiting
Israeli legislators on Tuesday. ``The children take a bath every
week or 10 days.''
	   Her husband, Jamal Abdel Muhsein, said there has been no running
water for three months at the Deheishe refugee camp just south of
Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians blame Israel for severe water shortages in the West
Bank, a charge vehemently denied by Israeli officials, and the
problem threatens to become another pitfall in the foundering
Israel-Palestinian peace process.
	   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat ``is very worried
about this,'' his adviser, Ahmed Tibi, said Tuesday. ``This is one
of the most crucial issues _ people are suffering.''
	   Tibi accused Israel of reducing the amount of water to the
Palestinian areas by 50 percent in recent months.
	   ``Meanwhile, the settlers are enjoying their swimming pools,''
he said.
	   Although the Palestinians have autonomy in the major cities and
towns in the West Bank, Israel retains control of the water sources
there, which account for one-third of Israel's total water supply.
	   Mustafa Natche, the mayor of the West Bank town of Hebron, said
the municipality needs 25,000 cubic meters (900,000 cubic feet) of
drinking water daily, but that Israel supplies only 9,000 cubic
meters (320,000 cubic feet) _ and that only 3,400 cubic meters
(120,000 cubic feet) actually reach Hebron because of thefts by
settlers and Palestinians and leaks in the water system.
	   The water shortage has left Hebron's Ali Hospital without
running water for four months, forcing the hospital to buy water on
the black market, director Yousef Sharawi said Tuesday.
	   Israeli Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, however, said
Tuesday that Israel was supplying Hebron with 22,000 cubic meters
(775,000 cubic feet) of water daily _ more even than the 17,000
(600,000 cubic feet) it is obligated to provide under the
Israel-Palestinian peace agreements.
	   ``The Palestinians can get as much as they need,'' said his
adviser, Ranaan Gissin.
	   ``Arafat is looking for an excuse not to proceed with the
negotiations,'' Sharon said. ``The water is just another excuse.''

Denmark to get first Roman Catholic abbess in 462 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Denmark will get its first Roman
Catholic abbess in 462 years when Mother Theresa of the Cistercians
order is ordained in October, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The order's international leadership recently decided to elevate
the status of Holy Virgin's Sacred Heart convent near Grenaa,
central Denmark, to include an abbess.
	   Mother Theresa, who in the past 11 years has been the leader of
Denmark's sole Cistercian convent, was elected abbess by its 13
nuns, the Kristeligt Dagblad newspaper said.
	   The ordination will be performed by Denmark's Roman Catholic
Bishop Czeslaw Kozon on Oct. 3.
	   There are some 31,000 Roman Catholics in Denmark. Almost 90
percent of the country's 5.2 million inhabitants belong to the
State Lutheran Church.

Spain's Olano keeps lead after 2nd day of Tour of Burgos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BURGOS, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Abraham Olano kept a 13-second lead
over France's Laurent Jalabert after the second stage of the Tour
of Burgos cycling race Tuesday.
	   The stage, 175 kilometers (110 miles) raced between the
north-central Spanish city of Burgos and the town of Villarcayo,
was won by Madrid cyclist Eleuterio Anguita for the Estepona team.
	   Ukrainian Andrei Tchmil of the Lotto team was adjudicated second
place while Belgium's Steven De Jongh, for TVM, was third.
	   In the overall standings, Spaniard Angel for Vitalicio is in
third place behind Jalabert and Olano and fellow countryman Marino
Alonso, with Banesto, is fourth. At No. 5, is Marco Fincato of
Italy who cycles for the Mercatone team.
	   Wednesday's third stage will cover 178 kilometers (110 miles)

Photographer who chronicled Greece between the world wars dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Elli Souyioutzoglou-Seidari, a
photographer whose work chronicled Greece between the world wars
and brought new life to its ancient ruins, has died at the age of
99.
	   Her death was announced Tuesday by the Benaki Museum, where she
donated her life's work. It said Souyioutzoglou-Seidari _
universally known as Nelly _ died at her home of natural causes in
her sleep late Monday.
	   ``She was a mythical figure in the area of photographic art,''
said Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who announced the
photographer would receive a state funeral Thursday.
	   Born Nov. 23, 1899, in what was then Turkey, Nelly move to
Dresden, Germany, in 1920 to study art. Instead, she chose
photography and studied with Hugo Erfurth and Franz Fiedler, two
well-know photographers of the time.
	   She moved to Athens in 1925 and opened her first studio and
exhibition hall.
	   In 1927, Nelly began to make her mark on Greek photography,
shooting pictures of Greek refugees from Asia Minor.
	   Two years later, Nelly shot a series of internationally known
pictures of a semi-naked Hungarian dancer on the ancient Acropolis.
	   Her pictures also graced the Greek kiosk at the 1939
International Trade Fair in New York, where she lived until 1966.
	   Her 1940 shot of a traditionally dressed Greek soldier blowing a
bugle on the Parthenon was on the cover of Life magazine.
	   An international exhibit of her work was held in New York's
International Center of Photography last year.

Israel asks Italian insurer to release details on policy holders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has asked Italian insurance giant
Generali to release the details of World War II-era policy holders
in order to help heirs of Holocaust victims trace claims, a top
government official said Tuesday.
	   Generali, which is facing a lawsuit for failing to pay out
policies of Holocaust victims, is currently negotiating a claims
settlement in New York of at least dlrs 65 million with survivors
and Jewish groups.
	   Bobby Brown, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on world Jewish affairs said that the government sent a
letter to Generali asking for full disclosure of the details of
policy holders.
	   Until now, Brown said, the company has not made public details
such as maiden names and policy beneficiaries.
	   ``We believe the information should be in the public sector. We
can never have perfect justice but even to do partial justice it
has it has to be based on some type of information,'' Brown said.
	   Last week, Switzerland's two largest commercial banks agreed to
pay dlrs 1.25 billion to cover claims and lawsuits against all
Swiss banks where victims of the Nazi Holocaust had accounts.
	   But that settlement did not cover claims on war-era insurance
policies held by companies in Italy, Germany, France and
Switzerland.
	   Generali and several other European insurance companies face a
federal court lawsuit in New York charging them with failing to
honor policies after the war.
	   The settlement would effect tens of thousands of claims
worldwide, including about one-third of policies bought by Jews in
eastern Europe, where Generali was the largest seller of life
insurance and annuity policies before World War II.

Arctic island at ease with plans to retrieve deadly virus from
</HEADLINE>
grave &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway (AP) - After a year of debate, the
townspeople of Longyearbyen seemed at ease Tuesday with a plan to
open a frozen mass grave near their homes in search of one of the
deadliest viruses ever known.
	   The virus, called the Spanish Flu, killed at least 20 million
people in 1918-19, and scientists still don't know exactly what it
was. They hope learn its secrets by taking tissue samples from six
young victims who have lain frozen in graves blasted into the
permafrost 80 years ago.
	   The four-nation team of researchers plans to begin setting up
equipment. They will begin the work with a moment of silence for
the victims.
	   Even though there is virtually no chance of finding a living
virus _ the organisms die quickly _ the team is taking no chances
of releasing the pestilence when they open the graves. They expect
to start digging on Friday and reach the bodies about 10 days
later.
	   The graves will be covered with an inflatable tent, with
airlocks like a space station. Researchers will wear protective
suits, have outside air supplies and will even take an experimental
drug that has proved successful in tests against virus infections.
	   ``We are doing all this to protect against the infinitesimal
chance that there is an infectious virus down there,'' said Rod
Daniels, a virologist at the British National Institute of Medical
Research. ``Nothing will escape.''
	   On Tuesday, the researchers invited residents of Longyearbyen to
a meeting to explain the work.
	   Less than 50 people, many of them journalists, showed up despite
strong interest in the issue in this mining outpost of 1,200
people, north of the Norwegian mainland and just 950 kilometers
from the North Pole. None of the townspeople asked any questions.
	   ``I don't think people are afraid,'' said Torbein Kvil Gaust, a
27-year-old student who attended the meeting. He said there had
already been a lot of debate over the past year, and people were
confident.
	   Kirsty Duncan, a Canadian who leads the team, said ``We had a
town meeting like this last year, and the hall was packed.'' The
team met with townspeople during a preliminary study of the graves,
marked by a row of six white crosses in a tiny cemetery.
	   For Duncan, a 31-year-old professor at the universities of
Windsor and Toronto, plans to exhume the bodies started five years
ago. She read of the terrible epidemic and that the scientists
still did not know what it was. The disease killed more people than
all the fighting of World War I.
	   ``I was horrified,'' she told the townspeople. ``I was
determined to find out the secrets of the 1918 flu.''
	   The virus was first reported at what is now Fort Riley, Kansas.
It spread quickly to Europe with American troops were deployed in
W.W.I. From there, it spread to the rest of the world, even places
as remote Longyearbyen in the Norwegian Svalbard Archipelago.
	   Victims suffered a sudden fever, chills, headache, malaise,
muscle pain, pneumonia and rapid death.
	   Duncan managed to find the graves of four coal miners who died
on the island in the first week of October 1918 and were probably
frozen ever since.
	   The team, from Canada, the United States, Britain and Norway,
hopes samples taken from the bodies will provide them with genetic
profile of the virus. That can help develop better vaccines, and
test whether modern medicines could have stopped the killer.
	   ``The main purpose of this project is to capture and rebuild the
genetic constitution of this virus,'' Tom Bergan, a Norwegian
physician on the team, told the town meeting.
	   The sets of samples will be shipped to four different
laboratories, for analysis that could take 1.5 years.
	   The six victims were young, aged 18 to 29. Most were bachelors
and had no descendants. Their distant families did not object to
the project.
	   But one of the miners, Kristian Hansen, had a three-old-daughter
when he died of the virus at age 29. Bergan said the daughter ``had
no problems with the project because it could render an important
service for humanity.''

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With the failure of a U.N. envoy's mission
to Baghdad and little guidance from the Security Council, U.N.
weapons inspectors were on their own Tuesday in deciding whether to
push ahead with contentious inspections or back off.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, which is overseeing the
inspections, and the International Atomic Energy Agency had sought
clear instructions from the council on whether to test Baghdad's
Aug. 5 decision to freeze cooperation with weapons searches.
	   The council's response _ letters to chief inspector Richard
Butler and his counterpart at the IAEA _ backed their mandates to
carry out inspections but gave no clear direction on how to deal
with Iraq's defiance. Inspectors say Iraq's refusal to cooperate
has made their jobs impossible.
	   While the letters fell short of what inspectors had sought,
council members said their message of support was sufficient for
inspectors to go about their work.
	   ``We are now engaged in a process in which inspections will take
place and we'll see what happens,'' said the council president,
Danilo Turk of Slovenia.
	   The inspectors must certify that Baghdad has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before U.N. trade sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
	   When asked why the council hadn't threatened Iraq with
ultimatums, such as threats of military action, for its continued
defiance, Turk said the time wasn't right for such a strong
message.
	   ``I don't think that anyone in the council has suggested that we
have reached a point at which consideration of severest
consequences would be necessary,'' he said.
	   Indeed, China's deputy representative, Shen Guofang, said
Beijing opposed any such threats.
	   ``We hope that there is no military action in this regard
because we hope this issue will be resolved calmly and
peacefully,'' he told reporters.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the U.N. chief's envoy, Prakash Shah, announced
that he had failed to persuade Iraq to resume cooperation and was
returning Wednesday to New York, where he was expected to brief the
council.
	   In its letters, which were sent Tuesday, the council expressed
its support for Shah's efforts as well as the continued involvement
of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who defused the last crisis over
inspections.
	   Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, had said the U.N. chief foresaw
no personal role in the dispute but said Tuesday that he was sure
Annan ``would be working closely with council members to bring as
much pressure on Iraq as possible to return to cooperation with
inspectors.''
	   ``I think basically he's been pleased that the approach being
taken by the council is low-key rather than confrontational with
military threats,'' Eckhard said. ``On the other hand, he can't
exclude that the council would once again consider the military
option.
	   ``But for the moment the emphasis is on the diplomatic side,''
Eckhard said.
	   The stalemate between Baghdad and inspectors is but the latest
confrontation between the two sides since the monitors began
searching dozens of Baghdad sites in 1991.
	   Iraq insists it has abandoned its weapons program, that the
searches violate its sovereignty and that the U.S. animosity toward
Iraq is the reason the embargo remains in place.
	   Butler has said Iraq has made great progress in dismantling its
chemical and nuclear weapons, but that there is sizable evidence
that it retains a thriving biological arms program.

ethnic Albanian negotiators and their Serb counterparts together
for talks on Kosovo's future vowed Tuesday to ``stay at it until we
succeed.''
	   So far, the diplomats, led by envoy Christopher Hill, have not
convinced Albanian negotiators to sit down with their Serb
counterparts to restart talks that were broken off three months
ago.
	   Hill conceded that no immediate progress had been made after
meeting separately with the Albanian negotiators and Albanian
pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova, who appointed the team.
	   Hill said the U.S. diplomats are pushing for a ``two-phase
process'' that would first try to get Kosovo institutions working
again, then tackle ``some of the broader, tougher issues related to
the status'' of the province. He gave no further details.
	   ``The process has just began, we have a long way to go, but it
has begun,'' Hill said.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has been fighting Serb security
forces in Kosovo since the Serbs launched a crackdown on Feb. 28.
KLA rebels and their followers have rejected Rugova because he is
against the use of violence to win independence. They are not
involved in the talks.
	   Ethnic Albanians account for 90 percent of Kosovo's population
of 2 million. Kosovo is in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   The chief Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani, said his side would
not take part in talks unless the Serbs halt their offensive.
	   The Serb's Media Center in Pristina reported five Albanian
militants died in a shootout early Tuesday while trying to cross
from Albania into Yugoslavia, but there were no reports of major
clashes.
	   The center also said several shells were fired at the Yugoslav
border from neighboring Albania, targeting border guards who were
not hurt and did not return fire. The reports could be
independently confirmed.
	   An Albanian interior ministry source, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, said three Serb mortars exploded early Tuesday a half
mile (800 meters) inside Albanian territory near the villages of
Padesh and Kamenica.
	   At the United Nations on Tuesday, Yugoslavia said
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report last week that accused it of
``wanton destruction'' in Kosovo was ``full of incomplete data and
arbitrary assessments.''
	   Meanwhile, prosecutors in Switzerland unfroze one of two bank
account which they suspected was used to buy arms for ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. Money from abroad is the KLA's main source of
support.
	   The account, reportedly containing dlrs 5.3 million, was
unfrozen on condition it be used only for humanitarian purposes,
authorities said.
	   The United Nations now estimates that more than 231,000 people
have been uprooted in the six months since the conflict began.

Portugal's Pinto finally gets first medal and it's gold

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Persistence finally earned Portugal's
Antonio Pinto a gold medal. And don't forget to credit the several
bottles of wine he drinks weekly, much from his own vineyard.
	   The 32-year-old Pinto, twice the winner of the London Marathon
but never a medalist in any major championship, got gold Tuesday at
10,000 meters in the European Championships, blowing away Germany's
former Olympic 5,000-meter champion Dieter Baumann on the closing
four laps.
	   Pinto won in 27 minutes 48.62 seconds with Baumann second in
27:56.75 and fellow German Stephane Franke taking bronze in
27:59.90
	   Two other golds on the first day of the six-day Euros went to
Alexander Bagach of Ukraine in the shot put and Russia's Ilya
Markov in the 20-kilometer walk.
	   For Bagach, it was another medal in a drug-tainted career that
saw him disqualified after winning last year's world championship
when he tested positive for the banned substance ephedrine. He also
served a two-year ban after failing a doping test in 1989 and got
bronze two years ago in Atlanta.
	   For Pinto, it was finally a medal after 10 years of trying.
	   ``I didn't want to end my career without a medal of some kind,''
Pinto said. ``Gold is all the better.
	   ``I knew Dieter (Baumann) would be difficult so I just pushed
very, very hard the last four or five laps,'' added Pinto, who owns
a vineyard in northern Portugal and admits to drinking four or five
bottles of wine weekly.
	   Pinto's time on a hot, sticky night in the Hungarian capital was
well off his season best of 27:15.76 _ the No. 4 mark in the world
this year.
	   Baumann, the defending European 5,000 champion, was running only
his third 10,000-meter race _ and it showed at the end.
	   ``After the second lap I knew the silver medal was possible,''
he said. ``The last six laps were difficult. I lost my rhythm and
then got it back so it wasn't so bad at the end.''
	   In the shot, Bagach won with a throw of 21.17 meters, with
silver for German Oliver-Sven Buder (20.98) and bronze for Yriy
Belonog of Ukraine (20.92).
	   This win was also controversial. Afterwards he spoke obtusely
about a possible rule violation, although meet officials declined
to comment with the medal ceremony set for Wednesday.
	   ``Though I have won the competition, some problems have
arisen,'' he told reporters. ``The judges say I had some weights
hidden in my socks, which made my rotation more efficient. At least
that is what they say.''
	   In the 20-kilometer walk, Markov _ silver medalist in Atlanta _
grabbed the lead from Latvia's Aigars Fadejevs as they entered the
Nep stadium with Markov winning in 1:21:10, 15 seconds ahead of
Fadejevs and 29 up on Spain's Francisco Fernandez.
	   ``Fadejevs gave me a strong fight,'' Markov said. ``I was glad
to be able to overtake just a few meters from the finish.''
	   The Latvian had no qualms about getting only silver.
	   ``He (Markov) is the No. 1 in the world, so it wasn't a
surprise,'' he said. ``I lost power and speed at the end, I was
just tired when we got to the stadium. But Markov won because he's
better.''
	   In a full schedule of qualifying at the six-day championships,
three British sprinters had the top times entering Wednesday's
semifinals and finals. Dwain Chambers and Darren Campbell both
clocked 10.26 and Marlon Devonish ran 10.28.
	   In the women's 100, with the finals also on Wednesday, reigning
champion Irina Privalova of Russia won her heat in 11.22 as she
tries to bounce back from a hamstring injury. Ekaterini Thanou of
Greece qualified with the fastest time, 11.04, and Zhanna
Pintusevich of Ukraine, the 200 world champion, clocked 11.06.
	   In the first major upset of the championships, Daniela Bartova,
the Czech pole vaulter who broke the world record 10 times in 1995,
failed to qualify for the final.
	   Bartova, who set the European record at 4.51 meters in June and
has the No. 4 vault this year in the world, cleared 4.00 on her
final attempt, then skipped 4.10. She failed in all three attempts
at 4.15, a height that would have qualified her.
	   World champion Stephane Diagana of France champion cleared the
first round of qualifying by winning his 400-hurdle heat in 49.28.
Carlos Silva of Portugal led all qualifiers with a time of 49.00.
	   Ruslan Mashchenko of Russia, who has the fastest time in Europe
this year of 48.06, won his heat to advance in a relatively slow
50.30.
	   Fermin Cacho, the 1992 Olympic champion from Spain, led all
qualifiers in the 1,500 in 3:38.52. Cacho was also silver medalist
at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and took silver at the world
championship last year.

Confusion over new Argentine national team coaching arrangement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ After a disappointing loss in the
World Cup, Argentina was expected to replace national team coach
Daniel Passarella.
	   What was unexpected was a confusing arrangement where two people
would take his place.
	   Julio Grondona, the head of Argentina's football association,
announced Monday that Marcelo Bielsa would be the team's new coach.
But Grondona also declared Jose Pekerman the team's general
director - a new position whose responsibilities are not quite
clear.
	   ``They will have to coach together,'' said Grondona, who
struggled to make the distinction between the two positions. ``Each
one will know his place.''
	   Biesla, an Argentine, is expected to resign as coach of Spain's
Espanyol club in the next few days. For Pekerman, who led
Argentina's youth programs, the new assignment will be a promotion
within the organization.
	   Grondona had hinted for months that Pekerman would succeed
Passarella, and his surprise announcement Monday has left
Argentines confused.
	   ``It would be good if fans knew who is responsible to organize
the team,'' read a headline in La Nacion, a Buenos Aires daily.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The ``Real IRA,'' a splinter
group opposed to Northern Ireland's peace accord, on Tuesday said
it carried out the bombing that killed 28 people here and injured
220. It apologized for the dreadful toll, asserting its warnings
were not properly reported.
	   ``Despite media reports, it was not our intention at any time to
kill any civilians,'' the group said in a statement telephoned to a
newspaper office in Dublin. ``It was a commercial target, part of
an ongoing war against the Brits.''
	   ``We offer apologies to these civilians,'' the statement added.
	   Britain's top official in the province, accompanying Prince
Charles on a tour of this shattered town when the claim was made,
denounced the apology as a ``pathetic attempt to ... excuse mass
murder.'' The police and Ulster Television in Belfast also rejected
the group's claim that it gave clear warnings.
	   ``It is contemptible and it is an insult to the people of
Omagh,'' said Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, breaking off
briefly from visiting survivors with Charles. ``The sole
responsibility lies with the bombers and we and the Irish
government will continue to do what we can to hunt them down.''
	   The ``Real IRA'' called the Dublin office of a Northern Ireland
newspaper, Irish News, using a recognized codeword.
	   News media said the responsibility claim appeared authentic and
to reflect embarrassment over the bombing, which killed mainly
women and children and was worst atrocity in three decades of
sectarian conflict.
	   On Monday, police arrested five suspected members of the ``Real
IRA,'' a group which rejects the acceptance by the Irish Republican
Army and political ally Sinn Fein of April's peace accord because
it does not provide for a united Ireland. The reputed commander is
a former IRA quartermaster, Michael McKevitt, who broke away in
October.
	   In its statement, the group maintained it warned Ulster
Television twice and a branch of the Samaritans that the bomb was
some 300-400 yards (meters) from Omagh's courthouse.
	   Both the police and Ulster TV said the warnings stipulated the
bomb was at the courthouse. Police cordoned off the building,
unwittingly driving people into the heart of the blast in crowded
shops at the end of Market Street, which slopes down from the
courthouse.
	   In a statement, the Royal Ulster Constabulary reiterated that
the warnings said the bomb was ``near the courthouse.''
	   As dusk fell, some 5,000 people gathered in the center of Omagh
in a candlelit vigil for the victims.
	   Earlier in Augher, a tiny, grieving village 15 miles (24 kms)
from here, 30-year-old Avril Monaghan and her 18-month-old daughter
were laid to rest in a hilltop rural cemetery, the first of a
string of funerals. At least 12 more victims, including Mrs.
Monaghan's 65-year-old mother, will be buried Wednesday.
	   The brown wooden casket of the young woman, heavily pregnant
with twin daughters, dwarfed the white coffin of her child Maura as
the procession entered St. Macartan's Catholic church.
	   Her husband, Michael, clasped the couple's other young children,
two girls and a boy. He joined in singing ``My soul is longing for
peace'' at the Requiem Mass.
	   ``We are bereaved as a nation as a whole, Protestant and
Catholic,'' said Bishop James Duffy, bishop of Clogher.
	   The Rev. James Grimes, Mrs. Monaghan's uncle and one of the
priests who celebrated the Mass, prayed that the Omagh tragedy
``would be the last of the terrible agonies our people have
suffered over the past 30 years.''
	   Such hopes have risen from the despair of every mass killing in
the Northern Ireland.
	   Charles recalled the 1979 assassination by the Irish Republican
Army of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to RAISE that study involved only women

 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ A surprising new study raises questions about the
effectiveness of hormone supplements containing estrogen in warding
off heart trouble in older women.
	   The study involved only women who already had heart disease, and
the study's authors and other experts rushed to say that the
findings should not be assumed to apply to healthy women. A much
larger study now under way will shed more light on that question,
they said.
	   Millions of women take estrogen supplements to replace the
hormones their bodies stop making at menopause. The supplements
relieve symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness and
protect against thinning bones.
	   Previous studies found that women taking these supplements
suffered up to 60 percent less heart disease.
	   The latest study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association, involved 2,763 postmenopausal women
with heart disease. All of them had suffered heart attacks or chest
pain caused by blocked arteries, or had undergone bypass surgery or
angioplasty.
	   Those who were randomly assigned to take a supplement containing
estrogen and a type of hormone called a progestin suffered no fewer
heart attacks over four years than the other women.
	   To researchers' surprise, women taking the supplements actually
suffered more heart attacks during the first year. But they had
fewer heart attacks later, and the effects balanced out over four
years.
	   The study's lead author, Dr. Stephen B. Hulley, chairman of
epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at
San Francisco, cautioned that the findings are directly applicable
only to women who already have heart disease.
	   He said more research is needed to determine whether the
findings also hold true among women who do not yet have heart
disease.
	   Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, an endocrinologist at Harvard-affiliated
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said if the study had been
extended, it might have shown an overall long-term benefit. But she
acknowledged that the findings ``somewhat dampen enthusiasm'' for
the belief that hormone supplements protect the hearts of healthy
women.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Confusion marked President Laurent
Kabila's troubled government Tuesday as it sought to regroup its
military and mistakenly arrested a senior official.
	   Kabila reportedly was in the southern city of Lubumbashi, a
stronghold where he has spent most of the past week, and his
overwhelmed government was showing signs of stress as tension among
troops and civilians began to take a toll.
	   Gunfire rattled through a crowded district in the heart of the
capital, Kinshasa, early Tuesday, wounding several people.
	   A government spokesman would not comment on it and there was no
immediate explanation.
	   In a separate incident, witnesses said several men were wounded
when troops loyal to Kabila opened fire on a convoy of new army
recruits heading out of the city to the southeast.
	   That shooting was in connection with the arrest of Deputy
Interior Minister Faustin Munene, who was mistakenly accused of
conspiring with the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters,
Rwandan soldiers and disaffected members of Kabila's army.
	   Munene was later released, Kabila's Cabinet director Adboulaye
Yerodia said on state television.
	   ``Mr. Munene is not the kind of man who would commit treason
against President Kabila,'' Yerodia said.
	   Wounded troops from front-line fighting were being treated by
doctors hindered by a citywide power outage, an International Red
Cross official said.
	   A number of soldiers were admitted to Kinshasa's General
Hospital with bullet wounds. Residents lined up to donate blood.
	   A former military intelligence officer with close ties to
Kabila's government said the army suffered a serious setback in
recent days, when its key Zulu Battalion joined the rebels.
	   The battalion was one of the first units to enter Kinshasa when
Kabila's forces ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko 15 months
ago. More recently it was deployed to defend the town of Inga,
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of Kimpese, the former
intelligence officer said.
	   Inga, which fell to the rebels late last week, is home to one of
Congo's primary power-generating dams.
	   In Kinshasa, struggling through a second straight day without
electricity, thousands of people flocked to gas stations and food
stores to stock up on supplies. The cost of daily essentials shot
up, with bread and cooking fuel prices doubling overnight in some
places.
	   ``The people are struggling,'' Marie Ngoyo said as she surveyed
a row of bread sticks at a local shop. ``All we want is our lives
to be normal.''
	   State-controlled Voice of the People radio, broadcasting with
the help of a generator, appealed to store owners not to inflate
prices unnecessarily. The government said it would begin
distributing bread and sardines.
	   Southwest of the capital, rebel forces continued their drive
toward Kinshasa.
	   Heavy fighting was reported Tuesday in Kimpese, about 200
kilometers (125 miles) south of Kinshasa. Kabila's soldiers fled
from the rebels, according to a local journalist who saw the
combat.
	   Kabila has insisted his troops will hold off the advance and
urged the public to arm themselves.
	   An underground opposition group on Tuesday, however, said it
would not support Kabila and called on both sides to consider the
will of the people for democratic reform.
	   ``The Congolese people will no longer accept the absolute power
of Kabila,'' said Awam Nguya of the Congolese Nationalist Army
Resistance Front.
	   Seeking outside support, Kabila was in Angola over the weekend
to request troops and arms. In late July, he went to Cuba, where he
also reportedly sought help.
	   One of Kabila's closest allies, Namibia, delivered 21 tons of
arms and ammunition to Kinshasa last weekend, Namibia's largest
newspaper reported. The delivery could not be immediately
confirmed.
	   But many of Kabila's allies have turned against him.
	   Rwandan Tutsi soldiers _ once the core of Kabila's forces _
defected two weeks ago to join the uprising, acting on concerns
that Kabila has failed to secure Congo's turbulent eastern border
with Rwanda.
	   Rwanda and neighboring Uganda, which together helped Kabila oust
Mobutu, have both denied involvement in the latest rebellion.
	   Diplomats from Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania and Namibia,
representing the Organization of African Unity and the Southern
African Development Community, met Tuesday with rebel leaders in
the eastern Congolese city of Goma. The delegation was trying to
determine whether Rwanda and Uganda had violated Congo's borders.
	   In Zimbabwe's capital of Harare, Kabila's son Joseph joined
defense ministers from several countries for talks Tuesday, state
radio reported.

	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Retired French soccer star Eric
Cantona returned to Manchester United to a hero's welcome Tuesday.
	   Cantona retired suddenly in May 1997, one week after winning the
Premier League title _ his fourth league title in five seasons with
the club.
	   But he was lured back for a testimonial at Old Trafford to mark
the 40th anniversary of the Munich air crash, which killed eight
Manchester United players in February 1958.
	   The result was an 8-4 win for Manchester United over Cantona's
selection, although the former French international remained the
star of the show by playing a half with each team.
	   He started with his Cantona 11 and the score was 2-2 at
halftime, with the help of his French connect Jean-Pierre Papin and
current France national team captain Laurent Blanc.
	   However, when he returned to the field in his famous red No. 7
shirt in the second half, it brought a huge roar from the capacity
crowd.
	   The referee disallowed a Cantona goal early in the second half
but the crowd got what it was waiting for in the 80th minute when
Cantona dribbled past two defenders and the goalkeeper before
scooping the ball into the net. His goal gave Manchester United an
unbeatable 7-4 lead.
	   He reserved some time for his faithful fans before the game.
	   ``Long live Manchester United,'' he screamed to the cheers from
the 55,000-strong crowd after running out on Old Trafford for the
last time.
	   ``It is very emotional for me to come and play at Old Trafford
this last time,'' he said.
	   ``I spent here...the best moments of my career.''

Debtors association calls for investigation of Zedillo funds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A nationwide debtors group urged opposition
parties Tuesday to investigate allegations that millions of dollars
from a bank bailout fund were used to finance President Ernesto
Zedillo's 1994 campaign.
	   The brewing scandal involves allegations by former bankers and
the former director of Mexico's largest airline, who say campaign
contributions to the ruling party were absorbed by a controversial
bank savings protection fund known as Fobaproa.
	   ``In any other country, this kind of revelation ... would have
caused the resignation of the entire Cabinet,'' Gerardo Fernandez
Norona, president of the debtors association, told reporters.
	   The amount of the alleged contribution is uncertain. The leftist
Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, said it would release an
estimate this week.
	   In a letter to PRD chairman Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,
Fernandez asks: ``Will there be a punishment for President Zedillo?
Will there be a punishment for the big businessmen and bankers who
benefited from the government's economic plan?''
	   The opposition PRD and National Action parties have questioned
the legality of the bank bailout, which could cost Mexicans more
than dlrs 65 billion. But Fernandez said neither party has gone far
enough in its investigation.
	   ``We have an inept Cabinet linked to a scandal. President
Zedillo received campaign funds and later implemented the
bailout,'' Fernandez said.
	   It would take one year for 60 million Mexicans working at
minimum wage, currently about dlrs 3 a day, to pay for the dlrs 65
billion trust which bought bad loans from the nation's banks, he
noted.
	   Zedillo has asked Congress to convert the bailout to public
debt. Opposition lawmakers say much of the defaulted debt was the
result of insider lending, corrupt practices and lax government
supervision.
	   Fernandez presented a petition of 1,680 signatures gathered in
downtown Mexico City opposing the plan.
	   The daily Reforma reported Monday that Gerardo de Prevoisin,
former president of Aeromexico airlines, told the company's lawyers
he was forced by government officials to transfer dlrs 8 million
from company funds to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI.
	   A campaign contribution of dlrs 8 million was considered small,
compared to what other companies were asked to contribute to
Zedillo's campaign, he said in a deposition for a U.S. District
Court.
	   The holding company which controlled Aeromexico received dlrs 25
million from Fobaproa.
	   Opposition lawmakers are demanding a thorough audit of the
fund's liabilities, and prosecution of government officials and
bankers who took advantage of the bailout.
	   Zedillo's proposal to Congress also would allow total foreign
ownership of Mexican banks.
	   ``We are bailing out our banks, only so the government can sell
them to foreigners,'' Fernandez said.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ After a nine-month manhunt, police have
captured Mexico's most feared kidnapper, who terrorized a capital
already reeling from a crime wave by cutting off the ears of his
millionaire victims.
	   Daniel Arizmendi Lopez _ known as the ``ear lopper'' _ was
arrested Monday night in Naucalpan, a northwestern suburb of Mexico
City, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar announced Tuesday.
	   He said Arizmendi was captured in a car with more than dlrs 1
million in cash.
	   ``Yesterday was a day of bad luck for me. That's all,''
Arizmendi told TV Azteca at the Mexico City airport as he was led
away in handcuffs. His hair was matted and he had what appeared to
be bruises across the right side of his face.
	   Madrazo said Arizmendi's gang, which stretched into at least
four states and allegedly included both former and active police
officers, had been disbanded.
	   It is not known how many kidnappings Arizmendi, a 39-year-old
former Morelos state police officer, is accused of committing.
	   But some authorities say he was involved in as many as 200
kidnappings, all of wealthy businessmen or their family members.
Madrazo said he would release an estimate soon.
	   In a police sweep that lasted into Tuesday morning, authorities
from three states and the attorney general's office also arrested
16 other alleged members of Arizmendi's gang, including his
mistress.
	   Police had been searching for Arizmendi since October, and at
least five warrants were issued for his arrest. On May 21,
Arizmendi narrowly escaped a raid on a safe house in Cuernavaca, 35
miles south of Mexico City.
	   His son and daughter-in-law were arrested in that raid, as well
as his wife, a former nurse who was allegedly in charge of cutting
off the hostages' ears, which were then used to pressure the
victims' families to pay ransom.
	   In exchange for lesser sentences, the three gave authorities
information that, along with intelligence gathered from phone taps,
helped track down Arizmendi, Madrazo said.
	   The case has captivated Mexicans, who have watched television
specials interviewing victims and read front-page stories on
Arizmendi's childhood.
	   Shortly after the arrest announcement, vendors were hawking
afternoon newspapers with a half-page headline: ``Daniel has
fallen.''
	   Arizmendi epitomized an unprecedented crime wave in Mexico City,
which has prompted a surge in bodyguards, driven away business and
brought travel warnings from the U.S. Embassy.
	   Although Mexican law and Roman Catholic doctrine bar the death
penalty, Cuernavaca's bishop once said Arizmendi ``makes you want
to make an exception.''
	   Madrazo said the manhunt apparently didn't stop Arizmendi from
continuing his crime spree: The latest crime he is accused of, the
murder of a wealthy businessman, occurred during an Aug. 6
kidnapping attempt in the nearby state of Queretaro.
	   Arizmendi's gang is accused of shooting to death Raul Nieto del
Rio, owner of a string of gasoline stations, then demanding a dlrs
15 million ransom from his family even though he was dead.
	   Arizmendi was taken to Queretaro to give a statement in that
case before being taken to Mexico's maximum-security Almoloya
Prison, west of Mexico City.
	   Police recovered millions of dollars in the May raid on
Arizmendi's safe house and also have seized property and bank
accounts allegedly belonging to him. Madrazo said all money
recovered from the gang would be returned to victims.
	   ``This is the minimum of justice we can offer,'' he said.
	   Samuel Gonzalez Ruiz, who is in charge of the attorney general's
special unit on organized crime, said the families of 80 victims
already have requested compensation.

Mallorca downs FC Barcelona 2-1 in first leg of Supercup final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ Yugoslav midfielder
Jovan Stankovic fired home from a free kick to give Mallorca a 2-1
victory over Spanish league and cup champion FC Barcelona in the
first leg of the Spanish Supercup final here Tuesday.
	   The Supercup, the season's first trophy, is played between the
winner of the first division and the King's Cup. Since Barcelona
won both, Mallorca qualified having been finalist in the King's
Cup.
	   The second leg is to be played Saturday in Barcelona's Camp Nou
stadium.
	   Xavi Hernandez, brought up from Barcelona's B team, put the
visitors ahead in the 15th minute with a shot from the edge of the
box following a corner kick by Giovanniand a clever back pass from
Luis Enrique to Miguel Angel Nadal who laid the ball back to the
youngster to bolt it past Argentine national team 'keeper Carlos
Roa.
	   For the first half, Louis Van Gaal's Barcelona played a dull
game despite the array of foreign talent at its disposal including
Brazilians Rivaldo and Giovanni and new Dutch international
signings Phillip Cocu and Boudewijn Zenden.
	   But neither did Mallorca, coached by Argentine Hector Cuper, put
it under any pressure until 13 minutes into the second half when
Dani Garcia, recently signed from Real Madrid, drew the home team
level following a pass from Cameroon midfielder Lauren Bisan-Etane
Mayer.
	   From there on in Mallorca appeared to realize that with a bit of
daring in Barcelona's half, it could unsettle its mighty opponent.
	   The strategy paid off in the 80th minute when Stankovic
thunderbolted in a freekick from 24 yards (meters) which deflected
off the defense wall and went past Barcelona 'keeper Ruud Hesp.
	   The goal was all the sweeter as it was Stankovic's penalty miss
in May that gave Barcelona a 5-4 win over Mallorca to win a record
24th King's Cup.
	   The Spanish first division begins Aug. 30.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian women's groups Tuesday celebrated
the ban on quinacrine, a chemical used for sterilization, but
criticized the government for delaying action for so long.
	   On Monday, India apparently became the first country to ban
quinacrine, opposed by health activists because of its possible
dangers, which include cancer.
	   ``It's a huge achievement,'' said Brinda Karat, whose All India
Democratic Women's Association asked the Supreme Court in March to
ban the drug.
	   Pellets of quinacrine, originally intended to fight malaria, are
inserted into the uterus and prevent pregnancies by scarring the
fallopian tubes.
	   Stephen Mumford, who operates the Center for Research on
Population and Security from his home in Chapel Hill, North
Carolina, estimated in June that he supplied more than 100,000 poor
women around the world with quinacrine.
	   He said that ban was based on media reports and not scientific
review.
	   ``Scientific evidence continues to mount, and we simply are not
getting any bad reports on this method,'' he said. ``As the safety
and effectiveness continue to be demonstrated, it's going to be
more and more difficult to suppress it. And we're convinced that
this method will survive this flurry of media opposition.''
	   No anesthesia is used, and the irreversible procedure is
painful. Some women faint; for many, short-term side effects
include abnormal bleeding, backaches, fever, abdominal pain and
headaches.
	   Mumford said the procedure was ``not painless. ... But the pain
involved is miniscule compared to surgical sterilization, and the
opposition never mentions this.''
	   Quinacrine is not approved for use in the United States. Nearly
all major family-planning organizations, many foreign governments
and the World Health Organization also oppose its use for
sterilization.
	   Karat said quinacrine pellets had already been inserted into
thousands of Indian women, mainly in the West Bengal state.
	   Health activists say the drug was being circulated in India for
years without permission from Indian authorities.
	   ``Doctors who used it were so secretive and non-transparent that
there was no way of finding out the numbers of sterilized women,
except from guessing from their papers at international
conferences,'' Karat said.
	   But she added that the Indian government had ignored AIDWA's
demand for a ban on quinacrine for years and the announcement came
five months after federal officials assured the Supreme Court the
drug would be prohibited in the country.
	   Thousands of women are feared to have been affected during this
period, she said.
	   ``The government's carelessness borders on criminal
negligence,'' Karat said.
	   The use of quinacrine _ distributed at low costs in poor
countries _ has shot up in recent years.
	   Swiss company Sipharm Sisseln has said it has produced around 5
million pellets in all for Mumford's center and two similar
laboratories.

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Police in Martinique said
Tuesday they arrested a man and woman in connection with the death
of their 3-year-old daughter.
	   A judge on Monday charged Carole Erepmoc, 21, and her
25-year-old boyfriend, Jean-Luc Milock, with ``voluntary battery
and violence.'' The couple has a 2-year-old son, and Erepmoc is
eight months pregnant.
	   The couple brought the girl to a hospital on Saturday, where she
died from multiple injuries.
	   Erepmoc claimed she had fallen down the stairs, but police said
marks on the body indicated she had been beaten.

Australian phenom Hewitt advances, but Sampras comes next

	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Young Australian phenom Lleyton
Hewitt won a straight-set victory over Armenian Sargis Sargsian
6-3, 6-4, and German Rainer Schuttler scored an upset victory
Tuesday in the Pilot Pen International tennis tournament.
	   No. 9 seed Jan Siemerink, No. 10 Nicolas Kiefer, No. 11 Gustavo
Kuerten and Americans MaliVai Washington and Jeff Tarango also
advanced, all in straight sets.
	   Justin Gimelstob lost his first-round match to No. 16 Guillaume
Raoux 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
	   Hewitt, 17, who won the Australian Men's Hardcourt Championships
earlier this year, will face 11-time Grand Slam winner Pete
Sampras, the No. 1 seed, on Wednesday.
	   ``It should be a good experience,'' said Hewitt, who rebounded
after falling to 3-4 in his second set. ``Hopefully I will give him
a good match.''
	   Hewitt's victory in his hometown of Adelaide included a victory
over Andre Agassi, a player he idolized growing up. But the
Australian dismissed any connection that Agassi's victory over
Sampras in Toronto earlier this month might have on his own
second-round match.
	   ``I don't think an indirect win's really what I'm looking at
here,'' he said.
	   The marquee match was to take place at night, with Wimbledon
finalist Goran Ivanisevic, the No. 8 seed, taking on Geoff Grant.
Grant was the lone winner Monday, when rain washed out most of the
matches.
	   Wet weather and a thunderstorm postponed play Tuesday afternoon,
but officials said they hoped to resume play later in the day.
	   Schuttler ousted Frenchman Nicolas Escude, the No. 14 seed, 4-6,
6-4, 6-3. He picked up the victory Tuesday after having dropped his
first set Monday before weather postponed the rest of the match.
	   ``I think I was lucky that yesterday the rains came,'' he said.
	   Andrei Medvedev beat Eyal Erlich 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 with the help of
six aces and will face No. 3 Petr Korda in the second round.
	   Jeff Tarango ousted Lionel Roux 6-2, 6-2 using a strong serve to
face No. 2 Patrick Rafter. Tarango wasn't in danger of being
broken, and won 78 percent of his second serves.
	   Todd Woodbridge held on despite 10 double faults to beat
Marc-Kevin Goellner 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 and advanced to face No. 5 seed
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the tounament's defending champion.

Graf returning to form in du Maurier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ At a time when brash teenagers are attracting
much of the spotlight in women's tennis, Steffi Graf proved on
Tuesday in the du Maurier Canadian Open tennis tournament that she
isn't finished yet.
	   Graf, 29, hampered by injuries in the last year, showed flashes
of brilliance in her second-round match against Spain's Virginia
Ruano-Pascual, needing only 41 minutes for 6-0, 6-1 victory.
	   ``I was surprised that I was feeling that good because I've been
training hard for the past 10 days,'' Graf said.
	   ``I cut down on practice because I've been feeling a bit tired.
But today I was going for it and hitting the balls. I was really
going for my forehand and my serve, and things have been holding up
physically for me since June.''
	   Graf, winner of 21 grand-slam singles titles and at one time the
world's top-ranked player for 374 weeks, missed seven months after
undergoing left knee surgery just over a year ago.
	   The German has also battled ankle and shoulder injuries, and has
played in only eight tournaments this year.
	   ``There were serious doubts if I could do it and come back,''
she said. ``It took me a lot of time to get used to all the
injuries, and during that period there were times when I wasn't
quite sure that I could hang on.''
	   In a battle of veterans earlier on center court, 13th-seeded
Mary Pierce of France was soundly beaten by American Mary Joe
Fernandez 6-1, 6-1.
	   The Canadian-born Pierce, ranked as high as third in the world
in 1995, strained a right quadricep in a tournament in San Diego
just over a week ago and was forced to withdraw from last week's
tour stop in Los Angeles.
	   ``I'm not upset, because I know that I wasn't ready to play,''
Pierce said. ``But my confidence is fine. I know that if I get fit,
and get back into game shape, I'll be OK.''
	   Fernandez, a former top-five player, has also suffered from
injuries. She underwent wrist surgery at the end of 1997 and is
playing in only her third tournament this year.
	   ``The last six or seven months have been really tough,'' said
Fernandez, ranked 67th by the WTA. ``And right now on the court, I
feel a little awkward. I know it's going to be a long road back.''
	   The other seed to fall on the second day of the tournament was
Lisa Raymond. The 17th-ranked American was ousted by countrywoman
Corina Moriaru in three sets.
	   France's Sandrine Testud, the 14th seed, downed Australian
Rachel McQuillan 6-1, 6-3; sixth-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain
beat American Amy Frazier 7-6 (7-4), 6-4; and South African Amanda
Coetzer, seeded eighth, defeated China's Fang Li 6-3, 6-4.

Daly ready to take break from golf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, California (AP) _ John Daly says it might be time
for him to walk away from golf until he can get his game
straightened out.
	   ``I've had it with this,'' he said Monday after shooting a
2-over 74 to finish 13 strokes back in the Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am. ``It ain't worth it.''
	   Frustrated by working harder than he ever has but getting
nothing in return, Daly planned to withdraw from this week's Sprint
International in Colorado and won't play another PGA Tour event
this year.
	   ``Only the fun events,'' he said, mentioning the Fred Meyer
Challenge, the Shark Shootout and the J.C. Penney Classic, a mixed
event that he plays with Laura Davies.
	   Daly is supposed to play with Mark O'Meara and Tiger Woods in
the Dunhill Cup in October, and is even having second thoughts
about that.
	   ``If things don't change, I may ask to be replaced,'' he said.
``I wouldn't help Tiger and Mark right now. I'd only be hurting the
team.''
	   Daly finished in the top 20 in five straight tournaments during
the spring, kept going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and spent
more time on the driving range than ever.
	   ``I used to be able to tee it up and shoot 69 without breaking a
sweat,'' Daly said. ``Now, I'm hitting it great and making a lot of
putts and nothing is happening.''
	   He has missed the cut in four of his last 11 tournaments. In one
of the few tournaments where he played on the weekend, he closed
with two double bogeys in the third round at Memphis and was
disqualified for walking off the course without signing his card.
	   ``That was stupid,'' he said.
	   He played the FedEx St. Jude's Classic because it was close to
his home in Arkansas and he wanted to appease his friends, even
though the course doesn't suit his game.
	   ``I figured I'd get ripped by the press if I didn't play,'' he
said. ``And I got ripped anyway.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ELS' CONCERNS: &LR;  Ernie Els is finding it more difficult to
return home to South Africa.
	   Earlier this year, his home was ransacked by burglars _ one of
them died after crashing an Els vehicle he had stolen. His farm in
the Western Cape Province was hit by another burglar recently, this
time by a man suspected of killing four people on a nearby farm.
	   Els was clearly disturbed after shooting a 4-under 66 in the
final round of the PGA Championship to tie for 21st. He dreads
tournament news conferences, where the topic of crime in South
Africa often comes up.
	   ``It's unfortunate that these things are happening,'' he said.
``We're not safe, and no one seems to care.''
	   Els also has a home in Orlando, Florida, where he spends about
nine months of the year.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; AUSTRALIAN INSPIRATION: &LR;  Robert Allenby of Australia, who has
won four times on the European tour and a total of 10 tournaments
around the world, had been thinking about trying to play the PGA
Tour next year.
	   That became a higher priority when his best friend, Stuart
Appleby, lost his wife in a freak accident outside a London train
station. Allenby is trying to win enough money to avoid going to
qualifying school.
	   Three weeks after Renay Appleby's death, Allenby finished tied
for 13th at the PGA Championship, his best finish at a major.
	   ``My main goal is to play well enough to get on this tour,'' he
said. ``I have a lot of friends over in Europe, but I also have
some here. And this is definitely where I want to play.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; RYDER CUP MYSTERY: &LR;  The PGA of America is still trying to
decide where to play the Ryder Cup matches in 2003.
	   ``You start with a great golf course to test great players, and
virtually every golf club in the United States is interested in
hosting that event,'' PGA president Jim Awtrey said.
	   The leading candidates are said to be Colonial in Fort Worth,
Texas; Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, and Medinah Country Club
near Chicago.
	   Colonial doesn't have the reputation of Pinehurst or Medinah,
but those courses have drawbacks.
	   Pinehurst lacks enough hotel rooms within 20 miles (32
kilometers) for an event that has become the biggest in golf and
will draw thousands of European visitors. What could hurt Medinah
is that the U.S. Open will be at nearly Olympia Fields that summer,
which could drain the resources of corporate sponsors.
	   Awtrey said the decision isn't taking longer than usual,
although the PGA of America usually announces such site selections
at its annual news conference the day before the PGA Championship.
	   Awtrey said an announcement is expected in the fall.

<TEXT>
	   WHITE PLAINS, New York (AP) _ Jennifer Capriati and Patrick
McEnroe were among 16 players who received wild card entries
Tuesday into the 1998 U.S. Open.
	   Capriati, who has battled off-the-court problems since leaving
the WTA Tour in late 1993, has lost in the first round at the U.S.
Open the past two years. She has been knocked out in the first
round six times in 10 Corel WTA Tour events this season and is
ranked 110th in the world.
	   McEnroe has played only one tournament this year, losing in the
second round at the American Red Clay Tennis Championships in May.
McEnroe, who is ranked 653rd in the world, reached the
quarterfinals of the U.S. Open in 1995.
	   Other women receiving wild card entries were NCAA singles
champion Vanessa Webb of Duke, Laura Granville, Kristina Brandi,
Samantha Reeves, Lilia Osterloh, Alexandra Stevenson and Brie
Rippner.
	   Other men receiving entries were NCAA singles champion Bob Bryan
of Stanford, Richey Reneberg, Alex O'Brien, Andrew Park, Paul
Goldstein, Taylor Dent and Geoff Grant.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 12-16 with government account of bomb

 &UR; With AP Photos &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The ``Real IRA,'' a splinter
group opposed to Northern Ireland's peace accord, on Tuesday said
it carried out the bombing that killed 28 people here and injured
220. It apologized for the dreadful toll, asserting its warnings
were not properly reported.
	   ``Despite media reports, it was not our intention at any time to
kill any civilians,'' the group said in a statement telephoned to a
newspaper office in Dublin. ``It was a commercial target, part of
an ongoing war against the Brits.''
	   ``We offer apologies to these civilians,'' the statement added.
	   Britain's top official in the province, accompanying Prince
Charles on a tour of this shattered town when the claim was made,
denounced the apology as a ``pathetic attempt to ... excuse mass
murder.'' The police and Ulster Television in Belfast also rejected
the group's claim that it gave clear warnings.
	   ``It is contemptible and it is an insult to the people of
Omagh,'' said Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, breaking off
briefly from visiting survivors with Charles. ``The sole
responsibility lies with the bombers and we and the Irish
government will continue to do what we can to hunt them down.''
	   The ``Real IRA'' called the Dublin office of a Northern Ireland
newspaper, Irish News, using a recognized codeword.
	   News media said the responsibility claim appeared authentic and
to reflect embarrassment over the bombing, which killed mainly
women and children and was worst atrocity in three decades of
sectarian conflict.
	   On Monday, police arrested five suspected members of the ``Real
IRA,'' a group which rejects the acceptance by the Irish Republican
Army and political ally Sinn Fein of April's peace accord because
it does not provide for a united Ireland. The reputed commander is
a former IRA quartermaster, Michael McKevitt, who broke away in
October.
	   In its statement, the group maintained it warned Ulster
Television twice and a branch of the Samaritans that the bomb was
some 300-400 yards (meters) from Omagh's courthouse.
	   Both the police and Ulster TV said the warnings stipulated the
bomb was at the courthouse. Police cordoned off the building,
unwittingly driving people into the heart of the blast in crowded
shops at the end of Market Street, which slopes down from the
courthouse.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office said
Tuesday night that at 2:32 p.m. on Saturday a warning was called in
to Ulster TV.
	   The exact words used were: ``There's a bomb, courthouse, Omagh,
main street, 500 pounds, explosion 30 minutes,'' a spokesman for
the prime minister said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   One minute later, the television station received a second call
and the caller said: ``Bomb, Omagh town, 15 minutes,'' the
spokesman said.
	   Another minute later the Samaritans, a group which runs a
helpline for suicidal people, received a call.
	   ``This is a bomb warning. It's going to go off in 30 minutes,''
the caller said, adding that the bomb was on Main Street about 200
yards (meters) from the courthouse. No description of any vehicle
was given, Downing Street said.
	   The bomb exploded at 3:10 p.m.
	   As dusk fell Tuesday night, some 5,000 people gathered in the
center of Omagh in a candlelit vigil for the victims.
	   Earlier in Augher, a tiny, grieving village 15 miles (24 kms)
from here, 30-year-old Avril Monaghan and her 18-month-old daughter
were laid to rest in a hilltop rural cemetery, the first of a
string of funerals. At least 12 more victims, including Mrs.
Monaghan's 65-year-old mother, will be buried Wednesday.
	   The brown wooden casket of the young woman, heavily pregnant
with twin daughters, dwarfed the white coffin of her child Maura as
the procession entered St. Macartan's Catholic church.
	   Her husband, Michael, clasped the couple's other young children,
two girls and a boy. He joined in singing ``My soul is longing for
peace'' at the Requiem Mass.
	   ``We are bereaved as a nation as a whole, Protestant and
Catholic,'' said Bishop James Duffy, bishop of Clogher.
	   The Rev. James Grimes, Mrs. Monaghan's uncle and one of the
priests who celebrated the Mass, prayed that the Omagh tragedy
``would be the last of the terrible agonies our people have
suffered over the past 30 years.''
	   Such hopes have risen from the despair of every mass killing in
the Northern Ireland.
	   Charles recalled the 1979 assassination by the Irish Republican
Army of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten.
	   ``I remember hoping 19 years ago that something positive would
come out of that,'' Charles told reporters after visiting survivors
in hospital here. ``But unfortunately things have gone on. Let us
pray this time will be an end to all the horrors that poor Ireland
has had to suffer.''
	   The British and Irish governments have pledged to do all they
can to track down the bombers. They are discussing changing laws to
make it easier to convict suspected terrorists by allowing courts
to accept as evidence simply the word of a police officer.

Brown in doubt for Bledisloe Cup match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's hopes of avoiding
an embarrassing 3-0 Bledisloe Cup series defeat against Australia
have received a setback with prop Olo Brown in doubt for the Aug.
29 match.
	   The All Blacks have lost four matches in a row including the
first two games of the traditional Bledisloe Cup series against the
Wallabies.
	   New Zealand returned home late Tuesday after the crushing
final-minute loss to South Africa last week to prepare for the
Bledisloe finale at the Sydney Football Stadium.
	   Coach John Hart said Brown was in doubt because of a lower back
problem which had not been helped by the flight from South Africa.
	   ``When he cooled down after the test against the Springboks he
was very sore,'' Hart said. ``It'll be no more than a 50-50 call if
he's to play.
	   ``Olo's now our most experienced player. I made him the
cornerstone of our game last week and he delivered.''
	   No. 8 Isitolo Maka, who had to be replaced in the second half in
Durban because of an extremely painful broken nose, is also in some
doubt.
	   Hart said a new tighthead specialist, to cover Brown, will be
brought into the squad when it is named Wednesday.
	   Hart was delighted with the way newcomers Maka, Carl Hoeft and
lock Royce Willis performed in Durban and said the All Blacks'
scrummaging was probably the best in any test in South Africa in
the past three years.
	   A squad of about 25 will be named for the Sydney test and that
will be reduced to 23 next week. Other than the injuries, Hart
indicated there would not be too much difference in the squad from
that which went to South Africa.
	   Hart, meanwhile, was non-committal on suggestions from Britain
that retired No. 8 Zinzan Brooke could be tempted into making
himself available again for All Blacks rugby.
	   Hart pointed out the New Zealand Rugby Football Union had a
policy precluding players from playing for the All Blacks if they
were overseas-based and Brooke now was contracted to London's
Harlequins club.
	   ``But it appears he's feeling rejuvenated, is a stone lighter
and is free of injuries and there might be a message there for
us,'' Hart said.
	   ``Players do need rest and that's why I feel we will get some
benefits next year when our players have three months' rest over
the summer.''

	   SACRAMENTO, California (AP) _ The Sacramento Kings fired coach
Eddie Jordan and assistant Mike Bratz on Tuesday.
	   The team said in a written statement that a search for a
replacement for Jordan would begin immediately.
	   Geoff Petrie, vice president of basketball operations for the
Kings, said that the Kings ``have given them the opportunity to
remain with the franchise as outside consultants during their
search for other opportunities.''
	   Jordan, who joined the Kings as an assistant in 1992, compiled a
33-64 record as coach after replacing Garry St. Jean in the final
weeks of the 1996-97 season. Sacramento finished 27-55 under Jordan
in 1997-98, his only full season coach.
	   Jordan, 43, played seven seasons in the National Basketball
Association and was a member of the Los Angeles Lakers' world
championship squad in 1982. He also played for Cleveland, New
Jersey and Portland.
	   After retiring from the NBA, Jordan began his coaching career as
a volunteer assistant at Rutgers in 1984. He then became a
part-time assistant at Boston College for one year and returned to
Rutgers as a full-time assistant for four years before joining the
Kings.
	   Bratz, 42, played nine seasons for six NBA teams before retiring
in 1986. He has worked five seasons as an assistant with the Kings.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's Foreign Ministry has invited foreign
diplomats to visit the state of Chiapas next month _ the first such
offer since leftist Zapatistas took up arms there in 1994, a report
said Tuesday.
	   The diplomats are expected to visit the capital, Tuxtla
Gutierrez, as well as San Cristobal de las Casas, Comitan and
Tapachula for three days beginning Sept. 7, the daily Reforma
reported.
	   The U.S. Embassy had no immediate response to the report.
	   The invitation comes three weeks after the U.S. Embassy's
military attache was detained by government supporters in a tense
Chiapas village, fueling accusations of U.S. meddling in the
southern state.
	   The government this year has been cracking down on foreign
involvement in Chiapas, expelling more than 150 people accused of
violating Mexico's law banning foreigners from political
activities.
	   The Zapatista rebels have demanded greater rights and democracy
for Chiapas' poor Indian communities. Peace talks with the
government broke off in 1996.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A Harvard archaeologist has
discovered what he believes to be a 3,000-year-old burial ground
for Mayan commoners, a Honduran official announced Tuesday.
	   ``The remains don't belong to upper-class Mayans because there
are no valuable jewels like those the members of the Indian
dynasties used,'' said Olga Joya, director of the Institute of
Anthropology and History.
	   She said the find, made by U.S. archaeologist William Fash and
four of his students in the Copan ruins 95 miles (150 kilometers)
west of the capital, is from the Mayan pre-classical period, about
1,000 B.C.
	   Joya said the remains are in good condition, and that
archaeologists were optimistic about finding similar sites in the
area. Fash was continuing his dig, she said.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The Supreme Court has ordered
Venezuela's defense minister to guarantee medical treatment to
HIV-positive soldiers, but did not question the army's right to
keep AIDS carriers off active duty.
	   Ruling in a lawsuit brought by four HIV-positive soldiers who
say the army has neglected their medical needs, the court Monday
accused the Defense Ministry of ignoring a January order to provide
the treatment.
	   But at a press conference Tuesday, Defense Minister Tito Rincon
denied the court's contention, saying he has already asked Congress
for the money to do so.
	   The Supreme Court ordered ``immediate and unconditional''
compliance with its original order and said the army was obligated
to show ``solidarity and ethical behavior'' toward AIDS patients.
	   The court said the army must keep paying the soldiers' salaries,
but it has not opposed taking them off active duty. The army, which
refuses to divulge the number of AIDS cases in its ranks, claims
that allowing HIV-positive soldiers in the ranks would hurt
military preparedness.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The federal attorney general's office has
pledged to appoint a new special prosecutor to investigate the
deaths of more than 120 young women in Ciudad Juarez, on Mexico's
northern border, a report said Tuesday.
	   Attorney General Jorge Madrazo made the pledge to the
Association of Families of Disappeared Persons, the daily La
Jornada reported. The new prosecutor will be the fourth in the
5-year-old investigation.
	   Three previous prosecutors were caught allegedly committing
crimes in Ciudad Juarez, such as kidnapping alleged drug dealers,
the newspaper said.
	   Residents of Ciudad Juarez, an industrial city of more than 1
million people across the border from El Paso, Texas, have been
terrified by the frequent grisly rapes and killings dating to 1993.
	   Most of the victims were workers at border assembly plants,
two-thirds of whom are women. Many disappeared while walking to
work on unlit roads.
	   ___
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The Chilean government on Tuesday
approved the import and sale of the male potency drug Viagra.
	   The drug ``will only be sold with a doctor's prescription and
the box will have to carry a warning that it can only be used under
strict medical supervision,'' said Dr. Reynando Gomez of the Public
Health Institute.
	   The government's decree included a clause banning advertising of
Viagra.

baseball bronze &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARACAIBO, Venezuela (AP) _ Belize's basketball team upset
defending champions Puerto Rico with an 83-80 win in the
quarterfinals of the Central American and Caribbean games on
Tuesday.
	   The defeat quashed Puerto Rico's hope of keeping the gold medal
it had won in 1993 in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1993. It will be
Belize's first berth in the competition's semifinals.
	   After a disappointing first half, two free throws from Orlin
Smith and one from Anderson Burton tipped the game in Belize's
favor.
	   Belize's next opponent will be Panama, which eliminated Barbados
81-70 on Tuesday. The Panamanians were down by eight points but
surged ahead in the last minutes of the first half. Panama's
Michael Hicks scored 23 points.
	   The U.S. Virgin Islands and the Dominican Republic battled for a
semifinal spot Tuesday night, as did Cuba and Venezuela.
	   Meanwhile, Venezuela claimed the bronze medal in baseball with a
5-4 victory over Panama. The Panamanians mounted a late defense,
scoring two runs in the bottom of the ninth.
	   Cuba and Nicaragua played Tuesday night for the baseball gold.
	   Cuba has collected 125 gold medals so far in the competition.
Mexico, with 44 gold, and Venezuela, with 43, are fighting for
second place.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ After a nine-month manhunt, police have
captured Mexico's most feared kidnapper, who terrorized a capital
already reeling from a crime wave by cutting off the ears of his
millionaire victims.
	   Daniel Arizmendi Lopez _ known as the ``ear lopper'' _ was
arrested Monday night in Naucalpan, a northwestern suburb of Mexico
City, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar announced Tuesday.
	   He said Arizmendi was captured in a car with more than dlrs 1
million in cash.
	   ``Yesterday was a day of bad luck for me. That's all,''
Arizmendi told TV Azteca at the Mexico City airport as he was led
away in handcuffs. His hair was matted and he had what appeared to
be bruises across the right side of his face.
	   At the attorney general's offices, agents later paraded
Arizmendi and seven alleged accomplices before the press for a
photo opportunity. None of the suspects made statements.
	   They all were expressionless. Arizmendi looked haggard and
scruffy in jeans, a checkered shirt and a thick beard.
	   Madrazo said Arizmendi's gang, which stretched into at least
four states and allegedly included both former and active police
officers, had been disbanded.
	   It is not known how many kidnappings Arizmendi, a 39-year-old
former Morelos state police officer, is accused of committing.
	   But some authorities say he was involved in as many as 200
kidnappings, all of wealthy businessmen or their family members.
Madrazo said he would release an estimate soon.
	   In a police sweep that lasted into Tuesday morning, authorities
from three states and the attorney general's office also arrested
16 other alleged members of Arizmendi's gang, including his
mistress.
	   Police had been searching for Arizmendi since October, and at
least five warrants were issued for his arrest. On May 21,
Arizmendi narrowly escaped a raid on a safe house in Cuernavaca, 35
miles south of Mexico City.
	   His son and daughter-in-law were arrested in that raid, as well
as his wife, a former nurse who was allegedly in charge of cutting
off the hostages' ears, which were then used to pressure the
victims' families to pay ransom.
	   In exchange for lesser sentences, the three gave authorities
information that, along with intelligence gathered from phone taps,
helped track down Arizmendi, Madrazo said.
	   The case has captivated Mexicans, who have watched television
specials interviewing victims and read front-page stories on
Arizmendi's childhood.

	   Arizmendi epitomized an unprecedented crime wave in Mexico City,
which has prompted a surge in bodyguards, driven away business and
brought travel warnings from the U.S. Embassy.
	   Although Mexican law and Roman Catholic doctrine bar the death
penalty, Cuernavaca's bishop once said Arizmendi ``makes you want

	   Madrazo said the manhunt apparently didn't stop Arizmendi from
continuing his crime spree: The latest crime he is accused of, the
murder of a wealthy businessman, occurred during an Aug. 6
kidnapping attempt in the nearby state of Queretaro.
	   Arizmendi's gang is accused of shooting to death Raul Nieto del
Rio, owner of a string of gasoline stations, then demanding a dlrs

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Confusion marked President Laurent
Kabila's troubled government Tuesday as it sought to regroup its
military and mistakenly arrested a senior official. Kabila
reportedly was in the southern city of Lubumbashi, a stronghold
where he has spent most of the past week, and his overwhelmed
government was showing signs of stress as tension among troops and
civilians began to take a toll. Gunfire rattled through a crowded
district in the heart of the capital, Kinshasa, early Tuesday.
Witnesses said several men were wounded when troops loyal to Kabila
opened fire on a convoy of army recruits heading out of the city to
the southeast. (CONGO)
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The ``Real IRA,'' a splinter
group opposed to Northern Ireland's peace accord, on Tuesday said
it carried out the bombing that killed 28 people here and injured
220. It apologized for the dreadful toll, asserting its warnings
were not properly reported. ``Despite media reports, it was not our
intention at any time to kill any civilians,'' the group said in a
statement telephoned to a newspaper office in Dublin. ``It was a
commercial target, part of an ongoing war against the Brits.'' ``We
offer apologies to these civilians,'' the statement added.
Britain's top official in the province, accompanying Prince Charles
on a tour of this shattered town when the claim was made, denounced
the apology as a ``pathetic attempt to ... excuse mass murder.''
(NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Prosecutors have called former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky back to the grand jury to respond to
President Bill Clinton's testimony about their ``inappropriate''
relationship, legal sources said Tuesday. Hillary Rodham Clinton
sent word she ``believes in this marriage,'' her first public
expression on her husband's infidelity. In the aftermath of
Clinton's defiant televised confession, it was clear the crisis was
far from over. As the president and his family left for vacation
Tuesday, a few lawmakers called for his resignation. Prosecutors,
whom Clinton rebuked for invading his privacy, pressed
on.(US-CLINTON INVESTIGATION)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyans said a mournful goodbye Tuesday to
Rose, who struggled for life in vain under the bombed-out rubble of
the U.S. Embassy while the world watched and waited for five days.
Rose Wanjiku Mwangi, 36, came to symbolize the tragedy of the U.S.
Embassy bombings that killed 257 people in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania _ and the frustrations of rescuers who came so
close to rescuing her. ``I would like to apologize to the family
since we tried to save her but failed,'' said a teary-eyed Bob
Nasser, a Kenyan Red Cross volunteer who passed messages to Rose
while she lay beneath the wreckage. FBI agents, meanwhile, pushed
ahead with their investigation into the Aug. 7 bombings. The head
of the FBI investigation in Dar es Salaam, Kenneth Piernick, said
the Bureau has questioned more than 100 people there but indicated
that most of the interrogations had led nowhere. (EMBASSY BOMBINGS)
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Judges at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal were shown grim video footage Tuesday of the carnage left
by Bosnian Croat troops who massacred more than 100 Muslims in 1993
and torched their village. Horrific images of charred bodies and
destroyed buildings were screened on the second day of the U.N.
trial of six Bosnian Croats accused of taking part in the killing
spree in the village of Ahmici on April 16, 1993. The trial is the
sixth currently under way at the tribunal, which was set up in 1993
to bring to justice those accused of committing atrocities during
the 3 1/2-year conflict in the former Yugoslavia. British Army Col.
Bryan Watters, the first prosecution witness in the case, talked
the three-judge panel through a series of video images and still
photographs. The defendants _ brothers Zoran and Mirjan Kupreskic;
their cousin, Vlatko Kupreskic; and Vladimir Santic, Drago
Josipovic and Dragan Papic _ appeared unmoved by the images as they
sat in court surrounded by U.N. guards. (BOSNIA-WAR CRIMES)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Technology stocks led a broad advance Tuesday,
with the Dow industrials nearly duplicating Monday's 150-point
rally. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 139.80 points _ or 1.6
percent _ to 8,714.65, erasing another chunk of a 1,000-point,
monthlong plunge from the July 17 record of 9,337.97. Broad-market
indicators also extended a rally that took hold Monday afternoon.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. trade deficit narrowed slightly to
dlrs 14.2 billion in June, still near an all-time high, as the
deficits with troubled Asian nations continued to soar. The
Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the June deficit was down
8.9 percent from a record of dlrs 15.5 billion set in May, marking
the first decline in the deficit since January. Even with the small
improvement, the trade deficit for the April-June quarter in goods
and services was the highest in history at dlrs 44 billion,
underscoring the heavy impact the U.S. economy has sustained from
the Asian economic crisis, which has cut sharply into U.S. exports
to a region of the world that accounts for one-third of America's
foreign sales. For the first six months of this year, America's
trade deficit is running at an annual rate of dlrs 158 billion, far
surpassing last year's imbalance of dlrs 110 billion. (US-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With economic crises still roiling Asia, and
now Russia, Federal Reserve policy-makers Tuesday opted to hold
short-term interest rates unchanged. The Fed's monetary policy
panel _ the Federal Open Market Committee _ concluded a three-hour,
45-minute private meeting Tuesday by signaling it had made no
change in the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks. It's
been frozen at 5.5 percent since March 1997, when policy-makers
raised it a quarter-percentage point. Asia's troubles already have
spilled into the U.S. economy by sending America's trade deficit
soaring toward a record this year. The Federal Reserve is
monitoring the impact and many analysts believe it could prompt the
Fed to cut interest rates by next year. (US-FEDS-INTEREST RATES)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble slid an additional 7 percent Tuesday,
the day after it was effectively devalued, and President Boris
Yeltsin endured a political lashing at the hands of his
Communist-led opposition. In its latest decline, Russia's national
currency fell to 14.53 U.S. cents from 15.55 U.S. cents on Monday
in extremely light official trading. But the more telling street
rate was much lower, with the ruble ranging between 10 and 12-1/2
U.S. cents. The government's withdrawal of support for the
embattled ruble and the decision to allow it to fall as low as
10-1/2 cents, or 9.5 rubles to the dollar, before moving to prop it
up ensured a rise in inflation, since it will now take more rubles
to buy imported goods. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen AG intends to expand into
the commercial vehicle market with two new models by 2010 _ with or
without a partner, VW chairman Ferdinand Piech said in an interview
published Tuesday. ``We will broaden our commercial vehicle range
irrespective of whether VW enters additional cooperations or makes
further acquisitions,'' Piech was quoted as saying in the German
monthly magazine Capital. Volkswagen, Europe's largest automaker,
has a commercial-vehicle division currently that specializes in
light vans and minibuses. Piech has indicated before that he wants
to enter the market for medium and heavy trucks, and recent reports
have suggested VW was considering a deal with Volvo, one of the
world leaders in that area, as well as other companies.
(GERMANY-VOLKSWAGEN)
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss firm Ciba Specialty Chemicals
announced Tuesday it is shedding 1,100 jobs worldwide as part of a
restructuring program. The job losses, mainly in Switzerland,
Britain and the United States, will be covered as far as possible
by early retirement and internal transfers, but some workers will
be laid off, chairman Rolf A. Meyer told a news conference. The
company said it expects its program to boost operating income by
100 million Swiss francs (dlrs 67 million) a year starting in 1999.
Ciba reported an unexpectedly high net loss of 791 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 531 million) for the first half of 1998 after charges
related to its acquisition in March of Britain's Allied Colloids.

Wyclef Jean, the Mounties, Johnnie Cochran Jr., Benito Mussolini,
Joe Pesci and Carl Perkins &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sophia Loren was released from a hospital
Tuesday and will stay in New York for a month to rest.
	   The 63-year-old actress was treated for an irregular heartbeat,
publicist Beebe Kline said Tuesday.
	   Ms. Kline said she didn't know when Miss Loren was admitted, and
she refused to identify the hospital. She said Miss Loren flew to
New York from Geneva on Aug. 10 to visit a friend and grew
fatigued.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UNIVERSAL CITY, California (AP) _ Look for another singing
Taylor out there on the road.
	   Sally Taylor, the only daughter of James Taylor and Carly Simon,
played guitar and sang a solo as her father strummed along during
his show Monday night at Universal Amphitheatre in southern
California.
	   ``Sally's got a record coming out soon, so find it and buy it if
you can,'' proud papa Taylor advised the crowd.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) _ Prosecutors ran out of time to
try Bobby Unser on charges of careless driving and resisting
arrest.
	   The deadline for trying the three-time Indianapolis 500 winner
on the 1994 charges passed July 22, District Judge Richard Knowles
ruled Monday.
	   ``This is nothing more than the district attorney's office
trying to use a celebrity for publicity,'' Unser said. ``I thought
it was dead a long time ago.''
	   Unser was stopped in May 1994 at the Albuquerque airport,
allegedly for speeding in the departure area. Unser claimed the
officer dented his truck with a nightstick and cursed at him.
	   Unser also claimed the officer shoved him. He was accused of
shoving back.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Musician and producer Wyclef Jean denies he
pulled a gun on a magazine editor.
	   Jean said Jesse Washington, editor of the new music magazine
Blaze, concocted the story.
	   ``Personally, I feel like this is so he can do publicity to sell
the new magazine,'' Jean said Friday night on MTV. ``Wyclef Jean
pulls no gun. Wyclef Jean plays guitar. And I have love for my
family ... and I have respect for the media.''
	   Washington said Jean pointed a gun at his chest last month
because the magazine was about to publish a negative review of a
record Jean produced. Jean complained the review was based on an
unfinished version of the album.
	   Washington said he pulled the review until the magazine could
hear a complete version. He didn't report the incident to police.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GRANDE PRAIRIE, Alberta (AP) _ Will the Mounties get their
Molson?
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are trying to find a missing
9-meter (30-foot) high beer can.
	   The elephant-sized, inflatable balloon owned by Molson Breweries
disappeared from a baseball park in this northern Alberta city
following a tournament last weekend.
	   Neale Graham, Molson Breweries spokesman for northern Alberta,
said information leading to the return of the promotional white
balloon with a Molson Canadian logo would be rewarded.
	   ``You can't hide a balloon that's 30 feet tall in your
backyard,'' Graham said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WEST HARTFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ Two Rottweilers who were
recently defended by Johnnie Cochran Jr. may need all of O.J.
Simpson's Dream Team to get out of their latest mess.
	   Sheeba and Sampson, owned by the mother of basketball star Ray
Allen, were accused this weekend of attacking and perhaps killing a
neighbor's cat. Cochran, a family friend, recently defended Flora
Allen and the dogs against a barking complaint.
	   Karen Jones, the town's assistant animal control officer, said
the cat's owner, Arshad Quadri, watched as two Rottweilers ran onto
his outdoor deck about 7 p.m. Saturday and grabbed the cat, named
Izzy. The cat has not been found and is feared dead, Jones said.
	   In the case Cochran argued, the judge imposed a 9 p.m. to 8 a.m.
curfew on the animals. Cochran had asked for the dogs to be allowed
to stay out later at night. If the dogs are found guilty in the
latest incident, Allen could be fined dlrs 77.
	   Cochran was part of the ``Dream Team'' of lawyers who
successfully defended former football star O.J. Simpson against
murder charges in 1995.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SCARBOROUGH, England (AP) _ A black, boat-shaped hat owned by
Italy's World War II fascist leader Benito Mussolini sold to an
anonymous buyer at auction in this northern English town for 2,300
pounds (dlrs 3,600) Tuesday.
	   The felt hat was among a collection of books and private papers
taken from Mussolini's personal library at Villa Carpena, near his
native village of Predappio, by Royal Air Force pilot Richard Beck
at the end of the war.
	   Other items included in the sale were unpublished photographs of
Mussolini and his mistress, family photographs and personal
letters, H.C. Chapman and Son auctioneer Ian Pearce said Tuesday.
	   The 57 lots, put up for sale by the late Capt. Beck's family,
raised a total of 7,500 pounds (dlrs 12,000).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ This is one album by an actor that you're
supposed to laugh at.
	   Oscar winner Joe Pesci has been holed up in a recording studio
in New York City, making a comedy-musical album called ``Vincent
LaGuardia Gambini Sings Just for You.''
	   Assuming the character of his role in the 1992 film ``My Cousin
Vinny,'' the 55-year-old Pesci sings a rich potpourri, including a
Christmas song and a rap number.
	   The album will be released on Columbia Records, but it will not
mark Pesci's singing debut. In the 1960s, using the name Joe
Ritchie, he cut an album called ``Little Joe Sure Can Sing.'' It
flopped.
	   Pesci then concentrated on acting. It proved to be a smart
choice _ he won an Academy Award for best supporting actor in
``Goodfellas.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JACKSON, Tennessee (AP) _ ``Blue Suede Shoes'' is still making
money _ and for a good cause, too.
	   The son of the late rockabilly star Carl Perkins played ``Blue
Suede Shoes'' and some of his father's other hits during a
nine-hour telethon to raise money for his father's favorite
charity.
	   The show took in dlrs 300,000 for the Carl Perkins Center for
the Prevention of Child Abuse. The center serves children in
Tennessee.
	   Stan Perkins, who played drums in his father's band, highlighted
a lineup of local performers.
	   Perkins died in January of complications from a series of
strokes. He was 65.

Drought hits Vietnam, accompanied by epidemics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VINH LAM, Vietnam (AP) _ At midday, Vinh Lam looks like a ghost
town, the only movement a dust devil swirling in the distance.
	   This, like many villages across central Vietnam, is a place
under siege again. But it's not the devastation of the Vietnam War
this time _ it's a relentless two-faced enemy that can't be fought
face to face.
	   For the second long stretch this year, drought has set in. And
this time, it has been accompanied by an outbreak of dengue fever
as mosquitoes breed in the stagnant ponds that many rivers have
become.
	   ``It is very bad since we have to deal with two epidemics _
hunger and dengue,'' Nguyen Ba Thang, 49, deputy chief of one
commune in Vinh Lam, said from a makeshift bed in the town meeting
hall, which has been turned into a dengue clinic.
	   ``It is too much to bear. Even if rains come now, we've lost the
whole crop. And it is too late to plant now because in October, all
this area will be under water'' if the rainy season starts on
schedule.
	   Thang's entire family of six has contracted dengue, a
mosquito-borne virus that causes high fever, headaches and pain in
the joints. His 20-year-old daughter was released last week and was
back to tend to her 16-year-old brother.
	   The national Agriculture Department estimates 2.5 million people
in 14 provinces are short of water, with 345,000 acres (140,000
hectares) of rice paddies affected. That follows a drought earlier
in the year that caused an estimated dlrs 385 million in damage to
crops nationwide.
	   The El Nino weather phenomenon has largely been blamed for both,
although deforestation from slash-and-burn farming has contributed.
	   Much of central Vietnam has had little or no rain for two
months, even as the north has been plagued by floods spawned by
heavy rains upstream in China.
	   In the worst-hit provinces _ Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri _
there are miles-wide (kilometers-wide) stretches of cracked land
that should be filled with lush stretches of rice just turning
golden for harvest.
	   With only an average of a half-inch (1 cm) of rain total for
July and August, Quang Tri province is suffering what officials say
is the worst drought in 90 years and has reported 10,200 dengue
cases, most of them in the last three months.
	   Quang Tri already was poor, with the dlrs 120 per capita annual
income less than half of the national average. Officials say 20
percent of the people go hungry year-round, a figure that has risen
to between 50 percent and 60 percent during the drought.
	   All 99 reservoirs are dry after failing to get enough rain in
May to reach more than half capacity. Rainfall so far this year is
only about 10 percent of the annual average.
	   More than half of the 500,000 residents _ 80 percent of them
farmers _ are short of clean water. Three-quarters of the 40,000
acres (16,000 hectares) of rice have been affected, including
25,000 acres (10,000 hectares) that are virtually dead.
	   Although some streams look full, they are full of saltwater,
which is deadly to crops. The falling water table has allowed
encroachment by the ocean up to 20 miles (32 kms) inland.
	   With no crops to tend, the 5,400 residents of Vinh Lam mostly
stay inside to avoid the relentless sun that sends temperatures
soaring to nearly 100 degrees (38 C) every day with no relief in
sight.
	   Although it has eased in recent days, the outbreak of dengue has
sucked out even more of town's life. It reached epidemic
proportions earlier this month, with 121 cases reported in a
nine-day stretch. So far, there have been no fatalities.
	   Everyone agrees that things were worse during the war, when
Quang Tri was the site of some of the fiercest fighting. Unexploded
bombs and artillery shells remain a persistent problem.
	   But the drought and dengue are catching up fast.
	   Farmers recall how happy they were when the delayed onset of the
seasonal rains finally began in May, bringing some areas their
first substantial preciptitation since last November.
	   The relief was short-lived, and many feel trapped now _ reliant
on rice aid from the government and too poor to move elsewhere.

Hundreds of minorities being held in Afghanistan detention camp
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JALALABAD, Aghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army has
detained up to 1,000 members of Afghan minority groups at a desert
camp near the Pakistani border, a camp guard said. The detentions
seemed aimed at rooting out all remaining opposition to the
Taliban's hard-line rule.
	   A reporter and photographer from the Associated Press who
arrived at the camp, 15 kilometers (9 miles) outside the eastern
city of Jalalabad, were barred by the guard from entering or taking
pictures. But aid groups also confirmed that refugees were being
held there.
	   Taliban authorities gave conflicting and guarded explanations
Tuesday for the detentions of fleeing Afghans, which began last
week after the Taliban captured a key northern opposition
stronghold, Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   At a checkpoint along the main highway to Pakistan, the Taliban
guard, Hazrat Walli, scrutinized identification cards Tuesday. He
said he was on the lookout for names and addresses indicating the
bearers were ethnic Hazaras, Tajiks and Uzbeks fleeing from in a
southeast arc toward Pakistan.
	   The Taliban, like most Afghans, are ethnic Pashtuns. They have
been accused of harassing and killing minorities in a sweep across
Afghanistan that began in 1994.
	   Human rights groups are concerned about the latest detentions.
	   Amnesty International said it had heard reports that the Taliban
had detained thousands of minorities and sent them to Kandahar, a
Taliban stronghold 450 kilometers (280 miles) south of Kabul.
	   ``Any detainee who has not been actively involved in combat
should be released immediately,'' the London-based human rights
group said.
	   The Taliban control most of the country, including the capital
of Kabul. Recent victories against the northern-based opposition
alliance, consisting mostly of minority ethnic and religious
groups, have put them within reach of uniting all of Afghanistan
under their strict form of Islamic law.
	   Walli, the guard, said about 80 men had been sent to a jail in
nearby Jalalabad as authorities investigated whether they were
opposition fighters.
	   ``We sent about 1,000 others, including women and children, to
this camp,'' he said, gesturing to 100 or so mud huts on a stretch
of treeless desert 100 meters (yards) away. He would not let an AP
photographer take any pictures at the camp.
	   ``We provide them bread and rice every day,'' Walli said, who
like other guards was armed with a Kalashnikov rifle.
	   He said the detainees could not go on to Pakistan because ``they
have no money.'' It was not clear if they would be allowed to leave
the camp if they headed back into Afghanistan.
	   Justin Cockerell, head of the international Red Cross delegation
in Jalalabad, said his staff had been able to visit the camp and
found its inmates in good health. He said the U.N. World Food
Program and others were providing food and medicine to those in the
camp.
	   Jalalabad, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Pakistan, is the
largest town on the busy highway linking Kabul with Pakistan, which
for decades has been a haven for Afghans fleeing civil war.
	   Maulvi Satar-i-Azam, the governor of Jalalabad, angrily denied
Tuesday that 1,000 people were being detained or that the Taliban
were targeting minorities. He claimed only 60 families were in the
camp.
	   ``There are no differences between Pashtun and Uzbek and
Tajik,'' the Taliban governor said. ``We stop them so they do not
become tramps in other countries. They are poor. They can go all
over Afghanistan, but not out of the country.''

Rios sweeps away Bryan's upset bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Marcelo Rios showed why he's the world's
top-ranked player Tuesday, fighting off Bob Bryan's upset bid to
advance to the RCA Championships round of 16 with a 6-4, 6-4 sweep
of the NCAA singles champion from Stanford.
	   The Chilean's exceptional baseline game caught Bryan flat-footed
or heading the wrong direction many times in the 67-minute match.
Rios added nine aces and won 25 of 27 first-serve points.
	   After being ousted in the first round at Cincinnati last week,
Rios said he's using this tournament to prepare for the Aug.
31-Sept. 13 U.S. Open.
	   ``I'm trying to run with every point and trying to play as hard
as I can,'' Rios said after winning his ATP tour-leading 49th match
of the year. ``I was sick with an allergy, but I'm trying to come
through and trying to play as best I can. I think I'm going to be
OK for the U.S. Open.''
	   Of Bryan, Rios said, ``He played two good games and two bad
games. He's not really consistent in that part. I think he needs to
work a little bit on his movement. I think he can be a great
player.''
	   The 20-year-old from Camarillo, California was aware of his
shortcomings.
	   ``My game didn't feel great. Partly, that's because of him, but
I felt like I could have done better, so I'm not going to be too
satisfied with the score or anything,'' Bryan said.
	   ``I wasn't going out in awe today. I was actually giving it a
good effort to win that match, so that's why I'm a little
disappointed. But he's No. 1 in the world, and I can't hang my head
too much.''
	   Two of the other three seeded players who competed during the
day also advanced.
	   Thomas Muster of Austria, the 12th seed, defeated Paul Goldstein
6-2, 6-2. The tournament's 1994 champion, Wayne Ferreira of South
Africa (No. 14) topped Canada's Daniel Nestor, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Andea Gaudenzi of Italy, seeded 16th, fell 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 to
countryman Gianluca Pozzi.
	   Second-seeded Carlos Moya of Spain played Sweden's Thomas
Johansson in a night match.

	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Young Australian phenom Lleyton
Hewitt beat Armenian Sargis Sargsian 6-3, 6-4 and German Rainer
Schuttler scored an upset victory Tuesday in the Pilot Pen
International tennis tournament.
	   No. 9 seed Jan Siemerink, No. 10 Nicolas Kiefer, No. 11 Gustavo
Kuerten and Americans MaliVai Washington and Jeff Tarango also
advanced, all in straight sets.
	   Justin Gimelstob lost his first-round match to No. 16 Guillaume
Raoux 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
	   Hewitt, 17, who won the Australian Men's Hardcourt Championships
earlier this year, will face 11-time Grand Slam winner Pete
Sampras, the No. 1 seed, on Wednesday.
	   ``It should be a good experience,'' said Hewitt, who rebounded
after falling to 3-4 in his second set. ``Hopefully I will give him
a good match.''
	   Hewitt's victory in his hometown of Adelaide included a victory
over Andre Agassi, a player he idolized growing up. But the
Australian dismissed any connection that Agassi's victory over
Sampras in Toronto earlier this month might have on his own
second-round match.
	   ``I don't think an indirect win's really what I'm looking at
here,'' he said.
	   Wet weather and thunderstorms bedeviled the tourmanent for the
second straight day. While several matches were completed, the
marquee night match between No. 8 Goran Ivanisevic and Geoff Grant
was rescheduled for Wednesday. Grant was the lone winner Monday,
when rain washed out most of the matches. A severe thunderstorm
temporarily suspended the rest of play.
	   Schuttler ousted Frenchman Nicolas Escude, the No. 14 seed, 4-6,
6-4, 6-3. He picked up the victory Tuesday after having dropped his
first set Monday before weather postponed the rest of the match.
	   ``I think I was lucky that yesterday the rains came,'' he said.
	   Andrei Medvedev beat Eyal Erlich 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 with the help of
six aces and will face No. 3 Petr Korda in the second round.
	   Jeff Tarango ousted Lionel Roux 6-2, 6-2 using a strong serve to
face No. 2 Patrick Rafter. Tarango wasn't in danger of being
broken, and won 78 percent of his second serves.
	   Todd Woodbridge held on despite 10 double faults to beat
Marc-Kevin Goellner 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 and advanced to face No. 5 seed
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the tounament's defending champion. Alex
O'Brien, the 1996 Pilot Pen champ, advanced in straight sets, 6-3,
6-4, over Max Mirnyi. Davide Sanguinetti beat Jonathan Stark, 6-4,
7-5.

Musicologist Iosif Sava dies at age 65
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A well-known musicologist who
supported soprano Angela Gheorghiu and numerous other Romanian
artists has died. He was 65.
	   Iosif Sava died Tuesday of a blocked intestinal track after 40
days hospitalization, Bucharest Municipal Hospital said.
	   There was an immediate outpouring of sentiment for Sava, who
appeared on weekly television shows to promote classical music.
	   ``It's a great loss for music in general,'' said Adrian
Iorgulescu, head of the Composers and Musicologists Union. ```He
kept alive culture with an overwhelming energy and power.''
	   Sava graduated from Romania's conservatory of music, Ciprian
Porumbescu, in 1966. He lived in Bucharest.
	   Under dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Sava was the only person
promoting opera and classical music through his radio and TV
broadcasts. But Ceausescu forbade his shows in 1988, allowing only
patriotic songs that praised him and the Communist Party.
	   After the fall of communism, Sava hosted a weekly TV talk show
featuring artists and musicians.
	   Sava wrote 60 books about music, artists and composers and
published thousands of articles. But he was best known for
supporting generations of Romanian artists, including Gheorghiu,
soprano Lina Vaduva and violinist Silivia Marcovici.
	   Sava is to be buried Thursday at the Filantropia Jewish cemetery
in Bucharest.
	   He is survived by his wife.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Al Leiter shut down Colorado for eight innings
and the New York Mets got four homers as they started a busy week
by beating the Rockies 6-2 Tuesday night in the opener of a
twi-night doubleheader.
	   Edgardo Alfonzo, Todd Hundley, John Olerud and Brian McRae
homered for the Mets, who because of rainouts are playing seven
games in a four-day span.
	   Leiter (12-4) gave the bullpen some rest, winning for the ninth
time in 10 decisions. He allowed both runs and 10 hits, struck out
five and walked two.
	   New York, which began the night a half-game behind Chicago in
the National League wild-card race, has won seven of 10.
	   Pedro Astacio (11-12) gave up all six runs and six hits in five
innings, striking out seven. Colorado hurt him by stranding 12
runners _ including at least one in each of the first eight
innings.

Pinto, the wine maker and drinker, finally wins gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; will be UPDATED by 1400 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Antonio Pinto's formula for a
successful track career: draw your strength from some home-grown
wine.
	   It may not be everyone's winning equation, but it seems to work
for the small man from northern Portugal.
	   Pinto, 32, who owns a vineyard and says he drinks 4-5 bottles a
wine every week, added a gold medal that has been missing in his
career when he won the men's 10,000 meters on the opening day of
the European Championship on Tuesday.
	   Twice a winner of the London Marathon, Pinto was lacking a major
championship title.
	   ``I didn't want to end my career without a medal of some kind,''
Pinto said. ``Gold is all the better.
	   He finally earned it with clever race tactics. Pinto settled
into the slow early pace. With about six laps left in the race,
Pinto and the two Germans, Dieter Baumann and Stephane Franke,
moved ahead of the field,
	   With about 4 1/2 laps left, Pinto switched into a higher gear
and easily left the Germans behind to win in 27 minutes, 48.62
seconds.
	   Baumann, a former Olympic 5,000 champion, ended up with the
silver in 27:56.75, Franke took the bronze in 27:59.90.
	   Aleksandr Bagach of Ukraine won the gold medal in the men's shot
put _ but he wasn't sure he would actually collect it.
	   Bagach said the judges had accused him of putting weights in his
socks to make himself more stable. ``That's at least what they are
saying,'' said Bagach, who is no stranger to controversy.
	   He was stripped of the gold medal at the World Championship in
Athens last year after testing positive for the stimulant
ephedrine. He was also disqualified for drug use as far back as
1989.
	   Bagach's winning distance was 21.17 meters.
	   Oliver-Sven Buder of Germany won the silver at 20.98, while the
bronze went to another Ukrainian, Yuriy Belonog, at 20.92.
	   While there were only three finals on the opening day, the
second day Wednesday has six on the schedule: the women's javelin,
men's long jump, hammer throw, the men's and women's 100 meters and
the women's 10,000.
	   Three British sprinters led the field into the men's 100
semifinals. Dwain Chambers and Darren Campbell both won their heats
in 10.26 seconds, while Marlon Devonish won his in 10.28.
	   Geir Moen of Norway also advanced, along with Charalambos
Papadias of Greece, winner of the last heat in 10.31.
	   In the women's 100-meter qualifying, reigning champion Irina
Privalova of Russia, back after a serious hamstring injury, won her
heat in 11.22 seconds to advance.
	   Ekaterini Thanou of Greece qualified with the fastest time,
11.04, while Zhanna Pintusevich of Ukraine, the world champion,
clocked 11.06.
	   Kiril Sosunov of Russia led the field in the men's long jump
qualifying with a leap of 8.14.
	   The women's javelin should see a battle of two Finnish stars,
Olympic champion Heli Rantanen and world champion Trine Hattestad.
	   The men's hammer throw is likely to be a hit with the fans, with
three Hungarians in the running for the gold.

Report: Kiriyenko sends letter to Obuchi asking for loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has sent a
letter to Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi seeking the speedy
disbursement of U.S. dlrs 400 million in untied loans, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The loans are part of a dlrs 1.5 billion package that Japan is
extending through the World Bank to aid the troubled Russian
economy, the Yomiuri newspaper reported.
	   The daily, Japan's largest, quoted government sources, which it
did not name.
	   Of the dlrs 1.5 billion total, dlrs 400 million has already been
disbursed, with contracts signed for another dlrs 400 million, the
paper said.
	   The existence of the letter was made known Wednesday, the
Yomiuri said.
	   On Monday, Russia's government let the value of its currency,
the ruble, drop 34 percent. The devaluation came just weeks after
the International Monetary Fund cobbled together an aid package of
nearly dlrs 23 billion to stabilize Russia's financial markets.

Committee to face question of Afghanistan, Cambodia representation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ One of the first items facing the next
General Assembly session will be how Cambodia and Afghanistan are
represented at the world body since their seats were disputed at
the start of the last session.
	   So far, the U.N. credentials committee hasn't received any
formal applications from either Cambodia or Afghanistan to get a
seat at the General Assembly's 53rd session, which begins Sept. 9,
said U.N. spokesman Alex Taukatch.
	   That's expected to change as the date nears and factions vie for
the international recognition that a seat in the assembly confers.
Other countries with empty seats are Somalia and Yugoslavia.
	   Cambodia's seat has remained empty since strongman Hun Sen
deposed his co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a coup in July
1997. In the aftermath, the Cambodian mission split into factions
for and against Hun Sen, each demanding that it was legitimate
representative at the United Nations.
	   The U.N. credentials committee, led by Barbados, decided the
leave the seat empty. Last month, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party won parliamentary elections and is considering sharing some
of the government with opposition parties.
	   Afghanistan's seat continues to be held by a representative for
President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was ousted by the Taliban from
the Afghan capital, Kabul, in 1996.
	   In recent weeks, the Taliban, known for their extreme version of
Islam, have come closer to their goal of controlling all of
Afghanistan by making inroads against the northern-based minority
opposition with recent military victories in north Afghanistan.
	   Noorullah Zadran, the Taliban's representative in New York, said
his group submitted an application last year for the U.N. seat but
the credentials committee deferred action on it.
	   The representative said a new chief delegate was expected at the
end of the month. ``We'll wait until he gets here before making a
formal application,'' he said.
	   The credential process requires a government to submit names of
proposed representatives to the secretary-general who consults with
his legal office and forwards them to the credentials committee,
which is appointed at the beginning of the General Assemby session.
	   The committee examines the credentials of proposed
representatives and reports back to the Assembly, which makes the
final decision.
	   The U.N. chief has received a letter from the Taliban indicating
the militia's desire to be represented, but the Office of Legal
Affairs has advised that no formal action be taken on it because
the Taliban is not an internationally recognized government, U.N.
officials said.
	   The Taliban emerged in 1994 in southern Afghanistan. In the 90
percent or so of Afghanistan the Taliban control, women risk being
whipped by religious police if they venture out without a
head-to-toe veil known as a burqa, girls' schools have been closed
and men must grow beards.
	   The Taliban have pledged to bring peace to Afghanistan _ which
has been in conflict since a series of military and communist coups
in the 1960s _ by subduing enemies they describe as ``evil and
corrupt.'' Invading Soviet forces withdrew in 1989.

Brown in doubt for Bledisloe Cup match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout following squad announcement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's hopes of avoiding
an embarrassing 3-0 Bledisloe Cup series defeat against Australia
have received a setback with prop Olo Brown in doubt for the Aug.
29 match.
	   The All Blacks have lost four matches in a row including the
first two games of the traditional Bledisloe Cup series against the
Wallabies.
	   New Zealand returned home late Tuesday after the crushing
final-minute loss to South Africa last week to prepare for the
Bledisloe finale at the Sydney Football Stadium.
	   Coach John Hart said Brown was in doubt because of a lower back
problem which had not been helped by the flight from South Africa.
	   ``When he cooled down after the test against the Springboks he
was very sore,'' Hart said. ``It'll be no more than a 50-50 call if
he's to play.
	   ``Olo's now our most experienced player. I made him the
cornerstone of our game last week and he delivered.''
	   No. 8 Isitolo Maka, who had to be replaced in the second half in
Durban because of an extremely painful broken nose, is also in some
doubt.
	   Kees Meeuws was brought into the squad as cover for Brown, who
was also named in the 25-man squad.
	   Hart was delighted with the way newcomers Maka, Carl Hoeft and
lock Royce Willis performed in Durban and said the All Blacks'
scrummaging was probably the best in any test in South Africa in
the past three years.
	   Hart, meanwhile, was non-committal on suggestions from Britain
that retired No. 8 Zinzan Brooke could be tempted into making
himself available again for All Blacks rugby.
	   Hart pointed out the New Zealand Rugby Football Union had a
policy precluding players from playing for the All Blacks if they
were overseas-based and Brooke now was contracted to London's
Harlequins club.
	   ``But it appears he's feeling rejuvenated, is a stone lighter
and is free of injuries and there might be a message there for
us,'' Hart said.
	   ``Players do need rest and that's why I feel we will get some
benefits next year when our players have three months' rest over
the summer.''
	   New Zealand squad (two to be cut next week):
	   Backs: Christian Cullen, Joeli Vidiri, Jeff Wilson, Jonah Lomu,
Norman Berryman, Eroni Clarke, Mark Mayerhofler, Carlos Spencer,
Andrew Mehrtens, Justin Marshall, Mark Robinson.
	   Forwards: Isitolo Maka, Josh Kronfeld, Scott Robertson, Ian
Jones, Royce Willis, Robin Brooke, Charles Riechelmann, Taine
Randell (captain), Carl Hoeft, Kees Meeuws, Olo Brown, Craig Dowd,
Anton Oliver, Mark Hammett.

Australians told to ignore potential problems in KL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian athletes have been told not
to criticize potentially difficult conditions in Malaysia during
next month's Commonwealth Games.
	   The country's top Commonwealth Games official, Perry Crosswhite,
suggested that Malaysia may have difficulty coping with some
specific sport issues at the games as some of the officials are
former military officers.
	   There are indications that the games might prove testing for
international athletes with concerns over heat and pollution and
difficulties arising during a recent test competition. The games,
which will be contested between Sept. 11-21, will go ahead despite
persistent rumors that they were to be moved to Australia because
of organizational problems and the effects of the Asian currency
crisis.
	   Crosswhite said Australian competitors had been told, ``not to
be critical, not to be depressed or to find a way to give excuses
but just really get on with it and that's what we're saying to our
team. What you see is what you get and just get in with it and make
the best of it.
	   ``Whatever they find, everyone else finds, and that means that
everyone else has the same conditions.''
	   Crosswhite admitted there were likely to be problems during the
Games.
	   ``Things are going to happen and it will go wrong, there's going
to be little glitches here and there and we'll all work to make
sure those aren't major glitches,'' Crosswhite said.
	   ``Statistically the army is probably quite capable of doing it
but when it comes down to the specific sport issues such as the
technical officials and how a cycling points race is won and who
gives the scores ... that is where it comes down to specialized
areas which probably the military don't have any experience in.''
	   But he said Malaysia would do ``as good a job as they can'' next
month.
	   ``What I mean is they will do it as far as their standards are
concerned, they will do it very well,'' Crosswhite said. ``I think
if we judge it in respect of western standards we are going to have
to be very careful about that because we're used to running sports
events of this magnitude and they are not, I guess it's something
that is going to be new to them and we're going to have to be a bit
patient about.''

Report: Kiriyenko sends letter to Obuchi asking for loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES amount in lede graf; ADDs officials unavailable for
comment; Kiriyenko asking loans be disbursed by end of the year &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has sent a
letter to Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi seeking the speedy
disbursement of U.S. dlrs 800 million in untied loans, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The loans are part of a dlrs 1.5 billion package that Japan is
extending through the World Bank to aid the troubled Russian
economy, the Yomiuri newspaper reported.
	   The daily, Japan's largest, quoted government sources, which it
did not name. Officials at Japan's Foreign Ministry were not
immediately available to confirm the report.
	   Of the dlrs 1.5 billion total, dlrs 400 million has already been
disbursed, with contracts signed for another dlrs 400 million, the
paper said.
	   In the letter, Kiriyenko asked that the loans be disbursed by
the end of this year. The existence of the letter was made known
Wednesday, the Yomiuri said.
	   On Monday, Russia's government let the value of its currency,
the ruble, drop 34 percent. The devaluation came just weeks after
the International Monetary Fund cobbled together an aid package of
nearly dlrs 23 billion to stabilize Russia's financial markets.

IRA dissidents' denials infuriate grieving Northern Ireland

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Grieving Protestants and
Catholics have united against an IRA splinter group's admission
they planted the car bomb that killed 28 civilians but didn't mean
to hurt anybody.
	   The ``Real IRA,'' determined to smash the 13-month-old truce
being observed by the outlawed Irish Republican Army, claimed it
had accurately warned of the explosion Saturday in Omagh, 70 miles
(110 kilometers) west of Belfast. The attack also wounded 220 in
the most bloody single terrorist attack in Northern Ireland
history.
	   In dispute is whether its three calls to a Belfast television
station and a suicide hotline specified that the car was parked
near Omagh's courthouse. Those who took the calls say the
courthouse was specified. The bomb detonated about 400 yards
(meters) away among crowds evacuated away from the courthouse.
	   ``At no time was it said it was near the courthouse,'' said
Tuesday's statement from the anti-British Real IRA, which started
detonating car bombs in Northern Ireland towns in February.
	   The statement added that it ``was not our intention at any time
to kill any civilians. It was a commercial target, part of an
ongoing war against the Brits. We offer apologies to the
civilians.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office in London
issued its record of what was said based on audio tapes kept of the
calls. According to the record the first call said: ``There's a
bomb, courthouse, Omagh, main street, 500 pounds (225 kilograms),
explosion 30 minutes.''
	   Catholic politician Seamus Mallon said the group's statement was
``so callous and pathetic it scarcely deserves a reply.''
	   ``It is an attempt to excuse the inexcusable,'' said Mallon, who
is deputy first minister of Northern Ireland's new cross-community
Assembly, the cornerstone of April's sweeping agreement on how
Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   Community workers who organized a candlelit vigil to the dead
Tuesday night in Omagh said they felt sickened by the killers'
apology.
	   ``An apology is not much good to those who are dead or those who
have had their limbs severed,'' said vigil organizer Rozella Kelly.
``It is just coming from the lips and not from the heart.''
	   And Oliver Gibson, a Protestant politician whose niece Esther
was killed, called it ``a sickening, stupid, childish statement''
that only increased ``the grief and bereavement and agony of the
families who are trying to come to terms with their loss.''
	   The Real IRA's willingness to admit responsibility surprised
many observers, who had expected the renegade group to remain
silent until the public uproar faded. Some saw the group's use of
the phrase ``ongoing war'' as a threat to plant more bombs.
	   ``The fact that this organization is now admitting
responsibility at a time when public feeling is running so high is
intended to send a clear message to their supporters that,
irrespective of the consequences, the next bomb is on the way,''
said Ken Maginnis of the Ulster Unionists, the largest British
Protestant party.
	   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, first minister of the new
Assembly, will meet Wednesday night with Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern in Dublin to discuss plans to crack down on the group.
	   Wednesday will be dominated by funerals: in Omagh, its outlying
villages and the Irish Republic seaside town of Buncrana, whose
citizens will bury three boys aged 8 to 12. Irish President Mary
McAleese is expected to attend.
	   Authorities in both Belfast and Dublin ordered flags to fly at
half mast until Saturday _ the red, white and blue Union Jack north
of the border, the green, white and orange Irish tricolor to the
south.
	   The Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican and Methodist churches have
organized a minute's silence to be observed Saturday across Ireland
at 3:10 p.m., exactly one week after the car bomb tore into the
crowd.

Prison uprising by minors leaves one dead in northeastern Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A rebellion by more than 100 minors in
a juvenile detention center in northeastern Brazil Tuesday left one
person dead and several injured, police said.
	   The uprising took place in Paulista, 2,150 kilometers (1,330
miles) northeast of Sao Paulo, in the state of Pernambuco.
	   The Pernambuco state police department said 148 of the center's
180 inmates armed themselves with sticks and makeshift knives and
tried to stage a mass escape.
	   One boy who refused to take part in the attempted escape was
stabbed to death, police said.
	   The young inmates, aged 14 to 18, held one guard hostage but
released him unharmed when close to 100 riot troopers surrounded
the detention center.
	   Police said the three-hour rebellion ended after the inmates
realized they couldn't escape.
	   The detention center holds minors who have committed a wide
variety of crimes, ranging from burglary and armed robbery to
murder.

Kenyans bury Rose, the bombing victim known by world

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ While U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright lent support to those who survived terrorist attacks on
two East African embassies, Kenyans said goodbye to one who didn't:
the woman the world came knew as Rose.
	   Rose Wanjiku Mwangi, who was buried Tuesday, came to symbolize
the tragedy of the U.S. Embassy bombings that killed 257 people in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania _ and the frustrations of
rescuers who came so close to rescuing her.
	   ``I would like to apologize to the family since we tried to save
her but failed,'' said a teary-eyed Bob Nasser, a Kenyan Red Cross
volunteer who passed messages to 36-year-old Rose while she lay
beneath the wreckage. ``It was very difficult, as you saw.
	   ``I am sorry.''
	   The FBI and Kenyan and Tanzanian police are remaining mum on the
progress of their investigation into the Aug. 7 bombings
	   Albright, who flew back to Washington after stops in Dar es
Salaam and Nairobi on a whirlwind trip to show U.S. support, said
she was impressed by the investigative work done so far but didn't
expect answers overnight.
	   ``The investigation, I think, is proceeding fairly well, thanks
to a good degree of cooperation by Kenya and Tanzania,'' she said
in Nairobi.
	   As Rose was being mourned and buried, Albright toured the rubble
of the two bombed-out embassy sites on what she described as an
emotionally moving day.
	   ``It's a war. That's what it looks like,'' said a grim Albright,
remembering her childhood when her family fled Czechoslovakia only
to get caught in the nightmare of World War II in Britain. ``As
somebody who actually saw bombs in London during the war, that's
what it looked like.''
	   Albright pledged to seek emergency funding from Congress next
month to pay for re-establishing embassy operations in Tanzania and
Kenya and to compensate families that ``suffered irreparable
harm.'' She did not specify whether all African victims would be
included or suggest any amount, saying that was still being
calculated.
	   ``So many, so loved, have been lost,'' Albright said outside the
Nairobi embassy before leaving a wreath at a memorial next door
where the Ufundi Cooperative building, site of many of the Kenyan
deaths, once stood. She and U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, who
fought tears, walked arm in arm through the devastation.
	   After 1,500 people attended Mwangi's funeral in a Nairobi
church, hundreds of mourners _ elderly women, men, barefoot
children _ trekked to the burial at her small farm outside the
capital under the shadow of Ngong Hills, made famous by Danish
author Karen Blixen in ``Out of Africa.''
	   Acacia trees surrounded the grave, dug behind her uncompleted
house in Ongata Rongai, nine miles (14 kilometers) southwest of
Nairobi.
	   Rose was at work in the Ufundi Cooperative House when the bomb
exploded. Rescue workers fought for five days to free her from the
rubble of the collapsed building, but by the time they located her
early Aug. 12, she was dead.

Former presidential candidate is freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ A former presidential candidate jailed
for rebellion last year was freed in the first act by newly
inaugurated Paraguayan president Raul Cubas, a government official
said late Tuesday.
	   Former army Gen. Lino Oviedo was imprisoned late last year after
then-President Juan Carlos Wasmosy charged him with disobeying a
presidential order to resign as commander of the army.
	   Oviedo's detainment left the presidential elections in limbo for
some time, threatening the country's fledgling democracy.
Neighboring countries and the United States rushed to make sure the
country's elections went ahead as planned in May.
	   ``The general, at this time, should be in the company of his
family, enjoying his freedom and recuperating his civic and
political rights,'' said Justice Minister Angel R. Campos.
	   Newly inaugurated president, Raul Cubas, signed a decree late
Tuesday, freeing the one-time presidential candidate and overriding
a 10-year sentence handed down by a military tribunal earlier this
year, Campos said.
	   Cubas, originally Oviedo's running mate, later assumed the
candidacy for the presidency after the Supreme Court upheld
Oviedo's sentencing weeks before the May elections.
	   Cubas, a member of the long-ruling Colorado party, went on to
easily defeat Domingo Laino, the Democratic Alliance opposition
candidate.
	   Cubas was inaugurated as Paraguay's president Saturday, the
first transfer of power from one civilian to another since the end
of the country's 34-year military dictatorship.

Dollar falls in Tokyo, Japanese stocks higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States dollar slipped further against
the yen Wednesday on growing concern over possible government
intervention in the market to support the Japanese currency. Tokyo
stocks rose.
	   The dollar bought 144.05 yen as of 10 a.m. (0100 GMT), down 1.73
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
rate of 145.00 yen.
	   The dollar dropped against the Japanese currency overnight in
New York as rumors flew that Asian central banks were selling U.S.
Treasury bills to raise cash as a possible prelude to an attempt to
bolster the yen.
	   The U.S. currency's slide accelerated in Tokyo after the
Japanese Finance Ministry's vice finance minister for international
affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, hinted early Wednesday that monetary
authorities may act soon to prop up the yen.
	   ``For investors, the risk of a strong yen is getting higher.
They should be careful. The opportunity for yen-supportive
intervention is getting near,'' Sakakibara said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, shares were buoyed by
the yen's sudden strengthening and a surge overnight in U.S. stocks
traded on Wall Street.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 273.17 points,
or 1.81 percent, to 15,336.96 in the first half hour of trading. On
Tuesday, the average surged 269.13 points, or 1.82 percent.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 139.80 points Tuesday to
close at 8,714.65.
	   Early Wednesday, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues listed on the first section picked up 14.85 points, or 1.27
percent, to 1,181.57. The TOPIX rose 14.69 points, or 1.3 percent,
the previous day.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.180 percent from
Tuesday's finish of 1.155 yen, pushing its price down to 111.88 yen
from 112.07 yen.

Congo rebels promise to release hostages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Rebels in the Democratic Republic
of Congo on Wednesday promised to release 10 hostages _ including a
New Zealander, and two Swedes _ after freeing a prisoner the day
before.
	   Chris Lyons, of Auckland's Adventure World, New Zealand agent
for Guerba World Tours, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who abducted 11
people in Congo last week had released a Canadian woman. She made
her way to the Congo-Ugandan border.
	   ``She was released with a note from the rebels. It said if a
message from the rebels was read over the BBC World Service in
Africa in French, English and Swahili, that the other hostages
would be released.''
	   The first message in Swahili was read out over BBC World Service
on Wednesday morning.
	   ``It's great news,'' Lyons said. ``The message said the hostages
have been treated well. That's really positive.''
	   Douglas Kear, 66, of Hamilton, New Zealand, was one of four
Western tourists abducted in a mountain gorilla park 12 miles (20
km) inside the Democratic Republic of Congo-Uganda border last
week. Two Swedes are still held with him.
	   Seven Congolese _ two drivers, two rangers and three baggage
carriers _ were also abducted.
	   Guerba World Tours organized Kear's trip to Africa, but not the
park tour.
	   J.B. Wasswa, news editor of Uganda's New Vision newspaper, said
Ugandan police could not confirm if the hostages had been released.
	   Ugandan police sources said Tuesday they were unsure which group
was responsible for the abduction, or whether the hostages were
still alive. The kidnappers had made no demands.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With diplomatic efforts to end the
fighting in Kosovo at a standstill, Albanian authorities are
evacuating children and the elderly from villages near the border
with the Yugoslav province, an Albanian official said.
	   The evacuations came after three mortars fired from Kosovo
crossed the border and landed roughly one kilometer (about half a
mile) inside Albanian territory, a source with the Albanian
Interior Ministry said on condition of anonymity.
	   International powers fear that a crackdown by Serb-led
Yugoslavia on ethnic Albanian militants, which began on Feb. 28,
could spread into neighboring countries, including Albania.
	   U.S. diplomatic efforts in Kosovo, a Serbian province populated
overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians, failed to bring the two sides
together in the provincial capital of Pristina on Tuesday.
	   Envoy Christopher Hill, who has been meeting with Yugoslav and
ethnic Albanian leaders, reiterated that neither side should count
on achieving anything by force and should keep working at
negotiations.
	   ``The process has just begun. We have a long way to go, but it
has begun,'' he said.
	   The ethnic Albanians, under the direction of pacifist leader
Ibrahim Rugova, have refused to meet the Serbs unless they agree to
halt the violence. The chief Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani,
relayed that position in a letter to Serb negotiators.
	   ``I have pointed out the necessity that violence stop against
the Albanian civilian population and that the police repression''
is halted, Agani said.
	   Rugova also faces opposition within the Albanian community. The
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been battling Serb forces,
reject Rugova because he is against the use of violence to win
independence. They are not involved in the talks.
	   The Serbs criticized the Albanians for failing to show up for
Tuesday's talks, but said the invitation remained open.
	   Hill was to meet with the Serb negotiating team in Belgrade on
Thursday. Serbia is the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   While neither side reported flare-ups in Kosovo Tuesday, the
Serb's Media Center, based in Pristina, said several shells were
fired at the Yugoslav border from neighboring Albania.
	   The reports of border incidents come as roughly 1,700 troops
from 14 different nations are in the Albanian capital, Tirana,
participating in a five-day exercise designed to show NATO's
commitment to preventing the violence from spreading into the rest
of the southern Balkans.
	   About 200 U.S. Marines and Navy SEAL commandos who arrived for
the exercises were sent Sunday along with Albanian police to the
U.S. embassy staff housing complex in Tirana, after U.S. officials
learned of a possible terrorist attack similar to the embassy
bombings that killed 257 people in Africa, U.S. officials said.

Canada defeats U.S., 31-14 wins berth in Wales world Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Led by top scorer Gareth Rees,
the Canada national rugby union team defeated the United States
31-14 Tuesday and won a berth in the 1999 World Cup in Wales.
	   Right wing Jason Hall opened the scoring for Canada with a try
following in the seventh minute.
	   The U.S. Eagles committed glaring mistakes in handling which
allowed the Canadians to gain in confidence.
	   Rees scored two penalties and converted tries by Julian Loveday
and John Graf to give Canada a comfortable 25-0 lead by halftime.
	   The Eagles came back in the second half on the strength of their
forwards scored two tries, one by flanker Dave Hodges and the other
by scrum half Kevin Dalzell, both converted by Stevens.
	   But Rees scored two more penalties for a 31-14 final score.
	   Host Argentina meets Uruguay later Tuesday.
	   In the first round, Canada defeated Uruguay 38-15 and Argentina
trounced the United States 52-24.
	   On Saturday, Uruguay will play the United States and Argentina
will face Canada in the final round of the tournament that
qualifies three teams for the Wales World Cup.

UNSCOM plotting course on how to proceed after council acts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to UPDATE with Annan to discuss possible role with
council &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Faced with his envoy's failed mission to
Baghdad, Kofi Annan is now willing to discuss with the Security
Council a possible role for himself in trying to break the crisis
over weapons inspections in Iraq, his spokesman says.
	   The secretary-general is prepared to ``see what it is they want
him to do and whether he thinks it will make a difference,'' Fred
Eckhard said Tuesday.
	   Neither Annan nor the Security Council appeared to be in a hurry
to take this next step, however, with both apparently content to
let Iraq get the message that sanctions won't be lifted unless
inspectors can do their jobs.
	   Inspectors have held off conducting any searches since Iraq
announced on Aug. 5 announcement that it was freezing cooperation
with the United Nations.
	   The weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction before the council will lift harsh
sanctions imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990,
touching off the Gulf War.
	   Annan's envoy, Prakash Shah, announced Tuesday that he had
failed to negotiate a resumption of cooperation after two meetings
with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. He said he was
returning to New York on Wednesday and was expected to brief the
council soon thereafter.
	   The council on Monday called for Annan's involvement in letters
to the top weapons inspectors to encourage them to go about their
work in the face of Iraq's decision. The inspectors have said the
decision has made their work virtually impossible.
	   U.S. ambassador Bill Richardson asked Annan to personally
intervene, saying Monday ``we believe the secretary-general needs
to once again use his skills and diplomacy to deal with this
problem.''
	   There were, however, serious questions about whether that
Annan's intervention alone could persuade Iraq to renege on its
decision to freeze cooperation with inspectors.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, has said repeatedly that
his country won't reverse its decision unless the council makes
swift movement toward lifting the sanctions.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions and says the
United States is manipulating inspections to maintain the sanctions
regime.
	   Annan brokered a February accord that defused the last crisis
with Iraq _ over inspectors' access to presidential palaces. But at
the time, he had U.S. and British threats of force to back his
diplomatic efforts.
	   This time neither Washington nor London has made such clear
threats, though Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said the
United States reserved the right to use force if necessary.
	   Annan has called for a comprehensive review of sanctions and
sent Shah to try to sway the Iraqi side.
	   Annan was vacationing in Mali and his native Ghana and wasn't
due back in New York until Sept. 4.
	   He has approved of the council's strategy so far, Eckhard said.
	   ``I think basically he's been pleased that the approach being
taken by the council is low-key rather than confrontational with
military threats,'' Eckhard said. ``On the other hand, he can't
exclude that the council would once again consider the military
option.
	   ``But for the moment the emphasis is on the diplomatic side,''
Eckhard said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Satoshi Watanabe and his fellow revolutionaries
have a gripe most Japanese can relate to.
	   Writing Japanese is just too complicated, he says. The thousands
of characters that must be learned just to read the evening paper
is too much. It's time consuming, inefficient.
	   So, Watanabe says, Japan should switch to something simpler,
something more along the lines of an alphabet.
	   That's where he loses his audience. While most Japanese agree
the writing system is a strain, hardly anyone would dream of
changing things.
	   Blind momentum, scoffs Watanabe.
	   ``No matter how inconvenient, people have grown accustomed to
things the way they are,'' said Watanabe, who is a leading member
of the Kanamoji-kai, a venerable _ but tiny _ group calling for
Japan to stop using Chinese characters.
	   Japan imported Chinese characters _ called ``kanji'' _ more than
a millennium ago because it had no writing system of its own. The
Chinese lexicon is difficult to begin with, but its use has been
further complicated in Japan by the need to mold it to local
pronunciations.
	   Today, writing a simple letter in Japanese means juggling two
phonetic alphabets of nearly 50 characters each with the kanji,
some of which are so complex it almost takes an artist's sense of
composition to pen them. For example, the character for sea bass,
pronounced ``suzuki'' in Japanese, has 27 strokes.
	   Exhaustive dictionaries can list as many as 50,000 Chinese
characters. And that's only part of the picture. Even a simple
character like the one meaning ``life'' can be read at least seven
different ways and has several different meanings depending on
context.
	   Fortunately, a well-educated adult can get by with knowledge of
a mere 3,000 kanji. The minimum needed to read a newspaper is about
2,000.
	   But even getting to that level requires no small effort.
	   According to the Education Ministry, by the end of sixth grade
Japanese children are required to know about 1,000 characters.
Kanji study, though usually mixed in with grammar and reading
lessons, takes up a great deal of language classes and after-school
study time.
	   And learning kanji doesn't stop at school.
	   Throughout life, the Japanese are judged by their handwriting,
their ability to use the proper kanji combinations, the faux pas of
each missed stroke.
	   ``No matter how much we learn, it's never enough,'' said Hiroshi
Tatsuoka, a linguist at Tokyo's prestigious Waseda University.
	   Kanji teaching, not surprisingly, is a lucrative industry.
	   Classes and seminars on the finer points of Chinese characters
abound. Penmanship schools for adults are a well-established
business. Self-help books for the kanji-challenged can be found in
just about any bookstore.
	   The spread of computers and word processors with kanji software
has been a godsend for the legions of Japanese who lack confidence
in their handwriting skills.
	   To write Japanese electronically, you type in the sound of a
Chinese character using one of the phonetic alphabets. The computer
provides a list of characters or character combinations matching
that sound, and you select which one to use.
	   Experts say even that is a mixed blessing.
	   ``Computers help people recognize characters'' in order to
select the right one, said Kyoko Iwahashi, spokeswoman for the
Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation. ``But these people can
also lose their ability to actually write them.''
	   Flaws notwithstanding, kanji has its defenders.
	   Biten Yasumoto, a professor of linguistic psychology at Tokyo's
Sanno University, said that once memorized, kanji give readers a
more direct shot of meaning than words written with an alphabet.
	   This is partly because many characters are pictographs, devised
to symbolically represent the word they stand for. The kanji for
mountain looks like a mountain _ at least to the trained eye.
	   ``Lots of people do complain about how complex kanji is,''
Yasumoto said. ``But we can understand the meaning of words easily
at a glance, even if we can't pronounce them.''
	   Others say the real reason Japan should stick with kanji has
nothing to do with its pragmatic value. For them, the true worth of
kanji is simply its beauty.
	   ``I really like seeing crisp kanji written in a neat row,'' said
Mari Shimizu, an office worker who practices calligraphy.

<TEXT>
	   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway (AP) _ Scientists know little about one of
the deadliest viruses of this century, the Spanish Flu that killed
at least 20 million people shortly after World War I
	   But a group of scientists will open a frozen mass grave from
that era on the Arctic island of Longyearbyen in an attempt to
learn the virus' secrets by taking tissue samples from six young
victims who have lain frozen in graves blasted into the permafrost
80 years ago.
	   The townspeople of Longyearbyen, after a year of debates, seem
at ease with the plan to open the grave site near their homes.
	   Even though there is virtually no chance of finding a living
virus _ the organisms die quickly _ the scientific team is taking
no chances of releasing the pestilence when they open the graves.
The researchers, from Canada, the United States, Britain and
Norway, expect to start digging on Friday and reach the bodies
about 10 days later.
	   The graves will be covered with an inflatable tent, with
airlocks like a space station. Researchers will wear protective
suits, use outside air supplies and take an experimental drug that
has proved successful in tests against virus infections.
	   ``We are doing all this to protect against the infinitesimal
chance that there is an infectious virus down there,'' said Rod
Daniels, a virologist at the British National Institute of Medical
Research. ``Nothing will escape.''
	   On Tuesday, the researchers invited residents of Longyearbyen to
a meeting to explain the work.
	   Less than 50 people, many of them journalists, showed up despite
previous strong interest in the issue in this mining outpost of
1,200 people, north of the Norwegian mainland and just 950
kilometers (590 miles) from the North Pole. None of the townspeople
asked any questions.
	   Torbein Kvil Gaust, a 27-year-old student, said there had
already been a lot of debate over the past year, and people were
confident. ``I don't think people are afraid,'' he said.
	   Kirsty Duncan, a Canadian who leads the team, said town meetings
last year were full and that the had met with townspeople during a
preliminary study of the graves, marked by a row of six white
crosses in a tiny cemetery.
	   For Duncan, a 31-year-old professor at the universities of
Windsor and Toronto, plans to exhume the bodies started five years
ago. She read of the terrible epidemic and that the scientists
still did not know what it was. The disease killed more people in
1918-19 than all the fighting that had occured in the just-ended
World War I.
	   ``I was horrified,'' she told the townspeople. ``I was
determined to find out the secrets of the 1918 flu.''
	   The virus was first reported at what is now Fort Riley, Kansas.
It spread quickly to Europe when American troops were deployed in
war. From there, it spread to the rest of the world, even places as
remote Longyearbyen in the Norwegian Svalbard Archipelago.
	   Victims suffered a sudden fever, chills, headache, malaise,
muscle pain, pneumonia and rapid death.
	   Duncan managed to find the graves of four coal miners who died
on the island in the first week of October, 1918, and probably were
frozen ever since.
	   The team hopes samples taken from the bodies will provide them
with genetic profile of the virus. That can help develop better
vaccines, and test whether modern medicines could have stopped the
killer.
	   ``The main purpose of this project is to capture and rebuild the
genetic constitution of this virus,'' Tom Bergan, a Norwegian
physician on the team, said Tuesday.
	   The samples will be shipped to four different laboratories for
analysis that could take 1.5 years.
	   The six victims were young, aged 18 to 29. Most were bachelors
and had no descendants. Their distant families did not object to
the project.
	   One of the miners, Kristian Hansen, had a daughter, who was 3
when he died of the virus at age 29. Bergan said the daughter ``had
no problems with the project because it could render an important
service for humanity.''

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ The Inter American Press Association
wrapped up a two-day meeting Tuesday by launching a campaign to
change laws throughout the hemisphere that shield governments from
media scrutiny.
	   During their session this week, IAPA newspaper editors and
jurists reviewed loosely designed laws that give courts great
leeway to convict journalists and their companies of criminal
violations.
	   IAPA said it would work to incorporate into each country's body
of laws the spirit of the Chapultepec Declaration, which
establishes guidelines for protecting freedom of expression and of
the press.
	   ``Freedom of the press is not something authorities grant; it is
an inalienable right of the people,'' states the first of 10
principles forged in Mexico City in 1994.
	   While the principles condemn terrorism and assassination of
journalists, they are intended mainly to prevent governments from
impeding the press in more subtle ways.
	   The IAPA cited several problems with laws in the region:
	   _The lack of precise definition of terms such as privacy,
intimacy, private life and self-image, giving judges broad
discretionary power.
	   _The use of ``contempt'' laws that make journalists and their
companies liable for alleged offenses against institutions or
political figures.
	   _Government attempts to hide information and deny the right to
petition for it.
	   The IAPA also noted the impunity often enjoyed by those
responsible for killing journalists, and criticized officials who
shut down news media.
	   The press association said it will organize forums in each
country to prepare campaigns to change legislation constraining
press freedoms.

Reputed leader of ``Real IRA'' denies involvement in bomb blast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The reputed leader of the ``Real IRA,'' a
Republican dissident group which has claimed responsibility for the
Omagh bombing, has denied he had anything to do with it, The Mirror
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Michael McKevitt is thought to be the commander of the Real IRA
and is the common-law husband of Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, sister
of the martyred IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands and a prominent
member of the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, the reputed
political wing of the Real IRA.
	   The Mirror, Britain's second-largest selling tabloid, said
McKevitt told his priest that he was ``completely innocent'' and
had ``neither hand, act nor part'' in the Omagh bombing.
	   Five suspects, believed to be members of the Real IRA, have been
arrested in connection with Saturday's blast in Omagh, 70 miles
east of Belfast, which killed 28 and injured 220 in the most bloody
single terrorist attack in Northern Ireland history.
	   The Mirror reported that Father Desmond Campbell received a
phone call from McKevitt and Sands-McKevitt after giving a sermon
Tuesday and that the couple were in hiding for fear of attacks
against themselves and their children from townspeople who were
reportedly planning to picket their home.
	   ``I had said during the Mass that it was very disturbing to know
the chief suspect in the bomb attack was living in my parish. I
believe it is because of this that they called me,'' the newspaper
quoted Campbell as saying.
	   Campbell said Sands-McKevitt was crying as she spoke of her
fears for her children before her husband took the phone from her,
the newspaper said.
	   ``The first I heard of this was when I heard it on the news. I
want to make it clear I had nothing to do with it,'' the newspaper
quoted McKevitt as saying to the priest.

The principles of the Chapultepec Declaration

 &UR; With IAPA-Press Law &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   These are the 10 principles of press freedom included in the
Chapultepec Declaration reviewed this week in San Jose, Costa Rica,
by representatives of the Inter American Press Association.
	   1. No people or society can be free without freedom of
expression and of the press. The exercise of this freedom is not
something authorities grant, it is an inalienable right of the
people.
	   2. Every person has the right to seek and receive information,
express opinions and disseminate them freely. No one may restrict
or deny these rights.
	   3. The authorities must be compelled by law to make available in
a timely and reasonable manner the information generated by the
public sector. No journalist may be forced to reveal his or her
sources of information.
	   4. Freedom of expression and of the press are severely limited
by murder, terrorism, kidnapping, intimidation, the unjust
imprisonment of journalists, the destruction of facilities,
violence of any kind and impunity for perpetrators. Such acts must
be investigated promptly and punished harshly.
	   5. Prior censorship, restrictions on the circulation of the
media or dissemination of their reports, arbitrary management of
information, the imposition of obstacles to the free flow of news,
and restrictions on the activities and movements of journalists
directly contradict freedom of the press.
	   6. The media and journalists should neither be discriminated
against nor favored because of what they write or say.
	   7. Tariff and exchange policies, licenses for the importation of
paper or news gathering equipment, the assigning of radio and
television frequencies and the granting or withdrawal of government
advertising may not be used to reward or punish the media or
individual journalists.
	   8. The membership of journalists in guilds, their affiliation to
professional and trade associations and the affiliation of the
media with business groups must be strictly voluntary.
	   9. The credibility of the press is linked to its commitment to
truth, to the pursuit of accuracy, fairness and objectivity and to
the clear distinction between news and advertising. The attainment
of these goals and the respect for ethical and professional values
may not be imposed. These are the exclusive responsibility of
journalists and the media. In a free society, it is public opinion
that rewards or punishes.
	   10. No news medium nor journalist may be punished for publishing
the truth or criticizing or denouncing the government.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Japanese Foreign Ministry comment in 4th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has sent a
letter to Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi seeking the speedy
disbursement of U.S. dlrs 800 million in untied loans, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The loans are part of a dlrs 1.5 billion package that Japan is
extending through the World Bank to aid the troubled Russian
economy, the Yomiuri newspaper reported.
	   The daily, Japan's largest, quoted government sources, which it
did not name.
	   Shuichi Tokuda, an official in the Russian Division of Japan's
Foreign Ministry, confirmed that Kiriyenko sent a letter concerning
untied loans, but would provide no details.
	   Of the dlrs 1.5 billion total, dlrs 400 million has already been
disbursed, with contracts signed for another dlrs 400 million, the
paper said.
	   In the letter, Kiriyenko asked that the loans be disbursed by
the end of this year. The existence of the letter was made known
Wednesday, the Yomiuri said.
	   On Monday, Russia's government let the value of its currency,
the ruble, drop 34 percent. The devaluation came just weeks after
the International Monetary Fund cobbled together an aid package of
nearly dlrs 23 billion to stabilize Russia's financial markets.

MetroStars defeat Rapids 4-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Eduardo Hurtado scored the
go-ahead goal in the 49th minute Tuesday night and the New York-New
Jersey MetroStars went on to beat the Colorado Rapids 4-1 in Major
League Soccer.
	   The MetroStars (14-11) remained second in the East Division with
38 points. Colorado (11-14), which lost defender David Vaudreil to
a red card in the 34th minute, remained in third in the West with
29 points.
	   Hurtado's goal came after he took a pass from Giovanni Savarese
and rolled a low shot through the legs of Peter Vermes and off the
fingertips of goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann. It was the 10th goal of
the season for Hurtado.
	   Tab Ramos put the MetroStars ahead in the 27th minute off a
backpass from Hurtado, scoring on a deflected shot.
	   Ross Paule volleyed a cross from Paul Bravo past goalkeeper Tim
Howard two minutes later to tie it.
	   Giovanni Savarese added a pair of goals for the MetroStars in
the 87th and 89th minutes, raising his season total to 12.
	   Howard, a 19-year old rookie, had five saves. He made his MLS
debut while Tony Meola, who had played every minute of every game,
served a suspension stemming from his behavior in Saturday's 3-1
loss at Miami.

<TEXT>
	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Raging waters two stories high submerged
tourist sites on an island in northeastern China on Tuesday, and
soldiers struggled to keep the rain-swollen river out of a key
industrial center.
	   The Songhua River washed over its banks in Harbin and threatened
to devastate the provincial capital of 9 million. Trying to contain
the deluge, hundreds of troops built a 1.5-meter (5-foot-high)
restraining wall of metal rods and wood planks.
	   With the Songhua at a record 120.44 meters (397 1/2 feet) and
rising, Harbin braced for potentially its worst floods in 50 years.
The river was expected to continue to rise until reaching a new
crest on Friday.
	   Flood waters broke through embankments outside the city and
threatened the city's airport, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Families fled low-lying areas of Harbin to camp in roadside
tents.
	   The Songhua rolled over Sun Island, leaving just the bridge that
connects it to Harbin poking above the waters. Soldiers evacuated
more than 700 families and 52 businesses from the island, which is
famed for its winter festival. Fifty-two endangered Siberian tigers
were also moved from a breeding center on the island.
	   As more than 260,000 people worked to protect Harbin, millions
manned dikes along the Yangtze River in central China as it crested
for the sixth time this summer.
	   Embankments, fortified by weeks of sandbagging, held back the
record-high waters as the flood crest passed through, state media
reported. Officials apparently put aside plans to dynamite dikes to
save cities downstream.
	   Seasonal rains that began earlier and fell heavier than usual
have produced the worst flooding on the Yangtze in 44 years. More
than 2,000 people have died nationwide in the flooding and millions
have been left homeless.
	   Vice Premier Li Lanqing convened a meeting Tuesday of the State
Council to discuss ways to prevent outbreaks of disease in flooded
areas.
	   China Central Television showed medical teams examining flood
victims, distributing medicine and putting purification chemicals
in vats of drinking water.
	   Floodwaters have already washed over roads and rail lines
connecting Harbin with Daqing, a city of 2.3 million people next to
the oil field.
	   More than 270,000 soldiers, oil workers and other civilians were
working night and day to prevent the Nen River from overwhelming
the oil field.
	   The government ordered soldiers to build a new dike to protect
the No. 7 oil production base, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported. The base was endangered by possible breaches of the
Nanyin Reservoir, whose water on Tuesday was 24 centimeters (less
than 10 inches) below the danger mark, Xinhua said.
	   Meanwhile, a 15-kilometer (9-mile-long) dike, the last defense
protecting Daqing city's 2.4 million people, was completed on
Tuesday.

	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Hideki Irabu, the only Yankees
pitcher to lose in the past two weeks, will miss his scheduled
start Thursday because of a sore instep.
	   Irabu (11-6) was hit in the foot by Tom Goodwin's liner last
Saturday against Texas. The Yankees said he is not expected to miss
more than one start and picked Mike Buddie (3-0) to replace him
against Minnesota on Thursday.
	   Irabu lost to Oakland on Aug. 5 and to Texas last Saturday.
Going into Tuesday night's game at Kansas City, no other Yankees
pitcher has lost since Aug. 2 at Seattle.

Newspaper: FBI raids hotel in connection with embassy bombing

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Acting on information obtained from a
suspect in custody in connection with the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy, FBI agents raided a Nairobi hotel where the bomb was
believed to have been made, a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The Daily Nation said the raid on the Hilltop Hotel on Accra
Road was carried out Tuesday morning by 15 FBI agents and six
Kenyan detectives wearing bulletproof vests who carried away
several boxes.
	   The newspaper cited unidentified sources saying a bomb made of
800 kilograms of TNT kilograms was assembled over a period of
several days in rooms 102 and 107 of the hotel.
	   The newspaper said the agents were acting on information
provided by Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who was arrested Aug. 7 in
Pakistan and returned Aug. 14 to Kenyan authorities investigating
the cause of the Aug. 7 blast.
	   The huge explosion rocked the embassy located at a busy
intersection in downtown Nairobi, killing 247 people, among them 12
Americans.
	   Odeh reportedly stayed at the hotel along with two Pakistanis,
and Egyptian and a Saudi national who left early Aug. 7.
	   Odeh reportedly implicated Saudi businessman and dissident Osama
bin laden, who is now living in Afghanistan, in the blast.
	   There appeared to be some confusion regarding the name and
location of the hotel.
	   There is no listing in the Nairobi telephone directory for
Hilltop Hotel, but there is a Hilltop Lodge on Cross Road, just off
Accra Road. Both are located less than a kilometer (1/2 mile) from
the embassy site.
	   Contacted by telephone, a man who identified himself as Omar
Jana, night clerk at the Hilltop Lodge, said police had raided the
hotel Tuesday and arrested manager James Nganga and taken away the
hotel's guest register.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain comment from the
police or FBI agents in Nairobi investigating the blast.

Police suspend raid on Hyundai pending last-ditch negotiations

	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ With police standing by in case they
fail, government negotiators made a last-ditch attempt Wednesday to
end a month-long strike at Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's largest
automaker.
	   Some 15,000 riot police were poised to forcibly disperse
striking workers who have barricaded themselves inside Hyundai's
sprawling plant at Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of
Seoul.
	   ``We're waiting for the outcome of the negotiations,'' one
senior police officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   A five-member negotiating team from President Kim Dae-jung's
governing party met separately with Hyundai's managers and union
leaders overnight behind closed doors to try to defuse the tension.
	   The team, led by Rep. Noh Mu-hyun, a party vice president,
called a joint meeting of both sides Wednesday to try to find
common ground.
	   ``The prospects are not so bright but we have to do our best
until the last moment,'' the national Yonhap News Agency quoted one
unidentified delegate as saying.
	   After mediation efforts by Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho failed
Tuesday, police moved to the gates of the plant, where 5,000
workers and their families have been encamped since July 20.
	   But the police withdrew late Tuesday after the governing party
delegation flew in for a new round of mediation.
	   Hyundai's 26,000-member union wants the company to take back
1,600 workers it fired July 31 because of sharply falling domestic
sales.
	   The company, which earlier got rid of 6,100 workers by offering
them enhanced early retirement packages, insists it has to reduce
its work force in line with slumping demand for its cars.
	   State-owned KBS-TV reported that in overnight negotiations, the
union repeated its earlier proposal that the company cancel its
layoff plans in exchange for workers' pay cuts, a proposal already
rejected by management.
	   In Seoul, chief presidential spokesman Park Ji-won said
Wednesday that it ``is the government's firm position that layoffs,
allowed by law, must be accepted by the union.''
	   Workers blocked all eight gates to the plant, reinforcing
barricades with hundreds of brand-new passenger cars and trucks
loaded with oxygen tanks, which they threatened to explode if
police move in.
	   A flexible labor market is a key part of reforms South Korea
promised to make in return for a dlrs 58 billion bailout package by
the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   The number of jobless people has since doubled to 1.5 million
and is expected to reach 2 million by year's end, a shock to South
Korean workers long accustomed to lifetime employment.

Congo rebels promise to release hostages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMENDS last sentence to clarify that kidnappers made no
demands aside from broadcast &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Rebels in the Democratic Republic
of Congo on Wednesday promised to release 10 hostages _ including a
New Zealander, and two Swedes _ after freeing a prisoner the day
before.
	   Chris Lyons, of Auckland's Adventure World, New Zealand agent
for Guerba World Tours, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who abducted 11
people in Congo last week had released a Canadian woman. She made
her way to the Congo-Ugandan border.
	   ``She was released with a note from the rebels. It said if a
message from the rebels was read over the BBC World Service in
Africa in French, English and Swahili, that the other hostages
would be released.''
	   The first message in Swahili was read out over BBC World Service
on Wednesday morning.
	   ``It's great news,'' Lyons said. ``The message said the hostages
have been treated well. That's really positive.''
	   Douglas Kear, 66, of Hamilton, New Zealand, was one of four
Western tourists abducted in a mountain gorilla park 12 miles (20
km) inside the Democratic Republic of Congo-Uganda border last
week. Two Swedes are still held with him.
	   Seven Congolese _ two drivers, two rangers and three baggage
carriers _ were also abducted.
	   Guerba World Tours organized Kear's trip to Africa, but not the
park tour.
	   J.B. Wasswa, news editor of Uganda's New Vision newspaper, said
Ugandan police could not confirm if the hostages had been released.
	   Ugandan police sources said Tuesday they were unsure which group
was responsible for the abduction, or whether the hostages were
still alive. The kidnappers had made no demands except for the
broadcast.

Official: Dominica issued Skase passport because of a mistake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Fugitive Australian businessman
Christopher Skase got a business passport from the Commonwealth of
Dominica because of a bureaucratic mistake, an official told a
newspaper Wednesday.
	   The Australian newspaper quoted Dominican Finance Minister
Julius Timothy, who is responsible for the tiny Caribbean nation's
business migration program, as saying that the passport was issued
as an ``oversight.''
	   Dominica's Ministry of Legal Affairs, Immigration and Labor
received a general alert from the Australian government last May,
describing Skase as a fugitive and indicating he might approach
Dominica seeking citizenship, the newspaper said.
	   The alert requested that the country concerned contact
Australian authorities.
	   ``It was a mistake, an oversight by our Ministry of Legal
Affairs, but somehow they did not tie the two together,'' Timothy
was quoted as saying.
	   Dominica was discussing Skase's future with the Australian
authorities, The Australian said.
	   Since 1994, Australia has been seeking Skase's extradition from
Mallorca, Spain, where he fled after being charged in 1992 in
relation to the U.S. dlrs 930 million (1.5 billion Australian
dollars) collapse of his Qintex group of companies.
	   He avoided the 1994 extradition attempt when a Spanish court
ruled that he was too ill to return to Australia.
	   After strenuous lobbying from Australia, Spain in July refused
to extend Skase's residency permit, forcing him to seek refuge
elsewhere to avoid deportation to Australia.

Dollar falls in Tokyo, Japanese stocks higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with markets' morning close, dollar-yen rate, quote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese yen gained against the U.S. dollar
Wednesday on growing concern over possible government intervention
in the market to support the Japanese currency. Tokyo stocks rose
in morning trading.
	   The yen rose to 144.35 to the dollar at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT), up
1.43 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also stronger than its late
New York rate of 145.00 yen.
	   The Japanese currency strengthened against the dollar overnight
in New York as rumors flew that Asian central banks were selling
U.S. Treasury bills to raise cash as a possible prelude to an
attempt to bolster the yen.
	   The U.S. currency's slide accelerated in Tokyo after the
Japanese Finance Ministry's vice finance minister for international
affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, hinted early Wednesday that monetary
authorities may act soon to prop up the yen.
	   ``For investors, the risk of a strong yen is getting higher.
They should be careful. The opportunity for yen-supportive
intervention is getting near,'' Sakakibara said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, shares were buoyed by
the yen's sudden strengthening and a rise overnight in U.S. stocks
traded on Wall Street.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 288.86
points, or 1.92 percent, to 15,352.65 by the end of morning
trading. On Tuesday, the average rose 269.13 points, or 1.82
percent.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 139.80 points Tuesday to
close at 8,714.65.
	   On Wednesday, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed on the first section picked up 15.47 points, or 1.33
percent, to 1,182.19. The TOPIX rose 14.69 points, or 1.3 percent,
the previous day.
	   There was some concern, however, that natural investor interest
is not there, said Stephen Wood, a senior salesman at ING Baring
Securities.
	   ``I think there is still a lot of bad news over the next few
weeks'' as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party battles with the
political opposition in Parliament over its bank reform bills, he
said.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.190 percent from
Tuesday's finish of 1.155 yen, pushing its price down to 111.80 yen
from 112.07 yen.
