<HEADLINE> EU Presses Japan for Fair Access to Japanese Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union (EU), expressed serious
concern to the Japanese government today over its failure to
remove obstacles to the way container vessels dock, load and
unload at Japanese ports.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and domestic shipping lines now need prior approval,
even for small changes to their schedules, from the Japan Harbor
Transport Association (JHTA), a monopoly body running stevedoring
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The EU maintains that this practice can cause major disruption
and additional costs, given the high price of a day's loading and
unloading.
</P>
<P>
The EU has long been urging the Japanese government to reform
the so-called "prior consultation system" of the JHTA.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Japanese government promised to improve the
practice by July, but according to the EU, progress has been slow.
</P>
<P>
The United States also shares EU concerns. Its Federal
Maritime Commission has now imposed sanctions on Japanese shipping
lines.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, stevedoring companies are organized through the
JHTA, a body established under the auspices of the Ministry of
Transport. The prior consultation system gives the JHTA effective
monopoly control over all loading and unloading of ships in
Japanese harbors.

<HEADLINE> Cardiology Symposium In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Second Symposium on
Interventional Cardiology opened in the Great Hall of People in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Cardiologists, scholars, and doctors from 13 countries and
regions attended the symposium, which is sponsored by the Fuwai
Heart Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and
Japan's Shonan Kamakura General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was an occasion to mark the twentieth anniversary
of the first percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
operation, a major method in interventional cardiology used on a
heart patient in Europe.
</P>
<P>
PTCA is a standard method used on patients with coronary heart
disease, which involves inserting an instrument or medicine into
the blood vessel of diseased parts. It causes less pain and speeds
up recovery time.
</P>
<P>
The first operation of this sort was performed in China in 1984.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day symposium, experts will lecture on invasive
therapy in coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease and
arrhythmias, said Yin Dakui, the Chinese Vice-Minister of Health.
</P>
<P>
Participants will also discuss new topics in the treatment of
heart diseases and watch the live demonstration on invasive
procedures for coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this symposium will promote interventional
cardiology in China," Yin said.

YINCHUAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- An outmoded airport at
Yinchuan, the capital of China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
will close at midnight Saturday and be replaced by a modern one
that can handle 600,000 passengers annually.
</P>
<P>
The New Hedong Airport will open tomorrow, Cheng Yu, deputy

Ningxia Bureau, announced here today.
</P>

have more than 30 flights each week.
</P>
<P>
Officials accused the decade-old airport of blocking economic

region to learn from the 15th National Congress and help the
reform of the economic system, to promote economic expansion in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the central and western regions should

<HEADLINE> Israel Tells PNA: No Anti-terror Fighting, No Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- In further reaction to
Thursday's bombings in Jerusalem, Israel decided today to freeze
the scheduled redeployments in the West Bank before the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) acts to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after an emergency Cabinet security
meeting convened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli
government condemned the PNA for failing to fulfill its main
commitment under the Oslo Agreement to combat terrorism and
terror infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Israel once again demands that the Palestinian Authority keep
all its commitments under the agreement," the statement said,
adding that the cabinet decided to stop handing over more land to
the PNA as long as it failed to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Netanyahu said, "We can't have a
situation in which we are asked to hand over more land to the
Palestinian Authority at a time when they are not fighting terror."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu once again lashed out at PNA President Yasser Arafat
for being responsible for the Thursday's bombings in central
Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall, in which seven people
including three suicide bombers were killed and 190 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) claimed
responsibility for the attack and threatened to have more.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu accused Arafat of appeasing the terrorists by
kissing and embracing leaders of militant groups, including
Hamas, in recent meetings held in Gaza and Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet statement vowed that Israel "will act against the
terrorist organizations and their infrastructure to ensure the
security of its citizens and their fight to self-defense,"
implying that it might send troops back into the Palestinian
areas to hunt suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Following the July 30 twin bombing in Jerusalem's Mahane
Yehuda market which killed 17 people and was also claimed by
Hamas, Israeli government already approved to send troops to
enter Palestinian areas if necessary to hunt terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said that Israeli security
forces would act independently, "without any connection to the
Palestinian Authority concerning everything to do with terror
organizations."
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who strongly condemned the Thursday bombing, maintained
that the suicide bombers came from abroad and not from the
territories.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the Thursday attack, Israel immediately
reimposed a total closure of West Bank and Gaza Strip, including
an internal travel ban on Palestinian residents in West Bank
cities.
</P>
<P>
Under the Note for Record attached to the Hebron Agreement
signed in January by Israel and the PNA under the auspices of the
United States, Israel should have completed the second phase of
troop pullout in the West Bank by September 7.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel has failed to implement even the first
redeployment, scheduled before March 7, because of the refusal by
the PNA to accept the 9 percent scope of pullout set unilaterally
by Israel. The PNA demanded Israel withdraw from 30 percent of the
West Bank in the first phase.
</P>
<P>
The PNA hopes to gain over 80 percent of the land after
Israel completes all the three stages of further pullouts in
the West Bank, on which it will establish an independent
state. But Israel is only willing to hand over about 40
percent of West Bank after the three-stage redeployments, which
were scheduled to be ended by mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision to freeze further redeployments in fact
halted the Oslo process, which has already been questioned by many
in view of the huge gap and lack of trust between the two sides in
the wake of a series of terror attacks.

HARARE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Three people have died and 12
other cases of suspected meningococcal meningitis have been
reported in Zimbabwe's second largest city of Bulawayo.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of health and child welfare today issued a health
warning in the press alerting the public of an outbreak of
meningococcal meningitis which it said had the potential to
spread.
</P>
<P>
Acting director of disease and epidemiology control Batsirayi
Makunike said the cases were confined to Bulawayo only.
</P>
<P>
She said, "the disease is characterised by sudden onset with
fever, intense headaches, nausea and vomiting, stiff neck,
painful joints, a red rush and skin patches. Coma and confusion
may set in later."
</P>
<P>
She added, "meningococcal meningitis is easily spread in
overcrowded places. The disease is spreading by droplet
inhalation through the respiratory system. The disease spreads
very quickly and has a high death rate if left untreated.''
</P>
<P>
She said, "the ministry of health and child welfare and city
health services department in conjunction with WHO (World Health
Organisation) are doing their utmost to contain the outbreak."

<HEADLINE> China To Clear up Illicit Fee Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's State Planning
Commission has suggested ways to use the Communist Party Central
Committee and the State Council's decision on stopping illicit
fees, fines, and other charges against enterprises.
</P>
<P>
One of the suggestions is for cancelling administrative
operating charges on enterprises, except for those stipulated by
state laws and regulations and in the documents of the State
Council, the State Planning commission and the governments at
provincial level.
</P>
<P>
Fees that conform to current regulations should be made clear,
and appropriate fees kept, merging redundant ones, and lowering
surcharges.
</P>
<P>
Management fees, especially for mediary services and management
fees in monopolies should be cleared up and standardized.
</P>
<P>
The SPC also suggested that government at all levels stop
approving new charges or raising the current ones for enterprises,
and that they be strict with rectification procedures in clearing
up current fees.
</P>
<P>
And they should crack down on any illicit fees, the SPC
stressed, saying that it will issue further regulations on
clearing up the collection of funds from enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The COSCO Global
Communications Network in China's largest commercial center got a
thorough going over today to improve communications facilities for
China's oceangoing ships significantly.
</P>
<P>
The network was built by China Ocean Shipping Companies (COSCO)
Group, the leading ocean shipper in China, with 11 major nodal
points in China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Inter-group communications in COSCO and with clients previously
went through the public telecommunications network, and the cost
for land telecommunications alone amounted to more than 200
million yuan each year.
</P>
<P>
With the special network, COSCO can run communications with its
agents in more than 1,100 ports in many countries through the
network, paying only for lease of telecommunications lines.
</P>
<P>
While special telecommunications networks have been built by
most consortia globally, only a few China's businesses have been
able to do so.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Visit Middle East Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- South African president
Nelson Mandela will visit Middle East in October, presidential
spokesman Parks Mankahlana said today.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana made the confirmation following the Egyptian
newspaper Al Ahram's report about Mandela's scheduled visit to
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"I will visit Egypt in October as part of a tour of the Middle
East, which could include Saudi Arabia and Oman," the newspaper
quoted Mandela as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Referring to relations between South Africa and Israel,
Mandela said "our policy is to establish good relations with all
countries, regardless of the role they played against the South
African people during the struggle against apartheid."
</P>
<P>
Israel had strong ties with South Africa's previous apartheid
government. The apartheid system was abolished when the first
non-racial general election was held in South Africa in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the time will come when I can visit not only
Israel but Palestine," Mandela added, calling on Israeli prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fully implement the Palestinian
autonomy accords.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Mandela had twice postponed visits to
Israel because of troubles in the peace process with the
Palestinians.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Basketball
Confederation (ABC) announced here on Friday that it will kick off
its first professional league next year.
</P>
<P>
At the organization's Central Board meeting and Congress held
here today, ABC decided to form the inaugural professional league
by the time between August to October next year.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the eight-team League will be teams from
China, Japan, South Korea, Chinese Taipei, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
The league matches will take a formula similar to that taken by
the U.S. National Basketball Association (NBA), according to ABC
President Carl Ching Man Ky. The Asian governing body for the
game has contacted NBA for technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
In order to raise the local standard of play, the Hong Kong
Basketball Association is considering proposals of inviting
players from China's mainland to join in the local club teams. The
association is also considering to invite former NBA players to
play in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales Hit All Time High in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Car sales in Britain reached a
record high in August with 8 billion U.S. dollars worth of new
cars sold out.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), 525,539 cars were sold, an
increase of 9.62% over the same period last year when 479,945 cars
were registered.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that windfall payments from building societies,
a surge in home prices, and the return of the "feel-good" factor
helped to send sales to the record.
</P>
<P>
But the extraordinary one-month sales also brought a huge boost
for foreign manufacturers, with seven in ten cars registered
imported during August.
</P>
<P>
Of the total August sales, 357,769 cars came from abroad.
Half of the top ten best-sellers came from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Ernie Thompson, chief executive of SMMT said the August
achievement "is a milestone figure and represents a huge volume of
business for the industry."
</P>
<P>
"But it demonstrates clearly the absurdity of having more than
25% of annual registrations in just one month," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has urged the Bank
of England not to raise interest rates further despite figures
showing that car sales broke all records last month.
</P>
<P>
Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford, the market leader, insisted
the figures did not reflect an overheating economy or an
unsustainable consumer boom, saying "my gut feeling is that the
economy is not as strong as these figures suggest".

<P>
LAUSANNE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Athens was named by the
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
as the host city for the 2004 Summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Greeks, who failed in a bid eight years earlier when they
applied to stage the centennial Olympics in 1996, won in a
five-way fight against Rome, Cape Town, Buenos Aires and Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
When Samaranch announced the result at the Palais de Beaulieu,
Greek bid leader Gianna Angelopoulos hugged members of her
delegation and kissed them on the cheek while supporters chanted
her name.
</P>
<P>
Athens, loser to Atlanta for the 1996 Olympics, finally won at
the second attempt. At the first attempt, they were criticised
for acting as if they had a right to the Games, 100 years after
Athens hosted the first modern Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Seconds after the official announcement, Greeks reacted with
jubilation. A crowd of some 1,000 supporters of the bid leapt for
joy outside the headquarters of the Athens Olympic Committee,
close to the Panathenian stadium where the modern Games began in
1896. Dozens of balloons were released into the pink dusk, flags
were waved and cars across the city honked their horns.

<HEADLINE> Funeral of Diana's Chauffeur Indefinitely Put off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The funeral of Henri Paul, the
chauffeur of Princess Diana and her friend Dodi Al Fayed, was put
off today because his family wanted to counter check how much
alcohol was in his bloodstream when he crashed the Mercedes early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Paul's funeral was originally scheduled for Saturday in Lorient
on the western coast of France, which is his hometown. No new date
was set for the funeral, according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
A counter-examination by experts were going on today to
reevaluate the level of alcohol in Paul's bloodstream at the
demand of his family, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
A primary examination by investigators showed that there was
1.75-1.85 grams of alcohol in each liter of his blood, a rate much
higher than the 0.5 gram limit allowed by the law for driving.
</P>
<P>
Paul was employed by the Hotel Ritz of Paris in 1986 as a
security man. He lost control of the Mercedes which carried Diana
and Dodi and their bodyguard early Sunday morning when the car
crashed at the Alma tunnel in downtown Paris, killing Diana and
Dodi.

<HEADLINE> Water Saving Urged in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
appealed for an increased awareness on fresh water saving in the
country as the island is facing a severe water shortage.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to three dams in southern Cyprus today, Minister
of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Costas Petrides
told reporters that Cyprus' water reserves in the dams were at
their lowest level for the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
"The situation regarding water reserves is tragic, since their
level in the reservoirs are being dangerously exhausted," he added.
</P>
<P>
Petrides described as "equally tragic" the reduction of
subterranean reserves and said the government has prepared a
strategic plan to better use water resources until the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
He said that the flow of water in the island's dams since last
October was 22.6 million cubic meters, representing 19 percent of
the annual normal flow.
</P>
<P>
This year, the minister added, there are only 39.1 million
cubic meters of water in the reservoirs, representing 14.5 percent
of their total capacity, in comparison with 75.5 million cubic
meters last year and 132.2 million cubic meters in 1995, while
Cyprus' annual needs of water are 134 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
"In case drought continues, something not impossible, the
situation will be more than tragic, since by December 1997 in some
big dams there will be nothing but mud left," Petrides said.
</P>
<P>
This island nation, which relies mainly on rainfall for its
fresh water supply, has imposed strict measures to save water
since January this year.
</P>
<P>
In Nicosia, water supply to households is cut by 20 percent,
which means water is supplied only three days a week. Water for
farming purposes is also cut by up to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Petrides, in a major step to tackle Cyprus'
chronic water shortage problem, the first desalination plant
started operating last April on the southeastern coast, near the
Dhekelia power station.
</P>
<P>
This plant daily supplies 20,000 cubic meters of water to
Famagusta District and part of Larnaca District. By July 1998 its
capacity will reach 40,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government approved in January a proposal for
setting up a second desalination plant, west of the southern town
of Larnaca, expected to be completed by 1998.
</P>
<P>
A further two plants are also envisaged for Limassol and
Paphos areas, which have to cater for thousands of tourists in
the summer months.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Wants Good Relations with Neighbors: Leghari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari said here today that his country wants good relations with
its neighbors and desires peaceful resolution of all outstanding
issues including the core issue of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Leghari made the remarks while meeting with Rick Inderfurth,
the new assistant secretary of state for South Asia, who arrived
here Thursday on a visit to Pakistan as a part of his five-nation
tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
The president exchanged views with his guest on a wide range of
issues including Pak-U.S. bilateral relations and the situation in
the region, official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining Pakistan's position on the issue of Jammu and
Kashmir, Leghari reiterated that Pakistan seeks a just and
peaceful resolution of the issue through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Leghari expressed the confidence that the Pak-U.S.
relations would continue to be improved.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan was looking forward with keen interest to
the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Albright to Pakistan this
year and the proposed visit of President Clinton to the region
next year.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the Brown Amendment permitting the transfer of
defense equipment purchased by Pakistan had set the stage for
opening a new chapter in U.S.-Pakistan relations, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan and the United States share common
objectives and interests on most issues, particularly in the
desire to seek peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan supports the United Nations' efforts at bringing about
a durable peace in Afghanistan, Leghari said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Pakistan was pursuing a policy of
non-interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts are directed towards cessation of hostilities, and
the formation of a broad based and representative government," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth informed Leghari about the deep interest of the
United States in peace and stability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country supports the process of dialogue which
has begun between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States believes that the situation in
Afghanistan is a source of instability in the region and would
like to see it to be resolved, Inderfurth said.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth's five-nation "familiarization tour", which started
from India, will also take him to Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> US Unemployment Rate Up to 4.9 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
increased to 4.9 percent in August as new jobs were created at the
slowest pace in nearly a year, U.S. Labor Department reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The gain of the jobless rate resulted partly from the UPS
strike which had a big impact on job growth. UPS temporarily
subtracted 164,000 jobs from the economy, although the U.S. Postal
Service and other competitors increased hiring by 9,000 to pick up
some of the slack.
</P>
<P>
The report said that crosscurrents left net job growth at
49,000 in August, the worst showing since September 1996. However,
that followed an extremely strong gain of 365,000 jobs in July,
revised up from an earlier estimate of 316,000 and it represented
the biggest gain in 17 months.
</P>
<P>
It showed that the manufacturing sector added a striking 47,000
jobs last month, the most since February 1990.
</P>
<P>
Job growth in retailing increased by 31,000 following two
strong months. The finance industry continued to add workers, with
11,000 in August, bringing growth over the past 26 months to
nearly 200,000. Construction employment rose by 10,000 jobs, the
first gain since May.
</P>
<P>
Government jobs increased by 72,000, bolstered by postal
service hiring and teachers returning to school.
</P>
<P>
The report said that average workweek rose 0.2 hours in August,
to 34.7 hours, after a 0.1-hour decline the month before.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earning also increased by 5 cents last month to
a seasonally adjusted 12.29 dollars, compared with 1 cent increase
in July.

Viktor Chernomyrdin, attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed that after the cold war, peace and
development have become a main trend of the world, where security
and stability are the key of the trend. All the countries of the
world should make every effort to create a peaceful and stable
international environment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the international
conference, Brazauskas said "By gathering in Vilnius, we will have
an opportunity to seek new ways of implementation and practical
application of the principles of democracy, co-operation, security
and good neighbourly relations enshrined in the Helsinki final act
and other international documents."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the states of Central and Eastern Europe which in
this century suffered extremely painful blows of history, hold a
special role and responsibility in preventing a repeat of old
mistakes and, instead, by concerted joint efforts, overcoming the
current problems for the free, secure and prosperous Europe.
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas emphasized the task facing heads of state is to
create such an environment in the region which would bring people
closer to each other and become a reliable barrier against
incitement of animosity between them.
</P>
<P>
On the European security, Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said that "Europe seems to be missing a historic chance
to create a common family of nations and peoples enjoying equal
rights."
</P>
<P>
He described the decision on the expansion of NATO to the east
as a "crucial mistake".
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko noted that "We ought to do everything possible to
minimize the negative consequences of this erroneous step and not
to allow the coming back of animosity and suspicion in
relationship between our nations and people."
</P>
<P>
He also said that nothing unites people more than a common
activity and economic interests. Therefore, the European states
should pay special attention to the discussion on regional and
economic cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said "a foundation for new
relations between the States is being laid and the shape of the
future European structure is being determined."
</P>
<P>
He said European states have got a unique chance at present to
make the Baltic Sea, Central Europe and the Black Sea region one
of the generators of peace and cooperation in the entire Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia sees the establishment of a new model of the
Baltic-Black Sea cooperation as an integral component of a new
Europe, said Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
The conference is also attended by the representatives of the
European Commission and the Council of Europe.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Civil Service Numbers Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The downward trend in Civil
Service staff numbers in Britain has continued, said Cabinet
Office here today.
</P>
<P>
Between 1 April 1997 and 1 July 1997 the number of permanent
civil servants fell by one percent or 3,200 to 472,000, four
percent less than a year earlier, according to a press release by
the Office.
</P>
<P>
The number of casual staff increased in the second quarter by
300 or one percent to 19,000, nine percent fewer than 12 months
earlier, reflecting the continued use of casual staff to overcome
fluctuations in workload and short-term shortages of permanent
staff.
</P>
<P>
Taking both permanent and casual staff into account the trend
has continued downward, the overall total having fallen from
495,000 on 1 April to 492,000 on 1 July.
</P>
<P>
Since the peak in 1976 the number of permanent staff has fallen
37 percent from 751,000 to 472,000. Casual staff numbers have
increased by 79 percent over the same period, from 11,100 to
19,900.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Office said the largest reductions in numbers of
permanent staff in the three months till 1 July occurred in the
Ministry of Defense (2,270 down), the Benefits Agency (920 down),
the Department for Education and Employment (620 down) and the
Department of Trade and Industry (610 down).
</P>
<P>
The largest increases in numbers of permanent staff in the same
period were in the Prison Service (530 up) and the Scottish
Prison Service (310 up), in response to the increasing prison
population.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Circular On Medical Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council has
issued a circular on reforming the medical storage and supply
sector to better prepare the nation for disasters, epidemics, and
other emergencies.
</P>
<P>
It says that there will be a system of central supplies for
serious disasters and local ones for lesser disasters.
</P>
<P>
The State Council and provincial level governments should
ensure funds for the central and local medical supply, it said,
and the State Pharmaceutical Administration and departments at the
provincial level should improve the administration of medical
supplies for greater efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The State Council says it will oversee the State Economic and
Trade Commission, the Ministry of Supervision, the State
Pharmaceutical Administration, and other departments'
implementation of the circular's demands.
</P>
<P>
A Xinhua News Agency commentary today said that the current
medical supply system, which was established in the 1970s, can no
longer meet the needs of the new nation.
</P>
<P>
The circular provides ways of improving the national medical
supply system, it said, and pointed to advantages for unified
policy, planning and implementation, and the role of central and
local governments the reform will bring.

<HEADLINE> Meeting On Improving Commercial Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A meeting has been held in
the capital of China's Henan province to discuss establishing
commercial centers in some pilot cities in central and western
China.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy (SCRE), the State Planning Commission,
the State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Internal
Trade, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation. In 1994 these offices started a project for this by
designating Lanzhou, Zhengzhou and Chengdu as pilot cities.
</P>
<P>
The project was described at the meeting as "a correct choice
for economic development of central and western China", and it is
considered significant for the reforms and opening-up
</P>
<P>
Shao Bingren, vice-minister in charge of the SCRE, said that
establishing commercial centers is more than merely reforming the
commercial sector, and can only succeed by reforming the whole
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
In putting commerce at the center of the service sector, Shao
said, pilot cities should also use more overseas investment
combined with the readjustment of industry and enterprise
structures.
</P>
<P>
He called for unified leadership and effective co-ordination
for the project, which in his words is a "complex systems
engineering."

<HEADLINE> Worlddidac Keen On China's Educational Equipment Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Beat Jost, executive director
of Worlddidac Association, said today that China Didac '97 has
attracted 50 foreign investors in the educational equipment
industry, and many more are interested in China's large market.
</P>
<P>
"With a population of 1.2 billion, accounting for one fifth of
the world's total, education has experienced a prosperous era in
recent years thanks to efforts made by the Chinese government and
educators," he said.
</P>
<P>
China Educational Instrument and Equipment Corporation (CEIEC),
the organizer of China Didac '97, has provided a chance for
foreign traders to learn more about the country's education
system, development, school equipment, and teaching equipment, he
said, and it will promote trade exchanges and technological
co-operation between Chinese manufacturers and foreign businessmen.
</P>

Investors from 50 countries have set up over 1,000 co-operation
projects with Chinese companies and school-run enterprises in
education materials, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ottwy Beats Jones in Tokyo Athletics Internationa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey
beat world champion Marion Jones of the United States to win the
women's 100m race at the Tokyo international athletics tournament
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Ottey, who finished a disappointing seventh
after a false start in the world championships, made a perfect
start this time to clock 10.83 seconds, beating the 21-year-old
American by eight hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
World silver medallist Zhanna Pintusevich of Ukraine, who
narrowly lost the world title to Jones in a photo finish final in
Athens last month, came in third in 11.16.
</P>
<P>
Pintusevich, who won the 200m gold medal in Athens, was also
beaten earlier in her favourite distance when American Inger
Miller clocked 22.77 to beat her into second by 0.10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Donovan Bailey could manage only second in his
last race of the season, beaten by Frankie Fredericks of Namibia,
who clocked 10.04 to repeat his performance here last year,
beating the Canadian by 0.14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Six-time world champion Sergei Bubka of Ukraine failed to clear
6.16m mark in an attempt for his 36th world record, but
comfortably won the men's pole vault with a 5.80m jump, far better
than American runner-up Dean Starkey's 5.65.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 3,000m steeplechase, Denmark's Kenyan-born Wilson
Boit Kipketer gained some consolation when the former world record
holder clocked 8:19.80 to beat Bernard Barmasai by four hundredths
of a second.
</P>
<P>
It was a repeat performance for 23-year-old Kipketer, the world
800m record holder, who defeated the same opponent into third to
win the world championships.
</P>
<P>
After Athens, Kipketer established an old world mark of 7:59.08
on August 13, only to see Barmasai break it again 11 days later at
the Cologne Grand Prix in Germany with a time of 7:55.72.

and air through the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei,
Henan and Hebei before reaching the destination of capital city
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
There are 16 special timing stages on the Rally's 3,000
kilometers route, with participating pilots competing each other

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The funeral of Britain's
Princess Diana was held Saturday morning in London's Westminster
Abbey, with millions of mourners bidding farewell to "the People's
Princess".
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth II, Diana's former husband Prince Charles, her
sons Princes William and Harry, and other members of the royal
family and Diana's family joined the 1,900 people attending the
funeral service inside the abbey.
</P>
<P>
Celebrities and political leaders, including British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, former United States secretary of state,
Henry Kissenger, and former British prime minister, Lady Thatcher,
mingled with ordinary people in the abbey to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, Diana's coffin, draped in the royal
standard and crowned with three sprays of white flowers, was
carried out of her London home, Kensington Palace, to Westminster
Abbey on a gun carriage. Millions of mourners lining the streets
watched silently as the cortege passed.
</P>
<P>
Princes Charles, William and Harry, along with Diana's brother
Earl Charles Spencer, and the Queen's husband Prince Philip were
in the funeral cortege.
</P>
<P>
Five hundred people who worked for or were helped by the 110
charities linked to Diana also joined the cortege on its way to
the abbey.
</P>
<P>
After an emotional speech by Tony Blair, singer Elton John,
Diana's close friend, sang the song, "Candle in the Wind", which
described Diana as a candle that burned out long before her legend
ever would.
</P>
<P>
While paying a personal tribute to his sister Diana during the
funeral service, Spencer delivered a bitter attack on the media,
blaming the press for hounding Diana to death.
</P>
<P>
The funeral ended with a one-minute silence across the
country. Diana's coffin was then driven to her family home in
Althorp, central England, for burial.

<HEADLINE> China Continues political Restructuring (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese theorists say that
China's political restructuring is not a kind of reform to
"destroy the present system or demolish the basic framework", but
will proceed in an orderly fashion.
</P>
<P>
"No big change will take place in the general pattern of
China's political structure," Wang Jiaqiu, vice-president of the
Party School of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central
Committee, predicts. This echoes what President Jiang Zemin said
in a speech on May 29 at the Party School about the need for
continuing the reform of China's political structure.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said, this does not mean that political
restructuring will have to destroy the present system or tear down
the basic framework, but it should be carried out in a step by
step manner.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that political restructuring is not something
abstract. When there have been breakthroughs in economic reforms,
the political structure must fit the reforms and special attention
should be paid to the introduction of a legal system and
increasing democracy gradually.
</P>
<P>
"The market economy should not be ruled by man, but by law,"
she emphasized.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Comoros' Stop to Armed Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- France today welcomed the
decision by the Comoran government to stop armed operation in the
separatist island of Anjouan, after heavy casualties were
reportedly inflicted upon government forces who landed on the
island Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
France also promised to provide emergency humanitarian help to
those on both sides of the conflict who became victims of the
fighting over the past three days in Anjouan, said a communique
issued by the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
``France has constantly stressed that the present problem in
the Comoros could not be solved by the resort to force and had
deeply deplored the fightings and the casualties caused by this
operation,'' said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Comoros said the military operation in
Anjouan, launched by the Comoran government despite opposition
from the Organization of African Unity (OAU), had resulted in the
death of 40 government soldiers and 18 civilians.
</P>
<P>
The envoy of the OAU to the Comoros, Pierre Yere, said the
operation had resulted in a ``debacle''.
</P>
<P>
The island of Anjouan, one of the three islands that make up
the Indian Ocean nation, declared ``independence'' on August 3 and
asked for the return of French rule, which was withdrawn in 1975.
</P>
<P>
France appealed to all parties in the conflict to cooperate
with the OAU to seek a political and consensual solution and to
respect ``the cohesion, unity and territorial integrity of the
Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros,'' said the communique.
</P>
<P>
``We reiterate our total support to the project of the OAU to
organize as rapidly as possible an inter-Comoran conference this
summer,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the French Foreign Ministry, a non-governmental
humanitarian group is launching a rescue operation in Anjouan to
help the people victimized by the fighting.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Continues Political Restructuring (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li says that China's political restructuring has been carried
out in such a cautious and steady way that the political reform
has been mistaken for "lagging behind".
</P>
<P>
Experts say that historic changes have quietly taken place in
China's political life while its economic reforms have been
carried out on a grand scale.
</P>
<P>
The results of political restructuring in the past five years
are improving the following: the people's congress system, the
multi-party co-operation system and the political consultative
system under the leadership of the CPC, the personnel system,
establishing a legal framework for a socialist market economy,
cracking down on corruption and building a clean government, and
guarantees of citizens' democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
These changes have resulted in a steady and progressive
political restructuring, they say.
</P>
<P>
Political observers say that China has quickened the pace of
legislation in the past few years, and one fundamental step is
that people's congresses at various levels have been playing an
increasingly greater role in the country's political life.
</P>
<P>
More than a third of the 300 laws and decisions adopted or
revised in the past two decades have come since 1992.

The National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature,
and its Standing Committee have a final say in the nation's
general and specific policies and in appointing major government
officials. Its annual section has become an important place for
deputies from across the country to exercise their power.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Xiaoyang, deputy director of the Commission of Legislative
Affairs of the NPC Standing Committee, says that laws on every
aspect of China's political, economic and social life have been
passed and a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics
has been instituted, based on the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China has also made progress in reforming
administrations and that institutional restructuring has taken
place across the nation since the Second Plenum of the 14th CPC
Central Committee in February, 1993.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the 68 ministries, commissions and offices
directly under the State Council, China's highest governing body,
have been cut to 59, and government offices at the provincial
level have been cut by some 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Personnel Ministry, the central government
departments have selected more than 1,700 civil servants through
examinations in the past four years, and governments at the
provincial level have hired 190,000.

A fair and competitive system for choosing government officials
has been formed.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that there are still major obstacles to institutional
restructuring, particularly in the definition of duties, which
involves a change of work style and way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
Institutional restructuring and the definition of duties are
expected to be a major part of political restructuring after the
CPC 15th National Congress, which begins September 12.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Civil Affairs official says that village
committee democracy in rural areas has also attracted a great deal
of attention. The direct election of village committees by secret
ballot has become a common practice in many places.
</P>
<P>
Since Village Committee Organic Law took effect in 1978,
several rounds of elections have been held in provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities, and the fourth round of
elections took place this year in Shanxi, Hebei, Fujian and
Heilongjiang provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Village committee leaders used to be appointed by the local
government but today, farmers enjoy the right to nominate them,"
the official said.

<P>
TIRANA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep
Meidani Friday approved a Council of Ministers proposal to appoint
17 new army generals in a bid to restructure the army.
</P>
<P>
The generals include the general inspector, the commander of
the air force, deputy chief of staff, seven officers from the
Defense Ministry and others.
</P>
<P>
In Albania, the air force and navy come under the control of
the army.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale reshuffle of the Albanian army began Tuesday when
a meeting of the Council of Ministers deposed a large number of
generals. The newly appointed only fill part of the vacancies.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian army has been seeking to restructure itself after
it proved unable to preserve order during the economic and
political crisis following an investment scandal early this year.

<HEADLINE> 49 Civilians Massacred Near Algerian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Forty-nine civilians were
massacred and about 60 injured Friday night, presumably by Islamic
extremists, in Beni Messous near the Algerian capital Algiers,
Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that an armed commando of Islamic militants
descended on the village of Sidi Youssef and slaughtered the
villagers with axes and other agricultural tools.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the mutilated bodies of the victims were
assembled on the ground of a hospital in Beni Messous.
</P>
<P>
This is the worst massacre to have taken place near the
Algerian capital since Algeria was plunged into violence in 1992
after the army cancelled an election victory won by Islamists.
</P>
<P>
About 300 people were massacred last Friday in Reis 20
kilometers south of Algiers by extremists in the worst massacre of
civilians in five years.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government early this week rejected an appeal by
the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to seek a
political, rather than military, solution to the internal conflict
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said in a statement last weekend that the
Algerian conflict was no longer a purely internal problem, and the
international community would not see the Algerian people
abandoned to their fate.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Algeria said that Abassi Madani, the head of the
outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) who was recently released
from jail, will make an appeal for peace within 15 to 20
days.

<P>
SHENYANG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto visited a museum for the "September 18 Incident"
this afternoon in the capital of northeast China's Liaoning
province.
</P>
<P>
On September 18, 1931 Japanese troops blew up a section of the
Dalian--Harbin Railway near Shenyang, then accused the Chinese
troops of sabotage as a pretext and bombarded the barracks of the
Chinese troops near Shenyang the same evening, thus starting
massive armed invasion against northeast china.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told a group of resporters at the museum that No
matter how forgetful people may be, they should not forget
history. They can learn from history, but must not change
history. They must bear the burden of history, he said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that he has come to Shenyang with the wish of
viewing history correctly, and that this could be a basis of
better Sino-Japanese relations and for casting our sights on the
future.
</P>
<P>
The museum has a 20-meter-high stone calendar scarred by
thousands of bullets. At the top are the characters for "September
18, 1931". It also has an exhibition hall with relics recording
the developments of the incident and how the Chinese army and
people fought back against Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the visit, Hashimoto wrote on the visitors book:
"peace is what matters".

WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A special White House panel said the Pentagon had lost so
much credibility in its investigation of the release of Iraqi
chemical weapons in the 1991 Persian Gulf war that oversight of
the investigation must be taken away from the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
-- Speaking "from the heart," Queen Elizabeth praised Diana,
Princess of Wales, in a personal address of a kind rarely seen in
her 45 years as monarch.
</P>
<P>
-- Ford Motor withheld information from Federal regulators
about an engineering defect that can cause its cars and light
trucks to stall at high speeds, documents filed in a lawsuit
suggest. The suit seeks the recall of at least two million
vehicles produced between 1983 and 1995 and the replacement of a
circuit. It also asks for damages of that could run to more than
two billion dollars under California law, even if no punitive
penalties are assessed.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- House conservatives, still fuming about parts of the budget
agreement, vowed yesterday to work to delay a final vote on a
major health and human service-education spending bill until late
next week in an effort to force GOP leaders to roll back some of
their commitments to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
-- Mother Teresa, the Nobel Prize-winning Catholic nun, died
Friday night after suffering cardiac arrest in the Calcutta
headquarters of her Missionaries of Charity, whose worldwide

<P>
CANBERRA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Defense Minister
Ian McLachlan heads off to Japan tomorrow for a three-day visit,
the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled visit "marks the substantial change in the
security relationship underlined by the agreement in April between
Prime Minister John Howard and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto for an expansion of defense cooperation activities," the
AAP said.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said in a statement that his visit "is one of the
ways to show the importance which we place on our relationship
with Japan."
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the contribution to be made by defense to
the security dialogue which we have established will continue to
reinforce our shared security interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I also believe that we have a strong basis to carry forward
the further development of defense contacts... Australia and Japan
shared substantial security interests," said the defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Australia's defense links with Japan remain delicate because of
memories of World War II, AAP said. The Japanese launched armed
attack at Australia and some neighboring Pacific Island countries
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Mclachlan is scheduled to meet his Japanese counterpart Fumio
Kyuma, director-general of defense agency, Japanese Foreign
Minister Yukihiko Ikeda and other senior military officials,
according to AAP.
</P>
<P>
Australia has strengthened its military ties with the United
States over the past year, while the United States and Japan are

<HEADLINE> Economists Assess Private Economy's Role in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Economists attending a seminar
on China's private economic development in Beijing on Friday said
that the sector role in the country's economic take-off has been
growing, according to China Securities today.
</P>
<P>
China's private economy is an important, organic part of the
socialist economy, and is playing a major role in the economy.
</P>
<P>
They said that a pressing matter for future development of the
private sector is reinforcing management and planning to ensure
healthy development.
</P>
<P>
They called for an environment that allows the private economy
to compete equally with other economies, one that is part of the
law to protect private properties, while protecting public
property.
</P>
<P>
Private entrepreneurs should improve themselves and the
management of private firms as well.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1996, the country's national economy grew at eight
percent annually, but the private sector grew 25 percent annually
and it has contributed 80 percent of the increase of the national
economy as a whole in recent years, according to the
economists.

DHAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will face the
challenges of the 21st century through scientific and
technological means, including proper utilization of water and
other natural resources of the country, Water Resources Minister
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made this statement at a workshop on "Ground water and
Environment" jointly organized by the Bangladesh Geology Society
and the Alumni Association of German Universities.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the geological scientists to identify the
problems relating to the ground water and environment and find out
their solution for ongoing development of the country and
improvement of the life standard of the people.
</P>
<P>
He called upon them to work with devotion for developing the
ground water as they have contributed in the field of oil, gas and
coal sectors of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Government will take necessary steps for higher
education and research in the geology departments of the
universities to create technically sound manpower in the field,
the minister stated.
</P>
<P>
The government has fixed a target for producing 25 million
metric tones of food grains in the proposed Five-Year Plan and
more surface water will be required in irrigation, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are presently using 70 percent to 90 percent of water from
the ground water for irrigation and drinking purposes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Owing to huge unplanned uses of the ground water, the
environment of the country has been affected badly, the minister
noted, adding that most of the shallow tubewells for supplying
drinking water have become imperative as the ground water level
came down.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Bay areas of the country are now flooded by saline
water and, arsenic pollution is found at different areas of the
country owing to the unplanned uses of ground water, he said.

At least 680 Rwandan refugees fled the camp in central Malawi

suspected of being implicated in genocide cases back home, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
"Many of them have returned to camp, the sole camp in the
country, after hearing that the repatriation is voluntary," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Malawi's Tobacco Production Faces Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE (MALAWI), September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Tobacco
Association of Malawi (TAMA) is unlikely to recover its loans of
more than 250 million Kwacha (about 15 million U.S. Dollars)
given to growers earlier this year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
It may spell doom to the future of the country's number one
crop, the local newspaper Nation said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from TAMA indicated that only 120 million Kwacha has
been recovered although over 75 percent of TAMA's 64,000 members
have already sold their tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The failure to pay back the loans is blamed on low prices and
also on cheating, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Some growers are deliberatedly avoiding selling their tobacco
at the auction floors where TAMA recovers its loans, preferring
to sell through middlemen or other outlets instead, a TAMA
official said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture blamed the low prices on the
incessant heavy rains this year which affected the quality of the
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The anti-smoking campaign in the United States has also
affected the export of Malawi tobacco to the United States, one
of the big buyers of the Malawi leaf.

</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also address the tight Israeli closure of
Palestinian areas after Thursday's attack in a shopping mall
in Jerusalem, which killed eight people and wounded 192.
</P>
<P>
Israel has held the PNA "indirectly responsible" for the
attacks, the second in the city in five weeks, and reimposed a
complete closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip which had been
eased earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out handing over more
land to Palestinians Friday until Arafat cracked down on Muslim
militants, accusing him of failing to honor a commitment under
interim peace accords to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israel has withdrawn its troops, handing over much of the Gaza
Strip and parts of the West Bank to Palestinian self-rule under
peace deals with Arafat starting in 1993. It is supposed to
withdraw from more of the West Bank by mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Arafat condemned the latest attacks as "terrorist activities"
masterminded from abroad, but he swiftly denounced the Israeli
decision as destroying the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman said Israel was trying to obstruct the first
visit to the Mideast by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
scheduled to start this week.
</P>
<P>
Albright's multi-leg mission, which President Bill Clinton
confirmed on Thursday would go ahead, expected to revive the the
Palestinian-Israeli peacemaking that has been in crisis since
March over Jewish settlement construction in East Jerusalem the
Palestinians want as part of a future state.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate has been deepened by the suicide attacks, first
on July 30 when 15 Israelis were killed by two suicidal bombs in
a Jerusalem market and second on Thursday.

<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Ambassador to China

hegemony and power politics.
</P>
<P>

policies and pursues a foreign policy based on the principles of
international law and norms governing state-to-state relations,
and respects sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-interference
in other countries' internal affairs, non-aggression, and the
peaceful settlement of disputes.
</P>
<P>
China is the only developing country with a permanent seat and
veto power in the Security Council of the United Nations, Haque
pointed out, and said: "Pakistan appreciates the role China plays
in the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"And we are confident that China will continue to safeguard its
own national interests as well as those of the developing
countries in the years ahead and will continue to respect and
implement UN decisions and resolutions", he added.

members of the international community, particularly the
developing countries, can devote their energies to the essential
task of socio-economic development and improving well-being of
their people."
</P>
<P>
China has successfully withstood external political pressure
and has scored rapid economic development, he said, adding that it
has a traditional friendship with other developing countries and
supports them in their demand for a just and equitable
international economic order, and is providing assistance in funds
and technology to them.
</P>
<P>
He called Pakistan and China "old friends" that have stood by
each other in good times and bad, enjoying the best of relations
for the last five decades.
</P>
<P>
"Both Pakistan and China are fully committed to international
and regional peace and security and have closely co-operated with
each other at the UN and other international fora in all areas",
he noted.

based on the fundamental principles of peaceful co-existence and
mutually beneficial economic cooperation.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The death of an icon: Mother Meresa, 1979 Nobel Peace Prize
winner and the most media-covered religious figure in the world,

slums of the Indian metropolitan, as well as for her lobby against
abortion on the planet.
</P>

privatize the air company, decided on Friday to quit the presidency

of a financial disaster.

<P>
BLANTYRE (Malawi), September 6 (Xinhua) -- All the 12 heads of
state from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) will
attend a summit to be held in Blantyre, Malawi on Monday,
according to the information desk of the SADC summit today.

The SADC leaders will have a challenging task and the debate
which starts on Monday when they are to purify the image of the

<P>
Alfred Nzo, chairman of SADC Council of Ministers, said that

resources," Nzo said.

timely for the region.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Minister Expects Israeli Retaliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of Information
Basim el-Sabaa today expected fresh Israeli attacks against
Lebanon to retaliate for its heavy losses in south Lebanon Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cairo-based Voice of Arabs radio, the
minister said the failed Israeli raid in south of the Lebanese
port city of Sidon was meant to plant explosive charges in
Lebanese installations several kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
Some 12 Israeli soldiers were killed Friday in fighting with
Lebanese troops and guerrillas after an Israeli airborne commando
launched a pre-dawn raid on the village of Insariyeh, about 45
kilometers north of the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
This was the worst casualty for Israeli forces in a single
battle in the area since Israel set up the security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The heavy casualty raised fears of tough Israeli retaliation
that usually comes in the form of lightning air strikes on
Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon, the last active front line in
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli pre-dawn raid, hours after a triple suicide
bombing in West Jerusalem, was meant to retaliate an Amal
attack last week in which five Israeli soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
On the first visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Sabaa said Lebanon was not officially notified
if Beirut will be included in her upcoming Mideast tour scheduled
to start this week.
</P>
<P>
If Beirut will be included, Sabaa said, talks with Albright
should focus on implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution
425, which calls for immediate and unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from the Israeli self-proclaimed security zone in south
Lebanon.

<P>
BAGHDAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has decided to launch a
free trade and industrial zone in Azzobair bay, Al-Basra
province, in southern Iraq, the Iraq News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision is part of the Iraqi efforts to revive its economy

envisage roads, parks, offices, service centers, communications,
fire fighting units, a medical center and a fuel station.

to Arab, European, Asian and African states, thus reducing time
and the costs of transport and labor, Mahmoud added.
</P>
<P>
It will turn the area into an Arab and international trade
center for its distinguished geographical location to the north
of the Arab Gulf, the official said.
</P>

industrial zone in Azzobair was adopted by the Iraq cabinet on

<HEADLINE> Science and Tech, Hong Kong's Competitive Edge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Science and technology has
played and will continue to play an increasingly important role in
 ensuring that Hong Kong remains a competitive manufacturing and
services center in the global market, a high-ranking official of
the Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a scientific conference, Acting Financial Secretary
Ki Chi Kwong said that the Hong Kong government is committed to
enhancing the development and application of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has adopted a three-pronged approach to upgrade its
science and technology capacity, Kwong said in a keynote speech
entitled "Science and Technology Policy for the HKSAR".
</P>
<P>
The government first provides suitable physical infrastructural
facilities by, for instance, earmarking three industrial estates
and setting up technology centers. A science park is being
planned, added the official.
</P>
<P>
The second part of the government approach is to invest in
human resources and the third, to support research and development
activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, over the past three academic years,
Hong Kong has invested 31 billion HK dollars (nearly 4 billion
U.S. dollars) in tertiary education, of which 35 percent or 11
billion HK dollars (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) went to the
development of science and technology-related teaching and
research programs.
</P>
<P>
For academic research, a total of 540 million HK dollars (69
million U.S. dollars) has been granted between 1995 and 1998, more
than four times the figure between 1992 and 1995 -- 120 million HK
dollars (15 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the increased investment, the research base has
expanded and there has been a general move towards larger
projects, especially in medicine and engineering fields, Kwong
told scientists at the fifth Annual Scientific Conference and
General Meeting, organized by Hong Kong Institution of Science
(HKIS).
</P>
<P>
The HKIS, founded in 1992, has grown into an outstanding
society today with more than 300 members, including academics,
officials and figures from industrial circles.
</P>
<P>
Leroy L. Chang, president of the HKIS, said that the goal of
the HKIS is to promote science in Hong Kong, a significant job as
it has been widely recognized that the world depends increasingly
on science to advance technology for the benefit of society.
</P>
<P>
The most important activity of the HKIS is its annual
scientific conference and general meeting, which gathers members
and scientists for one-day discussions on the latest development
trend of science and technology, and its impact on social and
economic life.

<HEADLINE> New Rain Alert System for HK Schools Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Office of
Ombudsman has made a proposal to have a new rainstorm warning
system for local schools to be available, probably before next
year's rainy season, the office said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was made by the Ombudsman after the
Education Department criticized the existing system as confusing
and problematic.
</P>
<P>
The department staff were heavily criticized by parents after
the department failed to close schools on the morning of June 4
despite severe flooding in some of the local areas.
</P>
<P>
At present, the warning system is based on actual rainfall
measurement, but the radical overhaul would rely on forecasts,
giving families time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
And when the red rainstorm signal was posted, kindergartens and
primary schools would be closed automatically.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department and individual schools currently have
to make their own decisions in the event of a red signal warning.
</P>
<P>
The black signal would close all schools, as under the present
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new system will be similar to the typhoon warning
system, which links the closing of offices to typhoon signals.
</P>
<P>
The watchdog recommended on the Hong Kong Observatory to
forecast when rainstorm warnings were likely to be issued.
</P>
<P>
But the Observatory said Friday that the Education Department
should make the final decision on whether schools should be
closed.

liberalization have become the main stream in the region, Prof. Lu
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "The Prospects of Science, Technology and Education
into the 21st Century", the speech tries to explore the
development trend and characteristics of economy, science,
technology, and education in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
"The mankind will step into the age of the so-called Knowledge
Economy," said Prof. Lu, who predicted that technological
innovation is bound to bring about new industrial revolution,
change economic and consuming structures, and shape modes of
production and lifestyle.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Southern African Ministers Morn over Diana's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE, (Malawi), September 6 (Xinhua) -- The 12-member
Southern African Development Community (SADC), of which 11 states
are Commonwealth members, paid a special respect to Princess
Diana whose funeral was held in London today.
</P>
<P>
SADC people shall always cherish the memory of Princess Diana
as a "true friend of southern Africa who passionately shared our
dream of a southern Africa free of the scourge of ani-personnel
landmines which have caused untold misery to millions of our
people," said Alfred Nzo, chairman of SADC Ministerial Council
and foreign minister of South Africa, at a press conference
today.
</P>
<P>
The memory of Princess Diana will "inspire the thoughts and
vision of southern Africa at peace with itself and the rest of
the world," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
At the SADC ministers' conference, ministers of the southern
African sub-region, paid special honor to Diana, Princess of
Wales, whose high-profile involvement in the anti-landmine
campaign and global fight against AIDS has won praise worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Diana flew to Angola as part of a British Red Cross campaign
to ban the manufacture of land-mines in March.
</P>
<P>
In a country where the number of landmines seems to have
surpassed that of the population, and an estimated 70,000 of a
total of about 12 million Angolans have lost their limbs or
suffered other devastating effects of landmines, Diana's death
means a lot, Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
Diana was planning to attend the internatinal conference
seeking a global ban on landmines which began in Oslo on
September 2.
</P>
<P>
Southern African leaders were urged to spare no effort to
attain the objective that Diana had fixed for herself.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa returned to Hong
Kong today after concluding his visit to Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of Tung's first overseas trip since he took

Mahathir Mohamad and Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Grants Uganda 56 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has decided to grant Uganda 56 million U.S. dollars in
the first year of a three-year program under the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily The New Vision today, the grant
followed an agreement reached between a visiting IMF team that
visited Uganda from August 19 to September 4 and the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team came to conclude negotiations that began in May
for the ESAF program for the 1997/98 to 1999/2000 period. The
first annual arrangement of the program covers the fiscal year
1997/98. The agreement is subjected to approval by IMF management
and executive board.
</P>
<P>
Ulrike Wilson, IMF resident representative in Uganda was
quoted as saying that the IMF executive board is expected to meet
in November this year.
</P>
<P>
She said,"Once the program is approved the first of the two
disbursements for this year will be made. This will be 28 m
dollars. The second disbursement will come after the mid term
review. The mission to review the mid term performance comes in
February 1998."
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the three-year arrangement is for 75 percent of
Uganda's quota in the IMF.
</P>
<P>
She said this was equal to about 140 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The focus of the program this year is on revenue measures
because last year's revenue collection was significantly below
program budget. It turned out some important new measures had to
be put in place to strengthen revenue performance," Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
She said this would be done through improving in the way Uganda
revenue authority operates and through reforming customs
administration.

<HEADLINE> Crew Return to Mir After Failing to Find Hole in Module </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Two cosmonauts returned to the
Russian Mir space station after a six-hour spacewalk today, during
which they failed to find the puncture in the Spektr scientific
module.
</P>
<P>
But the two men, Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyov and NASA
astronaut Michael Foale, had partial success in repositioning a
key solar panel.
</P>
<P>
They were ordered by mission control to re-enter the Mir
station after they tried unsuccessfully in locating the puncture.
</P>
<P>
The gash, which depressurized the module, was caused on June 25
in a collision between a Progress cargo craft and the orbital
station.
</P>
<P>
The punctured module is now airless and one of its panels was
destroyed and the remaining three were disconnected by the crew
who fled it immediately.
</P>
<P>
Today's spacewalk started around 0100 GMT and the two
cosmonauts tried for more than five hours during the spacewalk to
locate the hole.
</P>
<P>
Several more spacewalks would be needed to find and repair the
puncture which depressurized the module, said Korolyov Mission
Control outside Moscow.

BLANTYRE (Malawi), September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Southern
African Development Community (SADC) foreign ministers have urged

in the region, said South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo,
chairman of the SADC Ministerial Council at a two-day ministerial
meeting which ended here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis should be put on stakeholder participation in
determining the content and priorities of SADC protocols, he
said, adding that the protocols to be submitted to the Monday
summit will provide the foundation for regional integration and
development.
</P>
<P>
The protocols are to define the modalities, procedures and
institutions that will guide the group's further cooperation, he

<P>
Education, mining, tourism and human resource development will

The group summit will also find ways to bring peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional organization, mostly Commonwealth states,
will stress on closer economic ties within the sub-region, with
unified development policies, which will facilitate their
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Information exchange, enhancement of technological capacity,
common standards, environment protection, occupational health and
safety and the promotion of private sector participation will be
included in the protocols to be submitted to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The SADC summit is to find ways to maintain a sustainable
development through tighter ties among the member states.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also search out ways to cooperate with other
economic and political organizations in Africa and other
international organizations, among them the Organization of
African Unity (OAU),the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) and European Union (EU), the chairman said.
</P>
<P>

promoting economic integration towards a fully developed common
market.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of the
crude palm oil (CPO), tin and rubber closed the week all higher.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the CPO physicals market was supported on
export news that the State Trading Corporation of India is buying
between 6,000 and 12,000 tons of RBD (Refined, Bleached and
Deodorized) palm olein for September 10-25 shipment.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Wong, a private forecaster said Friday that August's palm
oil production was expected to increase 2.4 percent to 853,000
tons and August's stock level will be about 870,000 tons, which is
well-above the market's forecast of 840,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
September south closed the week at 1,360 ringgit (about 468.96
U.S. dollars) per ton, 10 ringgit (3.44 dollars) higher against
1,350 ringgit (465.51 dollars) per ton recorded at last week's
close.
</P>
<P>
The CPO market is expected to improve further next week despite
the weak ringgit as the market sentiment is still on a bullish
note with the surrounding positive fundamentals prompting the
commodity to enjoy encouraging demand, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), the tin price, which
broke its 14-month high at 15.76 ringgit (5.43 dollars) per kg on
Thursday, ended the week nine sen higher at 15.66 ringgit (5.4
dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The metal continued to see the absence of Japanese traders who
shied away in view of the wide discount between the KLTM and the
London Metal Exchange (LME) while European and local buyers were
active players.
</P>
<P>
Turnover fell to 468 tons this week from 796 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to lose some ground next week as
profit-taking will continue to depress market sentiment, dealers
said, adding that a downside potential is there, given the fact
that the metal was currently fetching a high premium.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the LME, which staged a long-running rally
this week, will play an important role in determining the
market's direction next week, they said.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market this week, October RSS One
jumped 5.50 sen to 264.50 sen (about 91.2 U.S. cents) per kg while
SMR 20 leaped six sen to 262.00 sen (about 90.3 U.S. cents) per
kg.
</P>
<P>
Middle East, China, India and Morocco were the main buyers
throughout this week, especially for SMR 20 grades.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for September 4 was at 199.38
Malaysian/Singapore cents against 195.57 cents on August 28.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average widened to 199.48 cents from 193.93
cents last week.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber market is expected to remain range-bound next
week with prices hovering around the 260 sen (about 89.6 U.S.
cents) per kg level.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Seek 2.1 Billion Dollar Aid for 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is likely to seek 2.1
billion U.S. dollars aid for the 1997-98 fiscal year, beginning
from July 1 this year, from the donors at the Aid Group meeting,
scheduled to be held here in early November, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the figures remained around two billion dollars in
the past several years, which means that the commitment of aid
depends on how much a country can absorb for its development,"
said a senior official of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that Dhaka would give priority to the construction
of the Ganges barrage, Rupsha bridge, Padma bridge, development of
the Mongla Port in its aid memorandum and will seek extended
amount of aid from the donors at the forthcoming Aid Group
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh will also propose to form a consortium comprising
the donor countries and agencies to construct the Ganges Barrage,
which is regarded by Dhaka as the key project to develop its
flood-prone northwestern region.
</P>
<P>
But, according to the Finance Ministry official, if the donors
wish to provide funds for construction of the Ganges Barrage or
Rupsha bridge, they will provide funds in additional to the normal
level of aid, given every year.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second time that the World Bank will organize
the annual meeting of the Aid Group in Dhaka on November 4-5. The
first such kind of meeting was held in Dhaka in 1973, two years
after this South Asian country's independence.
</P>
<P>
Since then, all previous meetings of the Aid Group for
Bangladesh were held in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the year's Aid Group meeting will be followed by a
two-day investors' conference on November 6-7, which is likely to
be participated by 30 to 35 representatives from globally reputed
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a large number of local investors will also take part
in the conference, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> EU to Help Southern Africa Clear Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYPE (Malawi), September 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union
has pledged to donate 2.07 million ECU to the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to aid the region in its
anti-personnel landmine clearance campaign.
</P>
<P>
This is an additional sum to the two million ECU granted to
SADC out of a total of 3.5 million ECU made available by the EU
to the UN for landmine clearance in various parts of the world,
Alfred Nzo, chairman of the sub-regional organization said here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, who is also foreign minister of South Africa, said at a
press conference after the conclusion of the SADC ministerial
council meeting in the eve of the Monday SADC summit, said that
the group is aimed at a total ban on anti-personnel landmines in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The southern Africa is one of the areas in the world where
landmines have posed as a dangerous threat to innocent people's
life, Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, one of the SADC members, alone, there are an
estimated 20 million landmines littered throughout the country,
exceeding the number of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
The death of Princess Diana in a car crash in Paris, with the
funeral to be held today, has added a high-profile impetus to the
landmine clearance campaign in the region, several attendants for
the ministers' conference said.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, Diana came to Angola as part of the
British Red Cross Campaign for Landmine Clearance.
</P>
<P>
According to Nzo, apart from the continued cooperation with
EU, SADC will also seek to tighten its ties with other regional
and international organizations, such as the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), the African Development Bank (ADB), and the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
An agreement on SADC-ADB cooperation is to be submitted to the
1997 SADC summit to be held on Monday, the SADC official said.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) fluctuated tremendously this week.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Composite Index rebounded to 840.42 points with
the return of local funds from the Independence day holiday
(September 1), but the index retreated to 675.15 two-days later on
persistent selling pressure by foreign investors who have been
able to deposit their shares with the Central Depository System
(CDS).
</P>
<P>
Local funds, in response to the call by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, aggressively bought up stocks on the
last day of trading this week, pushing the Index which tracks 100
quality stocks, to close the week at 821.59, or 17.19 points or
2.1 percent over last week's closing.
</P>
<P>
The Emas Index gained 11.70 to 231.18, the Industrial Index
rose 38.35 points to 1,657.58 and the Second Board Index recouped
27.27 points to 401.01.
</P>
<P>
The re-entry of local funds in the market on the closing day
was a surprise, causing foreign players who have been selling
heavily "to let stocks run".
</P>
<P>
Many analysts said from now, the market should stabilize
although there is still a possibility of further selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
They said with Mahathir's announcement of the lifting of
designated securities status on 100 Composite Index components,
coupled with the deferment of some huge projects in view of the
current external imbalance and the weaker ringgit, were all
positive reasons which will be attributable to the market's
stability.
</P>
<P>
The local stock market's slide recently was attributed to local
players being enticed to sell by the exaggerated bad sentiment and
rumors and increased foreign selling.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index is expected to make a comeback technically
to the 836 and 880 level with resistance noted at between 890 and
910, or 38 percent level below the all time high level of 1,332.
</P>
<P>
"A breakout at between the 880 and 908 level will catapult it
to the 1,018 resistance level," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The top 10 actives included Renong (up 34 sen to 3.34 ringgit
with 73.125 million shares traded), Berjaya Group (up nine sen to
1.78 ringgit with 65.144 million shares), Commerce Asset (down 24
sen to 3.40 ringgit with 63.089 million shares), Sime Darby (down
20 sen to 6.70 ringgit with 45.907 million shares) and Malaysian
Resources (up 67 sen to 3.02 ringgit with 44.754 million shares).
</P>
<P>
The weekly main board volume increased to 1,802.990 million
shares valued at 7.0357 billion ringgit (about 2.4258 billion U.S.
dollars) from 1,584.554 million shares worth 6.2005 billion
ringgit (2.1381 billion dollars) a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover decreased to 167.200 million shares
valued at 1.3260 billion ringgit (457.263 million dollars) from
197.236 million shares worth 1.5750 billion ringgit (543.129
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The total direct business transaction amounted to 165.428
million shares valued at 625.819 million ringgit (215.799 million
dollars) compared with 199.441 million shares worth 1.3153
billion ringgit (453.551 million dollars) last week.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Recover Body of Missing Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will make effort to retrace
the body of a navy commando who was missing during an operation
into Lebanon Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that the prime minister did not
rule out the possibility to release Iranian-backed Hezbollah
prisoners in exchange for the soldier's body, which was
reportedly taken away by Hezbollah from the scene of the fighting,
</P>
<P>
Some 11 Israeli navy commandos were killed and another was
missing Thursday night during a clash with Hezbollah gunmen north
of the Tyre in south Lebanon. The missing in the action is
believed to be dead, an Israeli army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
demanded the Lebanese Army and International Red Cross seek
the return of the commando's body. He also noted that military
inquiry is examing all stages of the operation with the
intelligence help.
</P>
<P>
The United States has promised to help in the search for the
missing commando, and it called on all sides in south Lebanon to
show restraint.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department official told Israel Radio that his
country has never opposed Israeli actions against terrorists
north of the "security zone", but "it must be remembered that
Israel is operating on Lebanese sovereign territory."
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 15-mile-wide "security zone" in South Lebanon
in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks by anti-Israeli
Hezbollah guerrillas who have been fighting to force Israel out
of the Lebanese territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Two crew members on the Russian
Mir space station today failed in their attempt to repair the
damage in the Spektr scientific module during a spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyov and NASA astronaut Michael
Foale were ordered by mission control to re-enter the Mir station
after they tried unsuccessfully to find a puncture in the module.
</P>
<P>
The damage was done on June 25 in a collision between a
Progress cargo craft and the orbital station, which forced a seal
off of the module from the main station.
</P>
<P>
The punctured module is now airless and one of its panels was
destroyed and the remaining three were disconnected by the crew
who fled it immediately.
</P>
<P>
Today's spacewalk started around 0100 GMT and the two
cosmonauts tried for more than five hours during the spacewalk to
locate the hole.
</P>
<P>
Several more spacewalks would be needed to find and repair the
puncture which depressurized the module, said Korolyov Mission
Control outside Moscow.

<HEADLINE> EU Requests U.S. to Change Satellite Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
warned the United States against violating world trade obligations
on satellite-based services.
</P>
<P>
The EU's executive body, the European Commission, requested the
U.S. side to change the rules issued on July 16 which would block
foreign operator's access to direct-to-home services and digital
satellite services in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The rules were said to have been adopted to implement the
commitments the United States made on satellite services made
under the Basic Telecoms Deal the World Trade Organization (WTO)
hammered out in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU member countries have been concerned about the
incompatibility of the rules with WTO, in particular with the
General Agreement on Trade in Services.
</P>
<P>
The EU warning followed a broad complaint last month about the
way the United States was implementing its general WTO
obligations.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Confident of Italy's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy will certainly be a
founding member of the European Economic and Monetary Union and
the European single currency euro, chief of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Renato Ruggiero said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a symposium on international strategies on
management in Cernobbio, a resort town near Lake Como, Ruggiero
said, "We are in the homestretch both for the creation of the euro
on time and for Italy's participation."
</P>
<P>
Italy is likely to continue to draw benefit from its ongoing
economic recovery, he added.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) has planned to launch the euro by
January 1, 1999. But scepticism is growing over whether the
deadline can be met as few members have been able to meet the
criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
An EU meeting in April and May 1998 will decide which countries
among the 15 EU members will qualify for the single currency at
its launch in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero said that he was optimistic about the economic
prospect in Italy and throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that he did not pay much attention to recent
turbulence on the international financial markets. "Capital comes
and goes, as is natural after having made so many economies grow,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: India Plunges Into Mourning for Mother Teresa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- News of the death of Mother
Teresa, widely hailed as the embodiment of love and compassion,
have plunged India into sorrow and grief.
</P>
<P>
The Mother, 87, breathed her last after a heart attack at 9:30
p.m. (local time) on Friday in Calcutta, capital of West Bengal
state.
</P>
<P>
President Kocheril Raman Narayanan and Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral led the nation in mourning the death of one who for
long years had come to be regarded as a legend in her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
Described the Mother as "an angel of mercy," Narayanan said
"such a one as her but rarely walks upon the earth."
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa, he said, had spread love and compassion
throughout the world and brought succor and relief to the sick,
the needy and the poorest of the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Though she was a world citizen, she was particularly Indian in
the true spirit of our culture and her passing away is an immense
loss to millions of our people," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Gujral, in his condolence message, said that
"Words fail me to express my sorrow. An apostle of peace and love,
Mother Teresa is no more with us."
</P>
<P>
The world, especially India, is poorer with her passing, the
prime minister said. "Hers was a life devoted to bringing love,
peace and joy to the people whom the world generally shuns," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Congress party President Sitaram Kesri, in his message,
described Mother Teresa as a symbol of the suffering humanity.
</P>
<P>
She was the mother of all poor children and handicapped, he
said, adding that her death was an irreparable loss for the whole
of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Pramod Mahajan, general secretary of the opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party, said Mother Teresa personified love and compassion
in its most sublime form and her work would be remembered by
generations to come.
</P>
<P>
West Bengal chief Minister Jyoti Basu also expressed deep grief
at the death of Mother Teresa, saying that his government had
given her all help in her work for the suffering humanity,
particularly for the children, orphans, disabled persons and
persons with incurable diseases.
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa, whose real name was Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, was
born in Skopje (now part of Macedonia), former Yugoslavia, on
August 27, 1910.
</P>
<P>
The daughter of an Albanian grocer, she was baptized at the age
of 18 and later sailed for India.
</P>
<P>
She made Calcutta her home where she set up the Missionaries of
Charity in late 1940s. The order now has more than 160 centers in
India which include schools, charitable dispensaries, homes for
lepers, orphans and the destitute.
</P>
<P>
She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Start Power Rationing on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Power rationing is to
start next Monday throughout Tanzania, according to a statement
from the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESO) available here
last night.
</P>
<P>
The statement said residential areas in Dar es Salaam and
Coastal regions will be divided into load shedding zones, each of
which will miss supply thrice a week from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.,
while power supply to industrial areas will be interrupted twice
a week also between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
TANECO regional managers have been instructed to draw power
rationing schedules in their areas.
</P>
<P>
TANECO acting Managing Director Kiato Iranga said in the
statement that the load shedding is inevitable following acute
depletion of water at the generation reservoirs in Iringa.
</P>
<P>
As of September 5, the Mtera Dam water level was merely 1.15
meters above the minimum level while the Kidatu Dam water level
was only 11.90 meters above the minimum level.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania experienced power rationing four years ago which
necessitated the installation of the multi-billion shillings gas
turbines at Ubungo in Dar es Salaam which injected about 40
megawatts to the national power grid.

<HEADLINE> Maradona Says He has Taken no Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Argentina soccer star
Diego Maradona denied Friday he has every taken drugs and said the
positive result of his doping test was tampered by his enemies in
the shadows.
</P>
<P>
"I'm dead inside. Until they tell me I can play again, I'm a
dead man," Maradona said on a television show.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Maradona made his public appearance
since he tested positive for drugs after a recent league
match. The third doping scandal may end his sparkling soccer
career.
</P>
<P>
Maradona insisted he was the victim of a "sinister" force.
</P>
<P>
"I swear on my daughters that I took nothing, and when I do
that I'm telling the truth," he said on the show Fenomeno Real.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine Football Association (AFA) has summoned Maradona
to testify before its sanctions committee next Tuesday. A second
test this week confirmed he tested positive for drugs after the
August 24 match, in which he scored a penalty point for his club
Boca Juniors.
</P>
<P>
"If I had taken cocaine I wouldn't have gone to the match.
Cocaine doesn't help but rather hinders you on the pitch -- I know
I would see four balls and eight defenders," he argued.
</P>
<P>
In a last ditch attempt to ward off punishment, Maradona's
lawyers have demanded a DNA check to verify the urine tested was
his, but it was not clear when this would be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Coppola, Maradona's manager who himself was arrested
on drugs charges last year, has said Maradona's drink may have
been spiked before the urine test.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Won Likely to Continue Its Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean currency won is
likely to continue to drop in value against the U.S. dollar this
month before stabilizing in mid-October, Korea Institute of
Finance (KIF) forecast today.
</P>
<P>
The KIF predicted that the won-dollar exchange rate will remain
stable from mid-October to the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
It said that the won may come under strong pressure this month,
mainly because of growing concerns over turmoil in the local
financial market and a slowdown in overseas borrowing by domestic
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
It also cited the ongoing depreciation of Southeast Asian
currencies and the weak Japanese yen as reasons for the won's
possible drop.
</P>
<P>
But the institute forecast that the supply of U.S. dollars
would greatly expand by around mid-October thanks to the package
the government announced on August 25 to stablize financial market.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea is also expected to actively intervene in the
Seoul foreign-exchange market this month to help prop up the won.
</P>
<P>
The won has depreciated about 7 percent against the
U.S. currency in local trading so far this year. The South Korean
currency broke the key-psychological resistance level of 905 won
to the dollar Friday.
</P>
<P>
Though there is room for further appreciation of the won after
mid-October, the forecast said that the central bank would not
allow the won to rise against the U.S. dollar, as it fears a
further weakening of the international competitiveness of South
Korean businesses.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Foreign Exchange Holdings Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign-exchange
holdings declined to 31.1 billion U.S. dollars last month from
33.6 billion dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea (BOK) attributed the drop, after a four-month
rise, mainly to the expansion in the central bank's supply of
foreign currency-denominated loans to domestic financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Most Korean financiers are facing serious difficulties in the
wake of the chain insolvencies and near-bankruptcies of large
conglomerates including Kia, Jinro and Hanbo.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts cited the BOK's disposal of enormous amounts of
foreign currency, in its bid to curb the surging won-dollar
exchange rate, as another factor behind the drop.
</P>
<P>
The basic won-dollar parity rate surged 13.60 won, or 1.5
percent, from 892 won per dollar at the end of July to 905.60 won
on September 5, as many financiers and private enterprises, who
feared a possible crisis in the domestic financial system, tried
to secure more foreign currencies, especially U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Market watchers are worried about a further drop of foreign
reserves because there are still unstable factors in the financial
markets.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Dwellers Suffer from Acute Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Dwellers in Bangladesh's capital
of Dhaka are suffering from an acute shortage of water, sources in
the Water Supply and Sewerage Authorities (WSSA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The water supply is about 40 percent short of the demand of the
ever growing population of the capital, they said.
</P>
<P>
The WSSA, an autonomous body responsible for operating the
sewerage system and supply of water in the metropolis, is now
supplying 860 million liters of water while the total requirement
is 1,350 million liters.
</P>
<P>
According to a United Nations report in June, Dhaka is among
the 50 largest cities in the world. Its population in 1996 stood
at nine million, making it the 22nd largest urban conglomeration.
</P>
<P>
Then UN report projected that Dhaka will continue to grow and,
by the year 2015, will have become the fifth largest city in the
world. At that time, its population will reach 19.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The WSSA has received hundreds of complaints from different
parts of the crowded city, the sources said, adding the whole city
is in the grip of water shortage.
</P>
<P>
The WSSA hardly could do anything with its limited resources
and networks to meet the increasing requirements of the millions,
a senior WSSA official said.
</P>
<P>
The water level has been going down by one meter every year due
to over extraction, the official said, adding that 98 percent of
the current water supply comes from ground water.
</P>
<P>
The existing system for procuring ground water has become
obsolete with the passage of time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are going to switch over to the surface water from the
ground water to overcome the crisis," he added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Inflation Declines: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The rate of inflation of Sri
Lanka is projected to be around 9.1 percent this year as against
the average inflation of 16 percent in the previous year,
according to the available indicators, Central Bank sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said this favorable development is due to improved
supply position of rice, vegetables, coconuts and subsidiary food
crops, lower increase in money supply and decline in interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Putting the index for August this year against that for
previous August, the indicated inflation is 7.1 percent, slightly
down from the 7.2 percent registered in the previous month, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
This is much lower than the inflation which stood as high as
16.8 percent at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The annual average inflation has been on a declining trend
since March this year when it reached a peak of 16.7 percent.
Furthermore, if the effect of administered price changes is
excluded, underlying inflation is estimated to be around 8.0
percent in August, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> One-Tenth Thailand's Plastics Factories Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 percent of
Thailand's plastics factories have closed down in the last two
months, mainly because of a slump in sales to the vehicle and
electrical appliance industries.
</P>
<P>
At least 10,000 workers have been laid off as a result of the
closures since the Thai currency's float on July 2.
</P>
<P>
Because of the economic downturn, demand for plastics from the
automotive industry and sales to appliance makers have each
plunged 40 percent, the Bangkok Post today quotes Sanan
Ang-ubolkul, president of Srithai Superware Plc, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sanan said exports have not benefited from the plunge in the
value of the baht because producers have to pay in dollars for
imported raw materials used in making plastic. Factories have been
selling unused machinery and other assets to get cash.
</P>
<P>
Stocks of plastic goods would be released soon to help reduce
storage costs, Sanan said, adding that companies have put
expansion on hold and are trying to make more value-added
products.
</P>
<P>
The industry is squeezed for cash as it has lost a major credit
line when 58 debt-ridden and mismanaged finance companies were
suspended by the government, and buyers have also defaulted on
payment to the factories, citing financial problems.
</P>
<P>
Plastics suppliers are now accepting payment only in cash.

BELGRADE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in

Council lifted sanctions on the country last October, said a
senior official here today.
</P>
<P>
Nebojsa Maljkovic, minister in charge of coordinating with

sectors such as electronic industry, oil industry, cement
industry, tobacco industry, shipbuilding industry, banking and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, External Trade Minister Borislav Vukovic noted that
Yugoslavia signed 1,757 agreements with foreign partners between

MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan hopes Japanese
businessmen to further invest in the country in order to widen
cooperation between the two nations, President Islam Karimov said
today in Uzbek capital Tashkent, Interfax agency reported.
</P>
<P>

Taro Aso replied that his government pays much attention to
developing cooperation with the Central Asian countries, and
Japanese businessmen are ready for further action because they
consider Uzbekistan a good market.
</P>

The two countries also signed today documents on Japanese
government providing about 439 million yen (about 3.66
million U.S. dollars) to Uzbekistan in farming equipments and

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Housing to Recover in 3 Years: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Thai
government's Land Department predicted that it will take at least
three years before supply and demand of housing can achieve
balance.
</P>
<P>
The housing market has been swamped by a huge oversupply of
stock, with many real estate consultants reporting that the market
has about 300,000 unoccupied units and 100,000-150,000 units
remain unsold.
</P>
<P>
This would be slowly absorbed by the market over the next two
to three years as the number of new projects was falling
significantly, said Vichien Rattanapirapong, director general of
the Land Department.
</P>
<P>
Developers are starting fewer projects this year because of the
housing oversupply and the central bank's lending squeeze.
</P>
<P>
Vichien said it is the worst crisis for the real estate
industry, adding that developers have painful experiences from the
property slump and oversupply.
</P>
<P>
Since the Gulf war, listed developers have acquired huge
amounts of land and have thus been burdened with high monthly
interest payments.
</P>
<P>
Despite the market oversupply, these developers will have to
develop at least part of their land, otherwise they would be
unable to repay loans to their creditors, Vichien said.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's jobless rate remained
unchanged at 9.0 percent in August from the previous month,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
In August, the country's employment rose by an estimated 55,000
for a six straight monthly increase. The growth far exceeded the
expectations of financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The markets expected an increase between 30,000 and 45,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The latest gain has brought to 277,000 the number of jobs
created so far this year, the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, August growth in employment was accompanied by a similar
increase in the labor force, which left the number of people
looking for work little changed from July.
</P>
<P>
There were employment gains among both adults and youths in
August.
</P>
<P>
Employment among adults has been strengthening for several
months. Since February, gains total 127,000 for adult men and
112,000 for adult women.
</P>
<P>
For youths, the gains are more recent. August marked the third
consecutive month of growth with gains totaling 52,000 since May
-- the largest sustained increase since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Job growth in August was equally split between full- and
part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
Since February, full-time employment has grown 1.7 percent,
while part-time gained 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the growth rate of part-time employment twice that of
full-time, the percentage of workers with part-time hours has
risen to 19.4 percent from 19.1 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
In August, employment in the private sector grew by an
estimated 87,000, while the public sector declined by 32,000.

</P>
<P>
The project is being implemented by TOTAL Oil Company of

</P>
<P>
The project includes the laying of 238 kilometers of

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Supports Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh Friday finally agreed to back the draft constitution,
easing a political tension that might disturb the six-party
coalition.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister vowed to seek amendments to the
draft later after the Parliament approves it.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit's announcement Friday that the coalition will
unanimously support the draft constitution came amid the mounting
pressure from the urban public, the military and within the
coalition, local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit made this announcement in the wake of an urgent
meeting of coalition party leaders held about one hour later after
the Chart Pattana Party (CPP), the second largest coalition
partner, broke rank to announce it would back the draft
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit Thursday held consultations with leading Thai
businessmen, Army Chief Gen. Chettha Thananaro and Police Chief
Pracha Promnok, who urged the prime minister to support the draft
constitution to ease the political tension and prevent the
country's economy from plunging further.
</P>
<P>
CPP Secretary General Suwat Liptapallop said that the
government's decision to accept the new charter would ease
political pressure on the coalition from the public and the
government now has more breathing space to tackle the country's
economic problems.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Sets Goals to Balance County-Level Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Financial authorities of the
Tibet Autonomous Region have asked treasury officials at the
county level to balance their budget by the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
The call was made at a regional financial conference held here
recently, with a view to advancing local economy into next century.
</P>
<P>
Local economic analysis indicates that Tibet is likely to have
a revenue income of 600 million yuan in the year 2,000, more than
double that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
By then, 11 counties would achieve a revenue exceeding 10
million yuan each while others are expected to see their treasury
grow at the rate of 15 percent each year in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The present sound economic situation and the continual support
from the central government make it possible for Tibet to realize
its budget balance goal, which in turn would provide financial
support for the overall development of the region, according to
local economic experts.

<HEADLINE> IAEA Adopts Convention on Safety of Radioactive Fuel, Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A five-day conference of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ended here today with
the adoption of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management.
</P>
<P>
About 300 representatives from 84 countries and five
international organizations at the conference held hot debates
focusing on how to guarantee the safety of radioactive materials
being transported.
</P>
<P>
Many noted that they should at least be informed when the
materials are being transported through their territories.
</P>
<P>
But others, mostly Western nations, opted to continue the
current ruling that notification be given on a voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
The final version of the convention received support from 62
countries in a show of hands, and is available for official
signing at the IAEA's 41st general conference which will begin
here on September 29.
</P>
<P>
The signatories will have to submit reports on how to implement
the convention in their countries.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA started to attach great importance to the management
of radioactive fuel and waste at its 38th general conference held
in 1994 when it decided to work out an international convention in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
A group comprising law and technology experts was set up by the
IAEA in March, 1995, to work the convention text with
environmental protection being a major theme.

<P>
SAN JOSE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Migration
authorities detained 32 Ecuadoran nationals who pretended to enter
Nicaragua en route to the United States, the authorities announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorans, 20 men and 12 women, who had IDs and passports,
traveled in the box of a cargo truck covered with a canvas,
accompanied by a driver and two traffickers, all Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
Each Ecuadoran had paid a sum of 300 U.S. dollars to the
traffickers to be taken to Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The group entered Costa Rica through the Panamanian border.
</P>
<P>
Their migratory documents registered their entrance to Panama,
but not their exit or their entrance to Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican migration authorities decided to send them back
to Panama, where the authorities of that country will decide if
they should be returned to their country of origin.

XIAMEN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- AlliedSignal Aerospace, one of
the world's leading suppliers of aircraft components, is making
inroads into the fast-growing Chinese market to capture a
significant share of the booming aerospace business.
</P>
<P>
The company will provide wheels and brakes for the five

<HEADLINE> Mao's Model Village Becomes County's Top Taxpayer (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Dazhai Village, which was
named a rural model by late Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong in the
1960s and 70s, has joined the market competition and become the
No. 1 taxpayer in Xiyang County, northern Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the village's properties were valued at 41 million
yuan, with an average per-capita income of 2,100 and pretax
profits of 1.64 million yuan. It paid the highest tax among all
the 423 villages in this moderately backward, agriculture-based
county.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the village has developed both agricultural and
industrial sectors, relying on its renowned "Dazhai Spirit" which
champions hard work.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1996 period, the village increased its
industrial output value from 2.6 million yuan to 36.2 million
yuan, while its grain output stood at 320,000 kg and the forest
coverage rate of the village's Hutou hill reaches more than 65
percent.
</P>
<P>
Villagers attributed the fast industrial development to the
setting-up of the Dazhai Economic Development Corporation in
1992. The company now owns a number of firms which produce wool
garments, shirts and cement, and a transport company.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has named Dazhai's industrial and
trade park as "National Model Zone for East-West Cooperation Among
Township Enterprises."

The speedy economic growth has improved the welfare of the
villagers. Currently, their per-capita residential space stands at
22 sq m, and their per-capita savings amounts to 1,056 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The villagers now enjoy free education for school-aged
children, pensions for the aged, free coal-supply, free
health-care, and cash prizes for those who enter universities and
secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
Dazhai residents no longer have to fetch water from far away,
manually transport fertilizer to farmland, or walk a long distance
to see doctor, since running water, village-owned vehicles and a
village clinic are now available.
</P>
<P>
However, the villagers are aiming higher, and are preparing for
a new round of development by establishing more industries with
funds from other parts of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province, home of the
late Chinese leader Mao Zedong, has introduced a market mechanism
for building traffic infrastructures including highways, railways
and water transport facilities.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, the provincial government has given up
the former practice of merely depending on state investment by
adopting a new, multi-formed investment method.
</P>
<P>
Stockholding and foreign funds have been used to develop the
infrastructures, on the principle of "those who invest could
benefit, and those who benefit should invest," according to local
officials in charge of transport.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the new policies have attracted a total of over 16
billion yuan of funds from the central and local governments as
well as from many domestic and overseas investors for building a
number of road, railway and port projects.

BUENOS AIRES, September 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 32 people were
killed and 200 were injured when the roof and a wall of a football
stadium collapsed in Ciudad del Este early today, some 330
kilometers east of Asuncion, the Paraguayan capital.
</P>
<P>
Information received from Asuncion said that the metallic
structure of the stadium roof and a 70-meter long wall collapsed
because of a tornado and rainstorm that hit the zone when some
4,000 people were gathered in the February 3 Stadium for a
political rally to mark the close of the Colorado Party's campaign
to name a presidential candidate for the May 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
The Telam Argentine state news agency reported that the
Paraguayan government decreed a three-day mourning in the Alto
Parana department, where Ciudad del Este locates, and the
suspension of the primary elections next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy ordered that four
transport planes and five ambulances be sent to the zone to assist
and transport the injured to hospitals.

<HEADLINE> EU-Ukrainian Summit Opens to Deepen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 5 (Xinhua) -- It is a strategic goal for
Ukraine to integrate with Europe and eventually gain the European
Union (EU) membership, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said at
the first EU-Ukrainian summit here today.
</P>
<P>
The yearly summit is also attended by Jean-Claude Junker,
Luxembourg's prime minister who holds the present EU presidency,
and European Commission (EC) Chairman Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
Junker said Ukraine has to deepen its economic and political
reforms in order to join the organization, adding that EU would
continue to help the East European nation with its reforms.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is one of the largest recipients of EU aid among the
new independent states, Junker said, and EU has promised to offer
another 530 million ECU to Ukraine before 2000.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also spotlighted cooperation on developing
Ukraine's nuclear energy. Santer disclosed that the EC has decided
to donate 100 million ECU to repair the sarcophagus burying the
Chernobyl No. 4 reactor which exploded 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Santer added that the precondition for the grant is that
Ukraine guarantees nuclear safety by completely closing down the
Chernobyl plant by 2000 as agreed by the former Soviet republic and
the Group of Seven industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
The two parties agreed that the most important direction for EU
aid is to increase the capacities of the Rivne and Khmelynytsky
nuclear power plants, which are located in western Ukraine.

CHANGSHA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Changsha, capital of central
Chine's Hunan Province, recently launched a greening drive
designed to improve its ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The city government plans to build within about four years a
green belt around the city, with a radius of 20 km.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for all city squares and various other
locations to be covered with vegetation.
</P>
<P>
A special team headed by Changsha Mayor Yuan Hankun will guide
the work of the greening project. The city has already provided
100 million yuan (12 million US dollars) in funding for the drive.
</P>
<P>
Changsha, one of the first 24 cities the State Council has
listed as famous ancient cities, is home to Mount Yuelu which sits
beside the Xiangjiang River in the city suburbs. Experts note that
Changsha has great potential for ecological development.
</P>
<P>
Green areas currently cover some 32 percent of Changsha's total
land area, or 10 percent more than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Hunan Province, one of the nation's major timber producers,
currently enjoys a forest coverage rate of some 51.1 percent, or

<HEADLINE> China's Leading Industrial Base Banks on Shareholding  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The shareholding system just
got a vote of confidence in China's Liaoning Province, the
country's largest industrial base, when the deputy general manager
of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Wu Yalun, brought some good news
about the performance of Liaoning's listed companies.
</P>
<P>
"Of all the firms listed in Shanghai, the 38 from Liaoning were
among the best," Wu told Governor Wen Shizhen.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that the performance of these enterprises means hope
for state-owned enterprises that are having difficulties.
</P>
<P>
All large state-owned enterprises in Liaoning are to become
shareholding entities through joint-stock or incorporation and as
many of them as possible will be listed, except for some strategic
industries and some infrastructure industries.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is the leading industrial base of China, with 1,000
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, or about a tenth
of the national total. This concentration made it a major economic
powerhouse during the years of the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
However, these state-owned enterprises, like those elsewhere,
have failed to adapt to market competition and have been mired in
financial difficulties since China began its market reforms in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said during an inspection tour of
Liaoning that a greater effort must be made to get most of the
state-owned enterprises out of difficulties in three years, but he
said he is positive about the work Liaoning has done.

<TEXT>
<P>
Liaoning was one of the first provinces or municipalities to
try shareholding and has more than 200 joint-stock companies. It
has 38 listed firms. Nearly 80 percent of these have good economic
returns.
</P>
<P>
The shareholding system will help improve management and boost
productivity, the governor says. It provides new financial
resources needed for equipment renovation and technology imports.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 alone, Liaoning completed more than 140 technical
renovation projects with funds raised through shares. Since last
year, the listed companies have raised 6.67 billion yuan by
issuing shares.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Danshi, a company official, told Xinhua that "every day
dozens of our shareholders call in to inquire about the well-being
of our company and this makes me and all the workers feel obliged
to do our best to improve our business record."
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do a good job, we'll feel terrible for our
investors," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Sisheng, a division chief of the provincial planning
commission, said that the shareholding system is an appropriate
organizational form for state-owned enterprises in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Lin Muxi, deputy director of the economic research institute of
Liaoning University, agreed and added that the system is a good
combination of public ownership and the market economy.
</P>
<P>
However, whether the system will produce the desired effects
depends on government's structural reforms, including its role in
policy-making, and reforms in the social security system and other
sectors.

<HEADLINE> Hingis, Williams Advance to U.S. Open Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Martina Hingis of
Switzerland and unseeded Venus Williams of the United States
advanced to the women's final of the 10.12 million U.S. dollars
U.S. Open tennis championships Friday after achieving victories in
semifinals at Flushing, New York.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Hingis moved into the position by beating sixth
seed Lindsay Davenport of the United States in straight sets, 6-2,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Williams fought off two match points in the
third set tiebreak and rallied for a 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 7-6 (9-7)
victory over No. 11 Irina Spirlea of Romania.
</P>
<P>
In the first semifinals Friday, Hingis avenged a three-set loss
to Davenport in the semifinals of the Acura Classic in Manhattan
Beach, California, last month, one of her only two defeats in 64
matches this year.
</P>
<P>
She was successful moving Davenport from side to side to set up
easy winners and frustrated her repeatedly with drop shots.
</P>
<P>
Davenport got off to a strong start, breaking Hingis in the
opening game of the match. But after she hold for a 2-0 lead,
Hingis put her game in high gear and won the next six games to
take the set.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, each player was broken on her first two
service games. However, Hingis held for a 3-2 lead finally and
broke Davenport for the sixth consecutive.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon match, Williams, who needed two hours and 42
minutes to defeat Spirlea, is the first unseeded female player in
the open era to reach the U.S. Open final and the first
African-American woman to reach a Grand Slam final since Zina
Garrison at Wimbledon in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Spirlea built a 6-4 lead in the third-set tiebreak and appeared
ready to advance to her first Grand Slam final. However, Williams
connected on a spectacular backhand winner that barely caught the
sideline and Spirlea netted a forehand to tie it at 6-6. Williams
wasted a match point at 7-6, but Spirlea netted a backhand to set
up match point and then went wide with a backhand to give Williams
the dramatic victory.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia and Daniel Vacek of the
Czech Republic captured their second Grand Slam doubles title of
the year by defeating the Swedish team of Jonas Bjorkman and
Nicklas Kulti, 7-6 (10- 8), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In women's doubles semifinals, Gigi Fernandez of the United
States and Natasha Zvereva of the Belarus defeated Nicole Arendt

<HEADLINE> Restructuring Invigorates Public Bus Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The public bus sector in
Pudong is expected to erase losses and earn a profit this year
following the merger of the state-owned public bus company and
listed companies.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact the Pudong New Area is a national pacesetter
creating many economic miracles, public buses serving the areas
have long operated in a loss-making situation.
</P>
<P>
A bold plan to merge public bus companies with market-oriented
listed companies was introduced some 20 months ago to improve the
situation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, three shareholding public bus companies have been
formed on the basis of equity from the former Pudong Public
Transportation Company, five locally listed companies and a
company listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The reform has thus far proved successful, with the new
companies gaining an increasing market orientation and flexible
operations.
</P>
<P>
For example, the recently incorporated Guanzhong company found
that the Lingzhao Residential Areas lacked public transport, and
within a mere 24 hours added a new route to the district. The new
route would have taken months and possibly even years to organize
under the old state planning system.
</P>
<P>
Some 37 public bus routes and 511 buses had been added to the
system by May of this year, raising available services in Pudong to
101 routes and 1,267 buses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the administrative staff has cut dramatically to
improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The public bus sector is not expected to totally erase the 23
million yuan (2.77 million US dollars) in losses recorded last
year, but will nonetheless record some profits for this year.

ATHENS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis
said tonight Athens' Balkan policy and a stronger Greek economy
through joining European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) were
basic conditions for turning northern Greece into a development
center for the Balkan Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address to this year's International Trade
Fair in the northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki, Simitis said
that another condition for uplifting northern Greece into its
central Balkan role was the promotion of infrastructure networks
in transport, communications, energy, and technology, as well as
stock market and banking facilities.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Greece's contribution to the promotion of peace,
security and cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The success of our policy in the Balkans depends on
strengthening our economy, its competitiveless, its ability to
participate in time in the third phase of the EMU," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a condition for Greece's far-reaching Balkan plan, Simitis
laid emphasis on measures designed to strengthen Greece's social
fabric, such as administrative devolution and cohesion,
educational reform, health care and welfare. He stressed at the
same time the need for security in the border regions against the
adverse effects of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
As for the prospects of Greece's economy in 1998, he said that
1998 would be a difficult year, the year of the big push forward,
in which the steps already made would have to be completed,
entering a "dynamic orbit."

<P>
NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Global semiconductor sales
surpassed 11.61 billion U.S. dollars in July, a 13.3 percent
increase over the same period in 1996, according to the
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).
</P>
<P>
July's sales -- 1.367 billion dollars higher than July 1996 --
continue a growth trend beginning from May, when 1997 sales
exceeded May 1996 sales by 167 million dollars. Sales for June
1997 surpassed June 1996 sales by 807 million dollars, the
California-based SIA said in its monthly Global Sales Report
issued today.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic year-to-year change occurred in the Americas
market, which experienced a 19.4 percent increase to 3.845 billion
dollars in sales for July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sales in the Asia-Pacific market hit 2.531 billion dollars in

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Ambassador Asks Israel to Pull Out of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese ambassador to
Washington today required Israel to pull its forces out of
southern Lebanon a day after an Israeli commando raid ended in
failure with nine Israelis killed by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for Israel to re-think its presence in southern
Lebanon and pull out its forces," Mohammed Shatah told reporters
after he called at the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief of staff Amnon Shakak said an Israeli commando
force which landed on the Lebanese coast north of Tyre was blown
up when explosives they were carrying were detonated during an
ambush by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Shatah said the incident showed the situation in
southern Lebanon could not be resolved by an Israeli presence
there. Israel maintains a so-called security zone in southern
Lebanon designed to protect its frontier from guerrilla attack.
</P>
<P>
Shatah reaffirmed his government's policy that if Israel
withdrew from southern Lebanon, the Lebanese army would assume
control there, which would end the reasons for the violence in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Foley called for
maximum restraint by all parties after the explosion incident in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very delicate moment in the Middle East, throughout
the Middle East, including in Lebanon, and we urge all the parties
to exercise maximum restraint," he said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to see an escalation of the cycle of
violence. So we need a defusing of tensions in southern Lebanon,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will travel to the Middle
East next week, visiting Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt,
Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia, in an attempt to revive the peace
process that has been suspended since early March.
</P>
<P>
A visit to Lebanon has not yet been decided, but the issue will
certainly come up when Albright holds talks with leaders of Israel
and Syria during her first trip to the region.

</P>
<P>
Out of the total 579 aircraft in its stock, 48 will be retired
by the end of 1998, and another 57 will be taken in by the end of

<HEADLINE> UN Inspector: Progress in Disarming Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The chief U.N. weapons
inspector said today that progress has been achieved in disarming
Iraq of mass destruction weapons with cooperation from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, chief of the United Nations Special Commission
on Iraq (UNSCOM) charged with removing the Iraqi mass-destruction
weapons, arrived here today for a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters upon his arrival, he said the major
progress that was made in the area of removing rockets during the
past five weeks has led to significant results.
</P>
<P>
Butler expressed relief over the intensive efforts exerted by
the two sides to meet the agenda that was agreed upon during his
previous and first visit to Iraq as UNSCOM chief five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
He said he has a good impression about the intensive work of
the Iraqi government since his previous visit.
</P>
<P>
Butler replaced Rolf Ecues as executive chairman of the UNSCOM
on July 1. Ecues had complained of non-cooperation from Iraq,
while Baghdad rejected the charge.
</P>
<P>
A UNSCOM report to be tabled to the U.N. Security Council on
October 11 will be objective and in the interests of the Iraqi
people if Iraq complies with the previously concluded agreements,
Butler said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq since 1990 will not be
lifted before the UNSCOM verifies that Iraq has destroyed all its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Butler pointed out that the report be compiled only after his
second round of talks with the Iraqi side under Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
Butler went on to say that he would inquire of the Iraqi side
whether it used any of the banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the mission of the monitoring and
inspection officials is to find out the truth.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors' team of the U.N. special Commission on Iraq
(UNSCOM), comprising some 150 experts, is to make sure that Iraq
is no longer possessing chemical and biological weapons or capable
of producing long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
During his previous visit to Iraq, Butler reached an agreement
with the Iraqi authorities on the working plan for the removal of
the Iraqi ballistic, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
At least five UN inspection teams have come to Baghdad since
last July.
</P>
<P>
Iraq hopes that Butler's visit will yield a recommendation for
lifting the U.N.-imposed sanctions or easing the embargo on Iraq.

NAIROBI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today said that 5,000 elector's cards had been fraudulently
printed and distributed in Baringo Central Constituency in a bid
to undermine the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
At a rare press conference held here, the president noted that
thousands of counterfeit elector's cards are suspected to be
circulating around the country with the purpose to have the
elections dismissed as a sham.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that his government will not condone any "monkey
business" ahead of the elections and emphasized that he is
personally committed to ensuring free and fair elections later
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan head of state displayed to the media one of the
bogus cards which is an exact replica of the voter's card issued

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Believes Russian Missiles Delivery on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government
believes that surface-to-air missiles S-300 contracted to be
bought from Russia will be deployed in Cyprus on schedule despite
Turkish threats and acts, a government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is searching recently commercial ships passing through
the Bosporus Strait and suspected of carrying missile components
in an effort to prevent S-300's deployment in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides told his daily press
briefing that the contract signed with Russian manufacturers
"secures safe transport and deployment of the S-300 missiles" on
the island, expected in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that these surface-to-air missiles are part of
the government's necessary measures to bolster its defense.
</P>
<P>
The missile deal, which was reached in January, has enraged
Turkey and Turkish Cypriots and Ankara has threatened to launch
military strikes against Cyprus if the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has repeatedly said that the deal could
be canceled if Turkey and Turkish Cypriots agree to Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides' proposal for demilitarization of the
island, or if there is substantial progress on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting recent Turkish inspections of ships sailing through
the Bosporus Straits from the Black Sea to the Aegean,
Christofides said the Cypriot government believes that
international treaties should be respected and observed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said Cyprus will investigate the press
reports that the secret services of the U.S., Israel and
Azerbaijan are providing Turkey with information of the S-300
possible transport to Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Air France Head Resigns in Quarrel with Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Christian Blanc, the president
of the French national carrier Air France, announced today that he
will quit his job because of his dispute with the government over
the privatization of the air company.
</P>
<P>
This brought to an end a week-long quarrel between him and
Lionel Jopin's Socialist government and Communist Transport
Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot. Blanc strongly advocates the
privatization but it is stiffly opposed by Jospin and Gayssot,
whose parties promised during the last legislative campaign to
stop the privatization process launched by the former rightwing
government of Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
In a statement announcing his withdrawal from the presidency of
Air France, Blanc, who was nominated to the post by the former
rightwing government of Edouard Balladur, said that privatization
"is the only way" to ensure the development of Air France.
</P>
<P>
He said the state must sell more than 50 percent of the
stocks of Air France, a demand rejected by Jospin who insists that
the state must maintain a majority of the stocks to keep the
company ``the last great Western transport enterprise with a
public majority of stocks.''
</P>
<P>
Blanc insisted that privatization of Air France would bring
about solid alliance with other international air companies which
buy its stocks, to make the air company one of the best in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The French presidential office today expressed regret over the
resignation of Blanc, and again called for an adaptation of the
French economy to the changing world economic situation.
</P>
<P>
``It remains a key stake for France which should pursue in this
field the indispensable efforts of modernization and adaptation of
the company,'' said the Elysee Palace in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn said today that the
state will open part of the stocks of Air France to the market,
but stressed that ``privatization is not on the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
In an article published in the Communist daily l"Humanite'' on
Tuesday, Gayssot presented the formula of ``neither privatization,
nor status quo'' for innovating Air France.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission adopted a French plan in 1994 to
privatize Air France at a value of 20 billion francs (4 billion
U.S. dollars), on the condition that the French government
participate in the privatization process.
</P>
<P>
``We don't demand that a enterprise should be private or
public, but that it should be competitive and that it follow the
rules of the market,'' said the commission today in reaction to
the resignation of Blanc.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Lodge Complaint Against Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon said it will lodge a
complaint against Israeli violation of truce with the five-nation
ceasefire committee regarding the heavy fighting in south Lebanon
early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official National News Agency quoted Lebanese
Foreign Ministry officials as saying that the complaint will be
heard at a meeting of the committee expected to hold within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Israeli soldiers were killed, four others wounded, and
one missing when Lebanese army and resistance fighters ambushed a
16-member Israeli commando who landed on the village of Nsariyyeh,
about 45 kilometers north of the Israeli border in attempt to
explode a Shiite Movement Amal base near the village, the news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the battle, a Lebanese army position was hit and a
Lebanese woman and a baby girl were killed, six civilians wounded.
</P>
<P>
The officials considered the death of the girl who was then in
a car and the injuries of others as gross violations by Israel of
true understanding reached in April last year, saying that the
Lebanese delegation of the committee is waiting for a detailed
report on Israeli aggression to make a formal complaint.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire committee, made up of delegates from the United
States, France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon, was established under
the true accord brokered by the U.S. to end a 16-day Israeli blitz
of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The committee is charged with overseeing the adherence to the
truce accord which prohibits attacks on civilians on both sides of
the border.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Safeguards Necessity of Cross-border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said today that cross-border military attack in
southern Lebanon may not be wrong despite the failure of such an
attempt last night.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio quoted Netanyahu as saying that it is too early
to draw a conclusion if Thursday's operation in which 12 Israeli
soldiers were killed went wrong, saying such attempts are always
heavily risky.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the comment after a meeting of inner security
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The 12 Israeli navy commandos were killed last night in
fighting with Lebanese troops and guerrillas as they were making
their way to a target in an operation beyond the
1,000-square-kilometer "security zone".
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman said Lebanon is responsible for the
return of the bodies. Four other commandos were hurt in the fight
and one of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the "security zone" in South Lebanon in 1985 to
prevent cross border attacks by anti-Israeli
guerrillas. Hezbollah, a Muslim Shiite movement backed by Iran,
has been battling to force Israel out of this buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman said, during his visit to the
wounded navy commandos in a hospital, that Israel must negotiate
with Syria if it wants to insure calm on the northern border and
the only way to end the conflict in south Lebanon is through such
dialog.

keep off Sierra Leone's territorial waters and airspace as it is
enforcing the embargo approved by the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The force is to "take any necessary measures against any ship,
vehicle or aircraft violating the ECOWAS decisions", it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the force reportedly fired shells
on two container ships which were trying to berth in Freetown to
unload rice and other foodstuffs on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The junta, which seized power in the May 25 coup, has accused
ECOMOG of killing some 50 civilians and seriously wounding nearly
20 others during the discriminate bombardment.
</P>
<P>
In an immediate reaction Thursday, ECOMOG Commander
Major-General Victor Malu denied the accusation, saying that the
force was enforcing the embargo ordered by ECOWAS last week.
</P>
<P>
"This final warning has become necessary in view of the
continuous attempt by some unscrupulous shippers to violate the
ECOWAS embargo in total disregard for the Heads of State and
Government of the sub-region," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It warned, "Any ship seen violating the ECOWAS economic
embargo shall be doing so at their risk as they will be attacked
by the ECOMOG forces."
</P>
<P>
However, vessels bringing goods meant for humanitarian
purposes will be exempted after they have been duly inspected by
ECOMOG forces, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The embargo, according to last week's ECOWAS summit in Abuja,
Nigeria, is part of the sub-regional effort "to restore the
democratically elected government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
to power as soon as possible".
</P>
<P>
Items covered by the "general and total embargo" are all
supplies of petroleum products, arms and military vehicles and
equipment to Sierra Leone, including police equipment and related
spare parts.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, ECOWAS leaders ordered that member states shall
prohibit any and all traffic from entering the territory or
territorial waters of Sierra Leone, carrying such goods.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS members are also required to prohibit all members of
the "illegal regime", military officers, as well as members of
their families, and other persons directly or indirectly
connected with the regime, from entering their respective
territories.
</P>
<P>
While sale or supply of the listed goods to Sierra Leone is
banned, member states have to prevent any activities by their
nationals or on their territories which would promote the export
or transshipment of commodities or products originating in
Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Iraq Sign Contracts Under Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Holding Company for
Food Industries today signed three contracts worth 17 million
U.S. dollars with Iraq for the supply of household materials.
</P>
<P>
Under the contracts, which are the first between the two sides
under the second phase of the oil-for-food deal, Egypt will export
to Iraq 23,000 tonnes of shortening, soap and detergents.
</P>
<P>
Signatories to the contracts were Chairman of the Egyptian
company Abdusattar Nasseb and Chairman of the Iraqi Public Company
for Food Trade Yousef el-Anni.
</P>
<P>
The contracts would be effective soon after their approval by
the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Under the first phase of the Iraqi-U.N. deal, the Egyptian
company had been contracted to export to Iraq shortening, sugar,
soap and detergents worth 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council agreed early June to extend the
agreement allowing Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars in oil for
another six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies.
</P>
<P>
The deal is an exemption from the U.N. sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. U.N. diplomats have said they will
not consider lifting the sanctions until they are satisfied that
Iraq has fully cooperated with UN arms inspectors.

<HEADLINE> British Defense Secretary on Bosnia Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
George Robertson has raised the possibility that the NATO-led
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia might be extended beyond the
current mandate in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a London meeting Thursday evening, Robertson said,
"I believe the international community should be reluctant to
leave a job half done after such a significant investment."
</P>
<P>
Though Robertson did not acknowledge that the mandate would
have to be extended, British government officials were quoted as
saying that Britain wanted other NATO members to address the
possibility that extension of the mandate would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
This crucial issue could be discussed at a meeting of NATO
defense ministers in the Dutch city of Maastricht in early
October, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
If the "follow-on" force in Bosnia were agreed, Robertson said,
"it will have to be NATO-led, with NATO-led credibility, and with
all the major players sharing the risks on the ground."

<HEADLINE> 3 Pro-Kurdish Activists Expelled by Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Istanbul police today
deported three pro-Kurdish foreigners, saying their activities
constituted a violation of Turkey's law.
</P>
<P>
An Italian diplomat in Ankara was among the three deportees,
who were taken into custody Thursday along with other 18
pro-Kurdish activists, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
These activists were detained by police when they tried to
hold a press conference in defiance of a warning.
</P>
<P>
Two diplomats from Italy and Britain were freed soon after
detention. The remaining foreign detainees will not be deported
until Sunday, police said.
</P>
<P>
A group of foreigners, mostly Europeans, arrived in Turkey
recently under a "Peace Train" plan to rally support for the
Kurds living in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government had tried to abort the plan, but some
activists managed their way into the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish issue is a long-standing problem annoying the
Turkish government. The outlawed Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) has
been fighting a 13-year guerrilla war against the Turkish
government in an attempt to establish an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey.

LAGOS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today called on the
country's public and private sectors to make joint efforts in the
building of a self-reliance economy.
</P>
<P>
Various progressive policies are being implemented under the
philosophy of guided deregulation and fiscal discipline so as to
build a solid economy, said Oladipo Diya, Chief of General Staff.
</P>
<P>
"The federal government is optimistic about the future of our
great nation," added Diya, who is also Vice-Chairman of the
Provisional Ruling Council, Nigeria's highest policy-making body.
</P>
<P>
Diya was speaking at the 10-day 1997 Lagos State Annual Trade
Fair which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair, tagged as "EKO EXPO '97", is held under the
theme of Lagos State at 30 -- Economic Growth and Development
through Public and Private Sectors' Initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of local companies and those from several other
neighboring states are at the fair promoting their products
manufactured with domestic resources, as well as services
available in the state.
</P>
<P>
Lagos State Military Administrator, Mohamed Marwa, said his
state had adopted a number liberalized policies to encourage the
development of medium-sized and small enterprises, tourism and
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
He urged domestic and foreign investors to come to the state

accounts for over 60 percent of the total value of industrial
investments in the six major industrial centers of Nigeria and
over half of the country's foreign trade.
</P>

With an estimated population of 10 million, Lagos also boasts
the largest seaport in west Africa, making it a sub-regional
shipping center.

<HEADLINE> International Conference on Europe's Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VILNIUS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The international conference
named Coexistence of Nations and Good Neighborly Relations -- the
Guarantee of Security and Stability in Europe opened today in
Lithuania's capital Vilnius.
</P>
<P>
The conference, initiated by Lithuanian President Algirdas
Brazauskas and his Polish counterpart, Alexander Kwasniewski,
was attended by the presidents of Belarus, Estonia, Latvia,
Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, Finland, Moldavia and Romania and
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the international
conference, the Lithuanian president said, "By gathering in
Vilnius, we will have an opportunity to seek new ways of
implementation and practical application of the principles of
democracy, cooperation, security and good neighborly relations
enshrined in the Helsinki final act and other international
documents."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the states of Central and Eastern Europe, which
in this century suffered extremely painful blows of history, hold
a special role and responsibility in preventing a repeat of old
mistakes and, instead, by concerted joint efforts, overcoming the
current problems for the free, secure and prosperous Europe.
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas emphasized the task facing heads of state is to
create such an environment in the region which would bring people
closer to each other and become a reliable barrier against
incitement of animosity between them.
</P>
<P>
On European security, Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said, "Europe seems to be missing a historic chance to
create a common family of nations and peoples enjoying equal
rights."
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, "the crucial mistake is a decision on the
expansion of NATO to the east," which, he said, poses a peril of
setting up new border lines if the cost of the expansion causes
the splitting-up of our continent, then this line of division will
on the border of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko noted, "We ought to do everything possible to
minimize the negative consequences of this erroneous step and not
to allow the coming back of animosity and suspicion in
relationship between our nations and peoples."
</P>
<P>
He also said that nothing unites people more than a common
activity and economic interests. Therefore, the European states
should pay special attention to the discussion of aspects of
regional and economic cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin said Europe is going through a period of
profound transformations. He said, "A foundation for new relations
between the states is being laid and the shape of the future
European structure is being determined."
</P>
<P>
He said at present, European states have got a unique chance to
make the Baltic Sea, Central Europe and the Black Sea region one
of the generators of peace and cooperation in the entire Europe.
Russia sees the establishment of a new model of the Baltic-Black
Sea cooperation as an integral component of a new Europe, looking
forward to the 21st century, according to Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the conference agreed that after the cold war,
peace and development have become a main trend of the world, where
security and stability are the key of the trend. All the countries
of the world should make every effort to create a peaceful and
stable international environment, they stressed.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which was also attended by the representatives
of the European Commission and the Council of Europe, is expected
to end Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Governor Fife Symington of
Arizona of the United States, convicted earlier this week on
federal fraud charges, was to leave office officially at 5 p.m.
today.
</P>
<P>
But he made his final exit from his office late Thursday, aides
said. He planned to leave on vacation this afternoon, the
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Jane Hull will be acting governor until she
is formally sworn in Monday. Arizona does not have a lieutenant
governor.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the day after he was convicted of seven fraud
counts that could land him in prison, he met with Hull.
</P>
<P>
Hull is the second Arizona secretary of state in a decade to
take over for a fallen governor. Governor Evan Mecham was
impeached and removed from office in 1988 and later acquitted in a
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney John Dowd said Thursday he would file papers
next month asking U.S. District Judge Roger Strand to set aside
Symington's conviction on seven felony counts of bank and wire
fraud.

<HEADLINE> New Strategies for Road Maintenance Formulated in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The technical teams of the
Ministry of Public Works of Cameroon today lay out new strategies
for road maintenance at the ministry's two-day seminar here.
</P>
<P>
In an adress to 60 participants, Minister Jean Bokam appealed
to participants to map out a strategy which will ensure the
maintenance of the road network in the country.
</P>
<P>
This presupposes more efficiency of the workforce of the
ministry. To attain this goal, the minister prescribed an
elaberate action plan which seeks to define the role of every
worker.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the seminar will therefore identify workers
who will be reorientated by leaving their present assignments for
others where their professional skills will be of maximum use.
</P>
<P>
The minister has challenged the private sector to fill the
vacume created by the disengagement of the state from the
productive circles of the cameroonian economy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for sensitisation and training of workers
to improve their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The seminar opened yesterday and is closing here this evening.

WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane warnings were
posted today for the Leeward Islands of the northeast Caribbean as
tropical storm Erika became a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
Warning flags could be seen on Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda,
Nevis, St. Kitts, Anguilla, St. Barthelemy and Dutch and French
St. Martin. Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands

<HEADLINE> US Imposes Sanctions Against Japanese Shippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
started imposition of sanctions on Japanese shipping companies
from Thursday which could face 100,000 U.S. dollar fees each time
they use a U.S. port, according to U.S. press reports here today.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken in order to retaliate for what Washington
considers unfair restrictions on Japanese harbors.
</P>
<P>
The first three ships facing fines were expected to dock in
U.S. ports today. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., Mitsui O.S.K. Lines
Ltd. and Nippon Yusen KK had full container ships headed for
Seattle, Houston and Tacoma, Washington state.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the three companies said there were no plans to
delay or reroute the ships. Meanwhile, they were hoping for an
agreement between the industry and Japan's Transport Ministry that
would satisfy Washington enough to delay or cancel the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were proposed in February by the independent U.S.
Federal Maritime Commission to retaliate for alleged restrictive
practices against U.S. shippers in Japanese harbors.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were to take effect on April 14, but President
Clinton suspended them until September 4, hoping Japan's Transport
Ministry could do something to end the alleged restrictions.
</P>
<P>
These include a practice known as "prior consultation," in
which any changes in shipping practices must first be discussed
with the Japan Harbor Transportation Association. The U.S.
commission also accuses Japanese harbors of discriminating against
U.S. carriers that attempt to run their own operations in Japanese
ports.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africans Receive Olympic Bid Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The news that Cape Town
will not host the 2004 Olympic Games is not all doom and gloom
and South Africa will continue to bid, political and business
leaders said this evening.
</P>
<P>
In Lausanne, Switzerland, the International Olympic Committee
today named Athens the bid winner of the 2004 Olympic Games,
beating the other four bidders, namely Cape Town, Stockholm,
Buenos Aires and Rome.
</P>
<P>
The decision "should encourage all of us to redouble our
efforts for the 2008 bid," the ruling African National Congress
(ANC) said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"In this way we can affirm in no uncertain terms our
determination to ensure that Africa takes its rightful place
among the continents of the world and that, by 2008, the
continent is firmly established on the path to reconstruction and
renewal," the statement continued.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Acting President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said his
people should be proud of the fact that Cape Town had qualified
for the last round of the bid.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela and his deputy Thabo
Mbeki are now staying in Lausanne along with Cape Town's bidding
delegation.
</P>
<P>
"Qualifiying to the last round was itself an achievement,"
Buthelezi told a hushed crowd at Cape Town's grand parade after
Athens was chosen as the successful bidder.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi told about 60,000 people that the whole Africa, from
Egypt to South Africa, is very disappointed, adding however, "We
don't let the disappointment put us down".
</P>
<P>
"We have our own pride and Africa's efforts to bid the Olympic
Games have just started," the acting president announced.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town Mayor William Bantom assured that the city had won
the attention of the world, and Tourism and foreign investment will
continue to gain in momentum in the future.
</P>
<P>
No one can deny that Cape Town and indeed South Africa as a
whole is now firmly placed on the international stage, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Uys, Executive Officer of Cape Town's city authorities,
noted, "As we worked together in a new spirit of cooperation
and partnership to win the Olympics, let us jointly strive to
face the challenges of the next century, for the betterment of
all our peoples."

<HEADLINE> Zambia Bans Import of Wheat Flour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official
declared here today that the Zambian government has banned with
immediate effect the importation of wheat flour into the country
to promote local wheat milling, Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ackim Nkole, deputy minister of commerce, trade and industry,
said that Zambia was capable of meeting the nation's annual
demand of 120,000 tons of floor from the locally produced wheat.
</P>
<P>
However, wheat instead of the flour could still be imported
because the government wanted to increase capacity for local
value added production of wheat flour which has been eroded by
the import of flour, Nkole explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the wheat milling industries are being
restructured in accordance with the new economic environment and
the government was taking measures to increase the economic scale
of local millers.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the ministry would work hand in hand
with the Zambian revenue authority to monitor items in transit at
entry points on the borders.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the ban would also help curb smuggling of the same
commodity which has become pampant of late.
</P>
<P>
Nkole assured the public that the ban couldn't lead to
shortage of flour since the government has done its "homework".
</P>
<P>
Although Zambia has leberalised its economy, the government
has a duty to put certain measures in place to ensure that the
"playing ground" is even, said the deputy minister.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Appeals to Refugees to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic
of Congo has called on its refugees hosted in Tanzania to return
home and join fellow citizens in re-building the nation.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Congolese Foreign Minister Bizima
Karaha who has come here to attend the Great Lakes Region summit
on Burundi that just concluded here.
</P>
<P>
Karaha told local press that it is imparative that good
citizens of Congo (former Zaire) who fled their country for some
reasons should go home.
</P>
<P>
"We have made arrangements between the government of Congo,
Tanzania and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) for the refugees to be repatriated home on voluntary
basis," the Congolese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "I understand that some 600 or so out of the 74,000
have been repatriated after consultations between the relevant
parties -- the government of Congo, Tanzania and the UNHCR."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We do not want antagonism. The country can only be
run by Congolese and not anybody else. So for those who fear that
the government will take them to task after returning home should
be rest assured that they will be safe."
</P>
<P>
As for some of the refugees who fled the country because of
their ill doings, Karaha said, "They can come back home as good
citizens, declare what they have possibly stolen if they may so
wish."
</P>
<P>
The Congolese refugees left their homeland in the last few
years to flee the civil strifes in their country.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Head Says Peace in Angola Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has
said it is possible for Angola to finally accomplish peace.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted here today by Manuel Monteiro, chairman of the
Portuguese People's Party (Partido Popular), after their meeting
in Andulo, a central city in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi was optimistic about the future of Angola, said
Monteiro, and thought peace was possible to be realized in the
war-torn country. This was quite in reverse to what the public
think about his attitude toward peace.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the resolution of the UN Security Council on
sanctions on UNITA, Monteiro said, before it takes effect on
September 30, there would be remarkable steps taken and sanctions
are not necessary.
</P>
<P>
He believed that all mediations for final peace in Angola are
very important and will brew positive results.
</P>
<P>
The People's Party is a powerful supporter for UNITA and its
chairman Savimbi in Portugal. Monteiro arrived in Luanda on
Thursday for a meeting with Savimbi to know what the head of the
former rebel movement thinks about the Angolan Peace Process
after UN's decision to impose sanctions on the organization.
</P>
<P>
Monteiro will leave for home tonight after talks with
officials from the Angolan government.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, Give Up Early Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all gave up their early gains and ended off their best levels
today, undermined by Wall Street's retreat.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London had gained 37 points on the FTSE 100
index earlier in the day, inspired by US jobs data which were
originally regarded as good for financial markets, before ending
only 2.9 points up at 4,994.2, failing to recapture the key
5,000-point level this week, but 176.7 points higher on last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that US payroll data initially eased fears of a
rate rise but analysts later said the figures gave mixed signals
as the August data was dampened by half a month's United Parcel
Service strike.
</P>
<P>
German shares closed higher despite a session spent trading in
narrow ranges. Traders said volumes were thin with market players
reluctant to adopt new position ahead of US non-farm payrolls
figures. The DAX-30 index ended at 4,100.67, up 28.99 points or
0.71 percent.
</P>
<P>
Stocks on the Paris bourse retreated in line with bonds, with
the CAC-40 index down 2.48 points at 2,924.51 by the close of the
session, but 154.02 points higher on last week.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Stick to Zero Tolerance Toward Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Palestinian
delegation said today that the Palestinian Authority would stick
to the policy of "zero tolerance" towards terrorism after a triple
suicide bombing Thursday killed seven people and injured more than
150 at a West Jerusalem shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of President (Yasser) Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority remains and will continue to be a policy of zero
tolerance to terror and violence whether committed by Israelis or
Palestinians against Palestinians and Israelis," top negotiator
Saeb Erekat told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after his talks with U.S. mediator Dennis
Ross earlier today at the State Department. The talks, which
followed the ones Wednesday between the U.S. and Israeli
officials, was scheduled to do preparation for Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's first visit to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Albright will travel to the region next week as scheduled
despite of the Jerusalem bombing.
</P>
<P>
Erekat emphasized it is time for Palestinians and Israelis "to
join forces together to preserve the peace process and to send a
strong message to all those who are thinking seriously of
sabotaging the peace process that the only alternative for
Israelis and Palestinians is the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Countering Israel's blames that Arafat was responsible for
Thursday's suicide bombing as he had failed to crack down
terrorist groups, Erekat said, "We wish that the Israeli
government would understand that trying to assign blame will serve
no purpose."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized security coordination among the Palestinians,
Israel and the United States over the past month was making
progress and withheld massive arrests of what Israel called
terrorist suspects.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the question is whether you just go and arrest
people without any rationale for why they are arrested. I think
each name that will be arrested must have a reason for his arrest,
and we are trying to go in accordance with the rule of Palestinian
law," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had
already tried arresting hundreds of people, but had been forced to
release many of them for lack of evidence.

<HEADLINE> White House Forecasts 63 Bln Dlr Surplus in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
forecast today that the budget deal between the U.S. government
and the Congress, and the continued growing U.S. economy, will
produce a budget surplus of 63 billion dollars in 2002.
</P>
<P>
That's nearly twice the size of the surplus estimated earlier
this week by the Congressional Budget Office, which forecast a
surplus of 32 billion dollars in 2002.
</P>
<P>
In a mid-year review of the economy, the White House Office of
Management and Budget said the deficit for the current fiscal
year, which ends September 30, would be 37 billion dollars, the
smallest deficit since 1974 and 90 billion lower than the White
House initially estimated.
</P>
<P>
The administration predicted that the surpluses would rise at
least through 2007.
</P>
<P>
The projected 63-billion-dollar surplus in 2002 would be the
first balanced budget since 1969.
</P>
<P>
The report asserted that, without the balanced-budget accord
reached between the U.S. government and the Congress in July, the
deficit would have begun to rise in 1998 and remain between 50
billion and 100 billion dollars for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In other forecasts, the Clinton administration said inflation,
as measured by the Consumer Price Index, would be 2.4 percent this
year and 2.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It said that economic growth, as measured by changes in the
gross domestic product, would be 3.5 percent for this year and
then range from 2 percent to 2.4 percent over the next five years.

<HEADLINE> US House Backs Putting Troops on Border With Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives today voted for its support for deploying up to
10,000 troops to guard the border with Mexico to keep out drugs
and illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The measure, proposed by Republican Jim Traficant, was approved
by a vote of 261-150. Under the bill, the troops could render aid
to the border patrol and immigration authorities in inspections
and detaining illegal aliens
</P>
<P>
However, troops would be barred from making arrests and other
civilian law enforcement activities. They would be deployed only
if the attorney general requested the aid and the Pentagon agreed.
</P>
<P>
The effort is aiming at ensuring that the negotiators writing
the final version of next year's defense bill include the troop
measure.
</P>
<P>
But the measure is opposed by the Defense Department and the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon says such a deployment could cost 650 million U.S.
dollars while the Justice Department warned of problems when
troops trained for combat are deployed on covert drug surveillance
missions.
