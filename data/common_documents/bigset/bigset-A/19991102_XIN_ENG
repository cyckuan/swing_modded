<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebel Leader's Son Deserts His Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- One of the Angolan rebel leader
Jonas Savimbi's son abandoned his father and presented himself on
Monday in the capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Araujo Domingos Sakaita, 22, one of Savimbi's 28 offsprings,
came from Lome, capital of Togo, where he has spent two years in
studying together with four of his brothers.
</P>
<P>
Sakaita called his father "the worst murderer Angola has ever
known" and told a press conference that his mother, Antonia
Macuia, was murdered in 1984 under instructions of Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Sakaita said that the peace in Angola could only be achieved by
 annihilating his father and destructing his war machinery.
</P>
<P>
Weeping several times during his speech, Sakaita, holder of
Cote d' Ivoire passport, said he felt happy in Luanda where he
could breathe free air.
</P>
<P>
Sakaita said that he had not told his brothers his decision to
leave Lome and that his example would certainly encourage other
Savimbi followers to abandon the bellicose leader.
</P>
<P>
Sakaita believed that the suffering of the Angolan people is
nearly ending and the death of Savimibi should open great
perspective for peace and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Savimbi will never surrender unless he is
defeated in all war fronts.
</P>
<P>
He also said that some countries, including Burkina Faso, Togo,
Cote d' Ivoire and South Africa, still allowed members of UNITA
rebels to freely travel and smuggle diamonds from Angola to afford
UNITA for sophisticated weapons.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the rebels led by Savimbi encountered
crushing defeat and fled into the forest areas after the
government troops captured dozens of cities and towns, including
UNITA's political and military headquarters in Bailundo and
Andulo, during a recent all-out offensive in the central plateau.

<P>
HARARE, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's real Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) is now expected to grow by just 0.9 percent this
year compared with earlier forecast of 2.1 percent, a leading
commercial bank said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank Zimbabwe Limited said the projection for economic
growth in 1999 had been scaled back following a downward revision
to mining and manufacturing output.
</P>
<P>
"There will be marginally negative growth in the material
production sectors of manufacturing, mining and agriculture, but
this will be offset by growth of around 1.2 percent in the private
service sectors and in tourism," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said the decision to close the Hartley Platinum Mine
represented a serious setback for the mining sector, while the
manufacturing sector was on track to record negative output growth
of about four percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Hope for Survivors Abandoned in EgyptAir Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- As the search operation
entered the second day Monday in the Atlantic where the Boeing 767
plane on the EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed Sunday, hopes for any
survivors among the 217 on board were abandoned.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard announced mid-day Monday that they would
shift the search and rescue mission into search and recovery
operation as they don't expect to find survivors.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came over 30 hours after the twin-engine,
wide-body Boeing 767-300 went down and the water temperature in
the area some 60 miles south of the resort island of Nantucket,
Massachusetts was 15 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
"We believe at this point it's in everyone's best interest to
no longer think we will find survivors," said Coast Guard Rear
Adm. Richard Larrabee.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-bound airliner crashed less than an hour after its
takeoff from the New York John F. Kennedy International Airport at
0620 GMT. It disappearanced from radar screens at some 0700 GMT
after experiencing steep and rapid plunge.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers have so far found only one body, some clothing, life
rafts, seats and cushions and passports.
</P>
<P>
The Norfolk-based Navy salvage ship USS Grapple, which
participated in the wreckage retrieval of TWA Flight 800 in 1996
and Swissair Flight 111 last year, headed for the debris area late
Sunday and it is expected to be in the area by Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Searchers hope that the vessel, equipped with side-scan sonars
and heavy equipment will be able to collect debris and large
portions of the aircraft from under the ocean over 60 meters deep.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard has found a large piece of the plane, which
needs a crane to remove from the water, Larrabee told reporters at
the U.S. Naval base in Newport, Rhode Island where the search
coordination is being conducted.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 199 passengers are said to be Americans and
Egyptians while the 18 crew members are all Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
A command center for massive investigation and recovery was set
up in Quonset Point, Rhode Island and officials were reviewing
radar tapes tracking a two-minute plunge by the stricken airliner.
</P>
<P>
Agencies including FBI or Federal Bureau of Investigation has
waged a massive investigation into the cause of the incident.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Kyrgyzstan Call for Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and his visiting Kyrgyz counterpart Muratbek Yimanaliyev
underlined Monday the need for enhancing bilateral ties, and
improving bilateral and regional cooperation in line with their
own national interests.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders stressed that there is sufficient ground for
cooperation between the two countries and called for more
consultations to explore the potential for mutual economic
cooperation, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also called for cooperation between the two countries
in fighting terrorism, drug trafficking, organized crimes and
maintaining peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran has focused on promoting peace and security in the
region, he said, stressing that economic development depends on
regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in Tajikistan, the Iranian foreign
minister said the Tajik peace process had reached a sensitive
stage and the regional countries along with the United Nations
should help the Tajik government and the popular institutions to
hold presidential and parliamentary elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Terming Afghanistan the fountainhead for exporting terrorism,
drugs and insecurity, he called for holding close consultations
between Iran and Kyrgyzstan to stop the spread of crises in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The brave nations in the region should determine their own
destiny and do not allow foreign powers to create a crisis to
justify their interference in the region for their own
illegitimate interests, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting dialog among civilizations proposed by Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami, he said the cultural right of the
nations is a good platform for holding dialog among civilizations.
</P>
<P>
"Our region enjoys an invaluable heritage which is
longstanding and rich civilization with impacts on the dialog
among civilizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the economic cooperation between the two countries,
Kharrazi said that their third joint economic commission would be
held within days to study Iran's economic and industrial
capabilities and its participation in building roads, bridges,
dams, cement plants, silos, electricity installations and its
contribution to food industry in Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Yimanaliyev said that Kyrgyzstan appreciated
Iran's stand toward crisis in southern Kyrgyzstan and that the
crisis was resolved thanks to the assistance of the international
community including Iran.
</P>
<P>
Yimanaliyev said that the Kyrgyz nation attaches more
importance to the friendly relations with Iran and is keen on
developing the Tehran-Bishkek ties.
</P>
<P>
Expressing pleasure with the peace process in Tajikistan, he
said that the current peace and stability in the republic is the
fruit of the peace efforts of the regional states.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating the proposal of President Khatami on holding
dialog among civilizations, he said, Kyrgyzstan is ready to
cooperate with Iran in holding such a dialog.
</P>
<P>
Yimanaliyev arrived here Monday for an official visit. It is
believed that he would talk with Iranian officials about the
future visit of Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The visit was scheduled to take place this summer, but was
postponed due to the crisis in southern Kyrgyzstan.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government's goal in
Chechnya is to find political solution to political problems, said
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Our main task in Chechnya is to resolve political issues with
political methods, not to conquer the republic or bring the
Chechen people to their knees by force," said Putin at a meeting
with heads of regional TV, radio companies and telecommunication
services
</P>
<P>
"The objective of federal units in the North Caucasus is to
destroy the terrorist bases and make its revival impossible," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Chechnya has got tired. They see that
international terrorism uses them as hostages, and those for whom
Chechnya is not homeland are doing that."
</P>
<P>
Militants have "other geopolitical goals that have nothing in
common with interests of the Chechen people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The federal authorities "will deal with all political forces in
Chechnya, but we will never sit at a negotiating table with
gangsters who have blood on their hands," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The mass media coverage will make a strong impact on the
solution of the North Caucasus problems, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged Russian media to use the truth, a real state of
affairs to counter the massive propaganda, employed by
"international terrorist organizations of the Moslem brand that
have nothing in common with real Islam."

<HEADLINE> WTO Helps Members, Observers With No Missions in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) launched "Geneva Week" here Monday to help WTO members and
observers, who do not have a permanent delegation in Geneva,
prepare for the WTO's third ministerial conference to be held next
month in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
"Your presence here is a positive step in the complex and
on-going process of assisting the integration of the smaller and
vulnerable countries, the least-developed countries and other
small economies, into the Multilateral Trading System," WTO
Director-General Mike Moore told representatives from the members
and observers without permanent physical representation in Geneva
where the WTO is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
"The Seattle ministerial conference will set the trade policy
agenda for the new millennium by adopting a ministerial
declaration, and launching a new round of multilateral trade
negotiations," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
"The scope of a new round must be balanced and reflect the
interests of all members," he went on. "I have stated as my
priority the necessity of working with members to ensure that poor
countries in particular obtain a balanced outcome from a new round
of multilateral trade negotiations. This is my firm commitment."
</P>
<P>
The 28 WTO Members and 9 Observers lack the resources to
maintain permanent offices in Geneva. They have difficulty gaining
full access to information on WTO's work and being alerted to any
action or issue that they may need to consider.
</P>
<P>
This information week is said to help non-resident WTO Members
and Observers inform themselves about the work going on in the WTO
in the count-down to Seattle, and also to expose them to the work
of other relevant agencies in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The 37 members and observers invited are: Andorra, Antigua &AMP;
Barbuda, Armenia, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cambodia,
Central African Republic, Chad, Dominica, Republic of the Fiji
Islands, Gambia, Grenada, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Laos, Macau,
Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Papua New Guinea, St.

LAGOS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Fighters of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone have captured two
northern towns from the ex- soldiers loyal to former junta leader
Johnny Paul Koroma.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in the towns of of Makeni and Lunsar which began

brought in 1,000 extra fighters from the east of the west African
country, reports reaching here Monday said.
</P>
<P>
"I gave instructions to RUF fighters to overrun Makeni and

<P>
Military sources said that some of the ex-soldiers loyal to
Koroma had surrendered and others fled into the surrounding

<HEADLINE> Iraq Never to Allow UNSCOM to Return: Vice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan reiterated here on Monday that Iraq will never
allow the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming
Iraq to return to the country.
</P>
<P>
"UNSCOM was something of the past that has been buried in the
grave. It has become rubbish heap of the history and does not
exist any longer," said Ramadan to reporters on the sidelines of
the opening ceremony of the 32nd Baghdad International Fair.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan accused members of UNSCOM of spying for the United
States and Israel, saying "any country with dignity will not allow
them to return."
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM withdrew from Iraq last December prior to the four-night
U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have been pushing inside the U.N. Security
Council recently for the adoption of a British-Dutch proposal
which recommends suspension of the sanctions on Iraq on conditions
that Iraq allows an enlarged disarmament body to return and places
its oil revenues under U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. support for the Iraqi oppositions, Ramadan said it
is not something new that the U.S. supports "those Iraqi
traitors." "It is just another farce," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has always been resorting to this kind of
artifice to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries,"
Ramadan added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government will not be scared by the U.S. threats,
said the vice president.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the U.S. gathered the Iraqi oppositions in New
York to discuss ways of overthrowing the Iraqi regime led by
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the U.S. has started training Iraqi
oppositions.

<HEADLINE> Street Riots not to Affect Kuwaiti-Egyptian Ties: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Senior Kuwaiti officials
said on Monday that Saturday's street riots that involved several
thousand Egyptian and Asian expatriate workers here will not
affect the strong relations between Kuwait and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Interior Minister Mohammad Khalid Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah
said the massive riots, which resulted from a quarrel between
an Egyptian and a Bengalese, have been completely over and
will not affect the Kuwaiti-Egyptian ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting members of the parliament's
Interior and Defense Committee, Mohammad said "what is between
Egypt and Kuwait is much bigger than a scuffle between a group or
several groups."
</P>
<P>
He said the Kuwaiti-Egyptian ties "are covered in the political
and security domains and on all levels."
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official said he did not witness any Egyptian
trouble-makers in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah also asserted that the isolated
incident "does not necessarily mean the relations between Kuwait
and Egypt have been affected."
</P>
<P>
Riots, which started Saturday night and went on until early
Sunday, rocked the suburb Kheitan area, about ten kilometers
south of the capital Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Army and National Guards were called in to assist
special forces and police to quell the serious clash.
</P>
<P>
Although no major causalities were reported, several shops as
well as a number of police, public and private vehicles were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
While the cleaning-up of the riot scene was going on, policemen
are still guarding the fighting-hit area in case of any new
disturbances.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Designed to Join NATO: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze on Monday declared his country's intention to join
NATO, reported Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
"If I were re-elected president in 2005, Georgia would knock
heavily on NATO's doors. It's a strategic course for a relatively
distant perspective," Shevardnadze said at a press conference in
Tbilisi, capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
The future of the Russian military bases in Georgia should be
negotiated, he said. A wide range of bilateral military issues
will be discussed at the talks in Moscow over in next days.
</P>
<P>
It was in an October interview to the Financial Times newspaper
that Shevardnadze announced a national course toward NATO
membership for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Russia has always reaffirmed its "unchangeably negative"
position on Baltic and CIS Countries' accession to NATO, calling
the alliance's eastward expansion "a wrong step which runs counter
to the direction of promoting European security."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- President of the United
Nations General Assembly Theo-Ben Gurirab on Monday urged the
international community to respond swiftly and generously to
India's urgent appeal for emergency relief assistance for the many
thousands of victims
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people died, 1.5 million were left homeless and
more than a third of the state's 35 million have been left in a
state of anguish and devastation following a powerful cyclone
which hit the Indian state of Orissa, in the Bay of Bengal, over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Gurirab said
judging from the scale of the destruction, it is obvious that
human beings are helpless against forces of nature, such as
cyclones, hurricanes or earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
This latest disaster was proof enough that, despite years of
persistent international efforts in disaster prevention, their
number and cost continued to rise, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab reiterated that disaster reduction must become an
essential element of international strategies and national
development plans.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Representative Condemns Attack on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. special
representative for Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, Monday condemned the
attack on Sunday night on Momcilo Trajkovic, president of the Serb
Resistance Movement and a member of the Kosovo Transitional
Council, in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, a U.N. spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here
that Trajkovic was shot at 22:30 (local time) in his home in
Pristina, capital of the Serbian province, by unknown assailants
with a small caliber handgun.
</P>
<P>
"He was shot through the door of his apartment and suffered a
gunshot wound in his upper right thigh," the spokesman said. "He
was hospitalized, underwent surgery and was released today."
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Trajkovic is one of our most important allies in our
effort to build a tolerant and multi-ethnic Kosovo," Kouchner
said. "He has worked -- obviously, at great personal risk, but
also at great political risk -- in order to ensure that the Serb
minority has a secure and vital place in Kosovo, but more
importantly, to ensure that Serbs and Albanians can find a way to
live together here."
</P>
<P>
"To terrify and attack minorities and their leaders to the
point of an exodus will leave Kosovo a morally weak and
internationally scorned place," said Kouchner, who described the
attacks as "foolish and coward."
</P>
<P>
"Kosovo will risk losing assistance and respect from the
outside world. I ask all the people of Kosovo to end these
ruthless attacks now," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the timely withdrawal of Yugoslav forces and the arrival
of the NATO-led international peacekeepers in Kosovo, the
situation was reportedly worsening by each passing day in the
province, where ethnic Albanians account for some 90 percent of
the population before many Serbs were driven out of the region in
the wake of the outbreak of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations has repeatedly
protested against the mortar attacks on villages of non-Albanians,
including Serbs, by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), saying
that KLA has not been disarmed as proclaimed.

HARARE, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's public enterprises,
blamed for the ballooning national budget deficit, have
accumulated losses amounting to 14.8 billion Zimbabwean dollars
(389 million U.S. dollars), a Cabinet Minister said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa told a post-budget seminar for

The post-budget seminar was held to enable parliamentarians and

</P>
<P>
Privatization of state enterprises is an ongoing exercise under
which the government seeks to wean the enterprises from state

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Protests KLA Terrorist Activities Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has lodged a
protest with the U.N. Security Council against the recent
terrorist atrocities by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
against the Serbs and non-Albanians in Kosovo, a Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The protest was contained in a letter from Vladislav Jovanovic,
the charge d'affairs of the Yugoslav Mission to the United
Nations, to the president of the Security Council. The letter is
being circulated here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The letter reported "the ever more deteriorating security
situation of the Serbs and other non-Albanians in Kosovo," and
"the situation is worsening dramatically with every passing day."
</P>
<P>
"There have been frequent instances of late of Serbian villages
being shelled by the terrorists of the so-called Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA)," he said.
</P>
<P>
On October 19, mortar fire was opened against the Serbian
village of Mogila near Vitina and on October 15-20, grenades hit
and damaged three Serbian houses, he said.
</P>
<P>
The village of Kmetovica was also shelled and bombed were
planted in Serbian houses and other property in the villages of
Grncare and Vrbovac in the Gnjilane area, while three Serbian
children were wounded in a landmine explosion in the vicinity of
Urosevac and two were killed in the village of Krusa near Prizren,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"These ignominious acts of terror, the glaring few in a
multitude, provide abundant evidence that, despite the contrary
pronouncements of the United Nations civil and security presences,
the KLA has not been demilitarized and disarmed and that UNMIK
(the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo) and KFOR (the
international peacekeeping force in Kosovo) continue to
countenance ethnic Albanian terrorism and systematic ethnic
cleansing of the Serbs and other non-Albanians of Kosovo," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In lodging a strong protest on behalf of my Government over
the commission of these atrocities, I transmit its expectation
that the Security Council will take the most energetic measures to
ensure full implementation of Security Council resolution 1244,"
adopted on June 10, which demands all Member States to respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and the
disarmament of KLA.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Feelings Among UK Businesses Over Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 1 (Xinhua) - British businesses are
divided over whether joining the European single currency - euro
is a good idea for them and the economy, according to a new survey
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times said the MORI survey showed about half of
the 1,000 businesses polled were committed in principle to British
membership of the euro.
</P>
<P>
But 37 percent wanted Britain to adopt a "wait and see"
approach to see how the euro developed before the Government
committed itself to signing up for the single currency.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the results were likely to dismay Prime Minister
Tony Blair because they suggested the government's strategy of
leaving business leaders to take the lead in making the case for
membership was not working.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader William Hague has vowed to fight the next
election on a "Save the Pound" slogan - the platform the
Conservatives used to defeat Labor in European parliament
elections in June.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper, Hague said business was
increasingly sceptical about the economic case for membership and
that "the sense of inevitability" about British membership had
been dissipated.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition leader said core EU countries should be allowed
to integrate further but that this would be impossible within an
enlarged union without greater flexibility for other member states
- including Britain - to opt out.
</P>
<P>
In an admission that will infuriate those on the right who
deride this position as a "fudge", Hague said he was happy to be
seen as a "pragmatist" on the single currency.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Rises in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction spending
increased 0.5 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 700.1 billion dollars, following a sharp 0.8 percent
decline in August, the Commerce Department reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected increase surprised many analysts. It reflected a
big jump in spending on big government projects that more than
offset a decrease in spending on all private construction,
including residential projects.
</P>
<P>
Home building and other construction activity, driven by low
mortgage rates, had been a key contributing factor to the strong
economic growth in the early part of the year. But the pace of
construction spending had shown signs of cooling, as rising
mortgage rates have put off prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice in June and
August to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. The
action made it more expensive for people to borrow.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said eroding consumer confidence, which fell for the
fourth month in a row in October, and a volatile stock market also
may be influencing consumers' decisions to hold off buying.
</P>
<P>
September's construction report showed that spending on all
government projects rose a strong 3.3 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 159.8 billion dollars. Spending on schools
and other educational building, highways and streets, and military
facilities all posted gains.
</P>
<P>
However, spending on all private construction projects fell 0.3
percent in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 540.3
billion dollars, with spending on office, religious and
educational buildings all showing decreases.
</P>
<P>
All residential projects dropped 0.1 percent in September to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 318.6 billion dollars with a
tiny decrease in spending for new single-family homes and a small
increase in spending on new apartments.
</P>
<P>
In some parts of the country, builders have experienced
shortages of skilled workers and some building materials, which
can delay or disrupt construction schedules.

<HEADLINE> Annan Reports Progress in Western Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has reported some progress in the preparations for a
referendum on the future of Western Sahara, and called for
continued cooperation of the concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
In his just released report to the Security Council, Annan said
that there has been progress in the identification of the
so-called "contested tribes."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief urged both parties to maintain their cooperation
so that the process can be completed, as planned, by the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
The referendum, which will give the people of the territory the
option of choosing between independence and integration with
Morocco, has been delayed several times because of differences
between the Moroccan Government and the Polisario Front,
particularly on the question of voter eligibility.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the very large number of applicants -- more
than 79,000 -- who have submitted appeals corresponds very closely
with the number of people omitted from the first part of the
provisional list of potential voters issued on July 15.
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances," Annan said in his report that
described the activities of his Special Representative and the
U.N. Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), "we
might be confronted with a lengthy appeals process, involving
almost all applicants rejected in the first instance, as well as a
large number of applicants whose inclusion in the provisional
voters list has been challenged."
</P>
<P>
This will have consequences on the level of staff, financial
and other resources required for the Mission, as well as the
timetable for holding the Referendum, Annan said. He plans to
provide the Security Council in early December with a realistic
assessment of the steps ahead.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) continued to prepare for the repatriation of
Saharan refugees as provided for in the Settlement Plan.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan said it is "regrettable" that UNHCR's draft plan
of action on confidence-building measures has not yet been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
The importance of fostering a climate of trust and confidence
can not be overemphasized, he said, and urged the parties to
cooperate fully with MINURSO and UNHCR for the immediate
initiation of the measures they have agreed to in principle.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Official Defends Laws on Right of Abode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The actions taken by the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to seek the
interpretation of the articles relevant to right of abode in the
Basic Law are entirely consistent with the rule of law, said an
HKSAR official here Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing of the Hong Kong report in the light of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),
David Lan, Secretary for Home Affairs of the HKSAR of the People's
Republic of China, told the participants that a judgement by the
Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong early this year would entitle
an extra 1.6 million mainland-born people to enter Hong Kong to
live, increasing the population there by 26 percent within a
decade.
</P>
<P>
"That would be the same as the United States taking in 68
million extra people or, say, France, another 15 million, in just
10 years," Lan explained.
</P>
<P>
"Meeting the needs of such a large and sudden influx of people
for housing, schools, hospitals, transport and social services, in
our case, would involve additional expenditure in excess of 710
billion HK dollars (91 billion U.S. dollars)," he said. "The costs
of all these would have had to be met at the expense of plans to
improve the living standards of our present population of 6.8
million."
</P>
<P>
In order to put the mechanisms that enabled Hong Kong to
control the rate of entry and thus the growth rate of the
permanent population there, Lan said, the HKSAR could not do it on
its own but had to seek either an interpretation or an amendment
of the Basic Law since the court's decision related to the meaning
of the Basic Law, which is a national law.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law includes very clear legal powers that the power
of final interpretation of the Basic Law lies with the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's
Republic of China and the power of amendment lies with the
National People's Congress itself, he said. The interpretation
issued by the Standing Committee on June 26, 1999 clarified the
issues concerning right of abode.
</P>
<P>
"Some commentators have asserted that the decision to refer the
matter to the Standing Committee, a non-judicial body, was
inconsistent with the rule of law," Lan said. "However, we firmly
believe that actions we took were entirely consistent with rule of
law, the bedrock on which all rights are founded in a truly civil
society."
</P>
<P>
"And, we remain, as we always have been, unswervingly committed
to the maintenance of the rule of law and to the principles on
which it is based," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on criticism that the interpretation will diminish
the status of the Court of Final Appeal, Lan said that "this
overlooks the fact that the interpretation simply reflects the
respective roles given to the court and to the Standing Committee
as clearly spelt out in the Basic Law".
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, it cannot be argued that an interpretation would
deprive Hong Kong of any legal powers because, while the Court of
Final Appeal has the power of final adjudication, no arm of the
HKSAR government, whether Judicial, Legislative or Executive, has
the power of final interpretation or amendment of the Basic Law,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, to clarify that the HKSAR government fully
respects the Court of Final Appeal's judgements, Lan said, "there
has not been, nor will there be, any attempt to overturn the
ruling as it applies to the mainland people who brought their case
before the court, or to the 3,700 persons who are treated as
parties concerned in those proceedings".
</P>
<P>
"Those judgements stand," he said. "The interpretation has
changed only the principles to be applied to claims for right of
abode that were pending when the interpretation was made, and to
those that are made after it."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he assured the participants at the hearing that
the power of interpretation relates exclusively to the Basic Law
itself, and cannot be exercised in relation to common law
principles or to Hong Kong's own staturory provisions.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Force Nears Handing over Mission to U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.-authorized
Australia-led multinational force is approaching the time to
handover its mandate to the United Nations peace-keeping operation
in the territory, it said in a report distributed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The force, called INTERFET, or the International Force, East
Timor, would welcome the early deployment of the U.N. operation
commander and his key staff in order to coordinate planning
between the operation and the INTERFET, the force said.
</P>
<P>
The report, the third periodic one by INTERFET covering the
period from October 13 to 26, was submitted to the U.N. Security
Council by the Australian Permanent Representative to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
It said the security situation in East Timor has improved
dramatically since September 20 when the INTERFET began to be
deployed.
</P>
<P>
As at October 25, INTERFET personnel has reached some 8,000
with troops contributed by Australia, Brazil, Canada, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway,
Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Britain and
the United States, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the INTERFET coalition has achieved a very
significant proportion of its mandate concerning the restoration
of peace and security, with the key indicators being the increased
level of security in towns and on roads, and the reduced incidence
of biolence against INTERFET," it said.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of progress to date, the expectation is that
INTERFET will have achieved its mandate in time for the transition
to UNTAET," it added.
</P>
<P>
UNTAET means the United Nations Transitional Administration in
East Timor which was authorized by the Security Council on October
25 to be set up as soon as possible to take charge of East Timor
affairs in preparation for its full independence.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said the transitional period would be two to
three years and the first year of UNTAET's spending would amount
to 700 million to 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
UNTAET's military component to compose of over 9,000 personnel
would replace the INTERFET. Because of financial shortages, it
would take months for the U.N. to form and dispatch such a
military mission in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 referendum paved the way for East Timor to go
independent after four centuries of Portuguese rule and 23 years
of Indonesian reign. The last 900 Indonesian troops left East
Timor on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Talks Enter Ninth Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The talks aiming to unlock the
stalled Northern Ireland peace process entered the ninth week on
Monday but a Sinn Fein negotiator described as "slim" the chances
for a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
"There's a slim chance that the review will be successful but
it has to be firmly rooted in the Good Friday Agreement," said
Alex Maskey following a meeting in the the Northern Ireland
capital of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
But one of the Ulster Unionist' negotiators, Michael McGimpsey,
said he believed the review could still work, adding that the arms
decommissioning issue still had to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ulster Unionist Party remains absolutely committed
to making this process a success and the full implementation of
the Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The talks, aimed at putting last year's Good Friday peace
accord into practice, have appeared to be on the verge of breaking
up several times but Mitchell has kept extending them.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. senator, backed by Britain and Ireland, has
been trying to persuade feuding politicians from the British
province's Protestant majority and Roman Catholic minority to come
up with their own ideas on how to end the impasse.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers have reported that Mitchell plans to put forward his
own proposals if the two sides cannot reach a solution.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of one-to-one talks with the parties, Mitchell
hosted a meeting on Sunday with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams
and senior negotiator Martin McGuinness and Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble and senior official Sir Reg Empey.
</P>
<P>
There was no word on what they discussed at the meeting, which
followed a briefing by Mitchell on the talks for Irish and British
officials.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Capital of Palestinian State: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of his three-way talks
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat stressed that Jerusalem is
the capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"The holy Al Quz (Jerusalem), which has been under Israeli
occupation since 1967...is the capital of an independent Palestinian
state," Arafat told a press conference here Monday following a
meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue, like the water issue, is one of the critical
problems in the final status negotiations between the two sides,
Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
This seemed to be a common strategy employed by both Israel and
the Palestinians to set their targets high to ensure a better
bargaining position in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Barak, likewise, has repeatedly declared that Jerusalem will
remain the "unified and eternal" capital of Israel. If there is no
compromise from both sides, the issue may prove to be a deal-breaker.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the Oslo summit is a "very important gathering" to
revive the peace process, and this process needs the support from
every party concerned.
</P>
<P>
He praised late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was
assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace policies,
as his "peace partner," and said Barak, who regards Rabin as the
mentor, is now toeing Rabin's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome him to be my peace partner," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He said he agreed with Clinton's optimism over the Oslo summit,
saying it can be a safeguard of the peace process. He was to meet
Clinton shortly.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians hoped this summit would "at least stop the
(Israeli) settlement activities," an obstacle to any serious talks
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Barak is accused of allowing settlement expansion to grow at a
faster pace than his hardline predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. The
peace process was froze under Netayahu's rein.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he is ready for a new Camp David negotiation,
Arafat said any negotiation should go into substance as the two sides
were trying to solve the hardest issues.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian prime minister told reporters that as the peace
process entered into a hard time, Norway is continuing to offer
help.
</P>
<P>
Informed Palestinian sources here said Arafat may meet Barak
later, although there was no agenda for their one-to-one meeting.
</P>
<P>
He had been scheduled to meet Clinton and Barak together at the
U.S. ambassador's residence Tuesday afternoon, following the
ceremony commemorating the 4th anniversary of Rabin's murder.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coach Takes DPR Korea as Top Threat in Asian Softball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion China
listed the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as the tough
rival at the 6-day Asian women's softball championships which
started on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Comparing with our long-time rival Japan, I think DPR Korea is
the top threat in the way to win our fourth consecutive title,"
said China's head coach Lu Yaming, whose team just beat Chinese
Taipei 2-0 in the opening game.
</P>
<P>
China, three-time Asian champion since 1987, had an even record
against Olympic fourth-placer Japan in their recent encounters but
found it was difficulty to play against DPR Korea, who seldom
showed up in the international events."
</P>
<P>
"DPR Korea has achieved amazing improvements in the last two
years, especially when they made an intense fight for us at the
Bangkok Asian Games last year," he added.
</P>
<P>
China's veteran pitcher Qin Xuejing echoed Liu's opinion: "We
are unfamiliar with their players and tactics. But their
insistence showed at the Asian Games gave us strong impression.
They are very tough."
</P>
<P>
China, runner-up at the Atlanta Olympic Games with a team of 27-
year-old in average, called back six veterans from aboard and
named a mixed line-up of veterans and young players. They now
average only 24 at the quadrennial Asian meet.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many DPR Korea players had competed in the
Bangkok Games, and whether they are experienced or not. We will
keep close eyes on them through this meet," Liu said before the
DPR Korea lost to South Korea 0-2 in later actions. "However, they
are not the arch-rivals for us in Sydney," Liu stressed.

<HEADLINE> 11th SAARC Summit Likely to Be Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The 11th summit of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) scheduled to be
held here from November 26 to 28 may be postponed due to the
military coup in Pakistan, a Nepali Foreign Ministry official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official said that as India has proposed the postponement
of the SAARC summit, there is possibility that the summit will be
put off.
</P>
<P>
He said Indian Ambassador K.V. Rajan had expressed his
country's desire to postpone the summit during an informal meeting
with Nepali Foreign Minister Ram Sharan Mahat on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Indian Embassy also hinted at the possibility
of the postponement of the summit.
</P>
<P>
"One member country of the SAARC has approached India to
postpone the meeting because of the political development in
Pakistan and (we) agree with this view," an official at the
embassy said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had already hinted in
Dhaka that the summit may be postponed due to the military coup in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani civilian government was ousted by the military
through a bloodless coup on October 11.
</P>
<P>
India has not formally proposed the postponement of the summit,
but discussion is going on informally among the member states,
according to the Nepali Foreign Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
If any country proposes a postponement, the summit can be put
off and most of the SAARC countries are not willing to welcome
Pakistan's new military ruler General Pervez Musharraf who ousted
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif three weeks ago, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Charter allows the summit to be postponed if any
member state requests it.
</P>
<P>
SAARC was founded in 1985 and groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> UAE Buys Stake in South Korean Oil Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Dhabi-owned
International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) will take a 50
percent stake in the South Korea's Hyundai Oil Refinery (HDO).
</P>
<P>
After a year of negotiations, an agreement to this effect was
signed Monday between Managing Director of the IPIC Mohammed
Nasser Al Khaily and HDO President N.N. Chung.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, IPIC will acquire the stake
through the subscription to the some 510 million U.S. dollars
worth of new shares issued by the refinery. The IPIC will also
have control of management, appointing a majority of HDO's board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, to maintain a 50 percent shareholding, the
Hyundai shareholders will invest a further 76 million dollars into
the refinery. The refinery's stocks were currently 100 percent
owned by Hyundai shareholders.
</P>
<P>
HDO is part of the Hyundai industrial conglomerate, with a
daily refining capacity of 665,000 barrels. It has a 20 percent
share of South Korea's market for petroleum products, with a total
annual sale of around 5.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
With IPIC's participation, HDO will increase its purchase of
crude oil from the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's oil consumption is the sixth largest in the
world and the third in Asia.

<P>
New Delhi and Budapest also sought the expansion of the U.N.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- British and Argentine armed
forces on Monday began their first joint military exercise since
they fought the Falklands War of 1982.
</P>
<P>
The four-day exercise, staged in the South Atlantic, is
designed to improve their ability to carry out search and rescue
operations, the British Ministry of Defense said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the two former enemies to take part
in exercises together since 1982, when the two countries fought
for the sovereignty of Falklands.
</P>
<P>
The exercises, under United Nations auspices and also involved
forces from other countries, will involve ships and aircraft from
the navies and air forces of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Military forces involved in the game will establish
communications, and then search together for a fishing vessel
reported "sinking" to the south of the Falkland Islands.
</P>
<P>
The scenario is designed to be as realistic as possible, and
imitates emergencies in which British and Argentine armed forces
have cooperated in the past.
</P>
<P>
The exercise "represents a positive step in the program of
military cooperation between the UK and Argentina", the defense
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Britain and Argentina have improved steadily
since the war, but diplomatic negotiations have taken place on the
understanding that the question of sovereignty over the islands is
not on the agenda.

LONDON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A narrow majority of Britons
think Australia should cut its ties with Queen Elizabeth and vote
to become a republic, according to a poll published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian/ICM survey showed 40 percent of Britons wanted
Australians to cut their ties with the monarchy when they vote in
a referendum on Saturday, while 34 percent were opposed to
Australia becoming a republic, the Reuters reported.

The remaining 26 percent of the 1,084 British adults polled
were undecided on what should become of the countries'
200-year-old constitutional ties.
</P>
<P>
The referendum on whether to become a republic needs the

of votes in at least four of the country's six states to succeed.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Passes Environment Report on Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's National Environment
and Management Authority (NEMA) has approved the environment
impact statement report for the Bujagali hydro-electric power
project whose completion would end Uganda's history of power
shortage.
</P>
<P>
The certificate of approval was issued Monday afternoon after
six months of intensive debate to the AES Nile Power, an American
company was contracted to build the project.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan Parliament passed an electricity bill last week,
paving the way for the American country to generate, distribute
and export electricity in Uganda. The bill abolished the monopoly
of power sector by the Uganda Electricity Board.
</P>
<P>
There has been heated debate over the site of the power
project. Some parliament members argue that the construction of
the project would have negative impact on the environment and
would destroy the beautiful scenery around Bujagali Falls, one of
the key places of interest in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has an installed capacity of only 180 megawatts of
electricity while total estimated peak demand is 250 megawatts.
This has resulted in a power deficit of 70 megawatts leading to
load shedding which is a constraint to investment and economic
diversification.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's MPs Unsatisfied with New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The future of Zimbabwe's
proposed millennium budget appears uncertain as some lawmakers on
Monday called for its rejection.
</P>
<P>
They told Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa that the budget had
failed to reflect the national aspirations and priorities, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians said the budget was not credible because
it did not spell out how the government intended to achieve the
proposed reductions of inflation (69.7 percent in September) and
high interest rates (over 50 percent).
</P>
<P>
Murerwa presented the 2000 budget to Parliament on October 21
proposing to introduce an AIDS levy, bring macro-economic
stability, stimulate investment and create employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is faced with a 16.2 billion Zimbabwean dollars (426
million U. S. dollars) budget deficit that is blamed on excessive
government borrowing totalling more than 146 billion Zimbabwean
dollars (3.8 billion dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien discussed the Balkan issue here Monday with visiting NATO
Secretary-General Lord Robertson.
</P>
<P>
"We want to discuss what's happened to the presence of the
Canadian troops there," Chretien told reporters before the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who is on his first visit here in the capacity of
the new NATO chief, confirmed there has been progress in the
situation in both Bosnia and Kosovo. But he cautioned against
drastic reduction of NATO troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"If we reduce our troop numbers, then we've got to make sure we
have them manoevrable and flexible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new NATO secretary-general was complimentary of Canada's
contribution, saying the performance of Canadian troops in the
Balkans "has been outstanding".
</P>
<P>
Canada has contributed more than 2,000 troops to the NATO force
being deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
During their two-day informal meeting held in Toronto in late
September, NATO defense ministers decided to cut down troops in
Bosnia from 30,000 to 21,000. The then NATO chief Javier Solana
said that the cut was possible due to the improved security in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Robertson arrived here late Sunday and will end his visit to
Canada Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's two frontrunners
of the president election will compete on November 28 to decide
who will be the next president of the South American country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Electoral Tribunal, neither of both candidates
obtained a majority in Sunday's general elections.
</P>
<P>
Tabarae Vazquez, 59, of the opposition leftist Broad Front
Coalition won 38.5 percent of the votes while Senator Jorge
Batlle, 73, of the centrist ruling Colorado Party, followed with
31.3 percent, according to official results.
</P>
<P>
And the candidate of National Party, ex President Luis Lacalle,
got 21.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.4 million Uruguayans voted peacefully Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Should Vazquez win the second round, he would be Uruguay's
first president not affiliated with the ruling Colorado or center-
right National Party, which have run the country since its
independence from Spain in 1828.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Colorado President Julio Sanguinetti is scheduled to
leave office on March 1 next year.

But analysts said whoever takes power, the cattle-and-wool
producing nation of 3.2 million will inherit a slump economy.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay's jobless rate has jumped to 10.5 percent so far this
year. The economy is expected to contract two percent as a result
of a regional crisis influenced by Brazil's currency devaluation

<HEADLINE> Rebels Raid Police Station in Central Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 heavily-armed New
People's Army (NPA) guerrillas struck at a police station in the
central Philippine province of Oriental Mindoro Monday night, held
four policemen there at bay and escaped with six firearms.
</P>
<P>
Edmundo Larroza, the officer in charge of the Philippine
National Police, said Tuesday that the rebels wearing military
uniforms breezed into the Pola Police Station without any hassle.
</P>
<P>
According to Larroza, the rebels successfully hoodwinked the
four policemen on duty and ransacked the police station in only
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
Besides looting the firearms, they also carted away one radio,
two typewriters and one air conditioning unit, said Larroza.
</P>
<P>
None of the four policemen there was hurt by the raiders who
fired bursts of gunfire as they escaped.
</P>
<P>
It was the second raid conducted by the NPA in less than 24
hours. On Sunday, heavily armed guerrillas raided the South Korean
Keangnam Construction Company in Quezon province in the northern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Larroza said the NPA burned nine dump trucks and three mixers
after the firm refused to pay "revolutionary taxes" amounting to 3
million pesos (75,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Army soldiers and police units in the concerned areas have been
in hot pursuit of the NPA raiders, said Larroza.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Disneyland to Invigorate HK Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surveys of departing passengers at the Hong Kong International
Airport, railway stations and ferry terminals indicate that 28.5
percent of all tourists would be interested in visiting such a
theme park.
</P>
<P>
kim Salkeld, deputy secretary for Planning, Environment and
Lands, said the Disneyland project conforms with the government's
"sustainable development" strategy. Since Hong Kong is densely
populated, developing heavy industry will deteriorate Hong Kong
people's living standard, he said.
</P>
<P>
"What Hong Kong needs now is various entertainment facilities.
To build a theme park is by all means better than build a
container terminal," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The business community's reaction to the theme park plan is
also positive.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Eden Y
Woon said the Hong Kong business community welcomes the Disneyland
project since it will help promote Hong Kong's role as a tourism
destination in Asia and stimulate Hong Kong's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Disney's choice of Hong Kong as the site for its theme park
destination will also have a positive effect on building Hong Kong
people's confidence in their future, Woon said.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists doubted whether the project would lead
to so many good results as expected. They believed that it may be
unwise for the government to build the Disneyland at the Penny's
Bay, the site originally chosen for a container terminal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Disneyland project, apart from stimulating
tourism, will also spur hotel and retail sectors, thus giving a
great impetus to Hong Kong's overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Disneyland plan will greatly encourage
local investors. They said within the first several years of its
operation, the theme park will bring in an estimated extra income
of 800 million HK dollars (102.56 million U.S. dollars), thus
improving the weak consumer market.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Efforts for Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has planted or
rehabilitated additional 355,000 hectares of forest nationwide in
the first 10 months of this year, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the figure, more than 95,100 hectares were newly planted,
212,900 hectares were rehabilitated, and 47,300 hectares were
grown with perennial industrial crops and fruit trees including
rubber, cashew nuts and tea.
</P>
<P>
During the period, around 1.6 million hectares of protected and
special-purpose forests were allocated to units and households for
protection and care.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has worked out a national program to plant five million
hectares of forest by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
VNA said the pace of forest planting was still slow in some
localities due to the shortage of capital for afforestation and
slow implementation of incentive policies relating to land
allotment.

<HEADLINE> S. Lanka Wants SAARC Summit to Be Held as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The government of Sri Lanka
looks forward to a SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation) summit in Kathmandu this month that will address the
economic and social issues in South Asia, according to Sri Lanka's
embassy here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the embassy said the Sri Lankan
government noted that there has been speculation in the media
concerning the impact of recent developments in Pakistan on the
forthcoming SAARC summit.
</P>
<P>
The speculation has not taken into account the working
procedures of SAARC which do not allow itself to be involved in
the internal affairs of member countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government was ousted by the military in a
bloodless coup on October 12.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka and Nepal have been in contact regarding the
arrangements for the summit scheduled for November 26-28, said the
press release.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government maintains that a deviation for
whatever reason from the path of collective endeavor commenced
through SAARC would at this juncture have serious and damaging
consequences for the progress, prosperity, peace and security of
South Asia, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC was founded in 1985 to promote regional cooperation in
economic and social issues among the seven member states --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua)-- Junior high school students in
Beijing recently wrote a letter to Premier Zhu Rongji, raising
eight suggestions for protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu praised these environmentally conscious students
attached to the No.2 Middle School at the Northern China Jiaotong
University. Students said in the letter that primary and middle
school students should organize regular tree planting activities
and take care of parks, gardens and other green belts in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
These students said burying ashes under trees benefits the
growth of trees. They said that trees would be just like
tombstones.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that disposal chopsticks made of wood be
banned to save forests and tanks be carefully designed to save
water when flushing toilets.
</P>
<P>
These junior high school students have taken an active role in
environmental protection activities since their school started a
course for environmental protection in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Although we are young, we should try our best to make the
world a better place", said Xiong Feng, one of the students.

<HEADLINE> Blair Favors Euro Policy in Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair reiterated that Britain has adopted a "prepare and decide"
policy on the euro and is in favor of joining in principle,
provided five economic tests are met.
</P>
<P>
Blair, addressing the CBI annual conference here Tuesday, said,
"The criteria are sensible, and at the time we judge those
criteria to be met, we will put it to the people in a referendum."
</P>
<P>
Blair attacked the "virulent anti-Europeanism" of the Tory
right and warned that Conservative proposals for a new opt-out
would lead to Britain pulling out of the EU altogether.
</P>
<P>
"They are unable to name a single country that would support
this proposal and it would require unanimous support by all 15
members," he said.
</P>
<P>
On public spending, Blair said that there would be no "
irresponsible spending spree" by the government in the run-up to
the next general election.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed suggestions that the government is ready to loosen
the purse strings and risk its reputation for economic prudence.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no risks taken by this government with this new
stability. No irresponsible pre-election spending sprees. No
irresponsible switches of policy," Blair stressed.

<HEADLINE> Softball Should Be School Sport in China By sportswriter Zhou Xin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- China need to promote the
sport of softball in schools despite a rapid development of its
women's national team in the last 20 years, top official of the
International Softball Federation said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's an amazing achievement for China winning the silver
medals at the Atlanta Olympic Games in such a short period since
the sport was introduced in China in 1979," said the ISF president
Don E. Porter, who is here for current 7th Asian women's softball
championships.
</P>
<P>
"Schools and universities competitions are the best arena to
find talent players," Porter added.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the large number of 28 millions women who are
playing softball in the United States and Canada, China has only
about 2,000 players, most of whom are from the 10 provincial teams
through the country.
</P>
<P>
"Softball is easy to learn. It has no requirements to the
physical strength, and is not expensive. Softball is very suitable
for Asian women." Porter added.
</P>
<P>
Most of the students are potential "super fans", Proter said,
with only a few talents turn to professionals after graduated from
schools.
</P>
<P>
"When I was in Japan last year for the world championships, I
saw a sell-out crowd in the stadium," Porter said, comparing to
the empty Pudong stadium which hosts the quadrennial Asian meet
here.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan are the two countries to represent Asia in the
Sydney Olympic Games next year.
</P>
<P>
Porter promised the ISF will step up to more cooperation with
the Chinese Softball Association for the development of softball
in China by giving more coach and umpire lectures and technical
instructions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income Remains Unchanged in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. personal income was
unchanged in September from August's 0.4 percent level, the
Commerce Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
September's performance reflects the impact of the hurricane,
which reduced personal income from uninsured losses to residential
and business property, the Department said. If excluding these
uninsured losses, personal income, which includes wages, interest
and government benefits, would have increased 0.3 percent in
September, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, spending rose 0.4 percent in September,
slightly more than the 0.3 percent increase many analysts were
anticipating. In August, spending jumped 0.8 percent, slightly
less than the government previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. savings rate, savings as a percentage of after-tax
income, had dipped to record lows in negative territory but was at
1.6 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
That reflects part of a comprehensive overhaul in how the
government calculates the Gross Domestic Product, the total output
of the country's goods and services. That overhaul, among other
things, affected the savings rate and shows that Americans are
saving more than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
The Department's report also said that wages rose 0.3 percent
in September, following a 0.4 percent gain in August. Analysts
were anticipating that the hurricane, which raked the East Coast
in September, would restrain wage growth.
</P>
<P>
But farm proprietors' income fell 22.5 percent. In September,
farm proprietors' income was reduced 6.1 billion dollars at an
annual rate to reflect uninsured losses of property caused by the
storm, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Spending on durable goods, such as washing machines and cars,
fell 0.4 percent in September, compared with a 1.7 percent gain in
August.
</P>
<P>
For nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, spending jumped
0.8 percent in September, down from 1 percent increase the month
before.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Georgia Fail to Agree on Border Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Georgia failed to
reach an agreement Tuesday on the joint protection for the Chechen
section of their common border, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The border will continue to be patrolled solely by Georgian
guards, said Konstantin Totsky, chief of the Russian Federal
Border Service, after talks with his Georgian counterpart Valery
Chkheidze.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which currently has no control over the Chechen section
of its border with Georgia, feared that "various elements" would
infiltrate Chechnya from neighboring Georgia as the federal troops
continue their assaults on the Islamic militants in the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
"We talked to the Georgian side on joint protection, but failed
to agree," he said, while Chkheidze insisted that Georgia "has
sufficient means and forces to guard its borders."
</P>
<P>
The two only agreed to exchange observers on the Chechen and
Abkhaz sections of their common border.
</P>
<P>
Totsky said a group of Russian border guards will soon travel
to the Chechen section to check the arrangements there, which will
be virtually closed in two or three weeks due to bad weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Given the success of the operation in Chechnya, the militants
may start flowing to Georgia in an attempt to flee from the
federal troops," Totsky said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Georgia reiterated its denial Tuesday that militants
and arms are illegally entering Chechnya through the Georgian
territory.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the anti-terrorist service of the Georgian National
Security Ministry Levan Kenchadze said such claims by the Russian
Federal Security and Border Services were groundless, Interfax
reported in a dispatch from Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
Kenchadze said the Russian services have not shown evidence
proving that the militants or arms are entering Chechnya from
Georgia."
</P>
<P>
Georgian President Edward Shevardnadze also dismissed the
reports as provocative, saying Tbilisi will not let terrorists
cross its border or allow arms deliveries.
</P>
<P>
However, Alexander Zdanovich, chief of the press section of the
Russian Federal Security Service, confirmed the reports of the
Russian forces on Monday that arms and ammunition were being
transferred to Chechnya through Georgia, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
"Mercenaries are also entering the republic across the Chechen
section of the Russian-Georgian border," Zdanovich said.

<HEADLINE> More Competitive Games to be Expected at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- More competitive games to be
expected at the Sydney Olympic Games when softball is to make its
second appearance in the Games next year.
</P>
<P>
"More well-balanced games are expected at the Sydney Olympic
Games because all the eight teams are very close to each other,"
said Don E. Porter, president of the International Softball
Federation here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The final berth will be decided in an Olympic qualifying game
in Parma in the upcoming July. Italy, with China, Japan, the
United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Cuba have booked
their tickets to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the eight teams that have qualified
after an extensive qualifying process will make softball's second
Olympiad even more exciting than its debut in Atlanta. The
overwhelming situation in the field is no longer to see at the
coming Olympics," Porter said.
</P>
<P>
"The female athletes of softball have shown that they are as
competitive and athletically skilled as those in any sport."

<HEADLINE> Taliban Accuse U.S., Russia of "Colluding Against Islam" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban's supreme
leader, Mulla Omar, Tuesday accused the United States and Russia
of having joined hands to eliminate Islam on the pretext of
terrorism, Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Omar as saying in a statement that Washington
had neither responded positively to a recent offer of alleged
terrorist Osama bin Laden for possibly leaving his refuge in
Afghanistan nor to the Taliban proposal for the settlement of the
issue by religious scholars according to the Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
Omar also came down heavily on Russia. "What is happening in
Chechnia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and other (central Asian)
countries and what had happened in Afghanistan or the voices that
were being raised against terrorism are the result of actions of
former Soviet Union."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban leader accused the United States of prompting
Russia to "declare hostility against Islam."
</P>
<P>
"If the United States remained adhered to its position, then
Osama will not be the real issue, rather such a situation will
cause a dangerous situation for Muslims," said Omar.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has been
approached to take over the late Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere's mediation task for the Burundi conflict, a South
African foreign ministry official confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khangelani Hlongwane, an aide to Foreign Minister Nkosazana
Dlamini-Zuma, said that the South African government has been
asked by the authorities in Burundi to step into Nyerere's shoes
to find a lasting peace in the Great Lakes country.
</P>
<P>
But South Africa has to consult with Tanzania and Burundi
before taking over the mediation task, Hlongwane said, noting that
Tanzania is still in mourning and that this period has to be
respected.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa is also aware of the potentially
explosive situation in Burundi.
</P>

"I'm confident a solution to this problem will be found soon,"

<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland peace mediator
George Mitchell said on Tuesday he would brief the leaders of the
United States, Britain and Ireland this week on peace talks
progress.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as talks adjourned in the Mitchell review
of the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. former Senator said in Belfast that he would meet
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in Dublin later on Tuesday
before flying to London for talks on Wednesday with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
He then plans to fly to the United States to brief President
Bill Clinton on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell did not comment on specific progress at the talks,
which remain bogged down more than a year and a half after the
rival parties agreed to end three decades of guerrilla conflict
and usher in a new era of peace with the Good Friday accord signed
in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said there
had not been "a breakdown or a breakthrough" in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Northern Ireland's Protestant leader David
Trimble abruptly left the talks for meetings at the White House.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether Trimble was introducing a new stumbling
block or seeking some sort of lifeline from Washington, which has
been a key player in Northern Ireland's elusive search for peace.

NEW DELHI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Tuesday
intensified relief and rescue operations in East India's Orissa
state, which was hit by a super cyclone last Friday.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Committed to Anti-dumping: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has been
acting as a strong advocate for the implementation of anti-dumping
measures in the World Trade Organization (WTO) this year, Minister
for Trade and Industry Alec Erwin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on South African Broadcasting Corporation radio about
the upcoming WTO negotiating round in Seattle, the United States,
Erwin said that the WTO had achieved a "major breakthrough"
through its disputes settlement panel.
</P>
<P>
"Many developing countries have very actively used the
mechanism to win decisions against the protectionist measures of
the U.S., EU and Japan this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If you look, South Africa is the number one user of
anti-dumping measures in 1999. We learned how to use the
provisions very quickly," he said, referring to a recent free
trade pact between South Africa and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The WTO's disputes settlement mechanism, exploited successfully
by South Africa and other developing countries, has for the first
time allowed smaller countries to win decisions over larger
economies in the world trading system, Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister acknowledged the micro-rules of dumping
needed to be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
"We can't carry on using these measures against each other," he
said. " One criticism of the U.S. is that the thresholds they use
for "injury" are much too low, and that they don't look carefully
enough at the size of imports into their markets. These need to
be changed."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. anti-dumping action against South African steel
products had not yet been resolved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Erwin will be playing a very active role in the upcoming
Seattle negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Besides discussing the agreed upon areas of agriculture and
financial services, he said new areas likely to be covered
included commerce, transparency in public procurement and
competition.
</P>
<P>
"We are not certain of the WTO outcome," he concluded. "Right
now there are very intense discussions underway in Geneva as a
prelude to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
"I hope it will be a truly developmental negotiation, which
will be very broad-based but will also agree upon very specific
and detailed steps to help developing countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Powerful Asian Giant: Syrian Weekly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing European-Arabian
tour by Chinese President Jiang Zemin proves that China has become
a powerful Asian giant, the Syrian weekly Tishrin commented on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president was received in London, Paris and Lisbon
with the warmest official welcome, said the paper. Europeans are
setting their eyes on the huge lucrative Chinese market, it added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has visited Britain, France, Portugal, Morocco and
Algeria and is currently on a visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
China signed with Britain trade agreements valued at a total of
3.5 billion U.S. dollars during Jiang's trip to the country. The
deals are considered as the biggest trade agreements Britain ever
signed with an Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Europe and China need each another. While Europeans set their
eyes on the huge 1.2 billion-people Chinese market, China is also
seeking strong ties with the European continent to balance its
economic and political relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is endeavoring to diminish China's economic and
political role in the international arena, and to have China
preoccupied with side issues such as Taiwan, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
China's policy of smooth and gradual change toward market
economy has proved succussful, the paper said. It has avoided
disturbances and problems to which some Southeast Asian countries
have been exposed, on the contrary, the country has played an
effective role in alleviating the consequences of the economic
crisis that has stormed those states since 1997, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The weekly said that China's trade surplus last year reached a
record high of 45 billion dollars and the gross domestic product
(GDP) was almost 1,000 billion dollars in the same year. China
drew about 75 billion dollars in foreign investments last year as
compared to 45 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Such a solid economic performance has enabled Jiang to speak in
confident and firm terms right in the heart of Europe. Such
language reflects China's awareness of its strong position and the
fact that it is in no need to appease the Europeans, nor the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
In his joint news conference with French President Jacques
Chirac held on October 25, Jiang warned against foreign
interference in China's internal affairs regarding human rights,
though Beijing is always ready to engage in dialogue with the
European Union on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Beijing showed its interest in boosting relations with Arab
states by incorporating Morocco, Algeria and Saudi Arabia in the
Chinese President's tour, the paper concluded.

BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
said China's monetary policy should play a greater role in
promoting the reform and development of State-Owned Enterprise (
SOEs).
</P>
<P>
Wen urged personnel in the financial sector to map out concrete
reform plans for SOEs. Addressing the Financial Work Committee's
12th Enlarged Plenary Session, Wen said that preferences should be
given to key SOEs in terms of credit and loans and more financial
support for high-tech enterprises and upgrading technology.
</P>
<P>
"The debt-equity swap should be conducted immediately and in a
careful manner to reduce debts, promote reform and liquidate bank
assets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Securities market should be further regulated to create a good
environment for the listing of qualified SOEs. Wen also called for
further improvement of export credit insurance and active support
in increasing exports for SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Wen also urged the financial sector to actively support
developing China's west, focusing on infrastructure projects,
ecological improvement and tapping natural resources and education.
Financial institutions should also make it easier for small and
medium-sized enterprises to obtain loans as long as they are
profitable, he added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Asks Local Govts to Set Up Reading Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
urged local government executives to set up information and
reading centers to expand awareness and improve the literacy
levels of Filipinos in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
In a circular issued Tuesday, Secretary Ronaldo Puno of the
Department of Interior and Local Government said there is a dearth
of reading and information centers in the remote areas of the
country, resulting in a low literacy level in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the reading centers do not require new or additional
buildings and can be located within the premises of other
community service units or within any public building in the
locality.
</P>
<P>
The centers, he said, should have a minimum of library fixtures
like tables, chairs, bookshelves and other furniture.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they should have more reading materials of vital
human interests such as public administration, local legislation
and other publications or magazines relevant to the needs of the
community.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure optimum utility, the center should be manned and
that rules and procedures on the management and use of said
facility are established," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
He also directed the department's regional directors to ensure
the widest dissemination of the circular to all local government
units within their jurisdiction and to provide the necessary
support in putting up these centers.
</P>
<P>
Puno said he believes that the establishment of such centers in
every village will help inform the people, especially the youth on
current issues and trends in local governance.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The local government of Ajegunle,
an slum area in Nigeria's biggest city Lagos, Tuesday declared an
8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew after a two-day long ethnic strife
has claimed 15 lives.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place between local Yorubas (an ethnic group
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo belongs to) and Ijaw
immigrants from the country's oil-producing Niger Delta, according
to a radio report.
</P>
<P>
"A 24-hour patrol of all the creeks and riverine areas of the
state by anti-riot policemen has also been ordered," Lagos State
Governor Bola Tinubu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Ijaws of the Egbesu warrior cult and the
Yoruba separatist Oodua People's Congress broke out Sunday,
forcing hundreds to flee the impoverished district on the
outskirts of the city of eight million.
</P>
<P>
Residents said the clashes were an extension of fighting
between Ijaws and Ilajes -- a clan of the Yoruba -- in the western
reaches of the Niger Delta over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, more than 1,000 people have been killed during
ethnic clashes in Nigeria since Obasanjo took office in May this
year to end 15 years of crippling military rule in the most
populous African country.

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned Over Democracy in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
judge the performance of the present government in Pakistan on the
basis of its headway toward restoration of democracy, said the
head of an EU delegation, Jukka Valtasaari, here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters at the end of two days of meetings with
Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf, government
officials and political parties, Valtasaari, also Finland's
foreign secretary, said the delegation would submit its assessment
of the situation to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"We came here Monday to find out what is in the coming and
recommend what EU should do," he said. "We were instructed to know
what is going to happen on the democratic front."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with General Musharraf, he said, the
delegation asked for a time frame for the return to a
representative democracy but the answer was "we don't have a time
frame but you will judge us from what we do."
</P>
<P>
Valtasaari said the EU would judge the present government in
Pakistan by its progress on the benchmarks like electoral reforms,
return to democracy and human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
"We will follow benchmarks in all the areas. We did not agree
on any particular benchmark," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-member EU delegation flew in here Monday morning on a
fact-finding mission in Pakistan after the government change on
October 12. Finland is the current president of the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Valtasaari said the second objective of their visit was to
gauge the regional stability, Pakistan's relations with India and
Afghanistan, nuclear issue and the issue of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the European Union would slap sanctions on
Pakistan, he said, "I cannot say. There is no decision in this
regard."
</P>
<P>
He said the political council of the European Union would meet
on Thursday and the delegation would submit a report for its
consideration.

<HEADLINE> Denktas: Proximity Talks Before Direct Talks ri pvkol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktas said that a lengthy process of proximity talks is needed
before he goes into direct talks with Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Even if all other issues are settled and direct talks arranged,
the process will not yield results since there is nothing left on
the negotiating table, the Turkish Daily News reported from
northern Cyprus on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is nothing to negotiate because Greece and
Cyprus have rejected outright his proposal for a confederacy
settlement put forward last year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Denktas said that unless lengthy proximity talks
are conducted between the two sides and groundwork is prepared,
it will be meaningless to carry out the direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Denktas said that a number of suggestions have been
made during his latest meetings in Cyprus with Alfred Moses,
U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said that the suggestions are not "acceptable."
</P>
<P>
Moses is expected to travel to the island this week-end or
early next week in a second attempt to break the impasse in the
Cyprus peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been trying for decades to
reunite the island through a bizonal, bi-communal federation
formula, but no tangible progress has been made so far.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the two sides have been stalled since 1997
after Denktas demanded international recognition of his breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," now backed only by
Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister Meets IMF Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Coordinating
Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie Tuesday
met the visiting International Monetary Fund's Asia Pacific
Director Hubert Neiss, discussing with him financial aid from the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kwik Kian Gie presented to Neiss the long
form of the PricewaterHouse Coopers audit report on the Bank Bali
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives has made public the full audit
report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The scandal involves the dubious transfer in early June of a
commission of some 546 billion rupiah (78 million U.S. dollars)
from Bank Bali to a private firm linked to close associates of
former President B.J. Habibie and the Golkar Party. The commission
was paid ostensibly for a private company's assistance in
recouping loans from closed banks.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
suspended their loan disbursements to the country following the
disclosure of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Tuesday, Neiss said the way
was cleared for renewed disbursement of IMF loans to Indonesia
following the publication of the audit report.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF will send a special team to review the
country's overall economy and economic programs, which would lead
to the signing of a new letter of intent.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government must sign the new letter of intent
before renewed loan disbursements.
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport on Monday
night, Neiss said: "Indonesia doesn't need IMF money right now,
but needs international support over the medium term."
</P>
<P>
The IMF would return to business as usual in its relationship
with Indonesia once the audit report on the Bank Bali scandal was
published even if the investigation was continuing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kwik Kian Gie Tuesday admitted that Indonesia's relations with
the IMF had been adversely affected since September 15 as the
former government failed to settle the Bank Bali scandal
satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
He said that after conducting a high-level talk, the IMF is
expected to immediately disburse aid which has been delayed since
September.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Water Project to Benefit Municipalities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 250 municipalities in
the Philippines will be provided with potable water under the
government's 250-million-U.S.-dollar Urban Water Supply and
Sanitation Project.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Interior and Local Government said Tuesday in
a report that these municipalities are those with insufficient
water supply and a high incidence of water-borne diseases.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the World Bank, the project aims to assist local
officials in improving their water supply and build institutional
capacity for the management of water and sanitation services at
the national, provincial and municipal levels.
</P>
<P>
According to the department's Secretary Ronaldo Puno, the
project is being funded from a 183-million-dollar loan from the
World Bank, 50-million-dollar allocation from the local
governments and 17 million dollars from grants by international
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Puno said feasibility studies for the first batch of 12
municipalities have been completed and bidding for the project is
now going on in three towns.
</P>
<P>
These areas are low-lying communities whose water supply
systems were found to cause a high incidence of water-borne
diseases, he said.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the second batch of beneficiaries is composed of 73
municipalities selected in the Visayas, Luzon and Mindanao which
also are not covered by the existing water utilities and
classified as non-viable water districts.
</P>
<P>
He said the project is set for completion by 2009.

<HEADLINE> Editor-in-Chief of Moderate Daily Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Mashallah Shamsolvaezin,
editor-in-chief of the banned Iranian moderate daily Neshat and
current editor-in-chief of Asr-e Azadegan newspaper, was arrested
here on Tuesday, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shamsolvaezin was arrested upon an arrest warrant issued by
the press court, an unidentified informed source said.
</P>
<P>
The judge of Branch 1410 of Tehran Justice Department Saeed
Mortazavi issued the arrest warrant for Shamsolvaezin on October
16 after he failed to appear before the court to defend himself
against the charges.
</P>
<P>
Shamsolvaezin was accused of desecration of the Islamic
sanctities and the Quranic teachings, earlier reports said.
</P>
<P>
In a court hearing last month, Shamsolvaezin had asked for
time to provide the court with evidences to support his defense
against the charges leveled against him.
</P>
<P>
However, he introduced three lawyers to the court later, saying
he did not believe in preliminary investigations and he would
appear before the court in presence of the press jury.
</P>
<P>
The daily Neshat, which supported the reformist policies of
President Mohammad Khatami, was closed down on September 5 on
"charges of disrespect for Islamic Sanctities and the status
of the supreme leader."
</P>
<P>
The ban came after the daily published an open letter by
a co-founder of the opposition Iran Liberation Movement to
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging him to distance
himself from the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Neshat is the successor of Tous and Jameah, which has
been closed down on press charges. Since Khatami came to
power in August 1997, six liberal dailies have been closed
down by the Iranian conservative judiciary.

CAIRO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's engineering sector is undergoing an
unemployment crisis, President of the Engineers' Order of Beirut
Samir Doumit warned.
</P>
<P>
"There are currently 6,000-7,000 unemployed engineers in the
country," said Doumit in a radio interview on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There has been a sharp decline in construction activities in
comparison with previous years, and many engineering firms have
begun dismissing staff, said Doumit.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the government's austerity measures and taxation
policy for the stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese government has decided to lower the
tariff on international courier from 12 U.S. dollars per kilogram
on inbound and outbound items to 7.5 dollars, the Daily Star
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian steel industry has planned to invest 500
million U.S. dollars through buy-back and financial schemes to
process 24.9 million tons of iron-ore by the end of the third
five-year development plan (2000-2005), the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mousa Aqaei Lankarani, an official from the Iranian National
Steel Company, said that his company has planned to boost the
capacity of Golghohar Iron-ore Complex to five million tons from
the current level of 2.7 million tons and that of Chadormalu
Iron-ore Complex to 8.5 million tons from 5.1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The company also planned to equip Sangan iron-ore mine to
produce 2.6 million tons of iron-ore annually, he said, adding
that the target output for steel by March 21, 2005 is set at 14.7
million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Iran's current annual steel production stands at around six
million tons.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- The Abu Dhabi Development Fund has offered four
loans to Syria at a total amount of 543 million dirhams (144.8
million U.S. dollars), the Al Baath daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fourth loan, amounting to 257.11 million dirhams (68.56
million dollars), is allocated for the establishment of a plant
for mixed yarn in the coastal city of Tartous. It will increase
the added value for the manufacturing of yarn rather than
exporting it as raw material. And the plant will provide about
3,000 new jobs and enable Syrian manufacturers to enter foreign
markets.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry Abdullah
al-Attiya said he expected an increase of 28 percent in
international demand for petroleum to stand at over 90 billion
barrels per day by the advent of 2010.
</P>
<P>
Al-Attiya, the current chairman of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), added that this would
necessitate further OPEC investments of over 60 billion
U.S. dollars to boost oil production to meet the increasing demand.

<HEADLINE> Japan Wins Cliff-Hanger against South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A fatal blunder in the extra
time costed South Korea a cliff-hanging match against Japan as
Shianawa Noriko's home run gave Japan a 1-0 win in a preliminary
match at the 7th Asian women's softball championships here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the scoreless seven regular innings, South Korea struck
first in the extra eighth inning but still failed to find the
scoring power.
</P>
<P>
Noriko snatched the third base from a double start on Ota Kaori
's sacrifice strike on the right field before she ran home on Sato
Rie's single on Japan's striking turn.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean player caught Rie's strike but dropped the
ball when Noriko touched the home base to call an end of the two
hour marathon.
</P>
<P>
"It's a breath-taking game," said Japanese coach Komuro Rumie,
who called domestic college players and some national members for
this event.
</P>
<P>
"The South Korean created tremendous troubles to us, a work
which they had never done in previous meetings. They had got big
improvement.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm happy with the result as we played with some college
students," she added.
</P>
<P>
In the following games, Japan, runners-up in the last version
of the event, romped Thailand 10-0, while South Korea suffered
their second loss of the day as they were thrashed 5-0 by
Philippine.
</P>
<P>
The local favorite China, who are seeking for their fourth
consecutive title, beat up Indonesia 9-0 and Singapore 12-0 in a
series with a back-up team.
</P>
<P>
"I gave playing time to the youth. They need to gain
experiences in major events like this," Chinese coach Liu Yaming
said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's other games: the DPR Korea won a hard-fought match
against Chinese Taipei, 2-1, and cracked down Thailand 10-0; Hong
Kong of China lost two games to Chinese Taipei, 13-0, and
Indonesia, 8-0; Philippine disposed of Singapore 10-0.

<HEADLINE> India Snubs Musharraf's Remarks on Indo-Pak Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday snubbed
Pakistani Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf's remarks on
Indo-Pakistan ties and expressed its desire "to build a
relationship of peace and friendship with Pakistan based on
principles."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry said, "India has
always taken the initiative toward improving relations, as it did
again last year by putting in place the composite dialogue process
to build confidence and trust, establish a stable structure of
cooperation and address all outstanding issues."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had sought to reinforce
this approach through his historic visit to Lahore in February
1999, he added.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held Monday in Islamabad, Musharraf said,
"Hostility will be met with hostility and peace with peace. If
India agrees to talk, we will take one step ahead."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman charged that Pakistan's armed "intrusion and
aggression" in Kargil was "a violation of the Line of Control, but
more than that it was betrayal of trust."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Pakistan must, therefore, facilitate a restoration of
trust through actions, abandon its state-sponsored cross-border
terrorism against India in Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere, and it
must also cease hostile anti-India propaganda."

ROME, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian Serie A soccer club
Venezia Tuesday announced that it had sacked its coach Luciano
Spalletti and called in Giuseppe Materazzi to guide the first
division team.
</P>
<P>
Spalletti's dismissal came after the team lost at home to
Bologna at the weekend. Venezia is in next to last place with five
points, just one more than the bottom Cagliari.
</P>
<P>
An official statement from Venezia thanked Spalletti for his
professionalism and wished him all the best for the future.
</P>
<P>
Materazzi came Italy after a disappointing adventure in
Portugal, where he was fired by the Sporting Lisbon just over a
month ago. Last season he coached another Serie A side Piacenza
and was relieved at the end of the season despite having saved the
club from relegation.
</P>
<P>
The coming of Materazzi recorded Venezia's 24th coach in the
past 14 years. He will make his debut on Sunday when Venezia
travels to Milan for a meeting with the mighty AC Milan, last year
's championship winners.

CHONGQING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Wu Bangguo asked
builders to secure the construction quality of the Three Gorges
Dam Project along the Yangtze River, the world largest water
conservation project.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the call during his October 27-31 inspection tour of
Chongqing, southwest China, where he also attended a meeting on
rural migration near the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of construction has begun. The first phase of
construction was completed in 1997. Wu spoke highly of the
construction and urged project owners, builders, designers, and in
particular supervisors to raise quality awareness in a bid to
build a world class reservoir.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Chongqing, Wu also emphasized reform of
State-owned enterprises (SOEs), urging the city government to
streamline its state sector.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be focused on major problems facing SOEs in
Chongqing such as high asset-to-liability rates, redundant workers,
heavy social burdens, and backward technology and equipment, the
vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
Measures must be taken to improve enterprise management,
conduct enterprise strategies research, and adopt modern
management skills and methods. The vice-premier said that
maintaining social stability is of the utmost importance during
reform and development of China's SOEs.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African Reserve
Bank supports the introduction of inflation-linked bonds, Governor
of the central bank Tito Mboweni said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni told the annual convention of the Actuarial Society of
South Africa that inflation-linked government bonds would help the
bank monitor inflation expectations in the market.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation-linked government bonds used to be associated with
financially unstable countries experiencing hyperinflation.
However, in recent years, financially stable countries have issued
inflation-linked government bonds, including Canada, the United
States, the United Kingdom and France," Mboweni said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation-adjusted bonds, also known as index-linked bonds,
systematically compensate investors for the loss of purchasing
power as a result of inflation.
</P>
<P>
In a typical inflation-linked bond, both capital and interest,
or coupon and payments rise with inflation. In most countries,
the consumer price index forms the basis for such indexation.
</P>
<P>
The idea of indexation is most relevant for bonds with longer
maturities, as there is more uncertainty with respect to
inflation, rather than for shorter dates securities. There are
arguments for and against introducing index-linked bonds, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It could be argued that the mere existence of inflation-linked
 securities is testimony to the fact that the monetary authorities
cannot deliver complete price stability. Their introduction could
also signify government's acceptance of inflation as a fact of
life which merely needs symptomatic treatment.
</P>
<P>
"By guaranteeing investors protection against inflation,
government is, in effect, making it easier to live with
inflation," Mboweni said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank head said that benefits of issuing
index-linked bonds include the following:
</P>
<P>
-- They can protect the purchasing power of accumulated
savings, and encourage such savings;
</P>
<P>
-- Other financial assets do not provide as good a hedge
against inflation;
</P>
<P>
-- The bonds can expand the range of investment opportunities;
</P>
<P>
-- They can enable the monetary authorities to obtain useful
information on real interest rates and inflation expectations; and

The Russian defense ministry said the rebels are still trying
to resist the advance of the federal troops by creating seats of
resistance in different directions and mining the routes.
</P>
<P>
As military actions continued, the refugee problem persisted,
with more than 195,000 people fleeing Chechnya so far, the Russian
Ministry of Emergency Situations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more refugees were massing along the Chechen borders
with its neighboring Russian regions, but the checkpoints manned
by the federal troops are accused of being too slow in processing
the refugees and not in operation long enough.
</P>
<P>
Four elderly refugees died on Monday while waiting to enter
neighboring Ingushetia, the Interfax quoted Ingush President
Ruslan Aushev as saying.
</P>
<P>
Aushev said the Russian forces are acting inappropriately in
light of the critical situation emerging in the Kavkaz checkpoint
area on the border of the two republics.
</P>
<P>
By Monday evening, a 15-kilometer-long line of vehicles had
formed on the border with the number of refugees reaching 5,000-7,
000, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said "a maximum of 170-180 people pass through the
checkpoint in a day.
</P>
<P>
"The same things that happened yesterday continue, the same
humiliation of people -- obstructions, checks, and other nerve
racking activities," Aushev said.
</P>
<P>
"If checkpoints are to operate in this way, the refugee
situation will drag out for at least a year. And if hostilities
begin in Grozny, in the southern areas of Chechnya, some 80,000-
100,000 new refugees will appear," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He said the humanitarian corridors should function round-the-
clock , and the interior troops, rather than army units, should be
in charge of the checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia tried to defend its military actions in
Chechnya and brushed away the Western pressure for it to ease the
assault.
</P>
<P>
The military campaign was launched following two waves of armed
incursions led by Chechen rebels into neighboring Daghestan and a
spate of terrorist bombings that killed over 300 people in Moscow
and two other Russian cities. Moscow accused Chechen militants of
masterminding the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Tuesday that there is
no reason for the West to put pressure on Moscow over its
operations in North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
"There was no and is no use in putting pressure on Russia,"
Ivanov said after his talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in Oslo, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that a mission of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is expected to visit
Chechen refugee centers next week.
</P>
<P>
Russia has agreed to receive the OSCE representatives who will
visit Ingshetia, Daghestan and Chechen districts, which are
controlled by federal troops, Ivanov said.

<HEADLINE> Italian Navy Fires Warning Shots at Tunisian Patrol Boat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 2 (Xinhua) -- An Italian navy corvette fired
warning shots Monday night at a Tunisian patrol boat attempting to
seize an Italian fishing trawler in the Sicilian Channel, the
Italian news agency Ansa reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place south of the Italian island of
Lampedusa and the corvette, "Urania," fired to ward off the
Tunisian patrol boat since they were all in international waters.
</P>
<P>
The patrol boat left immediately after the shots were fired,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Urania is deployed in the Sicilian Channel to protect
Italian fishing boats that have repeatedly been seized by the
Tunisian authorities for allegedly entering their territorial
waters.
</P>
<P>
The Italian navy said the Tunisian patrol boat did not respond
to radio messages sent from the Urania indicating that the fishing
boat, "Aceria," was in international waters.
</P>
<P>
When the corvette opened fire, the Tunisians had already
lowered a rubber speedboat with military officers on board,
intending to force the fishing boat to head towards Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Other ships out of the fishing port of Mazara are reported to
be returning to port in protest and Matteo Asaro, head of the
Mazara fisherman's association, said "the intervention of the
Italian navy ship shows without a shadow of doubt that the
Tunisians commit illegal acts."

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. authorities Monday gave up hope of finding
survivors in the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, but the Coast Guard
search crews found a large piece of wreckage and heard what may be
a radio signal from one of the aircraft's flight recorders.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday urged Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to seize
the "moment of opportunity" and move swiftly toward an agreement
on the toughest unresolved issues of the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration, worried that it could be blamed
if Serbs freeze to death in the winter, has decided to support a
European-run pilot program to send heating oil worth millions of
dollars to Serbia, senior U.S. government officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
-- Advisors of U.S. Republican presidential front-runner George
W. Bush's acknowledged that they were caught off guard by Senator
John MaCain's quick rise in New Hampshire polls, saying they are
bracing for a hard-fought contest in the state that holds the
first presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- DaimlerChrysler is expected to announce that it will begin
phasing out its Plymouth branch, whose sales have been declining
in recent years. Like Oldsmobile and Mercury, Plymouth is a
venerable name that has lost much luster. By dropping Plymouth,
the auto maker could cut costs without sacrificing any variety in
its lineup of high-volume products.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia's war on Chechnya will dominate a meeting Tuesday
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian Prime Minister
Putin, aides to Clinton said. Clinton plans a personal appeal for
restraint. Moscow opened several border crossings and let refugees
flee the breakaway republic.

<HEADLINE> Humans To Land On Mars In Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Humans will hopefully be able
to land on Mars within five years, said Lu Yongxiang, president of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
"The rapid development of space technology makes its highly
probable that humans will be able to land on Mars from 2003-2005,"
Lu told Chinese and foreign scholars yesterday at a Forum to mark
the 50th founding anniversary of the CAS.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 satellites have been launched by countries
around the globe. Space shuttles have flown many times into space.
Space stations have been built to explore other planets in the
solar system.
</P>
<P>
The landing on Mars has been eagerly anticipated after the
historical landing on the Moon in 1969. Humans will continue to
explore the earth, ocean and the space in the 21st century, said
Lu.
</P>
<P>
Apart from landing on Mars, Lu also added that China will
continue to find ways to control population as well as food,
health and ecological problems.
</P>
<P>
Lu's speech opened the three-day forum. Six Nobel Prize winners
including three Chinese-American physicists--Chen Ning Yang, Tsung-
Dao Lee, and Samuel C.C. Ting--and American biologists Harold E.
Varmus, Ferid Murad, and German biologist Hartmut Michel are also
giving speeches.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Jiang's Speech to Saudi Eminent Persons (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin delivered a speech to eminent persons from all spectrum of
the society in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. The full text follows.
</P>
<P>
First of all, I would like to extend, on behalf of the Chinese
Government and people, and in my own name, our heartfelt thanks to
everyone present here and to people from all walks of life in
Saudi Arabia who have worked to promote the friendship between the
peoples of China and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed made a famous remark, which goes like this, "For
people in pursuit of knowledge, even China is not too far away."
For a long time, the Chinese and Arab people have learned from
each other and their friendly relations can trace back to ancient
times. We have been linked up by the ancient "Silk Road," which
serves as a bond of friendship. As early as over 1,000 years ago,
Chinese commercial ships started to call at the Port of Jidda. In
the Ming Dynasty, Zheng He, who led fleets to what was then called
"West Sea" seven times, visited the Port of Jidda, and even
arrived at Macca on his way there. As early as 651 AD, envoys and
businessmen of the Arab Empire started to visit and do business in
China. Some of these people settled down in China and served as
officials in the Chinese imperial court. Some Arabic travelists
wrote Sulaiman's Story and Journey of Ibn Batouta, enabling Arab
people and Europeans to know about the society, life, culture,
science, technology and business in China at the time.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese and Arabic nations have a long history and
have created their own brilliant civilizations. China produced in
its history many outstanding philosophers, thinkers, statesmen,
strategists, scientists, writers and artists and left us numerous
volumes of literature. Various schools of thought and their
exponents such as Lao Zi and Confucius in the Spring and Autumn
Period and that of the Warring States occupy a very important
position in the world history of philosophy, and are still
influencing the Chinese society today. Ancient China made
outstanding contributions to humanity in many areas including
astronomy, calendric system, geography, mathematics, agriculture,
medicine and the humanities. China's four great inventions of
paper making, gun-powder, printing and compass in particular, had
greatly advanced the progress of human civilization and their
extensive application has profoundly changed the face of the world.
The ancient Arabs also excelled in the areas of medicine,
philosophy, literature, history, geography, mathematics and
chemistry. Ibn Sina and Ibn Roshd were regarded as medical
authority of their times. Kalela Wademmnah written by Ibn
Almoqafai and the Arabic Nights, a renowned novel, have been
passed on in the literary realm of the world and are still popular
even today.
</P>
<P>
The human society has created varied and colorful civilizations
in its long process of evolution. These civilizations, with all
their similarities and differences, are products of human wisdom.
It is exactly this diversity that has made our earth a colorful
planet with nearly 200 countries and regions and over 2,500
nations living on it. It is essential for different civilizations
to conduct dialogue and exchanges on an equal basis, learn from
each other, and draw on others' strength to make up for their own
weaknesses. They will thus be able to bring new prosperity to
human civilization while developing and enriching themselves.
Conflicts and disagreements are unavoidable between various
nations due to their differences in historical development, social
background, cultural tradition and lifestyle. These conflicts and
differences can be resolved through dialogue and exchanges on an
equal footing and in the spirit of mutual respect. It is wrong to
place the civilization of one's own nation before other
civilizations and ignore or even despise other civilizations, make
much ado about the differences between civilizations, or attempt
to stir up conflicts between various civilizations, for they are
detrimental to progress of world civilization and to the lofty
cause of world peace and development.

China and the Arabic countries are all developing countries.
Sympathizing and supporting each other in international affairs,
they are a staunch force for world peace and regional stability.
China has all along attached importance to its friendly relations
and cooperation with Arabic countries and supported the just cause
of the Arab people and their legitimate rights and interests. The
Arabic countries have rendered China their resolute support on the
question of Taiwan and many other issues. The two sides share
broad common views on human rights and a wide range of other
issues. The recent years have witnessed increased political
exchanges and expanded economic cooperation and trade between the
two sides. In 1998, the trade volume between China and 19 Arabic
countries in West Asia and North Africa reached 7.1 billion U.S.
dollars, and that between China and Saudi Arabia stood at nearly 1.
7 billion U.S. dollars. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has become
China's largest trading partner in the West Asian and North
African region. Our two countries are highly complementary,
economically and commercially, which promises a tremendous
potential for cooperation and a broad prospect. We wish to
explore with Saudi Arabia new ways and channels for enhanced
economic cooperation and trade between the two countries. We hope
that more Saudi entrepreneurs will go on study tours and make
investment in China and contribute to the friendly ties and
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The 20th century is one of great and sweeping changes in China.
Our ancestors advocated the idea that "gentlemen exert themselves
unceasingly." This idea reflects the Chinese people's fine
tradition of reform, innovation, and hard working. In the first
50 years of this century, the Chinese people, under the leadership
of the Communist Party of China, waged a tenacious struggle and
won national independence and people's liberation and founded the
People's Republic of China. In the second half of the century,
especially in the two decades since the reform and opening up, our
people have worked hard and independently, overcome various
difficulties and made remarkable achievements in building up the
country. All this has brought about profound changes to the face
of our country. In these five decades, China's GNP has grown by 7.
7 percent annually on average, a rate much higher than the world
average of around 3 percent for the same period. Its economic
aggregates have jumped to the 7th largest in the world and foreign
exchange reserves now stand at more than 150 billion U.S. dollars.
China has established trade relations with 220 countries and
regions. In 1998, the total volume of its foreign trade reached
more than 320 billion U.S. dollars. China has become one of the
most dynamically developing countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people love peace. Our ancient thinkers advanced
the maxims that "friendly neighbors are a boon to the state" and
that "do not do unto others what you would not like done to
yourself." These ideas reflect the long-cherished earnest desire
of the Chinese people against power politics and for peace. We
are committed to developing, on the basis of the Five Principles
of Peaceful Coexistence, friendly relations and cooperation with
all countries in the world and have made unremitting efforts in
maintaining world peace and stability. We will continue to pursue
the basic state policy of opening up, engage in extensive
cooperation and exchanges with other countries in the world and
make new contribution to human progress and development.
</P>
<P>
Mankind is at the threshold of the 21st century. Let us join
hands and write a new chapter of human progress and civilization
in the new century.

<HEADLINE> French Minister of Economy and Finance Resigns Over Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Economy and
Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned Tuesday amid a scandal in
which he was accused of forgery.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn was indicted last week by the public prosecutor's
office in Paris after he was accused of presenting a letter
claiming that he worked as a lawyer for a student health
association from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
He was reportedly paid 600,000 francs (97,000 U.S. dollars) for
his legal advice to the Mutuelle Nationale d'Etudiants Francais (
MNEF) when it had a financial deal with the Societe General des
Eaux.
</P>
<P>
But a former official of MNEF, Philippe Plantagenest, said the
letter which provided a legal basis for his payment was a fake.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Strauss-Kahn is no doubt a blow to the
Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, since he is
considered to be one of the most capable members of Jospin team.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Khan is known for his ability to reach understanding
with the country's employers, who don't like the Jospin government,
as well as his popularity among international financial
institutions in Washington.
</P>
<P>
When he tendered his resignation, Strauss-Kahn denied that he
had received the payment from MNEF for doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
"I made the decision (to resign) because I think that morality
and a sense of responsibility demand it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Rabin's Commemoration Ceremony Held in Oslo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
pledged Tuesday to continue the peace process and resolve
disagreement with the Palestinians through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We will follow your legacy until peace comes," Barak said
during a speech at a ceremony commemorating the late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was shot dead four years ago by a
Jewish extremist opposing his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government is determined to strengthen Israel and
to bring prosperity to the region by putting an end to the century-
old conflict between Israel and its neighbors," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
"The time is short, and the challenge is demanding," he told
the audience. "We will strive to ensure Israel's security interest
and vital needs, but at the same time, we'll seek to achieve a
fair settlement that reflects the need and sensitivity of our
neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Barak said peace in the Middle East will not be a diplomatic
peace, but rather a people's peace. "All disagreements must be
resolved only through negotiations -- this is a duty to our
children and future generations of the entire region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the United States, the Middle East, and Europe
attended the ceremony in the city hall of Oslo, in an effort to
give new momentum to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an emotion-charged speech, Leah Rabin compared her husband
to a "captain" -- a name former U.S. President Abraham Lincoln had
been called -- in seeking peace with Israel's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
She urged Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
continue the way toward a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton quoted Rabin as saying, "Don't say
the day will come, make it come."
</P>
<P>
He asked Israeli and Palestinian leaders to act and work for
peace. "There is a chance to bring peace in the Middle East, but
it's only a chance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we let it slip away, all of us will bear the consequences,"
he added, warning that "the enemies of peace remain alive and
active."
</P>
<P>
The ceremony began with the reading of a poem by Israeli poet
Bat-Chen Shahak, "A letter to Leah Rabin."
</P>
<P>
The sun was shining and the sky was bright blue, extraordinary
weather for a normally gray and chilly late autumn Norway.
</P>
<P>
People lined the main street, craning their necks hoping to get
a glimpse of the men who are expected to establish a just and
lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also gave a speech to the audience of hundreds. he was
followed by Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, on behalf of the
presidency of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Jordanian Foreign
Minister Abdul Ilah khatib, Moroccan Foreign Minister Mohamed
Benaissa, and former Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were
expected to address the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Militia Asks UN to Help Abandoned Asians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA) has asked the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) to address the plights of 73 Asians being sheltered by the
militia in south Lebanon, security sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The would-be illegal immigrants were rescued by an Israeli
navy last week from a cargo ship drifting off the Lebanese
southern coast.
</P>
<P>
They were reportedly tricked into paying 2,000 U.S. dollars
each for a clandestine trip to Italy from Greece.
</P>
<P>
The voyage began 13 days ago and the passengers were abandoned
at sea by the crew two or three days later.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Navy towed the boat to the Lebanese southern-most
haaeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The SLA has asked the Israelis to contact the UNHCR to
address the issue,"the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added the Asians were pleading with the militia not to
contact their embassies because they did not want to be
repatriated to their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
The passengers include 49 Bangladeshis, 11 Iraqis, six
Egyptians, three Indians, two Sri Lankan women, an Iranian and
an Algerian.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Has No Hidden Agenda in E. Timor: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Tuesday that
it has no agenda in going to East Timor other than a sincere wish
to serve and fulfill the responsibilities under the U.N.
peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi made the statement
here Tuesday when asked to comment on the East Timorese leader
Jose Ramos Horta's statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
Horta was reported as saying from Darwin, Australia, that civil
disobedience could occur if a Malaysian was picked to command the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in East Timor and that no one would
cooperate with a U.N. peacekeeping force commander from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"We are not entering that area with a political agenda, only to
serve the U.N. mission as peacekeeping troops," Bernama news
agency quoted the deputy prime minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia had no ulterior motives in its desire to
serve in the U.N. peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like he (Horta) is dead serious in not wanting
Malaysia to be present there," he said, adding, "Any dispute (on
Malaysia's role in the U.N. mission) will only complicate relief
work for the East Timor people."
</P>
<P>
"What he (Horta) did was not good for our image," Abdullah
said, adding that for the sake of East Timor's peace, it was
important that whatever recommendations made by the U.N.
secretary-general be accepted.
</P>
<P>
He said Horta might not be aware that Malaysia was among the
developing countries with vast experience in U.N. peacekeeping
duties.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been involved in U.N. peacekeeping missions in
Africa, Asia and other places, Abdullah said.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Deploy More Rolling Stores for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that it will deploy nationwide more rolling stores selling
basic commodities at lower prices to help ease the financial
burden of the poor.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said in a new release that the rolling
stores have helped the masses cope with the rising cost of living
largely triggered by recent increases in fuel costs dictated by
the global market.
</P>
<P>
The release added that the government will not stop undertaking
efforts to mitigate the suffering of the poor.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada earlier ordered the
National Food Authority (NFA) to dispatch the rolling stores to
rural areas to help cushion the impact on the poor of the recent
round of oil price increases.
</P>
<P>
He likewise directed the NFA to make sure that basic
commodities and other goods are always available in these rolling
stores. Estrada said he can do only what is within his power as
far as the oil price hikes are concerned.
</P>
<P>
The president explained that while he could not control oil
prices, he continues to explore ways to ease the impact of oil
price hikes on the people, including lowering the selling price of
rice and sugar.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's efforts to minimize the impact of another round of
oil price hikes paid off last Saturday when he got a commitment
from oil firms to raise their prices only minimally.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Customs Special
Task Force has seized about 300,000 pirated discs and arrested 97
suspects over the past three days, said Superintendent Fong Fai-
hung, head of the 185-member force, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This operation is one of a series of major anti-piracy
operations in Hong Kong, in which a total of 3.8 million pirated
discs worth 71 million HK dollars (9.1 million U.S. dollars) and 1,
104 suspects were seized, said Fong.
</P>
<P>
According to Hong Kong's Copyright Ordinance, anyone who is
found selling any pirated articles is liable to imprisonment of up
to four years.
</P>
<P>
Fong pointed out that the special task force, which was set up
in June this year to curb piracy and counterfeiting activities at

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Disneyland to Invigorate HK Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The planned Hong Kong
Disneyland will inject new energy into Hong Kong's rebounded
economy, boosting tourism, employment and infrastructure, analysts
said immediately after the agreement on the theme park was
announced.
</P>
<P>
"Being able to capture such a major international development
is symbolically important," said Bob McKercher, acting head of
Hong Kong Polytechnic University's Hotel and Tourism Management
Department. "It signifies the beginning of Hong Kong's resurgence.
"
</P>
<P>
McKercher believed that the project is important in rebuilding
confidence in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa announced Tuesday that the
agreement had been reached between Hong Kong and the Walt Disney
Co. to build a Disney theme park and resort on Lantau Island of
Hong Kong, after nine months of solid negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The would-be park is the world's fifth Disney theme park and
the third outside the United States, following Tokyo and Paris.
</P>
<P>
Tung told a news briefing that the Hong Kong Disneyland would
ensure that Hong Kong becomes the "favorite tourist destination"
in the region, strengthen Hong Kong's status as a "world city" and
ensure that Hong Kong's economic recovery and growth are sustained.
</P>
<P>
The park, with a total investment of 22.45 billion HK dollars (
2.87 billion U.S. dollars) from the Hong Kong government, is
expected to attract an attendance of over 5 million in 2005, its
first year of operation, and the figure would rise to 10 million
after about 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The massive project would create around 6,000 jobs during the
construction phase and some 10,000 jobs by the land reclamation
and other associated works.
</P>
<P>
The project will produce an estimated 148 billion HK dollars (
18.97 billion U.S. dollars) boost to the HK economy over a 40-year
period, eight times the original investment.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Howard Young, representing the Hong Kong Tourism
Functional Constituency, said a Disney theme park would enhance
Hong Kong's tourism potential and establish its status as "Asia's
premier tourism destination city."
</P>
<P>
"Not only tourism stands to benefit immensely from more
tourists, more expenditure and extra night stays because of Disney,
but other related sectors of the economy ranging from retail to
catering to transport, and all other sectors that in turn serve
these industries would benefit," Young said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Dismisses Speculation About SAARC Summit Postponement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka, the current head of
the seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), on Tuesday dismissed speculation about the postponing of
the regional summit due to the coup in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement,
"The working procedure of SAARC ... does not provide for the
association to involve itself in the internal affairs of member
states."
</P>
<P>
Colombo's position came against the backdrop of media reports
that some member states had sought a postponement of the summit in
view of the political developments in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Sri Lanka "looks forward to a summit in
Kathmandu this month that successfully and collectively addresses
the economic and social issues in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
"A deviation, for whatever reason, from the collective endeavor
commenced through SAARC, would at this juncture have serious and
damaging consequences for the progress, prosperity, peace and
security of Sri Lanka," it said.
</P>
<P>
A senior Nepalese Foreign Ministry source on Sunday said the
summit could be postponed at the request of some member states,
including India, in view of the changes in Pakistan following an
army coup last month.
</P>
<P>
However, a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said on Monday
that the summit should be held on schedule as any postponement
would violate the SAARC Charter.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, which groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan,
Sri Lanka and the Maldives, is to hold its 11th summit in Nepal's
Kathmandu on November 26.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Sri Lanka is not likely to oppose Pakistan being
represented at the summit by its Chief Executive General Pervez
Musharraf who initiated the coup overnight on October 12, toppling
the government of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

<P>
Surveys of departing passengers at the Hong Kong International
Airport, railway stations and ferry terminals indicate that 28.5
percent of all tourists would be interested in visiting such a
theme park.
</P>
<P>
Tim Salkeld, deputy secretary for Planning, Environment and
Lands said the Disneyland project conforms with the government's "
sustainable development" strategy. Since Hong Kong is densely
populated, developing heavy industry will deteriorate Hong Kong
people's living standard, he said.
</P>
<P>
"What Hong Kong needs now is various entertainment facilities.
To build a theme park is by all means better than build a
container terminal," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The business community's reaction to the theme park plan is
also positive.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Eden Y
Woon said the Hong Kong business community welcomes the Disneyland
project since it will help promote Hong Kong's role as a tourism
destination in Asia and stimulate Hong Kong's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Disney's choice of Hong Kong as the site for its theme park
destination will also have a positive effect on building Hong Kong
people's confidence in their future, Woon said.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists doubted whether the project would lead
to so many good results as expected. They believed that it may be
unwise for the government to build the Disneyland at the Penny's
Bay, the site originally chosen for a container terminal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Disneyland project, apart from stimulating
tourism, will also spur hotel and retail sectors, thus giving a
great impetus to Hong Kong's overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Disneyland plan will greatly encourage
local investors. They said within the first several years of its
operation, the theme park will bring in an estimated extra income
of 800 million HK dollars (102.56 million U.S. dollars), thus
improving the weak consumer market.

<HEADLINE> HK Re-Exports Increases by 10 Percent in August </HEADLINE>

<P>
HONG KONG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The volume of Hong Kong's re-
exports in August 1999 increased by over 10 percent over a year
earlier while that of domestic exports fell by 7.8 percent, a
report released by the Census and Statistics Department Tuesday
showed.
</P>
<P>
A total increase of 7.9 percent was recorded in the volume of
Hong Kong's external trade in August this year while imports rose
by 3.8 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the first eight months of 1999 with the same period a
year earlier, the volume of Hong Kong's re-exports increased by 1.
2 percent and that of domestic exports decreased by 10.2 percent,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the change in the volume of external
trade mainly to the change in trade value with the effect of price
changes discounted.
</P>
<P>
The prices of re-exports and domestic exports in August this
year fell by 2.1 percent and 2.9 percent respectively and imports
prices also declined by 1.2 percent, compared with the same period

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Chinese-Arab Ties, Mankind Civilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, November 2 Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin delivered a speech on Chinese-Arab relationship and the
development of human civilizations at the conference hall of the
King Abdulaziz Public Library at the center of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Jiang first quoted Mohammed's famous remarks of "For people in
pursuit of knowledge, even China is not too far away" to
demonstrate the long time friendship between China and Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, the Chinese and Arab people have learned from
each other and their friendly relations can be traced back to
ancient times. We have been linked up by the ancient 'Silk Road',
which serves as a bond of friendship," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese and Arabic nations have a long history and
have created their own brilliant civilizations. China produced in
its history many outstanding philosophers, thinkers, statesmen,
strategists, scientists, writers and artists, and left Chinese
people volumes of literature, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The ancient Arabs also made remarkable achievements in the
areas of medicine, philosophy, literature, history, geography,
mathematics and chemistry, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
"The human society has created varied and colorful
civilizations in its long process of evolution. These
civilizations, with all their similarities and differences, are
products of human wisdom," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President pointed out that it is essential for
different civilizations to conduct dialogue and exchanges on an
equal basis, learn from each other, and draw on others' strength
to make up for their own weaknesses. They will thus be able to
bring new prosperity to human civilization while developing and
enriching themselves.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that conflicts and disagreements are unavoidable
between various nations due to their differences in historical
development, social background, cultural tradition and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
These conflicts and differences can be resolved through
dialogue and exchanges on an equal footing and in the spirit of
mutual respect, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, it is wrong to trumpet the
civilization of one's own nation as superior and ignore or even
despise other civilizations, make much ado about the differences
between civilizations, or attempt to stir up conflicts between
various civilizations, because they are detrimental to progress of
world civilization and to the lofty cause of world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
China and the Arabic countries are all developing countries.
Sympathizing and supporting each other in international affairs,
they are a staunch force for world peace and regional stability,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that China all along attached importance to its
friendly relations and cooperation with Arabic countries and
supported the just cause of the Arab people and their efforts to
gain legitimate rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Arabic countries have rendered China their
resolute support on the question of Taiwan and many other issues.
The two sides share broad common views on human rights and a wide
range of other issues. The recent years have witnessed increased
political exchanges and expanded economic cooperation and trade
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also recalled the sweeping changes in China over this
century, especially the remarkable achievements it has scored over
the past 50 years since New China was established in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's speech won warm applause from some 400 participants,
including members of the Saudi royal family, government officials
and celebrities from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Supervisor of the King Library Fasel Al Moamer said in his
welcoming speech that Jiang's visit and his speech well
demonstrate that both countries and peoples have attached
importance to maintaining culture and civilization of the mankind.
</P>
<P>
Al Moamer said that all peoples of the Arab countries have held
respect for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The supervisor said Arabians and Chinese have many common
points, adding that they are all offsprings of the ancient
countries of civilization, and that they have all exerted efforts
to maintain the characteristics of the nations of respective
countries and that they have all made important contributions to
the development of civilization of the mankind.

<HEADLINE> Stock Market to Play a Major Role in China's SOE Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Shougang Co., Ltd., one of
China's biggest iron and steel producers, has recently raised 1.8
billion yuan from the stock market through the issue of 350
million shares to domestic investors.
</P>
<P>
Company officials said the issue will reduce its debt-to-assets
ratio and expand its profit base significantly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 900 Chinese enterprises, most of
which are state-owned enterprises (SOEs), have been listed on
domestic and overseas stock markets since the early 1990s when
China opened its own stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises have raised more than 400 billion yuan from
stock exchanges, which has helped them improve their financial
condition, accelerate their technical development, and expand
their profit base.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts say the stock market can play an even larger
role in raising funds for China's SOEs. Listed companies now
account for less than 10 percent of all businesses in China,
compared to 50 percent in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
They also note that the capitalization of the Chinese stock
market is only 30 percent of the nation's gross domestic product (
GDP), compared to 40 percent for developing countries as a whole,
and 70 percent for developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The continued expansion of the Chinese stock market is feasible
in terms of capital supply, they believe.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Industrial Electricity Fees to Rise 5.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korean industrial
electricity fees will rise by an average of 5.3 percent from
Friday while household utility fees will remain unchanged, said
the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the government's tight budget made it
impossible to make new power plants, causing state-owned Korea
Electric Power Corp.(KEPCO) to borrow continually from overseas.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the price increase, KEPCO's investment reserve ratio
still remains at 5.8 percent, far below the optimum level of 9
percent. There is still room for price hikes next year," said a
ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, South Korea has subsidized electricity
fees for manufacturing industries to stimulate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, the KEPCO suffered mounting losses due to facilities
expansion to meet growing demand.
</P>
<P>
Under such a subsidized price structure, there is no need for
South Korean industries to invest in electricity-saving facilities,
leaving KEPCO with a majority of the bill for increased electrical
output.
</P>
<P>
Following the price rise this week, KEPCO is expected to see
net profits rise this year to 15.32 trillion won, the ministry
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches Mechanism to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday launched
a poverty-eradicating mechanism, which involves the government,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Known as "Pusat Rahmat" (Daily Consultation Center to Assist
the Hardcore Poor), the mechanism will coordinate the various
efforts at poverty eradication among urban dwellers and will be
extended to cover the whole country, Deputy Prime Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said at the launching the first Pusat Rahmat
here.
</P>
<P>
Describing the efforts at poverty eradication as an unfinished
struggle and would be carried out continuously, Badawi said that
the Pusat Rahmat was created to forge cooperation between the NGOs
and volunteers to assist in poverty eradication in a more
effective manner.
</P>
<P>
The Pusat Rahmat has three major roles, that is, to coordinate
programs on poverty eradication carried out by government
agencies, non-governmental and private organizations as well as
volunteers, to monitor the process of providing assistance by the
government, NGOs and the private sector, and to handle new cases
of poverty in urban areas, according to the deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Pusat Rahmat would be managed by those who know where to
seek assistance from government agencies or other organizations,
and this would facilitate measures to be taken to assist the
target groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
All funds for the running of the center would come from
existing allocation from the Rural Development Ministry, Badawi
said.
</P>
<P>
The target groups of the center are poor individuals and
families earning less than 1,500 ringgit (about 395 U.S. dollars)
a month who are eligible for assistance under the urban poverty
eradication program, single mothers and those receiving assistance
from the Social Welfare Department, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged government agencies to give serious attention to all
recommendations made by the Pusat Ramhat so that whatever problems
faced by the hardcore poor at the center could be resolved there
and then.

<HEADLINE> Stock Market to Play a Major Role in China's SOE Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The savings deposits of Chinese citizens now stand at six
trillion yuan and the figure is increasing by 800 billion yuan a
year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has recently issued a series of new
policies to further increase capital supply, including allowing
SOEs and listed companies to buy stocks, allowing insurance firms
to invest in securities investment funds, and encouraging
securities brokers to expand their capital base.
</P>
<P>
Government interference and the absence of a visible owner have
been major causes for low efficiency in the SOEs. Analysts say an
ideal option is to restructure the SOEs into stock companies and
allow them to be listed on stock exchanges, so that visible
shareholders will replace the invisible state as their owners.
</P>
<P>
As listed firms, the SOEs would have to subject its operations
to the scrutiny of shareholders, the regulations of the stock
exchanges, securities regulatory bodies, law firms and accounting
firms.
</P>
<P>
The lack of an effective stimulus mechanism is also an old
problem for China's SOEs. The contract system experiment in the
past has often led to only short-term adjustments on the part of
the managers.
</P>
<P>
More recently, Chinese experts have recommended a managers'
stock option system, which is widely used in well-known companies
in developed countries. A number of Chinese firms have already
taken this recommendation.
</P>
<P>
The stock market's other major function is to optimize the
allocation of resources through market forces, a process that has
been demonstrated in the economic development of today's China.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Chinese consumer electronics producers
such as Changhong, Haier and Konka have increased their production
and market shares by purchasing a number of smaller companies, and
have gained market shares previously held by foreign producers.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment of the state sector of the economy is a major
strategy of the Chinese government. Its implementation has begun
with the experiment of decreasing the amount of state-owned shares
in chosen SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say the government's experimental program is a
feasible and cheap way for the state sector to withdraw from
competitive sectors of the economy, while the huge funds raised in
the process can be used for the social security system and sectors
where the state-owned economy should play a bigger role.
</P>
<P>
Some experts predict that in this way the ownership of China's
SOEs soon would be diversified, and a mutual holding relationship
would appear among China's SOEs and between SOEs and private
businesses.
</P>
<P>
By that time, the state sector of the economy would be much
more competitive versus the private sector than it is now,
according to these experts.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Protest Against Adoption of Sharia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of residents in
Nigeria's northern city of Kaduna took to streets Monday to stage
a protest against the adoption of Sharia, an Islamic legal system,
in Zamfara State, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Christian Association of Nigeria, the organizer of the
protest, called on the Federal Government of Nigeria to annul
Sharia in Zamfara State before it spreads to other states in the
northern part of the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Residents participating in the protest were quoted as saying
that "what is happening in Zamfara State is not all religious, it
is political."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the foundation for Sharia in Nigeria was laid by
late General Sani Abacha, former head of state, they accused
Abacha's associates of precipitating the current Sharia crisis
apparently to divert the present government's attention from
rebuilding the nation.
</P>
<P>
When the government of the Zamfara State launched Sharia last
Wednesday, people in the most populous African country rose in
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide survey last week conducted by The Post Express,
a local newspaper, Nigerians voiced their resentment to the
adoption of Sharia in Zamfara State.
</P>
<P>
Out of 1,807 respondents from various parts of the country,
1,511 or 83. 6 percent of them voted against the adoption of
Sharia by any state in the country, saying that such development
grossly undermined the Constitution of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria as well as the rights of the citizens including Moslems.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has reportedly described
the adoption of Sharia by the Zamfara State government as
unconstitutional. While addressing Harvard University in
Boston, the United States, on Saturday, the president said that
the Nigerian constitution did not allow any part of the country to
adopt state religion or any law that would go against the national
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is a secular state, nobody can adopt any religion as
state religion, he emphasized, adding that the controversy over
the adoption of Sharia shall soon fizzle out.
</P>
<P>
However, Obasanjo explained that as Nigeria is a federation,
the constitution allows the local levels of government to apply
Sharia in personal matters like marriage and inheritance.

<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Forty-year-old Ji Xihua from
east China's Jiangsu province was one of ten outstanding women
awarded a "Cup of The Best Women" at The Great Hall Of The People
here today.
</P>
<P>
Ji, who 20 years ago was living in poverty-stricken conditions,
now owns over 20 million yuan (2.4 million US dollars) of assets.
She is one of the 600 rural women awarded a cup by the All-China
Women's Federation (ACWF). These women are millionaires and now
helped other rural women out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, vice president of the ACWF, said at the awarding
ceremony that "We'd like to encourage more rural women to get
rich." Only when the economic status of women is improved, can
their social status be improved as well, she said.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF established an Agricultural Technology Instruction
Center for rural women organizing female agricultural experts to
share their knowledge and practical skills. Millions of rural
women have benefited.
</P>
<P>
Local women's associations have also promoted raising silkworms,
ducks, geese and planting fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
Ji Xihua, known as the "Queen of Azaleas", used to carry water
from far away to water her azaleas. Ji has established a
laboratory with five part-time professors from Nanjing
Agricultural University. She now owns the biggest azalea
production base in China.
</P>
<P>
Henan Province also has a group of rural female millionaires.
Liu Zhihua, who started with four grazing animals, three hutches,
a carriage and the borrowed 8,000 yuan (960 US dollars), now has
earnings of 300 million yuan (36 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Having studied Chinese rural women for six years, Hua Fuzhou,
also a vice-president of the ACWF, said that "women can better
bear hardships than men and are better at running things through
hardwork and thrift."

So far, Egyptian and U.S. leaders and officials have ruled out
the possibility that a terrorist act led to the tragedy. But they,
however, also cautioned that it is premature to jump to
conclusions.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Associated Chinese
Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia (ACCCIM) and the
Federation of Chinese Associations of Malaysia (FCAM) Tuesday
expressed their support for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and
the government under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir met at his office in Putrajaya near here a delegation
of the two organizations, representing the Malaysian Chinese
community.

<P>
The delegation, jointly led by ACCCIM president Lim Guan Teik
and FCAM President Chong Chin Shoong, expressed the support of the
two organizations for Mahathir, the ACCCIM and FCAM said in a
statement after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They said both organizations have helped contribute to
prosperity, stability and national development, and many of their
leaders have also played a role in national politics, before and
after independence.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, it is important for both organizations to state
their support for Mahathir and the government under his leadership
and this expression of support was necessary since Malaysia is
facing various external pressures towards the end of the 20th
Century, they said.
</P>
<P>
The ACCCIM and FCAM expressed their full support for the
various measures taken by the government in meeting the challenges
on the economy, the country and national leadership, they said.

TEHRAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday strongly criticized
U.S. Vice President Al Gore for calling Iran a "repressive and
fundamentalist regime."
</P>
<P>
Terming Al Gore's remark as "unfounded and baseless," Asefi
said such groundless remarks made as the forthcoming
U.S. presidential election approaches, were only aimed to please
the Zionists (Israelis), the Islamic Republic N ews Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at an influential U.S. institute two
days ago, Al Gore, the main hope and major candidate of
the Democratic Party for the next year's U.S. presidential
elections, termed Iran as an "repressive and fundamentalist
regime."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said that such statements were
indicative of the difference existing in the stance of the
U.S. administration and contradiction in their words and
practice.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, several senior U.S. officials called for
"unconditional dialog" between Washington and Tehran for a
rapprochement. The two sides severed their diplomatic relations in
1981 following the Islamic revolution.

<P>
LONDON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Leeds manager David O'Leary is
on a collision course with FIFA after his defiant insistence that
Harry Kewell will not be allowed to play in two friendlies for
Australia later this month.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, football's world governing body, have confirmed that
Soccer Australia have grounds for an appeal to force Leeds to
release their star midfielder.
</P>
<P>
Kewell has admitted he is "gutted" he will miss out on the
first match, against Brazil, with the friendlies coinciding with a
10-day break while England and Scotland meet in the Euro 2000 play-
offs.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old was especially keen to play in the game against
Ronaldo and Co on November 14 as it is being held in his home town
of Sydney and is also Frank Farina's first game as national coach.
</P>
<P>
An adamant O'Leary said: "I am sorry to disappoint the
Australian nation, I am sorry to disappoint the player and sorry
to disappoint his family, who would have been looking forward to
seeing their son back on home soil.
</P>
<P>
"But the bottom line is that Harry is a young player and I've
got to look after him. It's only the beginning of November and
already we are having a very hard season.
</P>
<P>
"Harry will one day be a truly great player and it's my duty to
help him along that path.
</P>
<P>
"Harry and his manager (Farina) will argue that the match has
come during a lull in the Premiership, this time because of the
Euro 2000 qualifier between England and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"But it's my view that it is the ideal opportunity for him to
have a well-earned rest."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Yorkshire Evening Post, O'Leary added: "The
game places extraordinary demands on top players and we must take
care of them."

<HEADLINE> Barak's Adviser to Head Team in Talks with Syria: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has chosen one of his senior advisers to lead the Israeli
team in the negotiations with Syria when they are resumed, a local
daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of reserve general Uri Saguy, former head of
Israel's military intelligence, was not announced by the
government apparently because Barak did not want to appear
pressured to restart talks with Damascus, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
Saguy had been a member of the Israeli negotiating team with
Syria during the government of the late prime minister Yitzhak
Rabin. He participated in talks with Syria's Chief of Staff Hikmet
Shihabi and its Washington Ambassador Walid Muallem.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria exchanged a considerable amount of
encouraging messages soon after the election victory of Barak in
Israel's national elections in May, expressing their desire to
restart the peace talks which broke off three years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the mood of disappointment has been rising in the
last few months since the two sides are at odds over how
the talks should be started.
</P>
<P>
Syria has demanded an Israeli ctary of state Warren Christopher, to fully
withdraw from the Golan Heights. It insists that the talks be
resumed from that point.
</P>
<P>
But Israel claims that Syria misunderstood Rabin's position,
saying he only raised a hypothetical question on a full
Israeli withdrawal to see what Syria will offer.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Rival Groups End Peace Consultations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The week-long separate
consultations among 16 out of 18 Burundian groups involved in the
Arusha peace process ended here last weekend with several
resolutions reached, the Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources from the Front for Democracy in
Burundi as saying that "the resolutions reached last week would be
signed by three major groups during the next round of Arusha peace
talks."
</P>
<P>
However, the next round of Arusha peace negotiations is yet to
be scheduled due to the absence of an ideal mediator to replace
Tanzania's former president Julius Nyerere, who was once the
driving force behind the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Delegations form the Bujumbura military government and the
National Unity for Progress did not take part in the separate
consultations which were held for the first time after the death
of Nyerere in a London hospital on October 14.
</P>
<P>
The delegates attending the consultations included two ousted
Burundian presidents, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and Jean-Baptiste
Bagaza, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Burundian government expressed its readiness to
continue with the Arusha peace process until a quick peace
agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Progress in Burundi peace talks has been slow since they were
launched in June last year because of the mistrust between
different factions over a conflict in which more than 150,000
people have died since October of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation has been going on between the Burundian
government, rebels and political leaders, all divided into 18
factions.

TOKYO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder expressed the hope Tuesday that China would
attend the summit of the Group of Eight (G-8) in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"In the 21st century, it will certainly be meaningful to
involve China in discussions" on controlling and preventing
regional conflicts and promoting international cooperation,
Schroeder told reporters at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"There are many pending political and economic problems, and
considering the size and importance of the country, I would like
China to become a part of the G-8," he said.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor, who is on a three-day official visit to
Japan starting October 31, said Germany, which hosted the previous
G-8 summit in Cologne last June, will cooperate with Japan to make
the next G-8 summit to be held in Japan next July a success.
</P>
<P>
Besides Japan and Germany, the G-8 also groups Britain, Canada,
France, Italy, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Schroeder said the relationship between
Japan and Germany is healthy and he hopes bilateral ties will be
further deepened on various levels.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder later left for China to continue his week-long two-
nation Asian tour. During his stay in China until Friday,
Schroeder will hold talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A British "security" company
has offered Turks help in destroying vital military targets in
Cyprus, local newspapers said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a recent report from the British newspaper Sunday
Times, local papers said that Aims Ltd. of Salisbury in Wiltshire
has offered the Turks expertise and personnel to help them
"neutralize" critical military targets in southern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The British "security" company has close ties with Britain's
secret services and the Special Air Service (SAS)'s anti-terrorist
unit.
</P>
<P>
The company, which is currently under investigation by the
Scotland Yard, had proof war between Turkey and Greece, the
newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The director of the British company insisted that the company
had the approval of the British government.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers said the company was also willing to
"neutralize" suspected Kurdish bases in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Aims Ltd. is under investigation after the Sunday Times
disclosed that it had plotted to murder Abdullah Ocalan, leader of
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and had been
engaged in a series of mercenary activities.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was sentenced to death on treason and separatism charges
on June 29 for leading a 15-year guerrilla war for autonomy in
predominantly Kurdish Southeast Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Retrench 2,000 Mine Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 Zambian mine workers
will be retrenched as part of a rationalization program to make
the country's mining industry more viable.
</P>
<P>
Roan Mining Corporation of Zambia (RAMCOZ), a major copper mine
 corporation in the country, will reduce its workforce to about
6,000 from 8, 000, Mines Development Minister Syamukayumbu
Syamujaye was quoted by Zambia Daily Mail as saying here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said there is an understanding with the new owners of the
now private mine corporation that the restructuring will have to
be conducted after its privatization.
</P>
<P>
Mining industry is Zambia's mainstay, which earns about 80
percent of the country's foreign exchange. However, in the past
decade, Zambia's mining industry has been hit by falling
production and dropping copper prices in international market.
</P>
<P>
To revive the industry by attracting foreign investment,
expertise and management, Zambia has been trying to quicken the
privatization of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the process has been dragging on and negotiations with
foreign mining corporations on the sale of mines are very
difficult.

Wood packing from the two countries should avoid the use of
conifer materials, according to a joint statement released on
Monday by China's State Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection
and Quarantine, the General Administration of Customs, and the

<HEADLINE> Japan Decides to Resume Charter Flight to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan has decided to resume
charter flights to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
as the first stage in easing sanctions against the country, Deputy
Chief Cabinet Secretary Soichiro Matsutani announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision will take effect immediately, Matsutani said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's decision came after the DPRK, in talks with the United
States in September, announced that it would not test any missiles
as long as dialogue continues with Washington.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo imposed the sanction, together with a suspension of food
aid and negotiations for normalizing ties with Pyongyang, after
the DPRK launched a three-stage rocket on August 31 last year,
part of which flew over Japan. Pyongyang said it was a rocket
carrying a satellite, but Japan said it was a medium-range
ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
Japan resumed informal contacts with the DPRK when Foreign
Ministry officials of both countries met in Singapore on October
18-20.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Frontier defense guards in
Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian Province, have smashed two
super would-be illegal emigrant cases.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, in one case, at dawn on October 31,
the Changle Frontier Defense Brigade, with support from local
police, detained 81 people who were being led by four Taiwan
residents in an attempt to sneak into the United States aboard a
shabby boat built of iron sheets.
</P>
<P>
The boat set sail on October 27 but was forced to return
because of strong storms and huge waves on the high seas.
</P>
<P>
The four smugglers of human cargo, known as "snakeheads", were
from elsewhere, but all of the 77 people who had paid to be
smuggled into the U.S. were from Fujian, including ten women.
</P>
<P>
The boat was grounded on the coast near Jiangtian of Changle
City and many people on the boat attempted to escape by jumping
into the water near the shore. The grounding was instantly
reported to the Jiangtian Frontier Defense Station by nearby
residents.
</P>
<P>
In another similar case smashed one week earlier, the Mawei
Frontier Defense Brigade detained another 46 people on the Fuzhou-
Quanzhou Expressway who were attempting to sneak out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Opens Bids for Mobile Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The search for Kenya's second
mobile telephone network has reached the penultimate stretch with
the opening of the technical and business bids presented by six
pre-qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
The Communication Commission of Kenya said Monday that the bids
were presented by the consortia that had been short listed for
consideration from an original list of 23, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya now has only one mobile telephone company, the
state-owned Telkom Kenya, which charges much higher than other
places. The government aims to lower the cost of mobile telephones
through the formation of a second network.
</P>
<P>
As the government only allows foreigners to take 40 percent
stake of the new mobile network, the bidders which represent
Kenyan companies are expected to provide evidence of no less than
a 60-percent stake in the business.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, local outfits have teamed up with
the foreign consortia from France and South Africa among others
for tendering the new project.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Chepkong'a, Director-General of the commission, said
"his organization would analyze the documents until next Thursday
when we will open the financial bids. It is also the day that we
will announce the results of the technical and business bids."
</P>
<P>
The commission would only accept financial bids from those that
have performed well on the business and technical front,
Chepkong'a added.

<HEADLINE> China Prints 10,000 Copies of Bible Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- China prints 10,000 copies of
the Bible a day on an average, according to an official with the
China Christian Council.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yuchun, deputy director of the Publishing Committee of
the Council told Xinhua that China is expected to print 2.9
million to 3 million copies of Bible this year.
</P>
<P>
He said, since China's implementation of the opening-up and
reform policy in 1978, "the country has printed a total of 26
million copies of the Bible".
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, before the founding of new China in 1949, the
country only printed around 1 million copies of Bible in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Amity Printing Co. Ltd, a joint venture between the
Amity Foundation and the United Bible Societies Publishing Co. Ltd
(Hong Kong) has been having the dominating share of Bible printing
in China since its establishment in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Han Shaning, Director of the printing company, explained that
his company prints annually 2 million to 3 million copies of the
Bible in the past 10 years. That means "around 10,000 copies of
Bible was printed during each working day," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese workers has 22 working days a month on an average.
</P>
<P>
Han said, apart from Chinese edition of Bible, his company has
been printing the Spanish, English and French editions of the
Bible and seven Chinese ethnic groups' language editions including
Yi, Miao and Korean languages.
</P>
<P>
In addition, his company has also began to provide Braille
edition of the Bible for the blind.
</P>
<P>
Han said, his print company receives annually about 50 foreign
delegations on an average, claiming the quality of the Bible
printing of his company is excellent.
</P>
<P>
Han's company also produces over a million of Christian
calendars each year and makes paper-cut crafts and porcelain works
with Jesus portraits, crafts with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The local post office fetches from Han's company the Bible
copies once a week for railway delivery.
</P>
<P>
He said, just after the heavy floods hit areas along the
Yangtze River last year, over 60,000 copies of Bible were sent to
the flood-hit areas together other disaster relief goods.
</P>
<P>
In China, it is convenient for people to go to church and buy
the Bible.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yuchun said: "China has so far opened 65 centers for
Bible distribution." Apart from delivering to Christian churches
nationwide, his company also sends about 1.5 million copies of the
Bible to the believers and house churches by mail.
</P>
<P>
Statistics made by China Christian Council indicated that
before the founding of new China in 1949, China only had less than
700,000 Christian believers while the country has over 10 million
Christian believers now.
</P>
<P>
China so far has over 12,000 Christian churches nationwide.

XINING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Police in northwest China's
Qinghai Province said they have arrested 18 saker falcon poachers
on separate occasions and set free six falcons that had been

<HEADLINE> U.S. Aircraft Carrier Visits Jordanian Harbor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. navy aircraft carrier,
the USS John F. Kennedy, has arrived in Jordan's southern harbor
of Aqaba for a four-day visit, a statement from the U.S. Embassy
in Amman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a U.S. aircraft fleet visited the only
harbor of the desert kingdom. Also docked at Aqaba on Monday was a
nuclear-powered attack submarine, the USS Scranton.
</P>
<P>
Over 5,000 crew members of the two ships will leave onshore to
visit tourism and archaeological sites of the kingdom, and
undertake community activities in Aqaba, including cleaning up
beaches and coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft Kennedy, known as an all-purpose, all-mission
carrier, was named after the 35th president of the United States
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft is 1,052 feet (320.86 meters) long, 252 feet
(76.86 meters) wide and weighs 80,000 tons, which travels at 30
knots and has a crew of around 5,000. It has carried out 15
combat missions around the world since it was built in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The USS Scranton, a Los Angeles class submarine and the most
prolific class of nuclear-powered attack submarine of the
U.S. navy, was first deployed in 1993 and named after the town of
Scranton, Pennsylvania of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The submarine, 360 feet (109.8 meters) long, has 129 crew
members and travels at 25 knots.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the aircraft fleet is apparently aimed at showing
solidarity between Jordan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Washington takes Jordan as an ally in the Arab world and has
been helping the kingdom to build up its defense muscles since it
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government provided some 75 million U.S. dollars in
military aid to the kingdom in 1998, including tanks and armored
vehicles, rockets, night-vision devices and other sophisticated
equipments.

<HEADLINE> Australian Marathon Swimmer Worried Charge Affect Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Australian endurance swimmer
Susie Maroney is worried that the charged of drink driving would
irreversibly damage her image as a role model, her agent said in
Sydney on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maroney, 24, was hospitalized early Sunday after police found
her in her car parked on a Sydney street near her parents home
wearing her pyjamas. She has been charged with drink driving.
</P>
<P>
While Maroney is expected to remain in hospital until the
weekend, her agent Max Markson said she had suffered a physical
and mental breakdown.
</P>
<P>
She had expressed deep regret and embarrassment over the charge,
Markson told the Nine Network's Today program. "The initial thing
with the family is that they were very embarrassed, Susie was very
embarrassed and she was in a distressed state,"
</P>
<P>
"Susie feels really bad, that maybe she's letting people down
because she's seen as a role model for a lot of people. Susie
obviously feels this enormous responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Maroney's mother said her daughter had been through a tough few
months, probably caused by the recent death of her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
Maroney completed a 160-kilometers swim from Jamaica to Cuba in
September this year. She had already succeeded in swimming from
Cuba to the United States in 1997 and from Mexico to Cuba in 1998.
</P>
<P>
She announced in October that she would swim from Haiti to Cuba
next May. But, with nine history-making swims already to her name
though, Maroney said that would be her last such effort.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Hosts Regional Conference on Zoo Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 zoologists from 17
countries and regions are in Ho Chi Minh City for a three-day
regional conference on zoo conservation and development, Vietnam
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the annual conference of the Southeast Asian
Zoos Association (SEAZA) will present papers on animal husbandry
and veterinary medicine, education and environmental conservation,
and the design and management of zoos.
</P>
<P>
Experts will study Vietnam's zoos to better understand the
diversity of wildlife in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which will end on Wednesday, also aims to
promote combined international efforts to conserve wildlife in
Southeast Asia and to step up awareness campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that the past environment campaigns have
helped change people's attitudes to nature and have helped zoos'
to improve their conservation work.
</P>
<P>
In addition to 275 mammalian species, 828 bird species, 180
reptile species, and 80 amphibian species, Vietnam also has 471
fresh water and over 2,000 sea fish species.
</P>
<P>
The country also lists 7,000 plant, 800 moss, 6,000 mushroom
species.
Since 1992, three new mammalian species have been discovered in
the country; Sao La, Giant Muntjac and Truong Son Muntjac, and in
July this year the first pictures of Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros
were released. The Sai Gon Zoo and Botanical Garden have
succeeded in breeding two crocodile species, the Annamese silver
pheasant, hog deer and red cheek gibbon in captivity while the
Hanoi Zoo has bred the Vietnamese pheasant -- once thought to be
extinct.
</P>
<P>
The delegates to the conference visited the Sai Gon Zoo, which
was established in 1865. They will also tour the Mekong River
Delta, Cham Chim (Bird Sanctuary) in the south and the Cuc Phuong
National Park in northern Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Adviser to Head Team in Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has chosen one of his senior advisers to lead the Israeli
team in the negotiations with Syria when they are resumed, a local
daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of reserve general Uri Saguy, former head of
Israel's military intelligence, was not announced by the
government apparently because Barak did not want to appear
pressured to restart talks with Damascus, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
Saguy had been a member of the IsraeSyria's Chief of Staff Hikmet
Shihabi and its Washington Ambassador Walid Muallem.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria exchanged a conessing their desire to
restart the peace talks which broke off three years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the mood of disappointment has been rising in the
last few months since the two sides are at odds over how
the talks should be started.
</P>
<P>
Syria has demanded an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau seized by Israel in
the 1967 Middle East War, as the precondition for the restart of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Damascus said Rabin had made a promise in 1995, through the
then U.S. secretary of state Warren Christopher, to fully
withdraw from the Golan Heights. It insists that the talks be
resumed from that point.
</P>
<P>
But Israel claims that Syria misunderstood Rabin's position,
saying he only raised a hypothetical question on a full
Israeli withdrawal to see what Syria will offer.

<HEADLINE> Asia's IT Spending to E-Commerce to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Information Technology
(IT) spending towards embracing e-commerce by businesses in Asia
is expected to increase, tagging along with an expected huge
increase in global IT spending in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Asian companies are expected to increase their IT spending to
7.5 percent out of revenue from five percent currently, as global
IT spending will reach 3.3 trillion U.S. dollars by the year 2003,
of which 50 percent will be spent on electronic-business
applications, William Houng-Lee, managing director of Oracle
Systems Malaysia Private Ltd. said at a Vision Tour for Malaysian
chief executive officers held here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Oracle Systems Malaysia is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
U.S.-based Oracle Corporation which is currently the world's
second largest software company and a leading supplier of software
for information management application.
</P>
<P>
This will be driven by the fact that business-to-business
e-commerce is expected to exceed 1.0 trillion U.S. dollars in
2003, William Houng-Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Companies themselves will begin moving their buying or sourcing
from the Internet, he said, adding that suppliers of these
companies will also have to be on-line or face losing as they will
not be able to bid on supply contracts.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the coming years as e-commerce and e-business
develop, large companies and entire industries across the board
are expected to form electronic trading communities.
</P>
<P>
The move to Internet computing will also be motivated by its
internal cost efficient properties in company operations as
decision making and processing tasks will be aided by better flow
of information which leads to better managers, employees,
customers and business partners, he said.

<HEADLINE> Senior Filipino MP Rejects Tax on Funds' Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Philippine House rejected Tuesday the proposal to tax the
investments of the Social Security System (SSS) and the Government
Service Insurance Systems (GSIS), the country's two largest
state-run pension funds.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Gullas, Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives,
said in a statement that the move would threaten social security
benefits and undermine the long-term viability of the two funds.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for Congress to keep the two pension funds
free from taxes and all other government imposts to sustain their
financial viability in the years ahead, Gullas said, "Once we
subject SSS and GSIS investments to regular taxes, we would, in
effect, be indirectly taxing social security benefits."
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance (DOF) earlier sought the swift
approval of a house bill that would subject SSS and GSIS
investments to the capital gains tax, the stock transaction tax
and the final tax on the interest income of bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
The DOF has been under pressure to identify possible new
revenue sources as the national government grapples with the a
growing budget deficit and massive tax collection shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
Gullas, however, said the DOF should look elsewhere for
incremental revenues.
</P>
<P>
"It would be counterproductive for us to start taxing the SSS
and the GSIS now, only to later bail them out with costlier
government subsidies," Gullas said.

<P>
CANBERRA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Australian trainer Bart
Cummings won his 11th Melbourne Cup when seven-year-old Rogan Josh,
ridden by John Marshall, took Australia's most famous horse race
Melbourne Cup on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ridden desperately in the closing stages, Rogan Josh overhauled
European runner Central Park to win the three million Australian
dollars (1.9 million U.S. dollars) 3,200 meters race at Flemington.
</P>
<P>
Rogan Josh beat Central Park, ridden by Frankie Dettori, by a
half length, with Lahar and another Cummings runner, Zazabelle
deadheating for the third a further half neck away.
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old trainer has won more Melbourne Cups than any
others.
</P>
<P>
Rogan Josh covered most of the race just behind leader Central
Park before being pulled out by hard-riding Marshall for a
powerful finish. Central Park seemed to hang on but it was Rogan
Josh that came out the winner.
</P>
<P>
"Here we are for the 11th time," Cummings said at the
presentation ceremony. "God must be looking after me somehow," he
added.

<HEADLINE> 1,000-Year-Old Suspended Temple Not Affected by Quake (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Suspended Temple, which was
built on a 30-meter-high cliff more than 1,000 years ago, was not
affected at all when an earthquake hit north China Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"I noticed that the windows of the Temple shook a little bit
last night," said Liu Fu, who was on duty in the Suspended Temple
last night when an earthquake measuring 5.6 on Richter scale
jolted areas between Hunyuan County in Shanxi Province and
Yangyuan County in Hebei Province at 21:25 (Beijing Time) in north
China.
</P>
<P>
The old temple is some four kilometers from the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
"I went around early this morning to check what might have been
damaged by the quake," he said, "nothing had happened to the
furnishings inside or the wood columns supporting the Suspended
Temple. They all looked usual."
</P>
<P>
The Suspended Temple, which is in Hunyuan County, was
constructed in the late Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534), and is
made of wood directly against the cliff, with its front supported
only by dozens of wood columns as thick as rice bowls.
</P>
<P>
It is the only existing temple in China which blends Buddhism,
Taoism, and Confucianism.
</P>
<P>
The main hall of the Suspended Temple has two floors and double
eaves, with symmetrical two-floor pavilions on each side. The
Temple compound also includes two pavilions with three floors and
three eaves.

"None of the 40 halls, houses or pavilions in the Temple were
injured by the quake," said an administrative staff member.
</P>
<P>
The Monday night quake with its epicenter located at 39.8
degrees north latitude and 113.9 degrees east longitude, caused
one slight injury and damage to 291 rooms and houses in Shanxi
Province. Bricks and tiles also fell from some 3,000 rooms and
houses, and walls were cracked, he said.
</P>
<P>
In October 1989, an earthquake measuring 6.1 on Richter scale
hit Hunyuan, but that one also caused no damage to the Suspended
Temple.
</P>
<P>
The unusual style of the Temple protects it, according to
architects who inspected it after the 1989 quake. The foundation
of the Temple is chiseled rock, and the halls and houses are built
along the mountain, helping to make it quake-proof.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Wholesale Market Remains Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The wholesale market near
Hebron's Avrahem Avinu quarter will not be opened as scheduled
until the Israeli demands are met, said a high-ranking Israeli
security official.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal signed by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Egypt
early September, the wholesale market in Hebron should be opened
by Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side demanded that a wall be built to separate the
market from the Jewish quarter entrance, The Jerusalem Post daily
Tuesday quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jewish settlers in the city strongly oppose to
opening the market to the Palestinians, saying the land on which
the market is situated belongs to them.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli police on Monday prevented a group of activists of
the Israeli peace group, Peace Now, from entering into Hebron,
where they planned to show support for the peace process and
protest the failure in opening the market.
</P>
<P>
The activists were kept away from the city because they had
failed to coordinate with security officials prior to their visit
and their presence in Hebron may lead to clashes with settlers,
said the police.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, a Palestinian-controled city in the south of the West
Bank, has an Arab population of about 130,000. About 500 Jewish
settlers are living in the city under heavy military protection by
Israeli security forces.

-- U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived on Monday in
Oslo to hold talks on the framework of a final peace agreement

to the 1978 peace deal between Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
-- A French judge has obtained some documents proving the
existence of a secret military agreement between six former
military regimes of South America on kidnapping and eliminating
all leftwing opposition members considered to be ``subversives''
in the 1970s. The ``Condor plan'' was signed in 1975 in Santiago
and grouped Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and
Brazil, said Judge Roger Le Loire, who is in charge of files on
five French-Chileans who disappeared in Chile.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tamil Party MP Killed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A Tamil party's member of
parliament was killed Tuesday along with his driver in their car
by unknown gunmen in the capital of Sri Lanka, informed sources
said.
</P>
<P>
A. Nadarajah of the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) was
killed around 11:30 a.m. local time (0530 GMT) in Colombo's
Wellawatte, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The EPDP, a former Tamil rebel group, has given up its armed
struggle and obtained nine seats in the country's 225-member
parliament in the 1994 parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
As a member of Parliament for the EPDP, Nadarajah represented
the northernmost Jaffna district, the former stronghold of the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The sources suspected the gunmen might be sent by the LTTE
rebels who regard Tamil politicians as traitors and have warned
them away from politics.
</P>
<P>
The killings came as the national elections are around the
corner. The parliamentary election is expected soon after the
presidential election which will be held on December 21 this year,
more than 10 months ahead of earlier scheduled November 2000.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 16-year-old war against the
government for an independent homeland in Sri Lanka's north and
east for minority Tamils.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Joint Military Commission Shelves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) Joint Military Commission (JMC) has temporarily
shelved plans to start implementation of the cease-fire agreement
for fund shortage, JMC Chairman Rachid Lallali said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that many financial pledges by African countries
have not been received, Lallali said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"We shall proceed with our investigations on the verification
mission as soon as funds are available," he was quoted by
Tuesday's Times of Zambia newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the JMC would investigate alleged violations of the
cease-fire agreement by the Laurent Kabila administration on one
hand and the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) and the Congolese
Liberation Movement (MLC) rebel groups on the other.
</P>
<P>
"There have been accusations of violations but we feel there
are no major violations. The rebels and the government are
partners now and are eager to have the Lusaka Peace Process
implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lallali said the JMC would have its provisional headquarters
set up in Lusaka before shifting to Kinshasa once everything was
set.
</P>
<P>
"We thank our political leaders for successfully playing a big
part in bringing the war to an end. This is a big challenge to
Africa and shows that we are ready to solve our own problems," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lallali said the differences on representation by the Emile
Ilunga (GOMA) RCD faction and the Kisangani group of Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba were resolved when both camps agreed to have consensus
on major decisions.

TAIYUAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Thus far, only one slight
injury and no deaths have been reported in yesterday's earthquake
in the area between Hunyuan County in north China's Shanxi
Province and Yangyuan County in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale at 21:25 (

Hunyuan, most of which are old. And cracks and falling bricks and
tiles occurred in some 3,000 houses there, said the local
seismological station.

Eradication Programs
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian government has
signed a four-million-U.S. dollar agreement to support the health
and poverty eradication programs in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony here on Monday, Norwegian Ambassador
to Uganda Arild Oyen said that his country was committed to
reducing poverty in the rural areas as well as in the less
privileged society in the African country.
</P>
<P>
Besides the sectors mentioned, the funds would also be used to
support education, child care, adolescent development, guinea
worm eradication, water and sanitation, coordination and
communication activities during the 1999/2000 period, according to
a New Vision newspaper report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Sidibe, the UNICEF country representative, received
the fund and hailed Norway for its support to Uganda and his
organization.
</P>
<P>
This is the second edition of cooperation between UNICEF and
the Norwegian Aid Development Agency, he said, adding that the
first one was in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sidibe pledged to ensure the transparency over the fund,
saying that the money would be used maximally and monitored so
that the rural poor and the less privileged benefit from it.

<HEADLINE> Injuries Abound as NBA Season Opens with 13 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- When the 54th NBA season
opens Tuesday night, one thing will be obvious: training camp
landed plenty of players in the trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing, Jayson Williams, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Kobe Bryant,
Joe Smith, Theo Ratliff and Otis Thorpe are just some of the big
names who will begin the season on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Ewing, Williams and Ilgauskas, they are still
recovering from injuries suffered last season. But the other four
are among the many who were hurt while preparing for the season,
which gets under way with 13 games on the opening night.
</P>
<P>
The San Antonio Spurs begin defense of their NBA title with a
nationally televised game against the Philadelphia 76ers. While
the Spurs again will be armed with the "Twin Towers" of Tim Duncan
and David Robinson, the 76ers will be without their two big men --
Ratliff and Matt Geiger, both of whom are sidelined with injuries.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs will receive their championship rings. They will be
without forward Sean Elliott, who had a kidney transplant during
the offseason and will not be back until January, if at all. San
Antonio signed free agents Chucky Brown and Samaki Walker to fill
the void.
</P>
<P>
San Antonio should enjoy an obvious advantage inside but must
figure out a way to contain 76ers guard Allen Iverson, who led the
league in scoring at 26.8 points per game last season and should
be even more dangerous with the new rules limiting defensive
contact. In the team's only meeting last season, Iverson scored
46 points in a 98-94 loss.
</P>
<P>
Big men Ewing and Ilgauskas will sit it out when the Eastern
Conference champion New York Knicks host the Cleveland Cavaliers
and new coach Randy Wittman. The Knicks lost to the Spurs in five
games in last season's NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
Ewing has lingering Achilles tendinitis and may not be back
until January. Ditto for Ilgauskas, who has chronic soreness in
the left foot he broke five games into last season.
</P>
<P>
Also likely out until 2000 is Williams, who is making his way
back from a series of operations on a badly broken leg and whose
rebounding skills may be missed when the New Jersey host the
Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
Bryant is expected to return in December from a broken hand
suffered in practice. The Los Angeles Lakers begin the Phil
Jackson era without their talented guard as they visit the Utah
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
Normally indestructible Jazz forward Karl Marlone, coming off
his second Most Valuable Player award in three seasons, missed
most of the preseason with a lower back strain but will be ready
to go.
</P>
<P>
After winning six championships in eight years with the Chicago
Bulls, Jackson took a one-year hiatus but was lured back to the
bench by the Lakers. He is trying to install his triangle offense
and instill some chemistry in what was a fearsome but fractious
bunch last season.
</P>
<P>
Jackson implored management to acquire Scottie Pippen, a member
of all six championship teams with the Bulls who moved on to
Houston for a season before demanding a trade.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were unable to swing a deal and Pippen landed in
Portland, giving the Trail Blazers perhaps the most talented
roster in the league.
</P>
<P>
Pippen, Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf are new additions to
the Blazers, who visit the banged-up Vancouver Grizziles. The NBA'
s worst team last season at 8-42.
</P>
<P>
In other games, Atlanta visits Washington, Miami hosts Detroit,
Orlando travels to Charlotte and Toronto entertains Boston.
</P>
<P>
Also, Golden State visits Dallas, Milwaukee travels to Houston,
Denver meet Phoenix and Seattle visits the Los Angeles Clippers.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Unveils Versatile Chip For Wireless Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Motorola Inc. on
Monday unveiled a new chip that will enable cellular phones to
operate from any location in the world, regardless of the wireless
platform in place, according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The DSP5690 chip, which can execute all major existing wireless
standards, can also support satellite-based products and Internet
technologies, enabling wireless phone users to send e-mail and
browse the Web faster, Motorola said.
</P>
<P>
Currently the United States has several wireless standards, so
users may need several cell phones depending on their location.
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturers can now standardize their manufacturing around
one smart solution, regardless of the market on which they are
currently focused," said Mario Rivas, vice president and general
manager of Motorola's Wireless division.
</P>
<P>
"This makes it easier for them to scale their production for
different standards and different areas of the world as needed,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Stock watchers believe the chip debut spells profits for the
company. "This news is especially important when in the next few
years standards will converge," said Alex Cena, an analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
Samples of the chip and a companion development board will be
available in limited supply later this year, according to Omid
Tahernia, general manager of Motorola's wireless communications
division, who said Motorola would begin shipping the chips to
handset makers in the first quarter of 2000 and estimated that
phones containing the chips could be in stores as early as the
third or fourth quarter of 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Credit Swisse Group plans
to expand its business in and introduce the new concept '
bancassourance' into China, according to one of its chief
executives.
</P>
<P>
Bancassurance provides clients with a series of banking and
insurance services to better meet their specific needs. The group
has increased economic cooperation with China in various areas
since it came to China in the 1950s. It now has banks in Shanghai
and agencies in Beijing, Tianjin and Guangzhou and business
relations with over 150 financial organizations in China.
</P>
<P>
It has restructured to meet the challenges in the field in the
next century. Even though China is not quite ready for the
insurance market, it has great potential in banking and insurance
because only 37 percent of its people have bought insurance
policies and the social security system needs to further develop.
</P>
<P>
The group also plans to participate in China's infrastructure
development.
</P>
<P>
Credit Swisse consists of five branches and has assets worth
435 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The preliminary design for the
first phase of the subway system in Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province has passed the appraisal of experts.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of the Central
Military Commission Zhang Wannian stressed here today that China's
refusal to disavowal of a possible use of force in the Taiwan
issue is directed at the pro-independence force in Taiwan and
interference from the outside.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remarks while meeting with Chief of the British
Defense Staff Charles Guthrie. Guthrie responded by saying that "
the British government entirely comprehends and approves the stand
China takes on the Taiwan issue."
</P>
<P>
Zhang hailed the bilateral relationship as being continuously
consolidated and developed since China's resumption of exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong. He added that Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's recent visit to Britain in particular has elevated
bilateral relations to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also voiced the hope that the two armed forces will learn
from each other and enhance exchanges and cooperation at all
levels and in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Guthrie said he regards Jiang's visit a milestone in bilateral
relations, and that both countries should go forward together at
the turn of the century for the interest of both peoples and the
whole world.
</P>
<P>
"I've learned through this trip that we have more in common
than differences," he said.

WELLINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- About 1.5 million bank
customers in New Zealand will get access to online banking this
week as two big banks rolled out Internet services.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post reported Tuesday that Australia-New Zealand
Bank (ANZ) launched its Internet banking service Monday, with its
550,000 phone banking customers being able to sign up by visiting
the bank's home page. Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) will unveil a

<P>
Banks are pushing ahead with online services following a boom
in e-commerce and personal Internet use in the last two years, the

Of the five biggest banks in the country with a population of
about 3.8 million people, only WestpacTrust still doesn't offer

<HEADLINE> Chairman of South Korea's Daewoo Group Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of South Korea's Daewoo
Group Kim Woo-choong resigned from his post on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, top managers of Daewoo's 12 major affiliates also
tendered their resignations to the Corporate Restructuring
Committee of the South Korean Financial Supervisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, CEOs of Daewoo Group, the country's second
largest conglomerate, met before their resignation. Kim, who is
now in Europe, failed to show up at the meeting, but delivered his
resignation by telephone, a Daewoo spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to step down from management to take full
responsibility for the Daewoo Group's managerial troubles," said
Kim and the 12 managers in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The resignation of the group chairman and presidents proves
Daewoo's commitment to fully cooperate with the government-
creditor led recovery process," the statement said, urging
creditors to pay special attention to job security for all Daewoo
employees.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who quit in last month the chairmanship of the Federation
of Korean Industries, the largest trade association for domestic
conglomerates in South Korea, has been leading Daewoo for the last
30 years since its foundation as a small textile company in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis that occurred in late 1997 due to
corporate failures and bad loans of financial institutions has
plagued South Korea, the 11th largest industrialized nation, and
has also exposed Daewoo's high indebtedness, negative cash flow
and low profitability which were hidden under its rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
Despite Kim's commitment to restructuring his group last year,
lack of liquidity and unprofitable operations made Daewoo unable
to live up to his pledge.
</P>
<P>
In July 19 this year, Daewoo and its domestic creditor banks
revealed an emergency debt restructuring plan of the business
group, signaling the end of Kim's era in the conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the launch of creditors' debt-rescheduling
programs for 12 major Daewoo companies in late August, Kim vowed
to focus his efforts on Daewoo Motor, his most treasured affiliate.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he wanted to retire in two to three years after
rehabilitating Daewoo Motor through a capital tie-up with General
Motors (GM) and other means.
</P>
<P>
However, Daewoo-GM talks have been in a stalemate due to a huge
pricing gap and other differences.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Daewoo Motor's overall production and marketing
capabilities are slowly deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government, losing patience with the little
progress of Daewoo-GM talks, has decided to turn Daewoo Motor into
a state enterprise before selling it to third parties.

<P>
YANGON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities deported
a female British citizen Monday while she was serving a seven-year
imprisonment with labor in the country, according to the Office of
Strategic Studies of the Myanmar Defense Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rachael Goldwyn, 28, was arrested by the authorities on
September 7 for allegedly instigating political disturbance in
Yangon.
</P>
<P>
A Myanmar township special court passed the sentence on her on
September 16.
</P>
<P>
Her release came less than a month from the day the court
passed the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Rachael Goldwyn is the fourth foreigner expelled by Myanmar
this year on such charge. The prior three are U.S., Belgium and
dual British-Australian citizens.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believes that this move is a friendly gesture
made by the Myanmar authorities in its effort to ease the tense
relation between Myanmar and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Last year Myanmar authorities also deported 18 foreigners, who

<HEADLINE> Romania Accepts EU Proposal on Economic Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile said Monday that Romania will accept the European Union's
proposal to help the country map out a medium- and short-term
economic development plan and will start preparatory work as soon
as possible, the government said in a press statement here.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Vasile said the decision was taken
considering that it is difficulty for Romania to carry through the
economic reforms on its own and maintain a continuous economic
growth without enormous, stable financial support from the
external world.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in an open letter to Vasile, Gunther Verheugen, EU
official in charge of organizational expansion, criticized the
Romanian government for its low efficiency in implementing
economic reforms, especially in reforming the money-losing large
state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Romania's decision on the matter has evoked different reactions.
Some believe it has cleared the way for seeking external financial
aid, but others, including chairman of the biggest opposition
Social Democracy Party Ion Iliescu, consider it unacceptable for a
self-respecting government. Iliescu held that Romania is
completely capable of mapping out its own economic development
plan and take necessary follow-up coordination measures with EU.

<HEADLINE> Tribals' Political Forum Turns into Political Party in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) --The political forum of former
tribal insurgents in Bangladesh's southeastern Chittagong Hill
Tracts (CHT) has turned into a "regional democratic party,"
newspapers here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Parbatya Chhattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (Chittagong Hill
Tracts People's Solidarity Association, PCJSS), made its debut as
a political party on Monday after amending its constitution in the
first ever open congress of the organization which is being held
in Khagrachhari, one of the three hill districts.
</P>
<P>
The four-day congress, the sixth of the PCJSS and the first in
public which opened last Saturday, "constitutionally" abolished
the PCJSS's armed wing, the Shanti Bahini and formed a 35-member
central executive committee of the organization, reelecting
Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma as its chairman.
</P>
<P>
Larma, also known as Shantu Larma, was the chairman of the CHT
Regional Council, which was established in May this year in
accordance with the December 1997 peace accord signed between the
rebels and the government after ending a more-than-two-decade-long
insurgency in the hills.
</P>
<P>
He called his followers to discard the "narrow and ultra
nationalist attitude" in view of the changed situation following
the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
PCJSS leaders were quoted as saying that the organization
unanimously decided to emerge as a "regional democratic party" for
the three hill districts of Khagrachhari, Rangamati and Bandarban,
discarding the path of violent campaign.
</P>
<P>
Since its emergence as a tribal organization in 1972, the PCJSS
held all its five earlier congresses in underground in 1972, 1977,
1990 and 1994 as it waged an insurgency in the hills, demanding
autonomy and expulsion of Bengali-speaking settlers from the
region.
</P>
<P>
Larma, who led the more than two-decade long insurgency in the
hills, criticized the government for the "slow pace in
implementing the peace accord," the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting security sources, a report in The Daily Star said the
PCJSS at the congress demanded total withdrawal of army camps from
the hill tracts.
</P>
<P>
The report said over 60 army camps have been closed and about
2,000 troops withdrawn from the Chittagong Hill Tracts in the past
two years since the signing of the peace treaty. There were over
500 army camps in the hill tracts, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> HK to Build Disney Theme Park: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) reached a deal with Walt Disney Co.
on building a theme park in the region, HKSAR Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government and Walt Disney Co. would form a joint
venture to build a world-class international theme park, a 400-
room Disney themed resort hotel complex and a retail, dining and
entertainment center at Penny's Bay on Lantau Island, Tung
announced at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government's total investment, including equity,
loans and infrastructure expenditure, will be 22.45 billion HK
dollars (2.88 billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government will hold 57 percent of the shares in
the company, while initially the Walt Disney Co. will hold 43
percent under the deal.
</P>
<P>
The project will inject energy into Hong Kong's economic
development, make Hong Kong a tourism attraction in Asia, as well
as enrich Hong Kong people's cultural life, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He said the project would produce an estimated 148-billion-HK-
dollar (18.97 billion U.S. dollars) boost to the HK economy over a
40-year period. "We think that is a pretty good return on our
investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Attendance of over 5 million is expected in the park's first
year of operation, rising to 10 million annually after about 15
years.
</P>
<P>
The massive theme park project would create 6,000 jobs during
the construction phase and some 10,000 new jobs are expected to be
created by the land reclamation and other associated works being
funded by the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Disneyland will generate 18,400 jobs at opening and
up to 35,800 new jobs over a 20-year period.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Consumer organizations in
Thailand are preparing to mobilize their opposition to the use of
genetically modified (GM) products amid confusion over their
harmful effects, the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Saree Ongsomwang of the Foundation For Consumers was quoted by

consumers are still confused.

She quoted a Monday survey at the largest park in central
Bangkok as saying that out of 300 people questioned, only two knew
what GM product was and voiced concern about the issue.

SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Experts at the Shanghai
Medical Center say that constant cuddling contributes to the
healthy, rapid growth of babies.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted on 405 newborns in six hospitals in Shanghai,
China's largest industrial city, showed that the weight of the
babies that were caressed three times a day for at least 15
minutes was 10 percent higher than those that weren't cuddled as
often.
</P>
<P>
The babies that were touched often also were brighter and less
likely to suffer from anemia compared with others, the experts
said, adding that the touching helped to improve the newborn's
breathing capacity.
</P>

A baby "cuddling center" jointly organized by the research team
and the Johnson and Johnson Company of the U.S. has been

YINCHUAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
unearthed a large number of animal fossils dating back 30,000 to
100,000 years in Huinong County in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The excavation began in September at a fossil site discovered
in 1990. To date, they have found more than 50 complete fossils of
a variety of animals such as rhinoceros, deer, sheep, horses,
elephants and hyenas.
</P>
<P>
The fossils, which are well preserved in rock strata in the
Helan Mountains area, formed in the late New Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
The fossils prove that the dry Helan Mountains area used to
have a comfortable climate and sufficient rainfall where animals
enjoyed a leisurely life in luxuriant forests and lakes, according
to the scientists.
</P>
<P>
The discovery provides valuable materials for the study of
ancient geography and the early subsistence environment of the
region.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Urges Canada to Expand Military Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO's new Secretary-General
Lord Robertson on Monday urged Canada to expand military spending
for the modernization of its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The visiting NATO chief described Canada as a country which
needs to do more in terms of modernization of forces.
</P>
<P>
Robertson made the remarks after separate talks with Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Defense Minister Art Eggleton and
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
NATO figures show Canada's military budget accounts for 1.15
percent of its GDP, the last but second only to Luxembourg among
NATO member countries.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Defense Minister Eggleton felt unease with the rating,
saying it may be unfair to look at percentage of the GDP spent on
defense.
</P>
<P>
Canada ranks the seventh in the 19-member alliance with a
military budget of about 10 billion Canadian dollars (about 6.8
billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
His view was echoed by Canadian Foreign Minister Axworthy. "I
think it's one of the really great falsehoods," he said,
challenging the NATO measure of Canada's military spending.
</P>
<P>
He said his country announced 100 million Canadian dollars (
about 68 million U.S. dollars) in aid to Kosovo earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"That's as important a way of establishing influence and being
able to effect change and make a difference as by simply applying
troops," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson is on his first tour to NATO member countries as the
organization's chief. He arrived here late Sunday and is leaving
Monday.

<HEADLINE> High-Yield Corn Benefit Chinese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yuming, a villager who
used to be too poor to feed his family, now holds his head high as
he walks through the busy streets of the county town of Longli in
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Chen now earns 30,000 yuan (about 3,627 U.S. dollars) solely
from raising pigs, three times more than a county magistrate's
monthly salary in China.
</P>
<P>
And Chen's neighbors in Maosu Village have shed their poverty
formerly caused by the low-yielding farmland of this southwestern
province.
</P>
<P>
The change, according to the villagers, is a miracle created by
scientists from the Crop Institute under the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Science.
</P>
<P>
The farmers have planted a high-quality and high-yielding
species of corn developed by the scientists, who are headed by Shi
Dequan, president of the institute, and then raised pigs fed with
the corn.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the small mountain village, Dr. N. Borlang,
a senior advisor with the International Corn and Wheat Renovation
Center, patted the well-fed pigs and asked his hosts, "Why don't
you popularize a good species like this in a speedier manner?"
</P>
<P>
The foreign expert insisted that what the Chinese scientists
are doing is of greater importance to mankind than the Mexico
Green Revolution, in which he had played a leading role for which
he received the Nobel Prize in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Research to develop high-yield corn species began in the United
States. Since 1983, Chinese scientists have made notable progress
in this field, and currently the new species developed by Shi and
his colleagues has been spread across China, with acreage for this
purpose to increase by 80,000 hectares a year, ultimately reaching
3.4 million hectares nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has given priority to the study of high-
quality and high-yielding corn species, according to Vice Minister
of Agriculture Lu Ming.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister said that in the next century, China's
population is expected to peak at 1.6 billion and to linger around
1.5 billion for a half century, which will propel the demand for
high protein-content meat, milk and eggs as well as corn, a main
source of protein for livestock.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates say that by 2020, the country's total demand
for corn is expected to top 204 million tons, 89 percent of which
will be used as animal feed. The acreage available for cultivation,
however, is expected to decrease gradually.
</P>
<P>
China will have to import 21 million tons of corn every year if
domestic output cannot be increased by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949 when the People's Republic was founded, The Chinese
government has been proud of its success in feeding its 1.2
billion population, while scientists are working hard to provide
not only enough, but even better food for the people in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
Shi said China is leading the world in some aspects of this
effort, and the top Chinese agronomist urged domestic and overseas
investors to take note of the research in China, which is
suffering from a shortage of funds, but has great potential and
prospects under a socialist market economy.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese River to Extend Directly to Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- China has begun to dig a 163.5-
km-long waterway to extend the Huaihe River, the country's third
longest, directly to the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
The new waterway, scheduled for completion before 2005, will
act as a flood-relief channel while serving shipping and
irrigation purposes.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge said the project aims to prevent the
lower reaches of the river from flooding.
</P>
<P>
The 1,100-km-long Huaihe River, which originally flowed through
Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces into the Yellow Sea, was
deprived of its channel to the sea in Jiangsu by the Yellow River,
the country's second longest, some 700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, it has had flowed into the Yangtze River, the
country's longest, and has caused frequent flooding.
</P>
<P>
The new waterway will run from Hongze County in western Jiangsu
to the coastal county of Binhai in the eastern part of the
province.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the waterway has been listed as a key state
project, and will cost 4.11 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> More Evidence Proves Japanese Atrocities in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 2 (Xinhua) --A Chinese version of the book "
What War Means: The Japanese Terror in China" written by a British
journalist was recently donated to the Jiangdongmen Museum of
Nanjing in this capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The book is a documentary record compiled and edited by H.J.
Timperley in the 1930s when he was the China correspondent for the
Manchester Guardian.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese version was published in July 1938 by the Guomin
Publishing House of Hankou, now a district of central China's
Wuhan City.
</P>
<P>
In 1938, Guo Moruo, a well-known Chinese poet and historian,
wrote a foreword and the title for the Chinese version of
Timperley's book which was translated into Chinese by Yang Ming.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese copy of the book is in Fuzhou, the capital of
east China's Fujian Province, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that these two copies will serve as powerful
evidence to prove the massacre committed by Japanese aggressors in
Nanjing in 1937. During that holocaust, well over 300,000 innocent
Chinese civilians were slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kaiyuan, a history professor at Central China Normal
University in Wuhan, edited a collection of original and Chinese
translations of diaries, letters and investigatory reports written
by ten missionaries to China from the United States which was
published in August this year.
</P>
<P>
The missionaries, five of whom also used to teach at the then
Jinling University (present-day Nanjing University), told in great
detail about the Nanjing Massacre and expressed their shock at the
holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhang said he hoped his book will be conducive to
uncovering the true face of the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese
aggressors and help to remind people of remembering history.
</P>
<P>
In a related case, a file from the archives of Qingdao in east
China's Shandong Province, contains interviews of Chinese laborers
who survived these hardships and gives new evidence proving the
Japanese aggressors' looting in China and their crimes of
torturing Chinese laborers.
</P>
<P>
According to the file, more than 700,000 Chinese laborers from
different parts of China were sent to Qingdao and then shipped to
northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Japan, where they were
forced into hard labor, and where many of them died.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is poised to benefit
from China's newly-implemented policies to strengthen the use of
investment from overseas, officials from the Municipal Foreign
Economic and Trade Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The central government has transferred power to the provincial

</P>
<P>
Shanghai has pledged to create a better environment for

<HEADLINE> Thai Tapioca Farmers End Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Tapioca farmers have returned
home empty-handed after a week-long protest in front of the Thai
Government House, Channel 9, the official television station said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pending their leaving, the farmers issued a statement, accusing
the government of releasing riot dogs to bite the protesting
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the protest in front of the Government House
went rough as some 30 people including policemen were bitten by
agitated riot dogs.
</P>
<P>
The farmers were also dissatisfied with the government's
refusal of a guaranteed tapioca price of 1.2 baht (3.08 cents) per
kilogram as they demanded.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi had insisted that the government will not subsidize
the tapioca price at 1.2 baht.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the government promised to intervene if the tapioca
price drops below 0.85 baht (2.18 cents) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that subsidy is not an appropriate solution to
the depreciation of farm product prices.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the Commerce Ministry needs to encourage
the restructuring of the tapioca farming and increase quality of
tapioca grown by Thai planters, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the tapioca farmers staging protests in front of the
Government House moved their vigil to the headquarters of the
Chart Pattana Party, the second largest member of the ruling
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The departure of the farmers, most of whom were from the
northeastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima, on Monday is believed
to be the result of the persuasion by Chart Pattana leader Korn
Dabarransi, who is a member of Parliament from that province.
</P>
<P>
Chart Pattana Party is said to have put pressure on the core
party of the coalition, the Democrat Party, pending a likely early
general election.
</P>
<P>
Domestic tapioca prices have dropped to 0.5 baht (1.28 cents)
per kilogram. The government has offered to guarantee the price at
0.85 baht (2.18 cents) per kilogram while the farmers have
demanded a guaranteed price of 1.2 baht.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem, the government has agreed to increase
the stock of tapioca pellet by 1.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry and the Bank of Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives agreed to increase a special loan
portfolio of 3.2 billion baht (82 million dollars) for tapioca
farmers in order to give 1,400 baht (35.9 dollars) per rai (0.16
hectare) of plantation.
</P>
<P>
The financial scheme is designed to delay the harvest by three
months in order to boost prices.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A three-year survey shows
that there are 13,160 square kilometers of swamps in Jilin
Province.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Jilin Forestry Department and
Northeast Normal University under the auspices of the State
Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Lufeng, deputy directory of the Jilin Forestry Department
said the survey was the first comprehensive report on swamps in
Jilin providing detailed and accurate data for the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Zhigang, there are five major kinds of swamps
in the province: river swamps, fenny swamps, man-made swamps, lake
swamps and inshore swamps. The swamps are home to over 500
varieties of plants, over 300 kinds of vertebrates and several
hundred species of birds, including the red-crowned crane and
white stork.
</P>
<P>
Findings from the survey show that swamps need to be reduced
because of water pollution and the accumulation of mud.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Experiences 0.06 Pct Inflation in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia experienced 0.06
percent inflation in October, the first inflation since March this
year, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS).
</P>
<P>
"For seven consecutive months the consumer price index (CPI)
showed a constant drop or deflation but it moved up again in
October," BPS Chief Sugito Suwito was quoted by the national
newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Higher gold jewelry prices and transportation costs were the
major contributors to the inflation.
</P>
<P>
"If gold jewelry is taken out from the CPI basket, last month
still saw a deflation of 0.04 percent," Suwito said, pointing out
that food prices continued to decline.
</P>
<P>
Last month's inflation brought the national inflation rate in
the period January-October 1999 to 0.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
Suwito forecasts that inflation for the whole calendar year
would be less than 2.5 percent if nothing extreme occurred in
December, during which the Christmas celebration and the Muslim
fasting month will coincidentally take place.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia expects inflation this year to be about 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia suffered hyperinflation of more than 77 percent last
year when the economic crisis deepened and the rupiah fell to as
low as 17,000 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was traded at 6,750 per U.S. dollar on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The economy has posted steady deflation since March, which
economists said mostly reflects the people's eroded purchasing
power during the economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Edible Oil Import Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Imports of edible oil returned
to normal at the port of Shanghai, China's largest metropolis, due
to a crackdown on smuggling of the product.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics provided by Shanghai Customs, from
January to September, Shanghai imported 761,300 tons of edible oil
seeds, 5.8 times more than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The import of edible vegetable oil reached 124,500 tons, up 180
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Oil Company produced 48,100 tons of edible oil in
the first half of 1999, up 90 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the smuggling of cheap edible oil, the oil
Company was forced to stop production for two months in 1998 and
suffered from stockpiled products worth 150 million yuan (18.14
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Customs uncovered a series of smuggling cases on
edible palm and bean oil and has tightened control of oil imports
and processing trade. The imports of oil seeds are expected to
keep growing till the first quarter of next year because of the
sustained growth of the domestic economy and consumer demand.

<HEADLINE> China's Expressways Exceed 10,000 km </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- With the Jinan-Tai'an Expressway
recently opened to traffic, the total length of China's
expressways now exceeds 10,000 km, ranking fourth in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Jinan-Tai'an expressway connects Jinan, capital of east
China's Shandong Province, with the city of Tai'an, where the
famous Taishan Mountain is located. The expressway is part of the
Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Fuzhou State highways.
</P>
<P>
Li Juchang, vice minister of Communications, who attended an
opening ceremony for the expressway, told Xinhua that road
construction is a comprehensive project and an important
indication of a country's economy. There is an old saying in
China: Roads are built in prosperous times, Li said.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice minister, although China began building
expressways a half century later than some developed countries,
its speed of construction has been the fastest. In 1988, the
Shanghai-Jiading Expressway, the first in China, was open to
traffic. During the first three years of the country's ninth five-
year plan, about 1,300 km of expressways were completed each year.
It took China about ten years, starting from zero, to gain its
present position.
</P>
<P>
Li said that most of the expressways have been built along the
major state highways and so far cover 28 provinces. The
expressways have basically formed a nationwide network and become
a main artery for passenger and freight transportation.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of expressways meets the requirements of
the country's economy, said the vice minister, and the road-based
economic belts have come into being along the expressways,
providing an impetus to local industries, agriculture, trade, and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The expressways also provide people with convenient and
comfortable travel during holidays, Li added.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan Presidential Runner Promises Priority to Mercosur Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's presidential front-
runner Tabare Vazquez promised Monday to give priority to Uruguay'
s integration with the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
For Uruguay, an accord of productive complementation with
Mercosur would be very important, said Vazquez, of the leftist
Broad Front, in his first press conference after obtaining a
preliminary victory in Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old doctor and former Montevideo mayor gained 38.5
percent of the votes, facing 31.3 percent by candidate from the
ruling Colorado Party and 21.3 percent by the National Party.
</P>
<P>
As no candidate obtained an overwhelming majority, Vazquez must
compete in a second round elections with the ruling Colorado Party
's candidate Jorge Batlle on November 28.
</P>
<P>
The primary triumph of the Broad Front has modified the
political map in Uruguay, which has been governed by turns by the
traditional Colorado and National Parties since 1828.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay,
and with Chile and Bolivia as associate members, is Uruguay's most
important trading partner, absorbing almost half of its exports.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay enjoys one of the most stable economies in Latin
America, with unemployment rate hovering at just over 10 percent.
The cattle-and-wool producing nation's 3.2 million people live
relatively well by Latin American standards.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Trade Records Surplus in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia recorded a surplus of
about 17.42 billion U.S. dollars in its foreign trade from January
to September, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS).
4@"
</P>
<P>
Exports in September declined by 2.34 percent to 4.49 billion
dollars, from 4.60 billion dollars in August. Exports in January
to September were recorded at 35.01 billion dollars, or down 6
percent compared to the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
BPS said that non-oil and gas exports were down 0.15 percent to
3.58 billion dollars in September and declined by 9.11 percent in
the first nine months, compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports in September slightly increased to 2.02 billion dollars
from the level in August.
</P>
<P>
"But this rise is rather negligible. This also means that
exports over the next two to three months will remain low, given
the heavy reliance of industrial exports on imported raw
materials," BPS Chief Sugito Suwito was quoted by national
newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Imports for the January to September period were valued at
17.59 billion dollars, or a 12.76 percent decline from the level
in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer good imports between January and August were recorded
at 1.57 billion dollars, or a 29.31 percent increase compared to
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"This means that our industry has not yet recovered," Suwito
said.
</P>
<P>
BPS said that imports of raw materials in the January to August
period declined by 4.24 percent, while imports of capital goods
dropped by 53.70 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates a depressed condition in the manufacturing
sector," Suwito added.

<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Qingdao Red Star Chemical
Group, one of China's major chemical conglomerates in eastern
Shandong Province, has so far set up six chemical enterprises in
the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
The move has generated new economic growth in many poverty-
stricken areas, while expanding the market of the group's products,
said general manager Jiang Zhiguang at a seminar here.
</P>
<P>
Developing the central and western regions is a top priority of
the Chinese government, which has adopted a series of incentives
to spur investment in those regions.
</P>
<P>
More and more enterprises, making full use of advanced
technologies and qualified technicians, are turning to the central
and western regions for expansion and market share.
</P>
<P>
The six enterprises are in the provinces of Shaanxi, Guizhou
and Hubei, and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, the group has more than 400 million yuan in
total assets and earns 520 million yuan in annual sale revenues
and 27 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The group has joined hands with the Germany-based Bayer Company
and founded Rhein (Qingdao) Chemical Company in November 1995 with
a total investment of over 20 million U.S. dollars producing high-
grade rubber.

<HEADLINE> Research Highlights Permission E-Mail Marketing Promising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Permission E-mail marketing
is five times more cost-effective than direct mail and 20 times
more than Web banners, a leading U.S. sales and marketing research
firm reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Further, U.S. leading marketers that ask for and receive
permission to E-mail their customers are finding that their
messages are not only welcome, but are greeted with response rates
that far exceed other targeted marketing vehicles such as Web
advertising and direct mail, according to a survey by IMT
Strategies, Inc.
</P>
<P>
The findings are based on a random phone survey of over 400
adult consumer and business E-mail users in the United States, and
phone and Web surveys of more than 200 leading E-marketers
</P>
<P>
The study also found that customers clearly distinguish
permission E-mail and unsolicited commercial E-mail (UCE), also
known as "spam." But marketers have a hard time telling the
difference between the two. So, IMT Strategies' report warned,
well-meaning but inexperienced marketers may acquire addresses
through questionable means only to have their promotions equated
in customers' mind with pornography, pyramid schemes and con
artists.
</P>
<P>
More than half of all E-mail users feel positively about
permission E-mail marketing, and nearly three quarters of users
respond to permission E-mail with some frequency, the study added.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the findings show that UCE can hurt the brand
image of companies who use it as 64 percent of customers had "very
negative" reactions to receiving spam.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of pennies per message sent, the report said,
permission E-mail offers marketers the chance to improve their
marketing economy without the stigmatizing brand impact of spam.
</P>
<P>
According to a cross-section of leading Fortune 500 and E-
commerce marketers, the cost-effectiveness of permission E-mail
makes it their number one priority in the next 12 months for
driving E-business
</P>
<P>
IMT Strategies predicted this will cause a "race for permission
" over the next two years. American companies will spend at least
1 billion U.S. dollars on permission E-mail marketing by 2001. A
critical portion of this will be spent on building and maintaining
permission lists, i.e., databases of customers and prospects who
have consented to an E-mail relationship with a particular company.
</P>
<P>
Leading companies already have lists that exceed 300,000 names,
and are doubling in size each year. IMT Strategies projected that
these organizations will invest an annual minimum of five dollars
per name to acquire new customer permission relationships and
enhance the data quality of existing relationships.

<HEADLINE> NBA Broadcast Package to Feature New Faces, New Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Allen Iverson and Jason
Williams are part of the NBA's new breed and NBC and Turner
Network Sports are counting on them to bring back old ratings.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the ratings dropoff, the networks have chosen to
highlight both Iverson and Williams during this season's slate of
games. Iverson's Philadelphia 76ers will be featured the maximum
11 times on NBC while Williams' Sacramento Kings will be shown on
nine occasions.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Iverson and Williams have something else in common -
- they both have been linked to marijuana use. But Michael Jordan
's retirement has forced the networks to cultivate new stars and
the two are thought to be good candidates as anyone.
</P>
<P>
Both led their teams to playoff appearances after long drought.
The Sixers upset the Orlando Magic in the first round before
losing to the Indiana Pacers. The Kings nearly stunned the Utah
Jazz in a first-round series that was the most thrilling set of
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
Iverson and the 76ers were not even on the NBC schedule last
season until a game against Orlando was added in late April.
</P>
<P>
"Last season was so wide open that there were chances for many
young, exciting teams to step into the spotlight," NBC Sports
chairman Dick Ebersol said. "Interest in the 76ers and Allen
Iverson grew as the year went on. We feel that the momentum and
following they carried into the playoffs will continue to increase
this year."
</P>
<P>
The Kings were not part of last season's cable package but
folks at Turner added two games after getting a look at Williams,
whose lightning-quick pinpoint passes from all angles have made
him a media darling and staple of NBA highlights package.
</P>
<P>
It is a dramatic step into the national spotlight for the Kings,
who have not been on NBC since the network acquired the rights to
the NBA beginning with the 1990-91 season.
</P>
<P>
Joining Iverson and Williams in the television spotlight will
be San Antonio Spurs superstar forward Tim Duncan, Los Angeles
Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal and the New York Knicks, who lost
to the Spurs in last season's Finals and represent the nation's
largest TV market. The Spurs, Lakers and Knicks all will appear
on NBC the maximum 11 times.
</P>
<P>
The first televised game this season features Duncan and the
Spurs beginning defense of their championship against Iverson and
the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
It is the first half of TNT's opening night doubleheader, which
is capped by a matchup of O'Neal's Lakers and the Utah Jazz -- a
team conspicuous by its absence among the TV leaders.
</P>
<P>
Seven teams have no national TV appearances -- the Los Angeles
Clippers, Vancouver, Golden State, Dallas, Cleveland, Washington
and Milwaukee, which made the playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
TNT will air 53 games on Tuesday and Fridays. It also will
have coverage of All-Star Saturday on February 12. Sister station
TBS will air 27 games on Monday and Wednesdays, giving Turner 80
regular season games.
</P>
<P>
As usual, NBC's coverage of the NBA begins on Christmas with a
doubleheader. The Indiana Pacers host the Knicks, followed by the
Spurs and Lakers. Both games are in new buildings opening this
season.
</P>
<P>
NBC will air 33 games on Saturdays and Sundays, plus the 2000
NBA All-Star Game from Oakland, California on February 13.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Unemployment Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- As many as 474,000 Venezuelans
lost their job in the first nine months this year in a wave of
company closures, polling firm Datanalisis said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This increased the country's jobless number to 1.694 million,
some 20 percent of the total labor force of 9.907 million, said
Datanalisis chief Luis Vicente Leon.
</P>
<P>
Leon attributed the bleak employment situation partly to a lack
of private investment, expectation of changes in labor legislation
by the Constituent National Assembly and a falling consumer demand
caused by recession.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Labor Minister Lino Martinez has admitted that the
high jobless rate of 20 percent is like a time bomb threatening
social stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the business sector proposed a pay system on an hourly
basis, similar to that in the United States, in a bid to improve
productivity, which was nevertheless rejected by the government.

LONDON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool fought back to score a
3-1 victory Monday night against Bradford, lifting them from
fourth place to sixth in the Premier League.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 1-0 after a 12th minute strike by Dean Windass, the
Reds bounced for their third home win on a trot through Titi
Camara, a Jamie Redknapp penalty and a late clincher from
substitute Vegard Heggem.
</P>
<P>
The victory sends Liverpool past Everton, Chelsea, Tottenham
and Middlesborough to the top six with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool, who garnered 11 points from last five games, had to
fight without star England strikers Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler
who had been sidelined for injuries.
</P>
<P>
Bradford, promoted to the Premier League this season, remains
mired in the relegation zone, second from bottom of the table with
11 points.

<P>
CARACAS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Venezulan President Hugo Chavez
Monday proposed the integration of the armed forces of Latin
America and the Caribbean to form an alliance with duties similar
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"Why can't we have the Caribbean and South Atlantic Treaty
Organization, if NATO exists?" President Chavez asked during the
20th anniversary of the Andean Parliament celebration.
</P>
<P>
The presidents and vice presidentas of the congresses of
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, present in this
capital, applauded the proposal of Chavez.
</P>
<P>
The leader called on those present to retake the ideals of
liberator Simon Bolivar in order to achieve the social, cultural,
economic, military and political integration of Latin American
peoples.
</P>
<P>
He also asked for the reformulation of the idea of Latin
American integration because what has been used up till now is
insufficient and needs to be reformed for the future.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Andean Parliament President Heinz Moeller
said this organism is 20 years old and two of its objectives are
to elect its members in a direct way and give impulse to the
region's political integration.

<HEADLINE> Arafat-Barak Meeting Drags On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
entered into a previously unscheduled meeting Monday night.
</P>
<P>
It is seen here as an effort to try to sound each other out
before a three-way summit Tuesday with U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has been going on for one hour and a half, but
still there is no end in sight yet.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a long-table one, with the Israeli and
Palestinian delegations on each side. Only Israeli and Palestinian
reporters were allowed in during the photo opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have many topics, said a Palestinian reporter,
who requested anonymity. The problem is who decides what to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has met with Arafat and Barak separately during the
day, and Leah Rabin, widow of the late Israeli prime minister,
made an emotional appeal for them to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I turn to you, Chairman Arafat, and to you, Prime Minister
Barak, it is now your commitment to now find the right formula to
finish what my husband started and had to pay the highest price
for his life," Leah said at the royal banquet hosted by the
Norwegian king.
</P>
<P>
They will be attending a ceremony to commemorate Rabin, who was
shot and killed by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace
policies with the Palestinians four years ago.
</P>
<P>
No major breakthrough is expected at the summit, but the
Palestinians hoped it will "at least stop the settlement
activities" in the West Bank to create an appropriate atmosphere
for the final status talks, to be kicked off on November 7.
</P>
<P>
It will be an uphill task ahead for Israel and the Palestinians
to resolve the thorny issues including Jerusalem, border, refugees
and water-sharing, by September 2000, according to Barak's
timetable.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, however, have been cautious and warned against a
rush to agreement in order to meet a deadline.

Brazil is a member of the Cairns Group, including Australia,

MAPUTO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said that his ruling Frelimo party could get a two-thirds
majority in the forth-coming parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Chissano was speaking on Sunday after a rally attended by about
10,000 people in Liching, capital of the northernmost province of
Niassa.
</P>
<P>
In the previous ten days of campaigning starting on October 19,
Chissano had travelled across four provinces - Zambezia, Nampula,
Cabo Delgado and Niassa - addressing 29 rallies.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that besides the promotion of rallies, his party
is doing door-to-door and person-to-person canvassing across the
country, explaining Frelimo's programme for the 2000-2004 period.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on violence between supporters of Frelimo and the
opposition Renamo party, in Nampula, where three people were
injured, one of them seriously, Chissano urged people not to
respond to provocation, and to avoid any attitude that may lead to
increased tension.
</P>
<P>
He urged the relevant authorities to cooperate and ensure
peace and tranquility during the electoral process.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Poor Performance in Job Creation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Italy is still the black sheep
among western industrialized nations when it comes to creating
jobs, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD), Italy showed the poorest record between
1980 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Not only did it not create jobs, but lost jobs at an average
rate of 0.18 percent a year, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Italy has an unemployment rate of 12 percent compared to the
European Union (EU) average of 11.5 percent and the United States
average of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Italy came 19th in the rankings drawn up by the IMF, with
Finland and Sweden below it - but both those countries have much
better jobless rates than Italy, among the lowest in the EU and
the OECD.
</P>
<P>
But Italy also comes out badly when compared with EU members
traditionally seen as more backward economically, such as
Portugal, Spain and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Australia led the IMF standings with a gain of 1.72 percent in
jobs from 1980 to 1997, followed by the U.S. with 1.58 percent,
Canada 1.37 percent and Holland 1.26 percent, the highest of the
European countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
front-runner George W. Bush sustained minor injuries to his right
leg and hip Monday when a truck trailer overturned near his
jogging path.
</P>
<P>
Bush, Texas governor, was treated at the scene and later went
to New Hampshire State for a scheduled campaign trip, said Linda
Edwards, Bush's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
Edwards said Bush was injured when he dived to get out of the
way as the truck overturned. "Governor Bush is in good condition
and good spirits," she said.
</P>
<P>
One of Bush's security agents accompanying Bush was hit with
debris from the truck. He was in fair condition at a local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said there was no reason to
suspect that the driver intended to hit the governor.
</P>
<P>
Austin police said the accident remained under investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street Stocks ended mixed
Monday with the Dow Jones industrial average falling and the
technology heavy Nasdaq rising.
</P>
<P>
At the closing session, the Dow fell 81.35 at 10,648.51,
erasing some of the gain of 427.73 points in the three previous
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 8.81 at 1,354.12 and the Nasdaq rose 1.22 at 2,967.65,
surpassing the record closing high of 2,966.52 points set in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell as investors guessed whether the Federal Reserve
will raise interest rates for the third time this year to cool off
the U.S. economy after the National Association of Purchasing
Management reported that manufacturing growth slowed in October
but prices for raw materials reached a four-year high.
</P>
<P>
The fall in stock prices was also attributed to profit-taking.
Investors sold stocks to lock in profits after the strong rally on
the market in the past two sessions.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index was pushed higher by companies including
software maker Oracle and computer maker Dell.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 3.75 at 621.72. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 4.17 at 804.97 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 3.18 at 431.82.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues were nearly even with decliners on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 1,550 up, 1,528 down and 446 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 834.55 million shares from 1.08 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Georgian Ruling Party Leads in Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Union of Georgian
Citizens headed by President Eduard Shevardnadze won leading
majority at the last Sunday's parliamentary elections and will
become the biggest party in new parliament, announced the Central
Electoral Commission on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian media, preliminary counts show that the
Union of Georgian Citizens gained 42 percent of votes and the
opposition Georgia's Revival bloc collected 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Around 95 percent of the ballots have been counted by Monday
evening, said the Central Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
None of the other political alliances exceeded the 7 percent
election hurdle, though some 6.9 percent of voters were cast for
the Labor Party and 6.8 percent -- for a block Industry will Save
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
By the nation's law, out of all 235 future members of
parliament, 150 will be elected by party lists and 75 deputies --
on majority tickets. Abkhazia region obtained 9 seats before the
vote.
</P>
<P>
Analysts forecast that the ruling Union of Georgian Citizens
may master between 135 and 140 seats. Therefore, President Eduard
Shevardnadze would be backed by a clear parliamentary majority.

sidelines ahead of news on interest rates later in the week, but
finished slightly hihger a late boost from the Nasdaq, with the
FTSE 100 closing up 28.3 points, or 0.3 percent, at 6284.

decisions are announced.

Merger activity in the construction sector had sparked some
interest in what was otherwise an interest rate weary market. News

some interest with blue-chip names such as Marks &AMP; Spencer,
Royal/Dutch Shell and Unilever all expected to publish results.

Dealers said the market appeared unimpressed by remarks from
ECB president Wim Duisenberg that the bank's inclination towards
raising interest rates had strengthened since July.

KIA deputy manager Geofrey Mbakilwa said that new tyres had
been fixed and that the plane resumed its scheduled flights.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of the investigation by the two experts will be
presented to the ministry of communication and transport for
further action," he said.
</P>
<P>
Six of the 74 passengers on board the plane, which was flying
from Dar es Salaam to Entebe in Uganda via Kigali in Rwanda and
Bujumbura in Burundi, sustained minor injuries and were rushed to
nearby hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The shocked passengers included senior officials of the East
African Cooperation secretariat and the International Criminal
Tribunal of Rwanda based in Arusha in northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
They praised the pilots for managing to bring the plane to a
safe stop when the tyres burst just when it was about to take off
at around 1320 local time (1020GMT).
</P>
<P>
One of the injured, Ruzika Muheto, a Tanzanian environmental
official, said that a thud was heard during takeoff, sending great
anxiety among the passengers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Returns 3 Military Bases to Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. military authorities
transferred Monday to Panama the control of Howard, Kobbe and
Farfan military bases, situated on the shores of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
Panama's President Mireya Moscoso, officials of the country and
high American military men attended the reverting ceremony of the
installations, which had been in American power for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
"This significant event represents one notch more in the chain
of important happenings, that guarantee the reaffirming of our
independence and total sovereignty," said President Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
According to Moscoso, with the delivery of Howard, Kobbe and
Farfan, Panama finds itself in the semi-final phase of the total
recovery of its political sovereignty which will definitely be
complete on December 31, 1999 under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties
signed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
"These military bases represent over 2,000 hectares of land,
counting with an extraordinary range of infrastructure including,
apart from Howard airport, a great amount of constructions for
residential, commercial, sporting, cultural and leisure use, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The leader said these installations are fully adequate for the
national government's purpose to develop a modern multimodal
center of merchandise transport, covering the docking of ships
coming from all the world and discharge activities.
</P>
<P>
Howard air base was until recently a yearned-for zone for the
U.S. government, with the purpose of creating there the
Multilateral Antidrug Center (MAC), but the government of ex
president Ernesto Perez Balladares rejected American intentions.
</P>
<P>
From this base U.S. military forces have carried out
anti-insurgent operations since the 1960s in Peru and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Howard also served in recent years as a site for the fight
against drug trafficking from South America to U.S. cities.

WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- About two dozen houses,
businesses and farm buildings were destroyed by a wind-driven
prairie fire in Montana State of the United States, said reports
reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fire, started by a spark from a passing train, forced the
evacuation of some 200 people in Outlook in Montana Sunday. No
serious injuries were reported, and most of the burned buildings
had been unoccupied.
</P>
<P>
It was the most destructive of at least eight fires touched off
Sunday in eastern Montana, many of them caused by strong wind
blowing power lines onto dry prairie grass, the reports quoted
state officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in western Montana, high wind at the town of
Florence toppled trees on at least 35 houses and several cars, and
also tore roofs from several houses.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 1 (Xinhua) -- PC monitor shipments are
expected to hit nearly 100 million units in 1999 and jump to 150
million by 2003, with an annual growth rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Revenues will increase at an annual 16 percent growth rate,
multiplying from 33.4 billion U.S. dollars this year to almost 60
billion dollars by 2003, U.S. market research firm International
Data Corporation (IDC) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Both new developments in flat cathode-ray tube (CRT) technology
as well as the increasing growth of flat-panel thin film
transistor liquid crystal displays (LCD) are bringing new vim and
vigor to the worldwide PC monitor business, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Monitor revenues are increasing faster than shipments because
unlike most other PC-related categories, IDC explained, average
selling prices for monitors are rising. This development is due to
the growing interest in larger, more expensive CRT monitors and
the increasing penetration of LCD monitors into the overall market
mix.
</P>
<P>
Despite high expectations for LCD monitors, IDC said,
tube-based CRT monitors are expected to remain as the industry's
workhorse, commanding just more than 85 percent of the total
monitor market even in 2003.
</P>
<P>
However, LCDs are still having an enormous impact on the
industry, IDC said, because they are both driving forward
impressive improvements in flat CRT designs and focusing more
attention on a computer system's monitor. In fact, according to
IDC, monitors are expected to increase from 20 percent of a total
computer system's cost to nearly 37 percent between 1993 and 2003,
which has dramatic implications for both PCs and displays.
