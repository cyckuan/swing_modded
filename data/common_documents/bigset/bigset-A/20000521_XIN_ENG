in the peace process with Israel, calling for Arab solidarity on
regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The position was expressed in a memorandum signed at the end of

to regain their lands occupied by Israel in successive Middle East
wars.

Love You" virus may have originated in Israel.

Network Associates, an Israeli hi-tech start-up company,
reportedly was hit by the virus on Thursday, which is earlier than
any other reports of such virus throughout the world, according to

<HEADLINE> Britain Sees Nuclear Disarmament a Long Way to Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain Sunday warned against
expecting the new superpower nuclear arms deal to result in a
widescale destruction of weapons any time soon.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said he saw no swift moves towards
nuclear disarmament despite a commitment by nuclear powers to
scrap their atomic arsenals.
</P>
<P>
"I think realistically it is unlikely to lead to action
tomorrow, next week or next month," he told BBC's Breakfast With
Frost program.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment after Britain, China, France, Russia and
the United States made an "unequivocal" pledge to eliminate their
nuclear arsenals, but without setting any timetable.
</P>
<P>
"What we have agreed there, together with the United States, is
that in principle we would like to see the end of nuclear weapons,
" Hoon said.
</P>
<P>
"I think every sensible person around the world agrees with
that but there is no timetable and it is dependent on every other
nuclear weapon state agreeing the same and taking appropriate
action," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But it is a declaration of principle and to that extent it is
an important principle that those countries with nuclear weapons
have accepted that ultimately they would prefer not to have them,"
the defense secretary said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that nuclear weapons would be a thing of the past
during his own lifetime.
</P>
<P>
"But it is dependent on all the countries with nuclear weapons
and access to that very dangerous technology (that they should)
agree upon and take action to bring about their elimination," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Isolation of Sankoh in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain insisted Sunday that
captured rebel leader Foday Sankoh must not be allowed back into
Sierra Leone's Government.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said Sankoh was responsible for
the recent upsurge in violence in Sierra Leone and should not be
allowed to play any role in the future government of that western
African nation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the BBC's Breakfast With Frost program, Hoon said
that although British forces had helped move Sankoh after his
arrest, his fate rested with Sierra Leone's Government.
</P>
<P>
Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front
blamed for breaking a peace deal in Sierra Leone, was arrested
last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter for them to decide what should happen to him
next. But obviously we would be concerned that he should no longer
have any kind of an influence over Sierra Leone. He was the one
who broke the peace accord, he's responsible for the recent
upsurge in violence," Hoon said.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary also confirmed that Britain was
considering a request from Sierra Leone's government for
ammunition supplies and that Britain's plan was to keep its troops
in that country only until United Nations reinforcements arrive.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain had discussed a request for more ammunition
with Sierra Leone's President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and was checking
it "very carefully."
</P>
<P>
But he declined to specify exactly when British forces would
leave Sierra Leone, where hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers remain
rebel hostages.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed confidence that the U.N. force "will be
properly reinforced very quickly."
</P>
<P>
"We are not entering into the combat situation there. We have
made it clear that our forces are there for a specific purpose --
to secure and make safe the airport both for evacuation and
reinforcement by the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 700 crack British paratroopers now in Sierra
Leone, a former British colony, backing up 9,000 United Nations
peacekeepers trying to disarm rebel fighters and implement the
1999 peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Main Opposition Party Confident of 2001 Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian main opposition party leader
Francis Nkhoma Sunday said that he is confident that his United
National Independence party (UNIP) will bounce back to power in
the 2001 presidential and parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
At his first press briefing here after he was elected President
of the UNIP on May 14 at the party's congress, Nkhoma said UNIP
could not afford to remain static in a continuously changing world
and would overhaul the former ruling party's operations in
preparations for the elections.
</P>
<P>
He said: "UNIP is an institution belonging to the people and
not belonging to one person, and so it should respond to the
people's calls to change in order to make it more responsive to
the needs of the people."
</P>
<P>
Nkhoma also formally introduced his newly elected party Central
 Committee which is a blend between both old UNIP and new guards.
</P>
<P>
He said the party would improve its administration, audit its
financial records and put in place a transparent financial
management system as among changes the former ruling party would
take.
</P>
<P>
He announced that elections at the district, branch and ward
level would be held soon so as to usher in a new crop of leaders
that will effect the changes in the party.
</P>
<P>
He advised the loosing candidates to bury their hatchets and
work together with the new Central Committee to advance the
party's objectives.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Kaunda, former Zambian president, officially retired
from the leadership of the party that he had led for the past 40
years when he opened the congress on May 9.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Honors AIDS Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The 17th International AIDS
Candlelight Memorial meeting was held at the Constitutional Square
in Uganda's capital Kampala on Sunday with the theme "Break the
Silence, Honor Every Death and Value Every Life."
</P>
<P>
The gathering commemorated with a bonfire was presided over by
Vice President Wandira Kazibwe on behalf of President Yoweri
Museveni, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the gathering, Kazibwe stressed the need to develop
more diverse, effective strategies and mechanisms for combating
the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Jyoce Kikomedo, a representative of persons living with AIDS,
called on African governments to subsidize AIDS drugs, saying many
victims still cannot afford them even after the costs have been
reduced.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 20 million Ugandans, nearly two million people are
infected with AIDS/HIV while 1.8 million have died of the
pandemic, said Kihumuro Apuuli, director general of Uganda AIDS
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Uganda currently has about 1.7 million orphans whose parents
died of AIDS, Apuuli added.
</P>
<P>
The national AIDS prevalence rate was as high as over 30
percent in late 1980s and early 1990s. Up to date the rate has
dropped to 10 percent due to the government's increasing efforts
against the disease and great enhancement of people's awareness in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of a few African countries where AIDS prevalence
rate is dropping, and it aims to reduce the rate from the current
10 percent to 7.5 percent by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Regrets Bahrain's Suspension of Joint Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Qatar on Sunday regretted
Bahrain's decision to suspend the work of the Higher Qatari-
Bahraini Committee formed late last year to tackle issues including
the border dispute between the two Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the joint
committee co-chaired by crown princes of both sides was tasked with
working out a solution to the border dispute, but with possibility
of referring it to the Hague International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain are locked in a dispute over several small but
potentially oil-and-gas-rich Gulf isles, including the Hawar
islands, which are controlled by Bahrain since 1930s but also
claimed by Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has taken the issue to the International Court of Justice
for a verdict.
</P>
<P>
But Doha and Manama agreed during a visit to Bahrain by Qatar's
Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani last December to set up a
joint committee to try to settle the border dispute through cordial
means.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the case would be withdrawn if an "acceptable
solution is reached by the joint committee before the court's
verdict."
</P>
<P>
But Bahrain announced on Friday that the "work of the Higher
Committee has been suspended after Qatar referred the issue to the
Hague international court and that it did not receive any positive
response from Qatar over the recommendations made to solve the
border dispute."
</P>
<P>
Bahrain, which prefers a bilateral compromise, considered the
Qatar's reference to the court as stepping over the mediation
efforts by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
However, the Qatari statement said its demand for the court to
resolve the dispute "did not jeopardize the mediations by Saudi
Arabia and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
"Resorting to the International Court of Justice was in line
with the agreements of 1987 and 1990, which was signed by the two
countries as part of the Saudi mediation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the "major objective of the committee was not to solve
the border dispute." It really managed to realize many
achievements, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Mediator and Gulf heavyweight Saudi Arabia has expressed concern
over the new round of rift between Qatar and Bahrain and called on
both sides to "overcome differences and restore the atmosphere of
cooperation."

TEHRAN -- Iran will increase its capacity of natural gas
refining and dehydration to 344 million cubic meters per day from
its current 183 million cubic meters by the end of the third five-
year economic development plan (March 2000 -March 2005), a senior
energy official announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
To attain this goal, it is necessary to ensure the security of
natural gas supply and make infrastructural investments in upstream
and downstream sectors to maintain and increase in the share of
natural gas in the country's energy basket, according to Hamdollah
Mohammad-Nejad, deputy oil minister for gas affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said during the third five-year plan, some 1.3 million new
natural gas subscriptions will be granted. A record number of 550,
000 city families will be supplied with gas, which will raise the
total number of gas consumers to 8.5 million, he added.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's proven oil reserve stands at 93.1 billion
barrels and gas reserve at 22.37 trillion cubic meters, local daily

</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Mir Moazee was quoted as saying that
Iran's oil and gas reserves have nine percent and 15.5 percent of
the total oil and gas reserves in the world respectively.
</P>
<P>
Iran's oil and gas productions can last for 65 and 213 years
respectively with the current outputs, Moazee said, but he did not
mention the country's current oil and gas productions.

<P>
The number of economically-active persons will go up from 98
million to 123 million in 2010, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Among the major challenges facing the Arab countries is to
create a regional labor market, he added.
</P>
<P>
The period from 1975 to 1990 witnessed an unprecedented movement
of labor force among the Arab countries some of which suffer from
lack of capital and others lack of labor force. The labor force
movement had important economic, social and cultural impacts on the
Arab region, Quider pointed out.

<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni government started a new strategy for the
development of the fishing sector in cooperation with the European
Union and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The strategy is aimed at assessing the current situation and
implementing effective policies with a view to rehabilitating the
fishermen and achieving sustainable development of piscine
resources, an official of the Yemeni Ministry of Fisheries told the
Arabic daily Al-Hayat, Sunday's issue.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to raise the piscine production from 127,
600 tons in 1998, valued at 25 billion riyals (a U.S. dollars
equals 161 riyals), to 320,000 tons, valued at 200 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The number of fishing towns and communities in Yemen amounts to
90 towns along the Red Sea and Arabian Sea coasts, according to the
strategy.
</P>
<P>
The aquatic studies show that Yemen has 350 types of fish and
aquatic animals of which 50 to 60 types are being exploited,
Minister of Fisheries Ahmed Mosa'ed Hussein said. The surface fish
account for 70 percent of the piscine resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
Local fishermen produce 79 percent of the piscine production
while foreign companies account for the remaining percentage.

<HEADLINE> mee052130hke --Iran's GC Urges Punishment of Those Responsible for Rigging in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Guardians Council
(GC) on Sunday called on the judiciary to punish those responsible
for irregularities in the sixth Majlis (parliament) election in
Tehran constituency, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Judiciary Chief Mahmoud Hashemi Shahrudi, the
council required prosecution of persons with the Interior
Ministry's Elections Headquarters who were responsible for flaws in
the ballot counting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the GC Ahmad Jannati said votes in 1,364 of the 3,
077 ballot boxes were counted in three phases and unprecedented
grave problems and irregularities were found.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the three-month long delay of the confirmation of the
election result in Tehran on those in the Interior Ministry who are
responsible for the irregularities.
</P>
<P>
As the top supervisor of the election in February, the GC
confirmed 28 out of 30 seats in the capital under the order of
supreme leader Seyyed Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Of the 28 seats, reformist allies of President Mohammed Khatami
won 26. The other two were awarded to the conservatives, including
one for influential former president Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose
ranking in the winners list were hoisted to the 20th from the
previous 30th.
</P>
<P>
The other two seats in the capital will be decided in a re-
competition among four candidates at a later time.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation of the election result in Tehran removed the
last obstacle for the formal inauguration of the 290-seat new
parliament on May 27. The GC had confirmed 185 seats in other
constituencies. Reformers won more than 70 percent of the confirmed
seats.
</P>
<P>
Since the reformers won a landslide victory in February,
relations have been tense between the GC and the Interior Ministry,
organizer of the election.
</P>
<P>
The GC annulled the election results in a number of
constituencies, even awarding some of the seats won by reformers to
the conservative hands. The action sparked public protests and
annoyed the Interior Ministry, who claimed that the election was
held fairly.
</P>
<P>
The GC also delayed the confirmation of the election result in
Tehran on excuses of vote rigging. It blamed the Elections
Headquarters of the Interior Ministry for the bulk of flaws and
called for probing into those irregularities, as well as
prosecution of the accused and issuance of proper and fair
verdicts.
</P>
<P>
In another report on Sunday, the IRNA said all cases of
irregularities in the voting in Tehran constituency will be
investigated by branch 16 of Tehran's public court.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the court has begun preliminary and
legal proceedings in the case and the results will be announced
later.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Turkey's Arrests of Iranians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry Sunday
strongly condemned the arrests of some Iranian nationals by Turkish
police.
</P>
<P>
By their doing so, the Turkish officials had outraged the most
basic norms of international law, spokesman of the Iranian Foreign
Ministry Hamidreza Assefi was quoted by the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted the Turkish government should be solely responsible for
the consequences of that behavior which he described as "dubious
and inhuman."
</P>
<P>
Iran can not afford to condone that kind of behavior, and it
will adopt every proper measure to protect the rights, the dignity
and the prestige of Iranian nationals in Turkey, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the official did not mention when and on what charges
the Iranians were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Tension has gripped the ties between the two neighbors. Iranian
Foreign Ministry recently summoned the Turkish ambassador Turan
Moraly to listen to Iran's "strong dissatisfaction over the
expanded anti-Iran propaganda" by the Turkish mass media, IRNA said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source at the ministry told the agency that the
Turkish envoy was also warned against the accusations leveled
against Iranian diplomats in Turkey for the alleged involvement in
the assassination of Turkish writers.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Iranian Foreign Ministry asked Ankara not
to attribute its domestic problems to others and avoid the policy
of accusing other countries in an attempt to suppress its domestic
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Turkish police had arrested nine Islamic
activists recently, and some Turkish press accused Iran of being
involved in the killing of two Turkish journalists in 1993 and
1999.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Asefi also
refuted the recent accusation by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit that Iran had given shelter to Turkish separatist activists.

The 10-meter section of the 5-meter-high bridge, which connects

<HEADLINE> Denmark Wins Palme d'Or at Cannes Festival With Iceland Actress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Denmark came out triumphant Sunday
evening at the 53rd Cannes International Film Festival with its
film "Dancer in the Dark" winning the Palme d'Or, the second most
prestigious film prize after the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old conductor of the film, Lars Von Trier, fought
his way to the top prize after he presented in Cannes in 1984 his
first "Element of Crime" which won the grand prize of techniques
that year.
</P>
<P>
Known as one of the most expensive films ever made by
Scandinavian countries, "Dancer in the Dark" cost 106 million
francs (14 million U.S. dollars) and was co-produced with France 3
television channel.
</P>
<P>
Entirely made in video and impressing audience with its
lyricism and sentimentality, the film was about the tragic story
of a young Czech worker named Selma who immigrated to the United
States in the 1960s and became blind.
</P>
<P>
Its heroin is played by the Icelandic singer Gudmundsdottir
Bjork, who perfectly relives the tragic life of Selma with her own
volcanic personality in an atmosphere of fire.
</P>
<P>
The mother of a 14-year-old son, Bjork was born on November 21,
1965, in Reykjavik in a hippie community. She began her career as
actress and singer when she was eight and made her first album of
songs in 1977.
</P>
<P>
She joined in 1987 the first internationally known pop song
group of Iceland, the Sugarcubes, after spending some years with
the femine punk group Spit and Shot, and has made several albums
since.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President, Jordanian King Discusses Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and
visiting Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein held talks here Sunday
on the Middle East peace process particularly on the Syrian-Israeli
track, stalled since January 10.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Assad and Abdullah covered the latest
development of, and the ongoing contacts on, the peace process as
well as the situation in the Arab arena and bilateral ties, said
Syrian Presidential spokesman Gobran Quriah.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day the two sides held an expanded meeting
attended by the delegations of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh and his Jordanian
counterpart Abdel Ilah al-Khatib also held a meeting at the
People's Palace here on the peace process and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian sources said the talks also covered the issues related
to the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, scheduled for July 7.
</P>
<P>
Jordan played an important role in the resumption of the Syrian-
Israeli peace talks last December but the talks met a snag after
two rounds .
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch arrived here Sunday morning for a short
visit to Syria, which came two weeks ahead of his visit to
Washington where he will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The monarch was just back home on Friday after a week-long visit
to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as part of his tight
diplomatic schedule to rally support for his cash-strapped kingdom
and for talks over developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, as the second Arab state after Egypt that has signed
a peace treaty with Israel, has been playing an active role in
mediating in the Arab-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Asked to Mediate in Eritrean-Ethiopian Border Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea on Sunday called on Egypt to
play a role in solving the Eritrean-Ethiopian border disputes,
which triggered a new round of fierce fightings on May 12, causing
heavy casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean President Issayas Aferwerki made the call in his
message
to his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak, which was delivered by
Eritrean Ambassador in Cairo Mohamed Omar Mahmoud.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Mubarak, Mahmoud said the
message dealt with what he described as "Ethiopia's renewed
invasion of Eritrea" and displacement of thousands of Eritreans.
</P>
<P>
"In his message, President Aferwerki called on Egypt to play a
role in those critical circumstances and to condemn the invasion by
Ethiopia," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea also urged Egypt to offer humanitarian aid to the
Eritreans currently stranded in their villages and towns, he added.
</P>
<P>
The latest report from Eritrea said that the Ethipian forces
have advanced to the areas about 100 kilometers away from Asmara,
the Eritrean capital, and the United States has begun to evacuate
its diplomatic stuff.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Eritrea was seeking Egyptian mediation between it and
Ethiopia, the ambassador said that Egypt has played a key part in
tackling a number of regional problems, especially those in the
horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the initiative launched by the Organization of
African Unity with the help of Egypt, which was aimed at solving
the Eritrean-Ethiopian border conflict peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Through its good relations with the other African countries,
Egypt could activate this initiative and do its utmost to help
implement it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has accepted the initiative and expressed readiness to
carry it out, the Eritrean ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
On the evaluation of the present military situation along the
battle front, Mahmoud said "the Ethiopians have captured some areas
in his country but this did not mean the end of the battle."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador added that since the beginning of the border
clashes two years ago, Asmara was seeking direct talks and meetings
with Addis Ababa to solve the problem through peaceful means,
because it could not be settled through the use of force.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his country's readiness to negotiate and seek a
peaceful solution to the territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
Border disputes led to armed clashes in May 1998 between Eritrea
and Ethiopia, which went into a new round of fightings on May 12
after the failure of their talks in Algiers, Algeria and the
shuttle diplomacy of a United Nations mission.

<HEADLINE> Barak Recalls Negotiating Team in Stockholm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
Sunday called his negotiation team in Stockholm for talks with the
Palestinians to return home in light of the surge of violence in
the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minster Shlomo Ben-Ami, head of the
Israeli negotiation team, will return to Jerusalem on Monday
morning, a statement issued by Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
The statement ascribed the urgent recalling to the increasing
violence between Palestinian protesters demanding further release
of Palestinian security prisoners and Israeli soldiers in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators should cease the talks and return home because
of "the situation in the (Palestinian self-rule) territories" and
because of the need of consultations "regarding the future of the
talks", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Stockholm back-channel talks, which were active for some
time but only made public on May 13, had been regarded by the two
sides as the most promising opportunity for reaching a framework
agreement for final-status issues between them.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators just returned to Stockholm on Thursday for a
further round to discuss thorny issues, such as the status of
Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian refugees, the future of Jewish
settlements, border, security and water.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts believe the ceasing of Stockholm talks is
intended by Barak to pressure Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
quell the street violence and ensure there will be no renewed
outbreak of bloody clashes.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, which broke out on May 12, have left at least eight
Palestinians dead, and 1,000 others injured. Meanwhile, several
Israeli soldier and civilians were also wounded in the violence.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident happened early Sunday morning, in which an
Israeli car travelling in the autonomous town of Jericho was
attacked by "Molotov Cocktail" firebombs and a two-year-old Israeli
girl in the car was burned over her entire body.
</P>
<P>
In response, Barak told his ministers in the weekly cabinet
meeting Sunday morning that Israel will not accept the continuation
of this situation, especially "the use of live fire against IDF
(Israel Defense Forces) soldiers by Palestinian policemen."
</P>
<P>
The government is waiting for Palestinians' response to its "
sharp messages" that the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
should take steps to end such incidents and prevent them from
recurring, Barak added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that until the incidents cease and the PNA proves
that it is in full control of its people, there will no change in
the status of Abu Dis, Azariya and Swahara, the Arab towns near
Jerusalem whose transfer was approved by the Israeli cabinet and
Knesset (Parliament) last Monday as a good-will gesture.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister emphasized the seriousness with which he
views Sunday morning's incident in Jericho, and outlined the
actions taken in response - the placing of roadblocks to close off
areas under Palestinian full control.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Barak already announced that he decided to postpone
his trip to Washington to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton due
to the situation in the West Bank and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak later said he will shortly decide when he will make the
trip, during which he will try to reach understandings with the
Americans prior to entering into the decisive negotiations on the
framework agreement with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Current Oil Prices Fair: Kuwaiti Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud
Nasser Al-Sabah said here Sunday that current oil prices in the
world market are fair.
</P>
<P>
On recent oil prices rise despite major oil producers' raising
of their output on April 1, Sheikh Saud said "there is a balance in
the market with regards to supply and demand."
</P>
<P>
He said the balance has been maintained as the low world crude
stockpiles were not really affected by the production increase by
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is an OPEC member with a crude reserve of about 100
billion barrels. It enjoys an OPEC output quota of 1.98 million
barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
OPEC decided at a March meeting in Vienna to raise its
production by 1.7 million bpd to ease the runaway prices from a
nine-year high of above 30 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The oil cartel also agreed to a mechanism by which it will
automatically adjust supply by 500,000 bpd if the average price for
OPEC basket of crude exceeds 22-28 dollars a barrel for 20 days.
</P>
<P>
The Brent crude ended the day in London on Saturday at 28.65
dollars per barrel for July and August deliveries, while the West
Texas average closed at 30 dollars in New York.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Voters Approve Bilateral Accords with European Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A majority of the Swiss voters voted
in favor of a series of accords leading to closer integration with
the European Union (EU) in a referendum Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 67.2 percent of voters backed the accords, according
to Swiss Radio International. The Swiss government and the EU have
welcomed the result.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss described the outcome as an
important step into the 21st century. He said full membership of
the EU remained a long-term government goal. But he said Sunday's
voter approval of the bilateral accords did not amount to a
mandate for further European integration.
</P>
<P>
The EU has also welcomed the result. European Commission
President Romano Prodi said he was pleased the accords had been
approved by such a large majority.
</P>
<P>
"The agreements shall bring about a considerable strengthening
of our relations, but in no way prejudge any steps towards further
integration," said Prodi.
</P>
<P>
The seven accords are designed to increase Swiss access to EU
markets and open up Swiss markets, covering transport, trade,
aviation, research, agriculture, free movement of people and
public procurement.
</P>
<P>
The accords, signed in 1999 after five years of painstaking
negotiations, have already been approved by the Swiss parliament.
They were last month ratified by the European Parliament in a
clear signal to the Swiss people and the 15 EU member states whose
parliaments also have to approve the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The accords are scheduled to take effect from next January
provided they are also approved by the parliaments of all EU
member states.

<HEADLINE> French Interior Minister Violently Attacks Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement violently attacked Germany Sunday, accusing it of "not
being cured of the derailment which was Nazism."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the proposal made by German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer on building a European federation as a
way to make the future European Union a politically strong entity.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the presence of a tendency in Germany to imaging for
Europe a federal structure which corresponds to its own model. In
depth, it (Germany) always dreams of the Roman-Germanic Holy
Empire," said Chevenement in an interview with France 2 television
channel.
</P>
<P>
The German proposal, made on May 12 by Fischer and tacitly
supported by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, includes a
European federal constitution, a directly elected European
executive government, and a two-chamber parliament based on the
model of the German parliament.
</P>
<P>
"It (Germany) is not yet cured of the derailment which was
Nazism in its history. It has a conception of nation which is that
of the Folk (people), which is an ethnic conception," said
Chevenement.
</P>
<P>
The remarks by the interior minister were immediately condemned
by former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who described
them as "unbearable."
</P>
<P>
The attack by Chevenement, who is the leader of the

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government not to Go Back on Land Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Vice-President Joseph
Msika Sunday said the government was not going back on the land
issue and would strive to see the black Zimbabweans get the land
that they fought for.
</P>
<P>
Msika made the remarks when launching a ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) campaign rally in
Makokoba constituency in Bulawayo, the second largest city in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was committed to resolving the colonial
land imbalances which Zimbabweans fought for during the liberation
struggle.
</P>
<P>
"I have personally committed myself into finishing this
resolution of land that we fought for and I will strive just to
do that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Msika said the government will soon acquire 841 farms for
resettlement and called on women to register for land allocation.
</P>
<P>
He castigated the white community in the country whom he said
did not accept the hand of reconciliation as evidenced by their
campaign for the " No" vote during the referendum held in February
to decide on a new constitution for Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"They de-campaigned that constitution because they were not
happy about the clause which would have enabled us to take their
farms and distribute to the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Msika said following Parliament's amendment of the
constitution, the government now had the power to compulsorily
acquire farms without paying compensation for the land.
</P>
<P>
He denounced the allocation of land to people by war veterans,
saying only the government had the authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
"Land should be allocated by the government and not war
veterans or those people who are now invading communities and
farms in the name of war veterans when in actual fact they are
not," he said.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Sunday Sunday
called his negotiation team in Stockholm for talks with the
Palestinians to return home in light of the surge of violence in
the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minster Shlomo Ben-Ami, head of the
Israeli negotiation team will return to Jerusalem on Monday
morning, a statement issued by Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
The statement ascribed the urgent recalling to the increasing
violence between Palestinian protesters demanding further release
of Palestinian security prisoners and Israeli soldiers in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators should cease the talks and return home because
of "the situation in the (Palestinian self-rule) territories" and
because of the need of consultations "regarding the future of the
talks", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Stockholm back-channel talks, which were only made public
on May 13, had been regarded by the two sides as the most
promising opportunity for reaching a framework agreement for final-
status issues between them. (Israel-Palestinians-Negotiation Team)

<HEADLINE> Turkish Defense Minister Visits Oman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish National Defense Minister
Sabahattin Cakmakoglu left here on Sunday for an official visit to
Oman with an aim to enhance ties with the Gulf Arab state.
</P>
<P>
"My visit to Oman is aimed at further improving bilateral
relations in every field. Defense industry cooperation and military
training cooperation will be high on my agenda," Cakmakoglu said
before departure.
</P>
<P>
He said he will exchange opinion with his Omani counterpart
Sayyid Badr El-Busaidi on regional and international issues of
mutual concern, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Cakmakoglu told reporters that Turkey welcomes Oman's support to
Yasar Yakis who has been nominated by Turkey to run for the post of
Secretary General of the 55-member Organization of Islamic
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has recently mounted a lobbying campaign to seek support
for the Turkish Arab-speaking career diplomat to assume the OIC
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Cakmakoglu said STFA, a leading Turkish contractor, has won the
tender for a wharf construction in Umman as part of the Sohar Port
Project.
</P>
<P>
"This will make a valuable contribution to our bilateral
relations with Oman,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that STFA and another Turkish firm Atilla Dogan
made a bid of 32.9 million U.S. dollars, the lowest among 12
international consortia, earlier this month.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people, including
children and women, were massacred and several others injured by
an insurgent group in West Tripura district of northeast India's
Tripura state on Saturday night, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported on Sunday.
</P>

The latest incident brings to 30 the death toll in ethnic
clashes in Tripura since Friday, as earlier reports said 15 people
had been killed and 13 injured in separate incidents in West
Tripura on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Violence was sparked in the insurgency-haunted northeastern
state on Friday morning when a group of rebels hurled a bomb at a
passenger jeep carrying tribal residents, killing 7. The tribal
and non-tribal residents and insurgent groups from both sides then
started retaliatory attacks on each other, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to stop the violence, local authorities in West
Tripura Saturday imposed a curfew for an indefinite period and
also issued shoot-at-sight orders in two police station areas, the
PTI added.

KUNMING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Border police in Lincang County, in
southwest China's province of Yunnan, today seized 3.45 kilograms
of heroin and 5,000 kilograms of drug-making chemicals from four
drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Police became suspicious when a truck evaded a check point and
drove towards the border.
</P>
<P>
The truck was stopped by police just 25 meters away from the
border. A total of 5,000 kilograms of drug-making chemicals, which
were stored in 20 barrels, were found in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Four people in the truck were arrested at the scene on charges
of drug-trafficking, police said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate case, local police today confiscated 3.45
kilograms of heroin from two food boxes on a bus heading from
Gengma County to Kunming.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that last year, China's border control
departments seized 17 tons of heroin, ice and hemp in 1,200 drug
trafficking cases, and arrested 1,933 people in connection with
the drugs.
</P>
<P>
The number of registered drug users in China rose to 680,000

<HEADLINE> Mass Organizations in Beijing Discuss Jiang's Directives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Three Beijing-based national mass
organizations have held a series of meetings and symposiums on the
important directives recently issued by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (
CPC) Central Committee, said in a recent inspection tour of south
China's Guangdong that the key to running China well lies in the
CPC, in its ideology, style of work, organization, discipline,
capabilities and leadership.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will remain successful and enjoy the heartfelt support
of the people of China so long as the party always earnestly
represents the development requirements of China's advanced social
productive forces, the progressive course of China's advanced
culture, and the fundamental interests of the people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Federation of Trade Unions held two separate
meetings on May 10 and 19 on Jiang's recent directives.
Participants noted that the directives answered the question of
how the CPC should be built in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
People from the Central Committee of Communist Youth League of
China noted that the directives represent a new development of
Marxist party-building theory and the new requirements for the
party.
</P>
<P>
The directives are also of great significance in pushing
forward the development of the Communist Youth League in the
country, they said.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Women's Federation met yesterday to study the
directives and explore new ways to strengthen the federation's
work in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Govt Denies Fall of Key Town Near Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government Sunday
said its troops were engaged in a close-quarter battle on the
outskirts of Chavakachcheri, a small but strategic town near the
embattled Jaffna city, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported
from Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Two senior commanders of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) and nine army soldiers were killed in the "fierce
battle" since Saturday, the PTI quoted a Sri Lankan government
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement also refuted the LTTE's claims of having captured
Chavakachcheri, located in the heart of the Jaffna peninsula,
saying: "At present, troops are in contact with groups of
terrorists on the outskirts of Chavakachcheri."
</P>
<P>
It identified the two killed LTTE area military leaders as
Murali and Vasanthan, adding that 47 army personnel, including six
officers, were wounded in the battle, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The Airforce's planes continued to fly in and out of the Palaly
airbase, the only airbase in the peninsula, carrying essentials
and troop reinforcements, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Also according to a PTI report on Sunday, the Sri Lankan
government would spend an additional 150 million dollars to
acquire new weapons, over and above the 730 million dollars
allocated to the defense budget this year.
</P>
<P>
The new weapons, which reportedly included Kfir bomber jets,
latest artillery and mortars and multi-barrel rocket launchers,
were being acquired to reinforce the embattled government troops
to halt the ongoing offensive by the LTTE to recapture the
northern Jaffna peninsula, the PTI quoted sources in Colombo as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Aid-the-Disabled Volunteers Win Applause in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- As if by prior agreement, Gu Yanan
and Dainzin Como, who live nowhere near each other in China, have
shared a habit for many years.
</P>
<P>
Gu Yanan, a 15-year-old middle-school girl in the Chinese
capital, has helped a paralyzed classmate get to school by
carrying her piggyback every day since 1992. The total length of
road she trod is estimated to be more than 8,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Dainzin Como, a primary school student in Tibet's capital of
Lhasa, which is several thousand kilometers from Beijing, escorted
a blinded classmate to school for five years -- also on her back.
</P>
<P>
Gu and Dainzin have never met, but they're both devoted to
helping the disabled, and are members of China's million-strong
team of volunteers for the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
"I volunteered to escort Hongliu (the paralyzed girl) the first
time I saw her being carried to school by her mom. From the look
in her eyes, I could understand how desperately she wanted to
study with us," Gu recalled.
</P>
<P>
"From that point on, I knew I would help Hongliu to have the
same opportunities and happiness that we have," Gu said,
explaining the motive behind her selflessness to a crowd of 1,000
gathered here today to hear stories of young volunteers.
</P>
<P>
At the gathering, Gu, Dainzin and 65 other people across China
were named by the State Council as the nation's outstanding
volunteers for their excellent performance in aiding disabled
persons. And 42 governmental departments, enterprises, non-
governmental organizations and military squads received the title
of "outstanding unit."

<P>
"We hope this activity will prompt more people to join in the
volunteer team," said Deng Pufang, president of the China Disabled
Persons' Federation.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who is wheelchair-bound, acknowledged that almost all of
China's 60 million disabled people have problems negotiating
through the maze of daily life, jobs, medical care, education and
social activities, and they need special care from society.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that nearly one million volunteers and some 40,
000 agencies have been set up to maintain contact between
volunteers and the handicapped. More than nine million disabled
persons get regular help from volunteer caretakers.
</P>
<P>
The volunteer population is made up of students, business
people, mayors, police, and disabled people themselves, who help
other handicapped people tackle the myriad challenges they face,
such as cleaning house, obtaining medical treatment, getting an
education, and finding a job.
</P>
<P>
Shen Fuyou knows the importance of the volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
Paralyzed by polio when he was five, Shen struggled with
poverty for 40 years due to his inability to make a living. After
getting financial assistance from local volunteers, the farmer in
Baodi County of Tianjin Municipality started a small business and
eventually became well-off.
</P>
<P>
"What I most want to do now is to help some other handicapped
people. I want to be a volunteer, too," Shen said.

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Enterprises Praised for Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The rural enterprises in east
China's Zhejiang Province have made remarkable achievements, an
inspection team from the National People's Congress concluded here
today.
</P>
<P>
The inspection team, headed by Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC
Standing Committee, aimed to see how effectively the Law on Rural
Enterprises is being enforced.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the NPC Standing Committee has made such
a review since the legislation took effect on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
After a week-long inspection, the lawmakers concluded that the
rural industry in the province has played a major role in the
rural economy.
</P>
<P>
In Zhejiang, rural enterprises feature flexible operation, high
quality and market-orientation, and have contributed a lot to the
prosperity and stability of the rural communities.
</P>
<P>
The province has 1.03 million township enterprises, with fixed
assets totaling 497.7 billion yuan ( about 60 billion U.S. dollars)
.
</P>
<P>
The rural enterprises accounted for about 84 percent of the
province's entire industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievements, the province's rural enterprises need
further restructuring and the Law on Rural Enterprises should be
further enforced, the inspectors said.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors also suggested that the local governments
provide better services and more support, and that the modern
enterprise system and urbanization be deepened.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics shows that the rural enterprises have
accounted for nearly one-third of China's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there were a total of 20.71 million
rural enterprises across the country, employing 127 million people.

participate in all sectors of the society, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Amat, state councilor and head of a State Council
committee in charge of work for the disabled, said at the meeting
that China should set up an incentive system to encourage more
people to volunteer time and services to the disabled community.
</P>
<P>
According to Deng Pufang, chairman of the China Disabled
Persons' Federation, nearly one million volunteer groups have been
formed across the country to aid the disabled and a positive
attitude toward helping the disabled has taken root among
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, 42 advanced volunteering units and 67
individual volunteers were cited for their outstanding
contributions.

<HEADLINE> New "Love Bug" May Have Originated in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Computer anti-virus experts in
Jerusalem Sunday expressed their suspicion that a new, but even
dangerous type of "I Love You" virus may have originated in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Network Associates, an Israeli hi-tech start-up company,
reportedly was hit by the virus on Thursday, which is earlier than
any other reports of such virus throughout the world, according to
a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the company had begun its internal investigation to check
whether an employee of the company had written the virus code and
distributing it, currently known as "NewLove Bug".
</P>
<P>
The previous "Love Bug" rapidly spread throughout Europe, Asia,
and the United States earlier this month, affecting thousands of
computers and causing disastrous damages.
</P>
<P>
The "NewLove Bug", a modified type of "Love Bug", is using the
same mechanism to spread itself by sending e-mails to persons in
Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express software's address book.
</P>
<P>
At first look, the only difference appeared that the new bug
randomly chose its attachment filename but always has a .vbs
extension.
</P>
<P>
In a more sophisticated examination, however, it is found that
the new offshoot of the virus is much more dangerous as it will
attaches itself to every file on the victims' computer drivers,
while the previous bug reportedly written by a Filipino only
attacked selected multimedia files.
</P>
<P>
The destructive move could be accomplished between 20 seconds to
one minute, wiping out all files and only leaving a user with a
blank hard disc once attempting to reboot.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the new deadly virus will also mutates and adds lines
of code to itself upon each infection in order to prevent anti-
virus software's detection.
</P>
<P>
All these characters had made computer security experts put the
lethality of such "NewLove Bug" at the dangerous end on the scale
of 1 to 10. In contrast, the original "Love Bug" only ranks at 5 on
this scale.
</P>
<P>
Numerous experts had issued warnings here that anybody should be
very watchful when he wants to open an e-mail attachment,
especially with a .vbs, .vps, or .vns extension filename.
</P>
<P>
There were already infection reports in the United States, while
U.S. experts had said that the most critical time will be Monday.
Only if the damage does not prove to be too severe by then, could
the computer business breathe a sigh of relief.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King, Syrian President Meets in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad held talks on Arab and Middle
East subjects as well as bilateral issues shortly after Abdullah
arrived here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Their talks were also attended by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
al-Shareh and Interior Minister Mohammad Harba and Jordan's Chief
of Royal Protocol Fayiz al-Tarwana, Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-
Khatib and Interior Minister Nayef al-Kadi.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Damascus said the talks tackled the developments of
the peace process on various tracks, especially between Syria and
Israel, and subjects relating to Israel's pending pull-out from
South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks, which resumed last December after
about a 46-week deadlock, hit a snag anew after two rounds in the
United States on January 10 over Israel's refusal to make a
complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Israel captured the
Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Flood Hits Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Drought-hit southern Somalia has
welcomed the long-waited rainfall, but when it comes, it has
caused flooding in many towns and villages furthering the
sufferings in to the drought hit people there.
</P>
<P>
The Jubba River, the largest in Somalia, which rarely flooded is
now taking its turn in competing with the river Shabelleh for the
worst each can do to its neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
An area of more than 40 square kilometers between the towns of
Jilib and Jamama of Middle and Lower Jubba regions is now being
inundated as the flood from the Jubba river have merged those of
the rains.
</P>
<P>
The floods from Jubba River have caused heavy damages to the
Southern port town of Kismaio, 500 Km South of Mogadishu, by
cutting the road linking the capital to Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
All of the commercial movements via terra between Mogadishu and
Kismaio have stopped earlier in the week after the threat has
increased and the farmers began to move.
</P>
<P>
According to Shuriyeh Umiyeh Addaweh, a traveler who reached
Mogadishu last night, the road is cut off but there are boats in
place now working between the town of Jilib and the strategic
bridge of Kansuma, about 100Km North of Kismaio town.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses contacted on the VHF radio in Jilib
town, hundreds of farms stretched along the river have been
abandoned after the river has crushed its banks in the areas where
it did three years ago during the major flood disaster in Southern
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The major crop the farmers have looked forward to good harvest
has been the sesame, which now ended in dismay under floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
The central region of Hiran is not now any better as the
Shabelleh River has flooded into two of its main residential
quarters inside the regional capital, Beletuein.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports reaching here in Mogadishu, over 600
families who fled their houses in Beletuein are now scattered at
Chentoh Kuindisheh area where the road linking Mogadishu to the
central regions pass-by.
</P>
<P>
According to the people in Hiran region, hundreds of families
in Hawo Takoh and Hawlwadag residential areas have left their
houses after the river burst its banks dangerously streaming into
their houses and streets.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Hawlwadag said the main bridge of Liqliqatoh is
now in danger which if its cut, the town will be bisected into two
incommunicable parts.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Abdulleh Qalad, the governor of the region who spoke
with the reporters on the VHF radio said the situation is
alarming. The governor said his people who suffered from
widespread malaria and cholera can not now withstand this extra
burden of displacement.
</P>
<P>
He appealed that unless something quick is done, his people
will start dying in their dozens for lack of food, shelter and
medicine.

<HEADLINE> One-China Principle Allows for No Evasion or Ambiguity: Commentary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinhua News Agency released
a commentary today stressing that the one-China principle leaves
no room for evasiveness or ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who dares insist on splitting Taiwan from China, in
spite of the warning from the Chinese government and people, must
bear responsibility for all the serious consequences arising
therefrom," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The principle concerns China's reunification, sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and the Chinese government and people will
make no concession on this major matter of principle, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The commentary was released in response to the policy speech
delivered on Saturday by the leader of the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
The new leader said that he will not declare "Taiwan
Independence," nor push for "the constituionalization of the two-
states remarks" or "a referendum on reunification vs. independence,
" and that the abolition of the "National Reunification Council"
and the "National Reunification Guidelines" will not be an issue.
</P>
<P>
However, on the key issue of accepting the one-China principle,
the new leader adopted an evasive and vague attitude, saying that
one-China is an issue that will be dealt with "in the future."
</P>
<P>
"Evidently, his so-called goodwill reconciliation lacks
sincerity," the commentary says. "There are still unstable factors
facing the development of relations across the Taiwan Straits."
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the statement on authorization, issued
jointly Saturday by the Taiwan Work Office of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Taiwan Affairs
Office of the State Council, reiterates the government's stand on
dealing with cross-Straits relations, representing the aspirations
of the compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
One-China is both a political reality for the two sides and a
fact in Chinese history, which has been widely recognized by the
international community, including the United Nations, the
commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan leader does not recognize the One-China principle,
the commentary says, cross-Straits relations are unlikely to
improve, and that will lead to conflict and a crisis will occur.

<HEADLINE> One-China Principle Allows for No Evasion or Ambiguity: Commentary (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article points out that the struggle against Taiwan
separatist forces is one for either reunification or separation,
absolutely not a battle over which political system is better.
</P>
<P>
The guiding principle of "peaceful reunification" and "one
country, two systems", which is in the interests of all, is the
best way for resolving the Taiwan issue, as has been proved in
Hong Kong and Macao, it says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary urges Taiwan's new leader to recognize
absolutely the one-China principle and the fact that Taiwan is
part of China.
</P>
<P>
"Acceptance or rejection of the one-China principle is the
touchstone to test whether one sincerely wants to improve cross-
Straits relations," it says.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has repeatedly expressed its willingness to
conduct dialogues, negotiations, and high-level visits between the
two sides on the basis of the one-China principle, the commentary
says.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the Taiwan authorities make a clear commitment that
they will not accept the 'two-state theory,' and that they will
adhere to the consensus reached between the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and Taiwan's Strait Exchange
Foundation in 1992 that 'the two sides of the Straits both adhere
to the one-China Principle,' dialogue may be held between
authorized organizations or individuals of the two sides," the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the Taiwan leader's straying from the one-China
principle will put the Chinese people on guard against further
promotion of Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
China will do its best to achieve reunification peacefully;
however, it is fully prepared to stop all separatist activities in
the name of "Taiwan independence," the commentary adds.

<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, will carry an editorial tomorrow calling for
strengthening of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in line with
President Jiang Zemin's recent remarks about Party building.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Great Guiding Principle for
Strengthening Party Building Comprehensively," says Jiang's
comments that the CPC represents advanced productivity, an
advanced culture and the fundamental interests of the people in
China have both immediate and long-term significance.
</P>
<P>
These "three representatives" reflect the nature of the Party
and socialism and have answered the question of how to build the
Party in the 21st century, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The Party originated and steadily grew with China's reform and
opening up drive because it has been adhering to the "three
representatives," the editorial notes.
</P>
<P>
The "three representatives" should be further implemented to
establish the Party in an unassailable position in the new century,
the editorial says.

<HEADLINE> Survey: European Forest Protection Needs to Do More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted by the World Wide
Fund for Nature (WWF), shows that none of the European countries
has treated its forests very well.
</P>
<P>
Under the "European Forest Scorecards 2000," the average score
for the 20 European countries is 51, against a maximum of 100.
Switzerland scored the highest of 62.
</P>
<P>
All countries have serious improvements to make in many areas of
forest care, according to the survey. There are important flaws in
all countries concerning production of timber and other forest
products, environmental care and quality, social and cultural
aspects of forest care and protected areas and pollution.
</P>
<P>
One obvious example is the Netherlands, which scores no more
than 50 percent in any category, according to a report of Anatolia
news agency.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that there is not an outstanding overall
difference between many countries. Twelve countries are within 10
points of each other. A handful of countries score significantly
worse than the average and lag a long way behind the highest
scoring nations. Some of the countries that do worse include
wealthy, supposedly environmentally-conscious northern European
nations such as Britain.
</P>
<P>
The survey praises east European countries for their
comparatively good performance. Poland and Slovakia, for example,
perform better in many aspects than France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, it says, Mediterranean countries care for their
forests as well as, and sometimes better than, their northern
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
While overall scores are too low, the scores achieved by some
countries in particular categories of forest care show that models
of good practice do exist in Europe. Switzerland is excellent in
its social and cultural care of forests, which includes recreation,
historical remains and safety, the survey says.

<HEADLINE> Israel May Reseize Areas Snatched by Hezbollah: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel will consider returning to
any areas in south Lebanon that Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas step
into following the planed withdrawal by July, Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy warned on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Sunday morning's weekly cabinet meeting, Levy
confirmed that Israel had reached an understanding with the United
Nations that U.N. peacekeepers will take over Israel Defense
Forces' positions in south Lebanon as soon as they are vacated by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment by United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon
(UNIFL), according to Levy, will not leave any security vacuum
after the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the foreign minister said to the effect that if
Hezbollah dared to expand its influence in those areas, Israel
would surely mull the possibility of reseizing them to wait for
UNIFIL's assumption.
</P>
<P>
Levy was giving his cabinet colleagues a briefing on his
diplomatic efforts at the U.N. headquarters in New York last week,
which was to ensure a quiet and safe Israeli troops pullout from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal was approved by Israeli cabinet in March as a
move to end the 22 year occupation of south Lebanon and quiet
international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the areas from being a dangerous security vacuum and
protect its north from future cross-border attacks, Israel leaders
resort to U.N. mandate to redeploy under the framework of U.N.
Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426, which created the UNIFIL
in order to return the territory to Lebanese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Resolution 425, adopted in 1978, demanded an immediate and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon it occupied after two
invasions. But only until last year did Israel agreed to comply
with the resolution, as it was considering a pullout amid mounting
casualties in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militia backed by Iran and Syria, has
been spearheading a war of attrition to out Israeli troops. It
escalated attacks against Israeli troops and their proxy South
Lebanon Army, and vowed to continue fighting until the last Israeli
soldier leaves Lebanese territory.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Foreign Ministry Summons Turkish Ambassador  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry has summoned
Turkish ambassador Turan Moraly to express Iran's "strong
dissatisfaction over the expanded anti-Iran propaganda" by Turkish
mass media.
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Sunday
that the Turkish envoy was also warned against the accusations
leveled against Iranian diplomats in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Two of its diplomats have reportedly been accused of involvement
in the assassination of Turkish writers. The Foreign Ministry asked
Ankara not to attribute its domestic problems to others and avoid
the policy of accusing other countries in an attempt to suppress
its domestic opposition.
</P>
<P>
Following the arrest of nine Islamic activists by the Turkish
police, Turkish press accused Iran of being involved in the bomb
explosions of two Turkish journalists in 1993 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish envoy was also briefed on Iran's detente policy and
expansion of relations with neighboring countries as well as "the
negative impacts of the attempts by Turkish mass media on Tehran-
Ankara bilateral ties."

MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded inside a Manila
shopping mall Sunday afternoon, killing one person and wounding at
least 12 others, police said.
</P>
<P>
An improvised explosive device went off inside a women's toilet
of a cinema of the SM (Shoemart) Megamall, killing one person,
seriously wounding five others and hurting many moviegoers and
shoppers, police said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second bombing incident in Manila in less than a

13 people.
</P>
<P>
But Philippine National Police (PNP) National Capital Region

<P>
Aglipay said they had no idea yet about who is behind the SM
Megamall bombing.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were utility personnel and snack counter

<HEADLINE> Common SAARC Stand to Face WTO Challenges Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Speakers at a seminar here Sunday
urged the member counties of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to forge a common stand to face the
World Trade Organization (WTO) challenges lying ahead.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders at the seminar on "WTO and South Asia" urged
the political leaderships to attach more importance to the
economic issues for the progress of millions of people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the SAARC nations to take a unified and
bold stand to win their due share within the framework of the
global trade body, they said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, jointly organized by the SAARC Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (SCCI) and Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), was held at a hotel in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar, Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed said
that despite strong moves taken by Bangladesh recently as the
spokesman for the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), the developed
countries are yet to give preferential treatment in trade to the
poor nations.
</P>
<P>
"The SAARC nations should create a common platform to ensure
their own share of global trade during the upcoming WTO Round,"
Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
FBCCI President Abdul Awal Mintoo said the SAARC nations should
take a collective stand and work together as a unified powerhouse
in facing the challenges of the WTO system.
</P>
<P>
He said the share of the global trade of 48 LDCs having a
quarter of the world's population has declined to 0.4 percent from
the pre-Uruguay Round volume of 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mintoo said the implementation of the WTO system must take into
account the development dimension of the poor countries.
</P>
<P>
SCCI President Qasim Ibrahim said the poor countries are more
vulnerable to external pressures.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim urged the SAARC countries to meet this challenge
unitedly, and called upon the developed partners of the WTO to
extend greater assistance to the poor nations for their capacity
building and smooth integration into the new economic system.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Crack Down Cults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is planning
to establish a special intelligence unit specifically to identify
cults and cult activities throughout the country, a leading
newspaper, The Guardian, reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed special intelligence unit will be put into full
operation with the assistance of a task force of the police, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest inquiry for the investigation of secret
cult activities, conducted by a judicial commission led by Justice
Okoi Itam, there are at least 56 secret cult groups currently
exist in the high institutions in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
These cult groups are fast penetrating into the secondary and
even primary schools throughout the country, said the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the commission stressed the need for the university
authority to take effect action to ensure that the identified cult
members are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended, among others, that all
identified cult groups should be banned by the government and the
security agents should be directed to invite self-confessed cult
members help to root out the cult activities.

<HEADLINE> HK Press Exposes Taiwan Leader's Evasion of One-China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong press pointed out
Sunday that Taiwan new leader Chen Shui-bian deliberately shunned
the one-China principle in his address delivered Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen adopted an evasive and ambiguous attitude on the key issue
of accepting the one-China principle, therefore the "goodwill
reconciliation" he mentioned lacks sincerity, said Ta Kung Pao, a
Chinese language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese language newspaper, Wen Wei Po, noted that Chen
mentioned the term "one China" only once in the address and
mentioned it in the context of "future one China."
</P>
<P>
This showed that the Taiwan authorities have not accepted the
one-China principle and sent a very dangerous signal for the
future development of cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
"The contacts and exchanges across the Taiwan Straits are based
on the one-China principle. Nothing can be discussed without this
principle," said Wen Wei Po.
</P>
<P>
Ming Pao, also a Chinese language paper, noted in an editorial
that Chen did not state the fact that the people across the Taiwan
Straits belong to the same country and nation.
</P>
<P>
"The reckless cut of the historical and cultural links between
Taiwan and the mainland revealed in his address is absolutely
unacceptable to any Chinese," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao daily pointed out editorially that Chen did not
support reunification of China though he said he would not declare
independence.
</P>
<P>
"Chen did not admit that he himself is a Chinese, nor did he
admit the one-China principle, showing that he has no intention to
promote the reunification of China," said the Daily.

<HEADLINE> Israel Bars Entry into Palestinian Self-rule Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Israelis and foreign tourists have
been barred from entering Palestinian self-rule areas following a
overnight incident in the West Bank of Jericho seriously Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday morning, Prime Minister Ehud Barak had ordered
Israeli troops to close off Jericho to all Israelis and tourists "
as long as necessary," a statement issued by Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
The travel ban was later extended by the troops to all areas
under full Palestinian control as Area A, Israeli officers
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued after a two-year-old Israeli girl was
burned over entire body early Sunday morning when the car she was
traveled in was attacked by "Molotov cocktail" firebombs inside
Jericho.
</P>
<P>
Her mother, who was driving the car, and her aunt in the car
were also lightly injured, while the girl's brother was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
The victims had been taken to the trauma center of Jerusalem's
Hadassah Hospital in Ein Kerem. The burned girl is now in intensive
care on life support, a hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The firebombs attack, which also occurred in Ramallah bypass
road and Hebron areas between Saturday night and Sunday morning,
was among the 10-day-long violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
demanding for the release of Palestinian security prisoners from
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum last December,
Israel had released about 400 Palestinians. However, there are
still more than 1,600 such prisoners, who began their hunger strike
at the beginning of this month in various Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
The violence, in which the Palestinians hurled stones,
firebombs, and glass bottles and Israeli soldiers fired rubber-
coated steel bullets and tear gas, had killed more than a dozen of
Palestinians, and wounded thousands.
</P>
<P>
No Israeli soldiers and civilians were killed in the bloodiest
clashes in years. However, several Israelis were seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
Barak has cancelled a planned meeting with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Washington after an emergency security cabinet session
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
In his statement Sunday morning following the Jericho incident,
Barak expressed greatest concern over the incident and demanded
that the Palestinian National Authority arrest those responsible
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side, on the other hand, blamed Israel for the
upsurge of violence and condemned Israeli use of "live ammunition"
against it called "peaceful demonstrators."
</P>
<P>
Israeli army issued a statement condemning the "very gravely
attacks on Israeli citizens within Palestinian-controlled areas,"
and calling on Palestinians to take immediate steps against violent
actions on Israeli security forces and citizens "within Area A and
outside them."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Replaces Army Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Sunday appointed Brigadier General Mohammad Salimi as
the commander of the army to replace Ali Shahbazi.
</P>
<P>
The commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces made the decision
after Shahbazi submitted his resignation, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not say why Shahbazi quit his post.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the appointment amid mounting power struggle
between the conservatives, who dominate most of sensitive organs,
and the reformists, who won an overwhelming victory in the February
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The reformist allies of President Mohammad Khatami are scheduled
to take over the parliament on May 27 despite conservative
stonewalling.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi was appointed in September 1998 to be the first
commander of the army since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Salimi, 63, had served as head of the representative office of
the leader in the army general staff, defense minister and advisor
to the leader.
</P>
<P>
Iran's armed forces under Khamenei's command include three major
parts, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the army and
the security forces (police).
</P>
<P>
The IRGC and the army have their separate air, ground and naval
forces.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Train Accident in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed when an
express train collided with a truck at a railroad-crossing near
Karawang, about 60 km east of Jakarta on Sunday morning, Antara
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The truck's assistant and a passenger died in the collision
between the Jakarta-bound express Kamandanu Train and the truck in
Tambun near Karawang.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of passengers on trains in the railway lines heading
to Jakarta were forced to continue their trip on buses following
the crash.
</P>
<P>
"We provide them with air-conditioned and non air-conditioned
buses," Head of the Operation of the Cirebon Area Makbul Sujudi
was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the train schedule might be delayed for about three
hours.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Head of the Jakarta Operation Wosep Muktamar said
the crash might have been caused by the truck driver's
carelessness.
</P>
<P>
"The signaling system in the Tambun railroad-crossing is an
automatic one, meaning the gate would be automatically closed when
there is a signal of a train," he said.
</P>
<P>
The crash was the fifth train accident in the past two months.
The last was a head-on collision on May 2 between two passenger
trains in Serpong, about 35 km southwest of Jakarta, killing at
least four people.
</P>
<P>
The series of accidents has led to the resignation of the
director of the state railway company and Director General for
Ground Transportation Santo Budiono.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Win Fourth Consecutive Thomas Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia ended China's dream
of seizing their first victory in the Thomas Cup, prestigious men'
s team tournament, for 10 years Sunday with a 3-0 victory for the
fourth consecutive title at the Putra Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The match had opened with a fierce singles fight between Xia
Xuanze and Indonesia's world number two Hendrawan, who put
Indonesia into the driving seat with a dramatic comeback win 11-15,
15-7, 15-9.
</P>
<P>
Entering the game earlier to take a 6-2 lead, Hendrawan was
intimated by the fast rhythem set up midway into the first set by
Xia, All England champion, losing 11-15. But in the second set it
was Xia who could not catch up the opponent's pace and lost 7-15.
</P>
<P>
Xia, who beat Hendrawan twice in March at the Swiss Open and
the All-England, stumbled on his feet by Henrawan's baseliners and
inside drops, surrendering the crucial first point to make China
struggle.
</P>
<P>
Tony Gunawan and Rexy Mainaky had no hesitation to hammer Yu
Jinhao and Chen Qiqiu, 15-9, 15-2.
</P>
<P>
After keeping in the game as long as possible in the first set,
the Chinese pair almost gave up their fight in the second.
</P>
<P>
Taufik Hidayat used his quick footsteps and powerful strokes
to conquer Ji Xinpeng, 15-9, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
The baseline specialist Ji, winner of the Japan Open, could
not respond to Hidayat's jump shots though he crept to save one
match point and came up from 11-14 down in the decisive set.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia are a better team than us in experiences, and I'm
satiesfied that my team has made the final since 1990," said
Chinese coach Li Yongbo, who has never won a Thomas Cup in his six-
year-coaching.
</P>
<P>
Li did not blame the singles players, saying "Most of our
first-team played their debuts in the Thomas Cup. They were not
techically and mental well prepared for the final."
</P>
<P>
"Our players had a great personal-improvements during the
tournament," Indonesian coach Sumaryono Hadi Nasri said. "They
played better after each game, and I knew they would give out
their bests in the final."
</P>
<P>
Talking about Chinese yongsters, Nasri said, "Xia played a
first-class match in the first singles. But maybe because he is
young and under too much pressure, he was not in his best form."
</P>
<P>
Nasri said some of his squad would retire after the tournament
and the team for the next Thomas Cup would be much different.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, who won the most Thomas Cup for 12 times, recorded
the first four-time winning streak during the span from 1970 to
1979. Since then, the arch-rivalry between China and Indonesia set
off as the two nations swept all the Thomas Cup except the 1992
version, which was won by Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Last time Indonesia beat China in the final was back to 1984
when Indonesia usurped the crown by 3-2.

<HEADLINE> Karrubi Says Ready to Be Iran's New Majlis Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Mehdi Karrubi, a prominent reformist
leader and former Majlis (parliament) speaker, has said he is ready
to take the post of Majlis speaker in the new parliament, local
dailies reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Many friends have urged me to run for the Majlis speaker and I
am ready to be a candidate," Karrubi told reporters Saturday, one
week ahead of the official handover of the parliament to the
victorious reformists on May 27.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi, 63, was elected Majlis speaker in 1989 after his
predecessor Hashemi Rafsanjani became president. But he failed to
enter the parliament in the 1992 elections when most of his allies
were ousted from the parliament by the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Political circles here indicated that Karrubi, Rafsanjani and
reformist coalition spokesman Behzad Nabavi are the three front
runners for the speakership, Tehran Times, a conservative
newspaper, said.
</P>
<P>
However, the reformist parties in the "May 23 Front" coalition
supporting President Mohammad Khatami have reached an agreement to
back Karrubi for the post, and Nabavi, Majid Ansari, a leading
reformist Majlis member, and Mohammad Reza Khatami, the president's
younger brother, as deputy speakers.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Reza Khatami, the top winner in the Tehran constituency
in the February, has declined to become the speaker, reformist
dailies said. Nabavi and Ansari have not commented on their
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
More than three months after the reformists' landslide victory,
the conservative watchdog Guardians Council on Saturday approved 28
of the 30 elected in Tehran, the biggest and most important
constituency.
</P>
<P>
This came after the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
stepped in to end further delays in endorsement, in order to
prevent possible political unrest.
</P>
<P>
However, by invalidating the votes in over 500 boxes, the
council moved Rafsanjani, a centralist and conservative candidate,
from the last position on the list to the 20th, enabling the
conservatives to name him as a candidate for the post of speaker.
</P>
<P>
But Rafsanjani will surely meet strong opposition from the
reformist camp in his pursuit of speakership. The chairman of the
powerful advisory State Expediency Council had even been resisted
in running for a seat in the 290-member Majlis.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office announced late
Saturday night that Barak was canceling a trip to the United
States, supposed to begin Sunday night, because of the violence in
Lebanon and the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also called several foreign leaders Saturday,
warning them that the government may have to "take steps"if
violence continues to escalate in those areas, officials in Barak's
office said.
</P>
<P>
Officials wouldn't elaborate as to what "steps" Barak was
considering to quell the violence. According to media reports
Saturday night, however, Israeli cabinet ministers were weighing
the possibility of halting the back-channel talks with Palestinians
in Stockholm on a final-status agreement and further postponing the
planned handover of three Arab towns near Jerusalem to full
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- At least three guerrillas belonging to Ahmed Jibril's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestinian-General Command were killed
Saturday during a raid by the Israel Air Force on a tank depot
inside the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Defense sources in Israel said that this is a clear response to
Syria's intentions to operate Palestinian opposition groups, with
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas' support, against Israel's northern
border following the Israel soldiers' withdrawal from south Lebanon
by July. According to reports, at least 10 Soviet-made T-55 tanks
were destroyed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
For some time, Jibril's organization has been gathering outdated
Soviet-made tanks at the Bekaa valley base. Recently, one such tank
was given to the Hezbollah, and it was destroyed last week in an
Israeli attack north of the Israeli-occupied security zone.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The two Days of Rage declared by the Palestinian Authority to
press demands for the release of 1,650 political prisoners held by
Israel were marked with violent demonstrations throughout the West
Bank and Gaza Strip over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators hurled stones, firebombs and bottles filled with
acid at Israel soldiers and border patrols, while Israel Defense
Forces responded mostly by firing rubber-coated steel bullets and
tear gas, killing one Palestinians and wounding about 160 people.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli soldier was seriously wounded by Palestinian gunfire
and five others were lightly wound by stones.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Talks among Education Ministry, Treasury, and Shas school
officials will bring an end early this week to the 10-month
government crisis between the Meretz party and the Shas party over
funding and control of Shas' education network.
</P>
<P>
Talks on the professional and political levels continued
Saturday night, with Prime Minister Ehud Barak meeting Meretz
ministers and party whip Zehava Galon at the Defense Ministry in
Tel Aviv. At the same time, the ministry officials were also
attempting to finalize an agreement between the parties.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader and Education Minister Yossi Sarid is till
insisting that his party will quit the government if Shas receives
control of its own schools at the government level or if non-
authorized state funding is passed to the network.
</P>
<P>
At Saturday night's session, Sarid made it clear that the only
solution it will accept is a compromise on the professional level
through Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein.

<HEADLINE> Iran Supports Government of Sierra Leone: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi has said Iran supports the legally constituted
government of Sierra Leone, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iran has always supported the government of President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah and has remained a friend of the Sierra Leone nation
since the start of the crisis in that country, Asefi said late
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the unresolved conflict in the African country on
foreign intervention in its domestic affairs. "Certain foreign
powers have not refrained from doing what they can to fuel the
conflict and unrest in that country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi condemned the foreign interference, which he said was
aimed at prolonging the crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He further expressed concern with the violation of rights of
innocent people in the country and called for a peaceful solution
of the current crisis so that peace and tranquility could be
restored with due respect for the sovereignty of the law.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone crisis erupted at the start of May when rebel
fighters attacked and took hostage up to 500 U.N. peacekeepers,
most of them Zambians, in a dispute over disarmament under a 1999
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force started deploying in Sierra Leone at the end of
1999 to police the peace deal and disarmament.

<HEADLINE> S.Arabia Urges De-escalation Between Bahrain, Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian government has called
on Bahrain and Qatar to seek de-escalation in their tense
relations, Saudi Radio reported Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Kingdom was surprised by the deadlock in the works of the
Joint Bahrain-Qatar Higher Commission on the Border Difference and
the two country's failure to reach an agreement on terminating that
long-standing issue between the two Gulf states, the radio quoted a
government statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expressed "
dissatisfaction with, concerns about and regret over the
developments of the situation" between the two states on the issue
and appealed that they should work for the supreme interests based
on the bond of faith, brotherly links of co-operation, traditional
ties, and good neighborliness, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
They should also seek de-escalation and pursue restoration of
understanding and amity as the sole way for regional stability and
prosperity, the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
On May 19, Bahrain's Foreign Ministry suspended the talks of the
Joint Border Commission with Qatar claiming that Qatar failed to
reciprocate its settlement-seeking endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said, "Bahrain made great efforts for
a brotherly solution of the border dispute through the works of the
Joint Commission and forwarded proposals for this purpose, yet,
astonishingly, it received no positive response from Qatar so far."
</P>
<P>
Both Bahrain and Qatar claim sovereignty over a small Gulf-
located island. The island, now under Bahrain's control, is
possibly rich with oil and gas. The issue has been referred to the
Hague International Court with the hearing sessions scheduled for
May 29.

Vice Mayor Han Zhang here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen extended warm congratulations on Shanghai Airlines'
successful maiden flight to Phnom Penh and also briefed the

The prime minister highly praised the rapid development made by
Shanghai in recent years, saying, "I believe that Shanghai, in the

strengthening the cooperation between our two countries in the
economic and trade areas."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said Cambodia attaches great importance to developing
its tourism, hoping that Cambodia will become the tourist
destination of China in the near future. He also encouraged
Shanghai Airlines to fly between Shanghai and Siem Reap.

and Phnom Penh on Friday and the delegation arrived here to
inaugurate the new direct air service.

flights between Shanghai and Phnom Penh weekly, on Tuesday and

<HEADLINE> Royal Plowing Ceremony Foretells Good Harvests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia will again have
abundant crops in the new year after a good harvest last year,
sacred oxen indicated Sunday during the annual Royal Plowing
Festival held in front of the National Museum.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Norodom Monineath Sihanouk
attended the ceremony. The king was in high spirits, beaming and
waving to his subjects.
</P>
<P>
The traditional plowing ritual, led by the son of Princess
Norodom Buppha Devi, minister of culture and fine arts, saw the
team of oxen circle the field three times before digging into
their food offerings.
</P>
<P>
The two selected oxen ate 97 percent of the rice offering, 95
percent of the soybeans, 95 percent of the maize and 65 percent of
the sesame and drank 50 percent of the water.
</P>
<P>
According to the prediction, the farmers will have abundant
water for the coming farming season and will yield abundant rice
and other crops.
</P>
<P>
Offerings of wine and grass went untouched and this means that
there will be peace and no violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, the king and queen also handed out some
articles of daily use to more than 200 peasants from all over the

According to the newspaper, the international mediators have
told the rebels who are still holding hundreds of U.N. hostages
that their release could not be linked to the fate of Foday
Sankoh, the leader revered by the rebels.

None of the 330 remaining hostages, most of them Zambian
peacekeepers with the U.N. force in Sierra Leone, has been freed
since Sankoh was arrested on Wednesday in the government-held
capital Freetown.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Prime Minister Cancels U.S. Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has cancelled his visit to the United States due to the tense
situation in the Palestinian territories and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak had been scheduled to leave for Washington Sunday night
for talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Regional Cooperation
Minister Shimon Peres has traveled to the United States in Barak's
place.
</P>
<P>
Barak convened his security cabinet for an emergency meeting on
Saturday night to discuss the escalation of violence in Lebanon as
well as the West Bank and Gaza. Barak updated them on the recent
developments in the areas and discussed possible courses of action.
</P>
<P>
He said the Stockholm talks with the Palestinians will continue
but the transfer of the three villages on the outskirts of
Jerusalem to the Palestinian National Authority will be delayed
until the violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip calms down.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he has sent a sharp message over the matter to
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers said before the meeting that Israel would not
be able to make any gesture toward the Palestinians following the
recent violent demonstrations in the territories, and would
definitely not release Palestinian prisoners, which was the main
demand of protestors in Gaza Strip and West Bank last week.
</P>
<P>
Barak spent the weekend trying to rally international support
for the Israeli position. He discussed the situation in telephone
conversations with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King
Abdullah, French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, and explained the measures that Israel had
taken and the possible consequences of a breakdown in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, visited
Israel and the Palestinian self-rule area over the weekend,
bringing Barak a message that Clinton intends to devote all his
efforts to achieving an Israeli-Palestinian agreement before he
leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is currently pushing for completion of the
framework agreement over a final status accord before Israel
completes its withdrawal from Lebanon. Clinton also wants a summit
meeting between Barak and Arafat next month to hammer out a peace
deal by the September deadline.
</P>
<P>
The two days of violent demonstrations in West Bank and Gaza
Strip reportedly led to the killing of one Palestinian and wounding
of about 160 people. One Israeli solider was seriously wounded by
Palestinian gunfire and five others slightly wounded by stones.
</P>
<P>
The weekend Days of Rage was declared by the Palestinian
National Authority to press for the release of 1,650 prisoners held
by Israel.

DHAKA, May (Xinhua) -- Most of the newly imported double-decker
buses of the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) remain
idle due to bureaucratic tangle, the New Nation reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A fleet of 68 double-decker buses imported from India on state
credit provided by the Indian government reached Dhaka early last
month for the convenience of the city commuters.
</P>
<P>
As per earlier decision, the state-run BRTC was to open its new
services in the old city and Nabinagor Export Processing Zone of
Dhaka. But the corporation is yet to press these buses into
service on the proposed routes due to bureaucratic indecision.
</P>
<P>
Of the total recently-imported buses, only 17 were put into
service.The rest 51 have been kept idle in depots of the
corporation in the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 50 more double-deckers will be added to the present
fleet of the BRTC by December this year. These buses are being
imported from Sweden on credit provided by the Swedish government
at an estimated cost of 6.6 million U.S. dollars.

extending ENT services to village communities of the countries in
the region,according to organizers of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
About 500 participants from the SAARC (South Asia Association

need to have more ENT surgeons and necessary equipment in local
hospitals in the region," said Rakesh Shrivastav, chairman of the
organizing committee of the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Political Violence Leaves Ten Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Ten Zimbabwean people have been
confirmed died in the political violence since January this year,
police have said, The Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the wave of violence that has gripped the country
as political parties campaign for next month's parliamentary
polls, Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa Saturday said he
had instructed the police " to deal ruthlessly" with any culprits
caught engaging in violent activities.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mail refuted foreign media and hostile right wing
media reports that all the violence were perpetrated by the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf), saying
that was "not correct".
</P>
<P>
A total of 431 people from four main political parties,
Zanu-pf, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) the Zimbabwe
Union of Democrats (ZUD) and Zanu-Ndonga had been arrested in 202
clashes involving their supporters.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said 200 Zanu-pf and MDC supporters had been
injured over the same period while only one ZUD supporter had
been injured.
</P>
<P>
He said April had been the bloodiest month with six people
being killed, while 64 were injured. At least 218 arrests had
been made following 92 political clashes during that month.
</P>
<P>
However, the statistics released showed that there had been a
marked decrease in political clashes this month with two people
being killed in 58 clashes reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were working flat out to combat violence
adding that arrests and clashes were showing a steady decline.
</P>
<P>
The figures seemed to suggest that some of the 23 people whose
deaths had been linked to political violence had actually died as
a result of other causes. In addition to the 10, four commercial
farmers and one policeman had died in skirmishes related to the
land occupations, the police said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Backs Mugabe's Barring UK Monitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans have come out in full
support of President Robert Mugabe on his firm stance barring the
British from monitoring the forthcoming parliamentary elections,
The Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe recently declared that the British would not be welcome
to monitor the electoral process as they had already taken sides
and openly supported other parties.
</P>
<P>
In a survey conducted by The Sunday Mail Saturday, most people
said the British government should not be involved in the
monitoring process as it had openly showed its support to some
political parties while publicly denouncing Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
President of the National Association of Freelance Journalists
 Simbarashe Chuma said since the British were interested parties
who had already shown an inclination towards some political
parties, it would not be ideal to include them in the monitoring
process.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the president has invited any other country and
various organizations to send monitors shows that there is
nothing to hide. I do not think there is any reason for the
international community to panic over elections in Zimbabwe
because other monitors will be allowed to come," Chuma said.
</P>
<P>
"The British have openly denounced the present government
because of its policies mainly on land. If they were allowed to
monitor the elections,
</P>
<P>
they would obviously paint a bad picture of the elections if the
 government remained in power," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Joyce Choga of Mabelreign said if the government had
nothing to hide, it should welcome anyone who wanted to monitor
the elections, including the British.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will hold the fifth parliamentary elections on June 24
and 25.

<HEADLINE> China Names Foreign "Lei Feng" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Two volunteers from the United States
were named as international "Lei Fengs" yesterday for their deeds
in Shaanxi Province, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Sarah Reinhercz and Harry Rossi have come to Shaanxi three
times to teach English, provide training at enterprises and
management consulting free of charge.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Global Volunteers is a non-official, non-religious and non-
commercial organization which aims to "serve others with their own
money, and study at the same time". Xi'an, the provincial capital,
is the only place in China where such voluntary activities of this
kind take place.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50 groups made up of 634 volunteers from the
organization have come to Xi'an since 1996. They include ordinary
nurses, lawyers and judges as well as other professionals.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng was an ordinary soldier of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army who devoted himself to wholeheartedly serving the
public and helping the needy. He was killed in an accident in 1962
at the age of 22.
</P>
<P>
On March 5, 1963, late Chairman Mao Zedong wrote an inscription,
calling on the people throughout the country to "Learn from
Comrade Lei Feng." From that time on, the "spirit of Lei Feng" has
encouraged the Chinese people for over 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh May Face Severe Flood This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- After the devastating 1998 flood,
Bangladesh is likely to experience another moderate to severe
flood this year, The Daily Star reported here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a rising trend in the Southern Oscillator Index (SOI)
in the Indian Ocean as in 1998 which may cause more rains than
normal and flooding this monsoon," space and atmospheric scientist
Choudhury told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
But it may not be as severe as the 1998 flood when it stayed
for four months, affecting most parts of the country and causing
enormous damage, said Choudhury who monitors weather at the Space
and Atmospheric Research Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said SOI indicates that the La Nina phenomenon is active in
the Pacific and Indian Ocean which is an indication of flooding in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Director of Meteorological Department Ershad Hossain said
available data indicate that the La Nina effect is appearing.
</P>
<P>
He said it is too early to tell the severity of the flood from
the SOI as many other meteorological phenomena are yet to be set
up.
</P>
<P>
According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center, the
water level of rivers in all the basins have risen, some of them
significantly.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Shoots Up to 73-Week High in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate reached a
73-week high of 6.31 percent for the week ended May 6 mainly due
to a sharp increase in prices of some food articles and petroleum
products, an official release said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This has been the highest inflation rate of the country since
December 9, 1998, when a 6.8-percent inflation rate was recorded,
said the release.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate rose by 0.37 percentage points during the
week ended May 6 compared with the previous week and was much
higher than the rate for the corresponding week of last year,
which was merely 3.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official release attributed the high inflation level to the
rise in prices of urea, raw rubber, gingelly seed, furnace oil and
naphtha.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate has been rising steadily since it
touched 3 percent on February 5, mainly on account of an increase
in administered prices in petroleum products and electricity, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
The index for all commodities for the week ended May 6 also
moved up by 0.1 percent to 151.7 from 151.5 in the previous week,
it added.

DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh had earned about 57
million U.S. dollars by exporting 1.288 million bales of raw jute

<HEADLINE> Thailand Faces New HIV Wave, Expert Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is now facing a second
wave of the HIV problem, with the infection rate among pregnant
women shooting up in the wake of budget cuts and lax intervention,
an expert warned.
</P>
<P>
Vigilance is critical since the successful disease control
years ago had caused authorities to relax while the economic
problems had limited containment activities, Dr. Chaiyos
Kunanusont, an AIDS prevention expert and former governmental AIDS
division director, was quoted by Sunday's Nation as saying.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of HIV-related pregnant women had dropped from 2.
29 percent in 1995 to 1.82, 1.68 and 1.53 in 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively. However, the latest statistics showed the infection
rate had risen to 1.78 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The second wave of AIDS problems is now emerging," said
Chaiyos,"and we can not afford to loosen our grip in the AIDS tug
of war."
</P>
<P>
The worrying trend among pregnant women aside, the infection
rate among such groups as drug users and prostitutes were still
frighteningly high: about 30 to 40 percent and 20 to 30 percent,
respectively,according to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
The rising infection rate among teenagers was also a concern.
</P>
<P>
Past AIDS prevention campaigns targeted only adults, ignoring
children, Chaiyos said. Thus teenagers were not sufficiently
educated.
</P>
<P>
He also said rampant discrimination against people living with
HIV-infected patients and their lack of access to treatment remain
the one of the country's toughest challenges.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Default Bank Loans Total US$4.8 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi banks had 4.8 billion U.S.
dollars in default loans at the end of the first six months of the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The New Nation Sunday quoted sources of Bangladesh Bank as
saying this amount is nearly 43 percent of the total loans
disbursed in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The total loans disbursed by all sorts of banks till last
December stood at about 11.6 billion dollars. The burden of
default loans would show an upward trend during the current fiscal
year, which ends on June 30, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to banking sector sources, about 67 percent of the
total loans disbursed by the specialized financial institutions
remain as default loans. Bad loans account for more than 47
percent in case of nationalized commercial banks and more than 29
percent for private commercial banks. Foreign banks, however, have
the lowest burden of default loans, at less than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Unacceptable levels of default loans have crippled banks and
financial institutions in the country, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Banks as a result charge higher interest rates, they said,
adding that this discourages investment in the country in general
and new investors in particular.

<HEADLINE> Enticing Showdown in Thomas Cup China-Indonesia Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 21 (Xinhua) -- After Friday's massive Danish
scare, defending champions Indonesia will definitely not
underestimate China when they meet in the Thomas Cup final at the
Putra Stadium here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
If Indonesia, who were seeking for the fourth-consecutive win
of the men's team world championships, were said to have the best
all-round side in the competition before the meet got underway,
China have proved as the tournament progressed that their doubles
can be as reliable as their singles players.
</P>
<P>
This sets up an enticing final, one that involves a rivalry
dating back 18 years when China made their entry in the 1982
Thomas Cup Finals in London, England. It will be a final that has
every interesting trivia in which the dragons of world badminton
try to outdo each other in a stadium expected to be filled to the
brim.
</P>
<P>
After being exhausted by Denmark to a 3-2 win, Indonesian coach
Sumaryono Hadi Nasri said, "We'll be a better team in the finals
on Sunday."
</P>
<P>
While Chinese coach Li Yongbo pledged after their 3-1 semi-
final win over South Korea, "Whoever we'll meet in the finals,
Indonesia or Denmark, we'll try our best as we did today."
</P>
<P>
China ended Indonesia's run of four straight wins in the 70s
with a hard-earned 5-4 triumph in 1982 and that set off a
continual rivalry. Indonesia came back to beat China in 1984 final
but for the next editions, had to be content playing second, at
times third, fiddle as China stamped their mark.
</P>
<P>
For China, who were barred from the final glory for 10 years
since 1990, Indonesia remain the only team to have beaten them in
one final and they held an edge of 2-1 record in their past three
final meetings.
</P>
<P>
And for Li, the meeting will be memorable as the last time the
two countries met in the final in 1986, when Li, partnering Tian
Bingyi at the second doubles, delivered the winning point of that
tie.
</P>
<P>
Recent memories are not sweet for Li as, since taking over as
chief coach in 1994, China have struggled in the Thomas Cup, and
Li is desperate for the first Thomas Cup trophy during his charge.
But it would seem that Li's confidence isn't misplaced as China
have been equally impressive as Indonesia, although they lost 4-1
in the preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
Despite Hendrawan's fighting spirit, China have the edge in the
first singles as All-England champion Xia Xuanze is a player in
form. China will be prepared to the loss of the first doubles as
Indonesia are expected to reinstate the Candra Wijaya/Tony Gunawan
partnership and Yu Jinhao-Chen Qiqiu don't look capable of
withstanding their attacking and fast play.
</P>
<P>
The second singles will be crucial to the hopes of both teams
and their faith will lie on the shoulders of two young players who
are the future of the game. China's Ji Xinpeng and Indonesia's
Taufik Hidayat will not only have to battle themselves but nerves
in the tie.
</P>
<P>
The second doubles will be equally interesting and Indonesia
should field Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky to take on the two
Zhangs, Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei.
</P>
<P>
Should the final need to decided by the third singles, which is
very much likely, China will really fancy the chances of Luo
Yigang against Marleve Marinaky. To some International Badminton
Federation (IBF) officials and legends of the old days, Sunday's
final would be a complete matchup.
</P>
<P>
"China are strong in the singles and Indonesia, the doubles,"
said IBF vice-president Datuk Punch Gunalan.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia need to win the doubles to secure the Cup but should
the match be decided in the third singles, China could walk away
with the trophy." Former world champion and All-England winner
Prakash Padukone of Indonesia said, "While I expect a close final,
Indonesia will retain the Thomas Cup if they can take the doubles,
especially the second doubles. But don't discount the possibility
of the final going down the the wire."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Against UN Intervention in Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
canvassed the support of friendly countries against moves for a U.
N. resolution on the island country's escalating internal conflict
between government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels, The Sunday Times
here.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want ourselves turned into another mess like Bosnia
or Sierra Leone through U.N. resolutions," a spokesman for the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China, two U.N. Security Council permanent members
with veto power, had responded positively to Sri Lanka's concerns,
the spokesman said, adding that the government would "go to the
ends of the world" to fight "tooth and nail" moves to introduce
any U.N. resolution on Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The government's tough stand came after the European Parliament
passed a resolution in Brussels Friday calling on "the European
Union member states in the U.N. Security Council to bring the
situation before the U.N. as a matter of urgency."
</P>
<P>
The European resolution, to be forwarded to the U.N. Security
Council, the U.N. secretary general and the secretary general of
the Commonwealth, also welcomed the efforts of the Norwegian
government and the Indian government to bring about an acceptable,
peaceful political solution and urges the Commonwealth to use its
good offices for high-level mediation in the Sri Lanka crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 17-year civil war between
government troops and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels who are fighting for a separate state for minority Tamils
in the country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the civil war has been escalating as LTTE
rebels are engaged in a ferocious assault in a bid to retake their
former stronghold of Jaffna which they lost to government troops
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said Britain is interested in raising the
Sri Lankan issue at the Security Council. However, Sri Lankan
Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar said last week that Sri Lanka
was dead against any form of U.N. intervention.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Make Breakthrough in Drip Irrigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The production of infilled pipe used
for drip irrigation developed by Chinese scientists has been
approved in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
after passing tests conducted by the province.
</P>
<P>
Drip irrigation is an efficient and water-saving technology,
however the devices used in China are mainly provided by Israel
and the U.S. Experts said that this achievement will end this
situation.
</P>
<P>
Tests have demonstrated that the special pipes, at a cost half
that of imported products, can save water up to 80 percent,
compared with traditional irrigation methods. They are also
suitable for the soil in northwestern China, and will be welcomed
by the local farmers.
</P>

<P>
BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will open a new
trade mart here next month to provide an all-year meeting place
for Thai exporters and their foreign buyers, according to a report
of the Thai Commerce Ministry available here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Commerce Ministry's Department of
Export Promotion Banport Hongthong was quoted as saying the new
trade mart would allow immediate and direct contact between Thai
exporters and importers from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Thai products to be demonstrated at the mart would include
automobiles, chemicals, construction materials, electronics, food,
furniture, gems and jewelry, gifts, household appliances, leather
products, printing materials, stationery, textiles, toys and
machinery, Banport said.

<P>
About 90 Thai firms could have their own 40-square-meter
exhibition rooms while nearly 300 others could display their
products in a large hall of the mart, he added.
</P>
<P>
In view of the campaigns by Thailand's trade offices overseas,
the Commerce Ministry expected that the new trade mart would
receive a trade mission from foreign countries every two months
over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Banport said the mart would be a step of his department's plan
to eventually open Thailand's permanent exhibition hall, where
Thai products would be displayed and business cards would be used.

<HEADLINE> 4 More Die in Renewed Violence in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Four more people were killed and 14
wounded as rioting between Muslims and Christians continued in
Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku Province, according to
reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The people were killed by gunshots fired by security forces
trying to stop a clash between residents of Hattu and Laha
villages in renewed communal conflict Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The deaths have brought to 35 the number of those killed since
clashes re-erupted five days ago after the arrival of 2,000
Islamic volunteers belonging to the Laskar Jihad (Jihad Force)
paramilitary group from Indonesia's main island of Java.
</P>
<P>
All commercial flights in and out of Ambon, about 2,500
kilometers northeast of Jakarta, have been canceled until May 22,
a spokesman for private airline Merpati Nusantara Billy Laho was
quoted by The Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian troops are on the alert after they were ordered
Friday to shoot troublemakers without warning.
</P>
<P>
"The security forces will not take sides and will confront
anyone who engages in the violence. Hopefully it will stop soon
since (both sides) feel tired of rioting," Maluku military
spokesman Lt. Col. Iwa Budiman said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Chief of the Indonesian Military Adm.
Widodo A. S. Saturday inspected Ambon aboard a helicopter. He was
accompanied by Maluku Governor Saleh Latuconsina and chief of the
Pattimura provincial military command Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela.
</P>
<P>
Tamaela said his command has prepared additional troops to
anticipate more clashes.
</P>
<P>
Maluku has witnessed a year-long ethnic bloodshed between
Christians and Muslims, which has claimed more than 1,300 civilian
lives. Clashes have subsided in recent months but tension remains
in some areas.
</P>
<P>
The five days of rioting this week is the first major eruption
of violence in Ambon this month. On April 30 six people were
killed and more than 10 others injured near Ambon's port and at
least 40 houses were razed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislator Meets Peruvian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 20 (Xinhua)-- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, said here Saturday that to develop the economy and
uplift living standards are the central tasks for developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is also the fundamental method of administrating a country,
" said Li while meeting Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
"As an old saying in China goes, 'if people get wealthy, a
country will be more smoothly governed; if people feel happy, a
country will be peaceful and harmonious.'"
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the legislator said, if people get poor, a country
will be full of troubles; if people have a lot to complain about,
a country will have a gloomy future.
</P>
<P>
Li warned that the most fearful thing for a country is that
ordinary people have lost confidence in government and those in
power have lost the heart of people.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, people in power should work hard to find ways to improve
people's life and make them feel happy," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on further enhancing
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori expressed satisfaction with the development of the
friendly cooperation between the two countries. He reiterated that
his government will continue to insist on its "one China" policy
and will continue to support China over the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori expressed hopes that both sides will make efforts to
seek closer cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived in Lima on Friday, also met with Prime Minister
Alberto Bustamante and Congress President Martha Hildebrandt.
</P>
<P>
Peru is Li's last leg of his four-nation tour, which also took
him to Canada, Venezuela, and Trinidad and Tobago.

China, EU Sign Bilateral Agreement on China's WTO Entry
</P>
<P>
China and the European Union signed an agreement on China's
accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO) here Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi
Guangsheng and Trade Commissioner of the European Commission
Pascal Lamy signed the bilateral agreement on behalf of the
respective sides.
</P>
<P>
Lamy arrived in Beijing Monday morning for this new round of
talks, and China and the EU had held three rounds of talks earlier
this year, one in Brussels and two in Beijing. China described the
talks as "positive" and "fruitful."
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin met with Lamy after the signing ceremony,
and said China will surely be a responsible member of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) and play a constructive role in it once
it gains membership.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that once as member of the WTO, China will enjoy its
rights and at the same time seriously honor its obligations, and
abide by the WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
China and the EU have long-standing friendly relations, Jiang
said, noting that the conclusion of Sino-EU agreement on China's
WTO entry shows to the world that the two sides can arrive at an
agreement on major strategic issues through consultations.
</P>
<P>
Lamy said the just-inked EU-China agreement on China's entry
into the WTO is "important for both sides", which sent an
important message to the world that China is still devoted to its
reform and opening-up efforts. The European Union (EU) hopes China
's efforts will succeed and is willing to march with China toward
this goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
Upon the signing of the agreement, the Beijing-based
representative offices of companies from EU member countries
voiced their welcome and support for the accord signifying the
last major victory in China's fourteen-year WTO bid.
</P>
<P>
Alcatel China Chairman and CEO Dominique de Boisseson told
Xinhua that Alcatel is very pleased to see China approaching the
final stage of entering WTO on reaching agreement with EU.
</P>
<P>
Another telecommunications giant Ericsson applauds the
conclusion, saying that "WTO, the world's largest trade regulatory
system can then be truly representative with the membership of
China, one of the world's largest emerging economic and trading
entities."

whatever name, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said here
Tuesday.

their proposal of "inviting the Republic of China (Taiwan) to
attend the WHA as an observer".

not to include in the agenda of the assembly the proposal by a
small number of countries like Honduras of "inviting the Republic
of China (Taiwan) to attend the World Health Session as an
observer", which once again frustrated the attempt by the Taiwan
authorities to get into the WHO.

<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Officials at Scotland's national
stadium said they have been inundated with ticket requests for
Mike Tyson's controversial bout next month.
</P>
<P>
Hampden Park stadium in Glasgow was announced as the venue for
the event on June 24, despite heated protests because of the boxer
's rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary, Jack Straw, who has granted Tyson entry to the
United Kingdom, and the Scottish Football Association, which runs
Hampden, have come in for fierce criticism from politicians and
women's groups.
</P>
<P>
The fight promoter, Frank Warren, said 15,000 tickets have
already been ordered and the SFA said that its switchboard had
been inundated with calls.
</P>
<P>
SFA chief executive, David Taylor, said 90% of calls had been
enquiries about the fight against Lou Savarese, adding that the
decision to hold the fight at Hampden had been purely commercial.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of whether the former world heavyweight
champion, who was convicted of rape in the United States in 1992,
should be allowed into the country was for the home secretary to

<HEADLINE> Banks Condemns Riot Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Former British sports minister Tony
Banks has criticised coverage of the football violence before the
Uefa Cup final.
</P>
<P>
His words of warning came as the British government took steps
to ban anyone involved in the Copenhagen trouble from travelling
to Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Banks, the man leading England's bid for the 2006 World Cup,
said there were "a million more important things" going on in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The European press and TV were dominated by pictures of Arsenal
and Galatasaray supporters fighting in Copenhagen's main square on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a great deal of over-reaction," Banks told BBC Radio
4's Today programme. "This isn't Sierra Leone, starvation in
Ethiopia or drive-by massacres."
</P>
<P>
"We are not the only country which suffers from problems like
this and they are much worse in other countries, but that never
seems to get covered," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the press reporting that England's World Cup bid had been
tarnished by the violence, Banks insisted the Turkish element in
Copenhagen had to take a large part of the blame.
</P>
<P>
The Galatasaray fans had stoked up a climate violence in their
ground and their presence was normally linked to trouble, he said.
</P>
<P>
Banks warned that the coverage of the violence could damage
England's chance to host the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks just as the government said it would
consider taking tougher action against suspected football
hooligans.
</P>
<P>
Home Office minister Lord Bassam said he was confident that
steps being taken in the UK would result in the 15 people arrested
after this week's game - plus any others identified as being part
of the riots - being banished from the European Championships.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had asked the police to pass the names of
the 15 arrested fans to Belgian, Dutch, German and French police,
along with details of all those identified as being involved in
the disorder.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no tolerance of the type of incidents seen in
Copenhagen and the police in Belgium and Holland have our full and
unqualified support," he said.

<HEADLINE> 4 Palestinian Militiamen Killed in Israeli Raids in Bekaa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Four militiamen of the People's Front
of Palestinian Liberation (PFPL) were killed and 15 injured in
Israel's air raids Saturday on its position in Lebanese Bekaa
valley.
</P>
<P>
Israeli planes Saturday noon attacked the Palestinian
guerrilla's stronghold, several kilometers inside the Lebanese-
Syrian borders, Lebanese security source said Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli jets fired 10 air-to-ground missiles in three
attacks to the stronghold and hit a training station and an
ammunition store of the Palestinian guerrilla, which is opposed to
peace talks with Israel and locates its headquarters in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has sped up its withdrawal process from south
Lebanon, a strip of land under Israeli occupation since 1985.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had promised to pull out Israeli
troops from the so-called "security Zone" in early July, one year
after taking office.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Reaches 33 in Boat Accident Near Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Bodies of six more victims who
drowned
in Saturday's rowboat overturn off the Black Sea coast of Turkey
have been found, increasing the number of deaths to 33, said a
latest report of the Anatolia News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 33 people, most of whom were women and children, were killed
in the accident off the Black Sea coast along Besikduzu township,
Trabzon Province, when two rowboats carrying them to mark a
locally-celebrated sea festivity capsized in rough waters.
</P>
<P>
A crowd including relatives and friends of the victims gathered
on the quay side at the port town of Besikduzu. Many wept as the
bodies were brought ashore by crews of other fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
Some 16 people were rescued and hospitalized in Trabzon, and
nine others are still missing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the two rowboat, which were fishing boats
not licensed to carry passengers, were overloaded when they were
overturned in high waves. But it is a common practice in the region
that fishing boats carry passengers.
</P>
<P>
The coast around Trabzon, a fishing region, is largely straight
without many sheltered bays. It is prone to sudden storms and wind
changes.
</P>
<P>
Local fishermen, rescue ships and military helicopters are still
searching for the missing.
</P>
<P>
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Parliament Speaker Yildirim
Akbulut have expressed their sorrow over the incident.

LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has said that he can persuade the Euro-sceptical British public
that it is right to scrap the pound.
</P>
<P>
Blair believes he can reverse hostility to the single currency
because people "do respond to political leaders who know what they
want to do," the Sunday Telegraph said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting from an interview with the U.S. magazine Talk, the
newspaper said Blair hinted he would not make the euro an election
issue but grab victory in a referendum after a "short,
concentrated campaign."
</P>
<P>
Blair was asked whether he believed it was getting too late to
turn public opinion in the face of growing hostility to the euro
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"I don't, as a matter of fact, accept this," he replied. "If we
decided to make a recommendation to people, the whole dynamics of
the argument would change, because the circumstances would have
changed," he added.
</P>
<P>
The comments confirm suspicious that Blair believes he can
avoid the issue during the next election and win a referendum on
joining the single currency afterwards with a campaign.
</P>
<P>
A Gallup poll for the Daily Telegraph in March showed that 69
percent of Britons opposed joining the euro, a jump of three
percent over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the interview comes after a week in which
Cabinet tensions over the euro were exposed. Trade Secretary Peter
Mandelson was rebuked for pointing out that the pound was
vulnerable to speculation while Britain remained outside the euro.
</P>
<P>
Britain set five economic tests in 1997 to judge it's entry but
is widely rumored to have gone cool on the euro, fearing it would
jeopardize its good performances of steady growth and low
inflation.
