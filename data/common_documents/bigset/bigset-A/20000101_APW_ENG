<HEADLINE> GM Unveils Car That Delivers 80 Mpg  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- After spending six years and hundreds of millions of
dollars on federal and industry research, General Motors Corp. is unmasking a
five-passenger test car that can travel about 80 miles on a gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
	   But in meeting several of the goals set out by President Clinton and
industry leaders in 1993, the GM Precept also shows that many of the
technologies it uses to reach 80 mpg are years away from everyday use. While
Honda and Toyota will sell vehicles this year that rely on similar power
sources, no automaker has committed to making such cars in any great numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the uncertain road, GM believes that its effort broke new
technological ground that underscores the value of industry-government
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   "It required a lot of invention," GM Vice Chairman Harry Pearce said. "It is
an extraordinary vehicle. It delivers far more than I ever thought possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of us questioned at the outset whether this partnership was going to
work. It has worked, and worked well," Pearce said. "It has pushed beyond what
the industry thought possible."
</P>
<P>
	   The Precept, like Ford Motor Co.'s Prodigy high-mileage car, uses a small
diesel engine linked to electric motors. While the Prodigy gets about 70 mpg and
sticks to the basic outlines of today's mid-size sedans, GM's engineers had to
break several conventions to get that extra 10 mpg.
</P>
<P>
	   The Precept's Isuzu-built three-cylinder diesel is located over the rear
wheels. One electric motor powers the front wheels, while a "multi-purpose unit"
built onto the diesel engine acts as another electric motor and a generator,
recharging a battery pack under the seats. The motors help the 54-horsepower
engine during acceleration, and capture energy during braking.
</P>
<P>
	   The engine gets placed in the rear of the car to improve airflow around the
vehicle; the Precept's body is the most aerodynamic ever designed for an
automobile. Rearview mirrors are replaced with tiny cameras, and the doors use
electronic controls instead of handles.
</P>
<P>
	   GM engineers also looked to save weight wherever they could. Aluminum and
titanium are used instead of steel in many parts; the seats are made of mesh,
and even the stereo speakers have an advanced weight-saving design. The result
is a car that's the size of a Chevrolet Malibu and weighs about 460 pounds less.
</P>
<P>
	   The Precept is the result of the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, an effort backed by $250 million in federal funding this year and $980
million from GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler. All three targeted 2000 as the year
to show test cars that had three times a standard sedan's fuel economy with no
compromises in safety, performance or price.
</P>
<P>
	   But GM and Ford say price remains a giant hurdle; neither puts an estimate
on the production cost for their test vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, the diesel cars could run afoul of U.S. anti-pollution rules. Last
month, President Clinton unveiled new standards for auto emissions that even the
Precept and Prodigy would not meet.
</P>
<P>
	   Engineers say a byproduct of more efficient diesel engines is more nitrogen
oxides in the exhaust -- a prime component of smog. Pearce said the new
standards could do more environmental harm than good if they kept cars that
burned less fuel off the road.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we are ever going to deliver true environmental benefits with lower
emissions ... we've got to convince the federal government to relax the
(nitrogen oxide) standards," Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, consumers have appeared to care little about mileage these past
few years, snapping up sport utility vehicles and trucks. Toyota and Honda will
offer gas-electric hybrid cars with high gas mileage this year, but both will be
imported in small numbers, and both companies are believed to be losing money on
the projects.
</P>
<P>
	   Pearce said the Precept's technology could end up in other GM products, and
that a vehicle similar to the Precept could roll off a GM assembly line in five
to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our view at GM is that environmental issues will become increasingly
important to people," he said. "Can I tell you when that's going to happen? No."

<HEADLINE> Justice: Pay Lawyers for Poor More  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist is urging Congress to
provide more pay for lawyers who represent federal criminal defendants too poor
to afford an attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Inadequate pay is ``seriously hampering'' courts' ability to recruit lawyers
to accept such appointments, the nation's top judge said in his annual year-end
report on the federal judiciary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Adequate pay for appointed counsel is important to ensure that a
defendant's constitutional right to counsel is fulfilled,'' Rehnquist said. ``I
respectfully ask Congress to make adequate compensation for panel attorneys a
high priority.''
</P>
<P>
	   The chief justice also reflected on ``remarkable'' changes in the federal
judiciary during the past century, ``which, I hasten to point out, has another
year to run. Just ask the makers of `2001: A Space Odyssey.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A century that began with some federal judges still riding the circuits
concludes with judges communicating by video conferencing, using a Federal
Judicial Television Network and in some instances reviewing briefs filed
electronically,'' the chief justice added.
</P>
<P>
	   Regarding pay for indigent federal defendants' lawyers, federal law has
allowed maximum hourly pay of $75 since 1986 for attorneys who agree to take on
such defendants. But Rehnquist said Congress has provided too little money to
pay that rate in most of the nation's 94 federal judicial districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Until Congress provided a $5 raise in 1999, lawyers in 82 districts were
paid $65 an hour for in-court work and $45 an hour for out-of-court work. Now
those rates are $70 and $50.
</P>
<P>
	   The pay rates ``have been eroded by inflation and are substantially below
prevailing rates in the legal profession,'' Rehnquist said in asking Congress
for enough to pay $75 an hour in all districts.
</P>
<P>
	   The judiciary's greatest contribution during the last 100 years may be ``its
stability and relative predictability,'' the chief justice said.
</P>
<P>
	   During the past century, he said, the number of federal judgeships rose from
108 to 852. Fewer than 15,000 cases were filed in federal district and appellate
courts 100 years ago, compared with almost 375,000 last year plus 1.3 million
cases in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehnquist said federal criminal case filings rose by 4 percent to 59,923 in
1999, following a 15 percent increase the year before. Civil case filings rose
by 1 percent to 260,271.
</P>
<P>
	   Bankruptcy case filings broke a four-year growth trend and dropped by 6
percent to 1,354,376.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress can help control the growth of the federal judiciary by ending the
``unwarranted federalization of crime,'' in which lawmakers make federal crimes
out of offenses already covered by state law, the chief justice said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years ago, Rehnquist sharply criticized the Senate for delays in
confirming President Clinton's judicial nominees. This time, he said, ``some
progress'' was made in 1999 with 33 new judges confirmed, but he said that
number still was below the 65 judges confirmed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in his own year-end
report that the Senate had ``made substantial progress in maintaining a low
vacancy rate in federal judgeships.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rehnquist also noted the death last March of retired Justice Harry A.
Blackmun, who the chief justice called ``a thoughtful and compassionate man, who
will be remembered for his integrity, his sense of justice and his
exemplification of decency and modesty.''

<HEADLINE> At the drop of a ball, new millennium arrives for America  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Times Square celebrated New Year's Eve for the world
Friday in a wild street party that exploded when the millennium arrived in
America. At midnight, a flashing, glittering crystal ball dropped to a countdown
from a cheering, banner-waving crowd that flooded mid-town.
<P>
	   The 20th Century passed into history with more than a million people in and
around the square. The crystal ball's descent in Times Square is traditional,
but the ball was newly designed for the millennium - with 90 rotating pyramid
mirrors that sent lights dancing across the crowd below.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite warnings of terrorism, people had come from around the world to
greet 2000 in the place that Americans traditionally look to for the signal of a
new year.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 500 perfomers presented music, dance, light shows and giant puppets to
mark the New Year in all the world's time zones, and 17 New Year's Eves had gone
by - from New Zealand in the Pacific to Bermuda in the Atlantic - before it was
New York's turn.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese visitors watched pink confetti fashioned to look like cherry
blossoms drift down, marking the new year in Tokyo. Englishmen yelled as 2000's
arrival in London flashed onto the square's giant TV screens, and Argentines
waved their flags at the appropriate hour.
</P>
<P>
	   But at midnight in New York, with strobe lights flashing from the Waterford
crystal ball, it looked like an American New Year - with revelers kissing,
dancing, blowing horns and breaking into Auld Lang Syne.
</P>
<P>
	   City officials expected 1.5 million people in and around Times Square. The
peaceful crowd swelled northward up Broadway toward Central Park, nearly 20
blocks from the ball's home at One Times Square. Four hours before midnight,
police said the Times Square area was filled to capacity, although they provided
no official crowd count.
</P>
<P>
	   The $7 million party started when it was midnight in New Zealand (7 a.m.
Friday in New York) and was to end with the dawn of a new century 24 hours later
in Western Samoa and Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Island (6 a.m. Saturday New York
time).
</P>
<P>
	   "We can feel our country here," said Miwa Shinoda, a Japanese living in
Manhattan, as the cherry blossom confetti rained and the boom of traditional
Taiko drums echoed through the square at 10 a.m. - midnight in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   But this was, after all, Times Square U.S.A., and lots of Americans wanted
to share in person in the falling of the 1,070-pound Waterford crytal ball
heralding the new millennium that millions of others watched on television.
</P>
<P>
	   By 5:30 a.m., a crowd of hundreds had gathered to be a part of it in New
York, New York. At 7 a.m., a shouted count-down arose as the ball, with its 504
crystal triangles, was lighted and made its journey up the 77-foot flagpole atop
the building at One Times Square.
</P>
<P>
	   The visitors were not stopped by talk that a big crowd would be the dream
target for a terrorist wanting to deliver a terrible message just opposite the
celebration's theme - the Unity of Mankind.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrest of a man suspected of terrorist links on Thursday in Brooklyn
added to the tension. At midmorning Friday, police issued a bomb warning but the
abandoned knapsack that set it off turned out to be harmless.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowds kept coming. Times Square was the place to be, as Dustin Landis
said after driving in from Green Lane, Pa., with his wife and two daughters, 7
and 4.
</P>
<P>
	   "When they grow up and someone asks where they were on New Year's Eve of the
millennium, I just want them to be able to say, 'Times Square,"' Landis
explained.
</P>
<P>
	   A British woman wished she had brought her family, too. Caroline Tavernor of
Nottingham wept as England's celebration came, saying she missed her 4
1/2-year-old. But she quickly regained her composure.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the chance of a lifetime, and I'm having fun," Tavernor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Times Square did not disappoint, with its own brand of flash and kitsch,
with echoes of its role in history and images of the 20th Century.
</P>
<P>
	   The flash came from the giant neon signs, and the kitsch from African
immigrants who usually hawk jewelry but on this day dealt in foam rubber 2000
tiaras and oversized 2000-shaped eyeglasses where the eyes stare out through the
central O-Os.
</P>
<P>
	   A giant Kodak sign flashing pictures of America supplied the history.
Suddenly there was a young, pencil-thin Frank Sinatra before the microphone,
looking much like the did when he played the Paramount Theater in Times Square
back in 1942.
</P>
<P>
	   He brought out the bobby-soxers whose screams became an echo of the
century's music - from Ol' Blue Eyes to Elvis to the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not long after Sinatra rose to fame that Times Square saw its other
big party. An estimated 2 million had crowded into and around the square on Aug.
14, 1945, to breathe a collective sign of relief - and shout with joy - at the
end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   How times have changed was apparent Friday as time ticked toward the new
millenium. At 47th Street, a building had room for giant neon ads for both
America's Cadillac and Japan's Suntory whiskey.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leads Nation Into 2000  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FEINSILBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With an extravagant fireworks display dancing up the
sides of the Washington Monument as the 21st century arrived in America,
President Clinton called on the nation to fear not the future but to ``welcome
it, embrace it, create it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our children are ready. Again the torch is passed to a new century of
young Americans,'' he said, speaking from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the
statue of the Great Emancipator peering over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   Relieved that technology was behaving itself, 300 stars from the worlds of
entertainment, business, government and academia dined with Clinton, his wife
and daughter at the White House and then joined the first family at a $12
million extravaganza at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   The famous statue of a sober-faced Lincoln peered down as the Clintons and
3,000 other invited guests in a heated booth and thousands of ordinary Americans
crowded around the reflecting pool and watched actor Will Smith introduce a show
of song, dance and even poetry. Among the performers were Jack Nicholson, Diane
Keaton, Bobby McFerrin and some known only by one name -- Bono, Stomp, Slash and
Usher.
</P>
<P>
	   Remarked one member of the audience, Marie Trotta, who runs a
Meals-on-Wheels program in Bellport, N.Y., ``We were a little more concerned
about terrorism than we were about Y2K, but we figured, what the heck, if you're
going to blow up, why not in Washington?''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was the first president to bring in a new century since William
McKinley did so with far less pizzaz. This president started Millennium Day by
stowing Army dog tags, a public library card and other artifacts of 20th century
America into a time capsule to be opened at the end of the 21st.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton found a happy omen in the beautiful winter weather -- crisp but
clear. ``The sun is still rising on America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At nightfall he donned a tuxedo to dance into the new year and shook the
hands of dinner guests streaming into the White House. Actor Robert De Niro,
former boxing champ Muhammad Ali and rock star Bono were among the famed and
accomplished who came for the roast lamb dinner and champagne toasts.
</P>
<P>
	   One guest was former senator and astronaut John Glenn, with a prediction:
``Will humankind get to Mars in the next century? Oh yes, certainly.'' He wore
his congressional space medal on a ribbon around his neck.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing at the East Portico of the White House, the president; first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton in a floor-length black silk dress with rhinestone
buttons down its front; and daughter Chelsea, wearing a dark blue taffeta dress
and a stand-up collar, received their guests.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton offered three toasts-- to his guests, his wife and humanity's
``shared future.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``By far my most solemn prayer for this new millennium is that we will find
somehow the strength and wisdom in our hearts to keep growing together, first as
one America and then as one people on this ever-smaller planet we all call
home,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Next came the star-filled and fireworks-lit party for the throngs at the
foot of the Lincoln Memorial, a hallowed obelisk that stood like an exclamation
mark aglow in the century's waning moments.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, the plan was all-night dancing at the White House, ending with
breakfast at sun-up.
</P>
<P>
	   But all was not fun. Clinton had solemn words in a day filled with
millennium-conscious oratory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the new century, we may not be able to eliminate hateful intolerance,''
he said, ``but we will see the rise of healthy intolerance of bigotry,
oppression and abject poverty in our own communities and across the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   And for his final speech of the century, he quoted Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let us pledge,'' he said in his short prepared speech, ``that the new
millennium will bring, in the words of the Great Emancipator, 'a new birth of
freedom.'''
</P>
<P>
	   The White House called the finale ``an unforgettable midnight moment.''
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour show competed on television for the home audience with the
customary Times Square countdown.
</P>
<P>
	   One difference: In New York the ball of light was descending in the seconds
before midnight while here the white light of fireworks was cascading up the
555-foot Washington Monument, sparked by a fuse racing along the reflecting pool
from the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the day, Clinton was kept up to date on the initially untroubled
Y2K computer rollover and on events in a far-off Kremlin, where Boris Yeltsin,
an unlikely and sometimes uncertain partner, peacefully yielded the presidency
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and his wife, sitting with an audience of diplomats in the soaring,
arched-glass atrium of the Ronald Reagan Federal Building, listened as children
from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Nigeria and Russia asked for a new
century built on peace, prosperity, security, unity, and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For all the billions of people who came before us,'' said Clinton, ``it
has been left to this generation to lead the world into a new millennium, to use
our freedom wisely, to walk away from war and hatred toward love and peace.''

<HEADLINE> New Millennium Arrives in Argentina  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GRAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   USHUAIA, Argentina (AP) -- Thousands of new millennium revelers gathered at
the most inhabited southern tip of the world Friday to bid a spectacular welcome
to the new millennium amid showering fireworks and thumping electronic music.
</P>
<P>
	   Against a skyline of snow-clad mountaintops, partygoers braved whipping
winds and freezing temperatures to watch fireworks illuminate a blue-gray sky
over the Beagle Channel with hues of yellow, green, and red.
</P>
<P>
	   Ushuaia, the world's southernmost city some 1,945 miles south of the
Argentine capital of Buenos Aires and just 435 miles north of Antarctica, was
either a final destination or launching point for thousands of adventurous
millennium revelers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some celebrants arrived in private jets or chartered planes with ambitions
to travel to Antarctica. Others trekked to this city of 45,000 on motorbikes,
capping off an across the Americas journey to the most southerly point their
bikes could travel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wanted to ride to one of the world's most far-flung places for the
beginning of Year 2000,'' said Nat Crewe, a 28-year-old adventure biker who set
off from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska in August.
</P>
<P>
	   Four months and 17,000 miles later Crewe joined dozens of like-minded bikers
from Germany, England, Scotland, the United States and Canada at an
end-of-the-century party in Tierra del Fuego national park -- complete with
bonfires and spiced wine.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, hundreds of teen-agers gathered on the northern shores of the
Beagle Channel that slithers through the islands of the Tierra del Fuego
peninsula for a rave party. Electronic music blared over loudspeakers as they
writhed away the millennium's first hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside a turn-of-the-century jail which once housed some of the Argentina's
most notorious criminals, dozens of partygoers nibbled on $100-a-plate chicken,
crab, and pasta dinners.
</P>
<P>
	   Over 2,000 people boarded luxury liners in Ushuaia this week heading for
millennium festivities in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Blythe, owner of the Toronto-based tour group Marine Expeditions,
planned a 12-hour party across four boats at a sunken volcano in Antarctica --
with dancing and ice cutters to shuttle guests from boat to boat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We wanted the most unique, memorable party in the wildest place in the
world,'' he said as the ships pulled out of Ushuaia this week.

<HEADLINE> 5 Hostages Released at Kansas Bank  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. (AP) -- Two women -- one of whom said she was upset about losing
her job and had no hope for the future -- took a group of bank employees hostage
Friday, but released six of them after several hours of negotiations with
police.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-takers remained inside early Saturday, and police didn't know
whether other people were still in the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the bank employees inside the building had earlier called KMBC-TV and
said everyone was being treated well.
</P>
<P>
	   The employee was interrupted when one of the suspects took the phone and she
was upset because she had lost her job, her family and all hope for the future.
She said she would release the hostages if she could talk to a friend named
Sean.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once I talk to Sean, then I'll talk to them, that's when it all ends,''
the suspect said. ``I want to talk to Sean face-to-face first before I talk to
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, she yelled to the hostages, ``Are you being harmed?'' and
people in the background were heard saying ``No.''
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of injuries in the bank, and police said no shots had
been fired.
</P>
<P>
	   The women entered the Bank of America branch, a free-standing building in an
Olathe shopping district, as it was closing shortly after 5 p.m. on New Year's
Eve, FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one of the hostage-takers was armed, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With a SWAT team surrounding the building, police tried negotiating with the
women by phone. Officials said the women had abruptly broken off talks at least
once.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were tipped by a frantic call from inside the bank, Olathe Police Lt.
Larry Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The police department had increased the number of officers on patrol in case
of trouble New Year's Eve, and an officer was in the area when the call came in,
Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the standoff, one hostage walked outside the bank, retrieved
something from a car belonging to one of the suspects and went back inside,
Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials would not release further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Lanza said the incident was the Kansas City area's first hostage situation
at a bank in about nine years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've never seen two female bank robbers working as a team in Kansas
City,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Times Square Welcomes 2000  </HEADLINE>
   By G.G. LaBELLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Times Square celebrated New Year's Eve for the world Friday
in a wild street party that exploded when the millennium arrived in America. At
midnight, a flashing, glittering crystal ball dropped to a countdown from a
cheering, banner-waving crowd that flooded mid-town.
</P>
<P>
	   The 20th century passed into history with more than a million people in and
around the square. The crystal ball's descent in Times Square is traditional,
but the ball was newly designed for the millennium -- with 90 rotating pyramid
mirrors that sent lights dancing across the crowd below.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite warnings of terrorism, people had come from around the world to
greet 2000 in the place that Americans traditionally look to for the signal of a
new year.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 500 perfomers presented music, dance, light shows and giant puppets to
mark the New Year in all the world's time zones, and 17 New Year's Eves had gone
by -- from New Zealand in the Pacific to Bermuda in the Atlantic -- before it
was New York's turn.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese visitors watched pink confetti fashioned to look like cherry
blossoms drift down, marking the new year in Tokyo. Englishmen yelled as 2000's
arrival in London flashed onto the square's giant TV screens, and Argentines
waved their flags at the appropriate hour.
</P>
<P>
	   But at midnight in New York, with strobe lights flashing from the Waterford
crystal ball, it looked like an American New Year -- with revelers kissing,
dancing, blowing horns and breaking into Auld Lang Syne.
</P>
<P>
	   The $7 million party started when it was midnight in New Zealand, Fiji and
Tonga (dawn Friday in New York) and was to end with the start of a new century
in Western Samoa, French Polynesia and Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can feel our country here,'' Miwa Shinoda, a Japanese living in New
York, said as the cherry blossom confetti rained and the boom of traditional
Taiko drums echoed through the square at 10 a.m. -- midnight in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1,070-pound Waterford crystal ball heralding the new millennium descended
a 77-foot pole at midnight as millions watched on television.
</P>
<P>
	   The peaceful crowd swelled northward up Broadway toward Central Park, nearly
20 blocks from the ball's home at One Times Square. Four hours before midnight,
police said the Times Square area was filled to capacity. They provided no
official crowd count, but veteran observers said it easily exceeded 1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Zarar Aflam of London said police at 9 p.m. turned him away from 45th Street
and told him to head north about 20 blocks, were people were being allowed to
enter the celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm quite appalled with the system,'' Aflam said. ``We spent so much money
to come here. They've overdone it with the precautions. They've gone over the
top.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others were taking the crush of people more in stride.
</P>
<P>
	   Patty Goss, 36, who suffered a cerebral hemorrhage several years ago and
uses a wheelchair, flew alone from Springfield, Mo., to see the
once-in-a-lifetime event.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My friends thought I was kind of crazy to do this, and nobody wanted to
come with me, but this was my lifelong dream,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Goss was even nonchalant about the 30-degree weather -- wearing only a
short-sleeved T-shirt and a sport jacket, which was all she had after the
airline lost her luggage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm kind of cold, but I'm not freezing, and I wouldn't leave if it killed
me.''

	   SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- Ole Miss is making itself right at home in the
Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels, after letting a 21-3 halftime lead slip away, got a 39-yard
field goal by Les Binkley on the game's final play Friday night to beat Oklahoma
27-25.
</P>
<P>
	   Ole Miss (8-4) won its second straight Independence Bowl and fourth straight
bowl game. Oklahoma, making its first bowl appearance since 1994, wound up 7-5
despite a record-setting performance by quarterback Josh Heupel.
</P>
<P>
	   Duece McAllister, who scored two touchdowns and prevented another with a
hustling tackle after an interception, helped set up the Rebels' game-winning
drive with a 41-yard kickoff return after Oklahoma had taken the lead with its
third touchdown of the second half.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   Millions joyously packed the city streets of Europe and the Americas to join
in a worldwide welcome for the new millennium, ignoring fears of terrorist
attack and computer collapse to revel in a a shimmering spectacle of song, light
and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   From South Sea islands to the southernmost city in the world, from the
Eiffel Tower to New York's Times Square, they partied and prayed for a better
world.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop of a huge crystal ball in Times Square, a ritual almost as old as
the century, set off an explosion of fireworks, cheering and tears as the
millennium came to the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with choreographed spectacle came reminders Friday of the turmoil of
the dying century -- political upheaval in Russia and the dramatic end of a
hijacking in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Woven together by satellite TV, the world's nearly 200 countries, in their
24 time zones, became a jamboree of disparate cultures -- South Pacific
islanders singing Handel's ``Hallelujah'' chorus, Buddhist monks praying for
peace in Japan, a German choir singing in a church in Nazareth, Israel, and a
huge French-made bell tolling a welcome in Newport, Ky. for each time zone
entering 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Fireworks lighted up the skies over Sydney, Australia, and over Rome, where
Pope John Paul II gave thanks for humanity's triumphs and asked forgiveness for
its sins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What suffering, what dramatic events!'' the frail 79-year-old pontiff said
of the 1900s. ``But, also, what incredible achievements.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1 million people packed Times Square, ``crossroads of the world,''
for the biggest, splashiest American celebration, guarded by 8,000 police, some
equipped to deal with bombs and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, President Clinton helped stow artifacts of 20th century
America -- including Army dog tags and a public library card -- into a time
capsule to be opened at the 21st century's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, he led the nation in splashy celebrations and predicted humankind
will turn away from bigotry, oppression and poverty. ``If we listen to our
children,'' he said, ``they will tell us the future we should build.''
</P>
<P>
	   Humanity also breathed a little easier as the rolling wave of 1999-to-2000
date changes failed to awaken any immediate Y2K disruptions of the world's major
computer systems. Experts cautioned, however, that problems could still arise in
the next few days or even weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   But even on this most widely celebrated midnight in history, amid the
fireworks, prayers and revelry, old hatreds and unscripted events surfaced.
</P>
<P>
	   An hour before Tonga and Kiribati in the south Pacific became the first
countries to welcome 2000, Boris Yeltsin announced he was resigning the Russian
presidency to make way for Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia must enter the new millennium with new politicians, with new faces,
with new intelligent, strong, energetic people, and we who have been in power
for many years must go,'' the 68-year-old Yeltsin told his people over
television.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a gesture to democracy that would have been unimaginable until the
collapse of communism in the last years of the century -- a century of tumult
that began with world war, split the atom, spliced the gene and pitted East
against West in Cold War and proxy wars.
</P>
<P>
	   As Yeltsin was making his announcement, word came that the hijack drama in
Afghanistan had ended peacefully after eight days.
</P>
<P>
	   Both events highlighted the unpredictability of a world that has never
marched to the mathematical beat of a calendar. Those who inherit the new
century can expect huge strides in medicine to lengthen their lives, and in
communications to bring nations closer together. But genetic engineering and the
globalization of culture and commerce is expected to produce ethical dilemmas
and conflicts undreamed of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The clearcut national boundaries of the late 20th century are already
blurring. Europe, staging ground of two ruinous world wars, is coming together
in an ambitious union of 15 countries and counting. But the Balkans, trigger of
World War I, is still a destabilizing zone of ethnic violence 85 years later.
</P>
<P>
	   As if to illustrate the borderless nature of today's conflicts, a quiet
Pakistani enclave of New York woke up on the century's next-to-last day to the
spectacle of American law agents swarming through the streets hunting for
suspects in an alleged Arab terrorist plot.
</P>
<P>
	   The freeing of 155 hostages from a hijacked Indian Airlines jetliner,
innocent victims of a half-century struggle over Indian-controlled Kashmir, came
as the welcome for 2000 was in full swing.
</P>
<P>
	   The capitals of Europe, the continent that dominated the past millennium,
put on dazzling spectacles. From London to Lisbon, and Rome to Reykjavik,
1,000-year-old cathedrals and medieval citadels of trade were lit up by laser
lights and pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
	   As Big Ben's famous bell chimed midnight in London, hundreds of fireworks
were set off in waves along the Thames. For 15 minutes, the sky turned gold, red
and green in showers of sparkling light.
</P>
<P>
	   At midnight, Queen Elizabeth II toasted the new millennium with a glass of
champagne and kissed her husband, Prince Philip, on the cheek. They linked arms
with Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, and sang ``Auld Lang
Syne.''
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland, savoring the promise of peace after decades of political
and religious strife dating back to the 1600s, drew huge crowds to celebrations
in its main cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 2 million people massed in central Berlin. And even Albania, Europe's
poorest country, splurged on an hour-long fireworks show in Tirana, the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The people of a disintegrated Yugoslavia, winners and losers in a wave of
civil wars in the 1990s, welcomed the new millennium with hopes for new,
peaceful beginnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Bosnia reported no Y2K problems -- since its older computers were destroyed
in its 1992-95 war and the newer ones ane thought to be Y2K- proof.
</P>
<P>
	   The show began at 5 a.m. EST near the international date line in the south
Pacific, and swept westward, giving pause -- at the end of a speeded-up century
of shortened memory -- for reflection on the past.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tokyo, a focal point of celebrations was the Meiji Shrine, destroyed in
World War II and rebuilt, like much of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Signs of Asia's long-running conflicts haunted the festivities.
</P>
<P>
	   South Koreans gathered at their barbed-wire border with North Korea to pray
for peace, and more than 3,500 prison inmates, including two convicted North
Korean spies, were released in a millennium amnesty. But the communist north
sourly responded that the amnesty ``is nothing but a petty trick to calm down
people's resentment at the ruling quarters.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak marked the last day of
the century with a prediction that peace was coming to a country at war for 50
years. ``The decisive moment is very near, even within a few months, and we
should ready our hearts appropriately,'' he wrote in a newspaper article.
</P>
<P>
	   Yasser Arafat, leader of a Palestinian people homeless for 50 years,
promised statehood early in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   Bethlehem, Jesus' birthplace, greeted the new millennium with 2,000 doves
soaring above a floodlit Manger Square. Tens of thousands of Palestinians
cheered as fireworks lighted the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   In stark contrast, many streets of nearby Jerusalem were deserted. Orthodox
Jews, oblivious to the millennium hoopla, observed the 17th Sabbath of the
Hebrew calendar year 5760 at home with traditional Friday evening meals and
prayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent history -- South Africa's Nelson Mandela revisiting the prison cell
he occupied until 1990 -- became bound up in images of the ancient past --
Egypt's pyramids, built more than 2,000 years before the birth of Christ, or
hikers in the Grand Canyon descending through 120,000 years of geological strata
with every step they took.	   The Western calendar is the world's calendar in
its everyday business, but it is hardly a universal timekeeper. Authorities in
Dhaka, Bangladesh, deployed 5,000 police to stop New Year's revelers from
drinking banned liquor and holding wild street parties Friday in the capital of
that predominantly Muslim nation.
</P>
<P>
	   And, strictly speaking, the millennium doesn't really begin until 2000 is
over, as Arthur C. Clarke, celebrated author of the ``2001'' series of
science-fiction novels, reminded the world Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, I think it is a good excuse to make the whole of 2000 one long
party,'' the British-born author told the AP at his home in Sri Lanka. ``But
this is not the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
	   His analogy:
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the scale of your grocer's weighing machine began at 1 instead of 0,
would you be happy when he claims he had sold you 10 kilograms of tea? And it is
exactly the same with time. We will have had only 99 years of this century by
Jan. 1, 2000. We will have to wait until December 31, 2000, for the full
hundred.''

<HEADLINE> Heavy police presence at Times Square and environs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - As more than one million revelers streamed into Times
Square on Friday to ring in the new millennium, thousands of police officers
also gathered en masse at the Crossroads of the World to serve as a highly
visible deterrent to terrorist threats and other potential disasters.
<P>
	   By midnight, when the 1,070-pound New Year's crystal ball slid down the
flagpole at 1 Times Square, some 8,000 police officers were stationed in and
around the area - more than double the number during an ordinary New Year's Eve
celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 37,000 of the department's 40,000 officers were on duty, including
officers equipped with anthrax antidote kits in case of a biological terrorist
attack and officers hovering overhead in police helicopters.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of a possible terrorist strike against the city - and Times Square in
particular - were heightened this week after members of the Joint Terrorist Task
Force arrested a Brooklyn man, saying he had possible ties to an Algerian who
allegedly tried to smuggle explosives into the United States from Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   City and federal officials said they had no knowledge of a credible threat
against New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, during the hours leading up to the 24-hour Times Square
extravaganza, authorities locked mailboxes, bolted shut manhole covers, removed
trash cans and searched cars parked in nearby garages. Huge orange city
sanitation trucks blocked surrounding streets to prevent vehicles from reaching
Times Square. And police and fire officials set up tractor-trailer rigs parked
just off Times Square that are equipped with showers that can be used as
decontamination chambers.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also towed cars on nearby streets and authorities said they would
walk the crowd carrying hand-held metal detectors. Hundreds of other officers
were positioned in nearby subway stations, store doorways and hotel lobbies.
</P>
<P>
	   And at dawn, police began searching the bags of revelers as they herded them
into cordoned-off sections behind metal barricades along Broadway to watch the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
	   City officials, including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said repeatedly that the
city could not guarantee anyone's safety.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday morning at the city's command center in lower Manhattan, Giuliani
said he was optimistic that the celebration would go off without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be real quiet," Giuliani said about the dual threats of
terrorism and potential computer snafus that some thought might wreak havoc on
the city's traffic light, electricity, sewage and water systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the day, there was a spike in the number of bomb hoaxes,
including threats against the Verrazano Bridge, said Police Commissioner Howard
Safir.
</P>
<P>
	   At Times Square, police briefly evacuated a small area of 46th and 47th
streets near the Times Square visitors center when officers observed a red back
pack leaning against a building. Police found nothing dangerous in the backpack
and people were allowed back into the area about 15 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, at about 6 p.m., detectives noticed a man carrying handcuffs at a
parking garage on 53rd St., and after approaching him, spotted a shotgun in
plain view inside the vehicle. The man, identified as George James, 29, of
Saranac, Mich., was arrested and charged with criminal possession of a weapon.
The gun, which was loaded, was not licensed, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were at least five other arrests in the Times Square area, all for
minor incidents, said police.

<HEADLINE> Online auction pitches New York mastodon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PINE VALLEY, N.Y. (AP) - There were no takers for John Gilbert's
11,000-year-old mastodon skeleton as it sat on the eBay auction block.
<P>
	   But it was just as well - Gilbert would prefer that it goes to a museum or
other public display.
</P>
<P>
	   The bones were unearthed in September by a contractor who was digging a pond
in the back of Gilbert's house, located halfway between Elmira and Watkins Glen
in Chemung County.
</P>
<P>
	   "He came back and said, 'I got a dinosaur here. Come and look in the back of
my truck,"' said Gilbert, a retired air traffic control supervisor.
</P>
<P>
	   "I went out and there's this huge hip bone. We have horses, and I knew it
wasn't a horse," Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of excavation and analysis by Cornell University
paleontologists, it was determined that Gilbert had found a mastodon, a heavily
built elephant-like mammal with long tusks that became extinct about 10,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Paleontologist John Chiment said his team found about 200 of the mastodon's
220 bones, one of the more complete skeletons ever discovered.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert said he let friends talk him into putting the skeleton up for
auction on eBay. By asking an extravagant sum, they figured he might entice some
rich private collector. Gilbert said he actually plans to sell the bones to a
museum or university.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is something that shouldn't be hoarded," Gilbert said. "It should be
out where people can see it."
</P>
<P>
	   It used to be that prehistoric skeletons were typically donated to a museum
or local historical society, said Gay Malin, who does conservation and
restoration for the New York State Museum in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, private collectors and international museums - with the help of
old-fashioned and online auctions - have created a new marketplace for old bones
and fossils.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes it hard for those of us in museums where budgets are limited,"
Malin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Just how huge a market exists became clear in 1997 when the biggest, most
complete Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton ever found was auctioned off at Sotheby's
for $7.6 million. The bones were purchased by the Field Museum in Chicago, with
the help of donors that included McDonald's and Walt Disney World Resort.
</P>
<P>
	   Many paleontologists feared the bidding war set a dangerous precedent, Malin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, advances in technology have made old bones even more important to
scientists, who are just starting to use DNA analysis to find out more about
mastodons and other animals that have long been extinct.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Gilbert nor Chiment think that the mastodon skeleton will be worth
millions. More in the range of $25,000 to $150,000, Chiment said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lots of mastodon bones have been discovered around North America. Climate
change is suspected in the animal's extinction, but Chiment said it is
suspicious that both mastodons and mammoths disappeared about 10,000 years ago,
just as humans began spreading their territory.
</P>
<P>
	   DNA from the mastodon may be able to show evidence of a viral infection,
something that could have spread from the Paleo-Indians or their dogs. DNA
testing also could indicate whether the last animals died in a single
generation, perhaps from a catastrophic event.

<HEADLINE> Year 2000 partying goes deeper - down 156 feet to be exact  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HOWES CAVE, N.Y. (AP) - While thousands of New Yorkers were gazing at
fireworks as 1999 turned into 2000, some partiers in the rural hills of upstate
New York dropped off the face of the Earth - for real.
<P>
	   "We have 75 guests who are on the planet who will be in the planet at the
turn of the millennium," said John D. Sagendorf, general manager of Howe
Caverns, an underground maze of tunnels carved millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The popular tourist destination located about 30 miles west of Albany held a
champagne toast 156 feet underground after an evening of dinner and dancing
above, Sagendorf said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of $250 per person included the beef and shrimp dinner and a
special jacket for revelers to wear below where it's 52 degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the state, the doings were more traditional.
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester held the largest fireworks show in the city's history, a $50,000
extravaganza with sparkling lights and explosive bursts set to envelop downtown
starting at one minute before midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Fireworks were set off from five locations, the Rochester Philharmonic
Orchestra performed a free, sold-out concert and a projection television screen
broadcast live telecasts of celebrations from cities worldwide from a skyway
bridge above Main Street.
</P>
<P>
	   Citywide celebrations were also held in Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people were expected to celebrate at the Oneida Indian Nation's
Turning Stone casino, 35 miles east of Syracuse. The casino-convention
center-luxury hotel complex has a number of parties planned.
</P>
<P>
	   Parties weren't scheduled everywhere, though.
</P>
<P>
	   In the city of Auburn, officials planned to greet 2000 not with fireworks,
but with bagels and coffee.
</P>
<P>
	   A "Millennium Breakfast at Dawn" was scheduled for this morning at 6:30
a.m., followed by a 1.25 mile Millennial Y "2K" Race.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's on a relatively small scale compared to what other municipalities are
doing across the country and across the world, but we wanted to make sure we
didn't let the event pass us without celebrating," said Auburn Mayor-elect
Melina Carnicelli.
</P>
<P>
	   Town of East Fishkill Supervisor Peter Idema said his municipality, which
had originally decided to hold a New Year's Eve party for residents who live 50
miles north of New York City, canceled the idea due to a lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   "We received two calls and said, 'Forget it,"' said Idema, who believes many
people chose to stay home not out of fear but because it is a meaningful way to
start the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   Krista Gore and Mikhail Yefimenko did make meaningful plans for New Year's
Eve - to get married in Glens Falls, about 40 miles north of Albany. The
24-year-olds got engaged last Christmas and were able to book their wedding
reception at the Queensbury Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvette Smead and Brian Sesselman decided to marry two months ago and picked
a New Year's Eve wedding at the Hadley Town Hall west of Glens Falls with a
reception at the American Legion Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   "My father works for NiMo and he assured me that the power's not going to go
out," Smead said. "If it does, we've got plenty of candles."

	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With fireworks and rock concerts,
with protests and sad remembrances, the people of a disintegrated Yugoslavia
embraced the new century with hopes for new beginnings.
</P>
<P>
	   In this divided Kosovo city, ethnic Albanian and Serb leaders stood on a
bridge linking its two halves Friday and pledged to work toward uniting their
communities in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mitrovica will be a united town,'' the province's chief U.N.
administrator, Bernard Kouchner, said during a ceremony on the Ibar River span.
</P>
<P>
	   In nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina, another breakaway region of the former
Yugoslavia, revelers hugged, kissed and swilled champagne at the stroke of
midnight in Sarajevo, the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time since the end of the 1992-1995 Bosnian war, authorities
organized a public New Year's celebration on a square in downtown Sarajevo. It
featured a three-hour rock and folk concert.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgrade, capital of the diminished Yugoslavia, fireworks resounded and
new neon lights glared, but they could not cover up the gloom and uncertainty
gripping the Serbian people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Socialist and Communist Youth groups staged rock concerts in Belgrade,
at the main square and in front of the federal parliament building, but only a
few thousand in the city of 2 million turned up.
</P>
<P>
	   The scars from the 78-day NATO bombing campaign unleashed in March against
Yugoslavia, as punishment for President Slobodan Milosevic's bloody crackdown
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, remained painfully visible.
</P>
<P>
	   At the stroke of midnight, two reporters from independent news media were
married in the opposition-run town of Soko Banja in central Serbia, the Beta
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We wish all future couples will be married in freedom,'' said the groom,
Vojkan Ristic, a Beta reporter. His bride, Suzana Antic, of the daily newspaper
Danas echoed wishes that all Serbian towns will soon become ``free,'' a term
applied to those communities hoverned by opponents of President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Here in Kosovo, heavily armed French soldiers patrolled the Kosovoska
Mitrovica bridge, scene of frequent clashes between the city's two communities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are expecting quick results but just give us some time and you will
see,'' Kouchner said of achieving ethnic peace here.
</P>
<P>
	   Kouchner was joined by the city's ethnic Albanian leader, Bajram Rexhepi,
and Oliver Ivanovic, head of the smaller Serb community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must have courage, and we have to try to unify this town,'' Ivanovic
said. ``I hope that we will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rexhepi said he hoped ``that we will work together toward unifying this
city'' in the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, 30 miles southeast of here, thousands of
ethnic Albanians jammed the main street in front of the National Theater,
greeting the new millennium with fresh demands for the release of compatriots
held in Yugoslav jails following the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tonight, when the whole world is celebrating, thousands of Albanians are
being tortured in the cells of the Serb criminals,'' said Shukrije Rexha, a
protest organizer. ``Let us not forget tonight our beloved ones who are not with
us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians are believed still held in Yugoslav jails more
than six months after the Kosovo conflict ended with Milosevic's acceptance of a
Western peace plan after 78 days of NATO bombing.

<HEADLINE> New York braces for the millennium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Thousands of extra utility workers and emergency
personnel with generators and tanks of water at the ready reported no initial
problems statewide as the year 2000 arrived.
<P>
	   From Olean to Farmingdale the much feared Y2K bug was a dud, arriving with
lights on, dial tones and no serious mechanical disruptions shortly after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   State workers at the emergency operations center of the State Emergency
Management Office in Albany reported no problems shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   "Happy New Year, everybody!" said Ed Jacoby, SEMO director. "Now the work
begins or us."
</P>
<P>
	   Along the Canadian border, where fear of terrorism ran high in recent weeks,
no arrests were reported. But police closed the Thousand Island Bridge in
northern New York and traffic was being rerouted through the city of Ogdensburg,
120 miles north of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   State police told WTVH-TV in Syracuse that a car was being detained at the
scene, but neither state nor federal officers would immediately comment on the
situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Statewide, ground zero for Y2K preparations was a state-run underground
command bunker in Albany, which buzzed with activity Friday as 150 people
monitored the state's vital functions. Workers continued to take reports from
hospitals and utilities, but no Y2K-related troubles were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are still vigilant, there could still be problems, but we don't
anticipate any," said James Natoli, director of state operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "No state in America ... is more ready than we are to deal with any
potential problems that might come up tonight," said Gov. George Pataki, who
ends the century in the office held in 1900 by one of his idols, a 41-year-old
war hero named Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
	   The command center will remain staffed into the weekend, as will satellite
centers in places far afield as Canandaigua, Ray Brook and Farmingdale.
</P>
<P>
	   A key concern for state officials is making sure its sprawling power grid
continues to deliver electricity. The state's power utilities have each declared
themselves Y2K compliant, but thousands of extra workers were on duty overnight
at generating plants, electrical stations, gas pipelines and command centers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've done all our drilling, all our testing. We've completed our planning.
Now, we're just waiting and monitoring the world situation," said Mark Frank of
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. "We're confident that we'll encounter few, if any,
problems."
</P>
<P>
	   Niagara Mohawk scheduled about 1,000 additional workers - 10 times the
number of people who would ordinarily work a holiday weeknight. They included
radio-equipped technicians at 100 key substations from Olean to Ticonderga.
</P>
<P>
	   Just 17 of Niagara Mohawk's 1.3 million upstate customers were without
electricity at 7:30 p.m. - two in Buffalo, one in Schenectady, 12 in Utica and
two in the Adirondack Mountain hamlet of Silver Lake. Most were back on line by
10 p.m., Niagara Mohawk spokesman Gerald Rockower said from company headquarters
in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   The few disruptions were about half the norm for a New Year's Eve, Rockower
said, and there was only one reason - the mild weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's so good, it couldn't have been better weather if we had called for
it," Rockower said. "It's ideal. No winds knocking down lines and no road icing
causing cars to spin out."
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric spokesman Mike Power noted that isolated outages
due to a limb falling on a line or a car hitting a power pole are not uncommon
and that any outage overnight could be routine. Yet no power losses attributed
to Y2K or routine interruptions were reported through Friday evening in the
Rochester area, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic began an intensive around-the-clock watch Friday on its
telecommunications system.
</P>
<P>
	   The volume of telephone calls was heavier than normal for a New Year's Eve,
but the network was expected to handle the load with few if any delays, said
Bell Atlantic spokesman Cliff Lee.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've fixed, replaced or retired equipment," said Skip Patterson, who runs
Bell Atlantic's Year 2000 Program Office, "and we're confident Jan. 1 will be
just another day."
</P>
<P>
	   That refrain was common, but extraordinary precautions were taken just the
same:
</P>
<P>
	   -Albany International Airport had on hand a 1250 kilowatt mobile power
generator and a tank truck to supply water;
</P>
<P>
	   -University Hospital in Syracuse was bringing in its technical personnel to
watch over electronic systems;
</P>
<P>
	   -Keycorp was making extra deliveries of cash to its ATMs. However, bank
spokeswoman Therese Myers said had no evidence of a run on cash machines.
</P>
<P>
	   In Western New York, all was quiet as midnight approached. Officials said
there were no major problems at the border with Canada or in the city, where the
most serious mishap was a water main break.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would say it's even quieter than usual for a Friday night," said Harold
Litwin, chief of operations for police in Buffalo, which 100 years ago was a
bustling commercial center more populous than 12 states.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's dead," said a man selling hotdogs in front of the arena where the band
Bare Naked Ladies performed. "There's only about 8,000 people in there. We'll
get more tomorrow when Toronto comes to town to play the Sabres."
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester-based Wegmans Food Markets and rival Tops markets reported recent
increases in the sales of water, flashlights, canned soups, bathroom tissue,
cereals, baby food and other stables. At Wegmans, bags of charcoal were snapped
up at the same pace as in the peak barbecue summer season.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are stocking up in general but not to any unusual degree," said Jo
Natale, spokeswoman for the Wegmans Food Markets based in Rochester. "I wouldn't
characterize any of it as panic buying."
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds were large and problems were few at several "First Night" downtown
celebrations across the state. Most went off as planned, but as 13,000 revelers
began to filter into Binghamton's event, fire erupted in a downtown bar damaging
the tavern and an adjacent adult book store, reported the Binghamton Press &AMP;
Sun-Bulletin. No injuries were reported and the cause remained under
investigation. A couple acts had to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the newest First Night celebrations was in Saratoga Springs, near the
site of the Battles of Saratoga where 222 years ago America's citizen soldiers
shocked the world's most powerful empire and turned the tide of the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   In that city of 25,000 about 25 miles north of Albany, all 20,000 buttons
needed for First Night events were sold out for the first time in four years,
said police Sgt. Dan Noeker.
</P>
<P>
	   In the basements of local police stations and county office buildings,
emergency preparedness workers were on the job, missing parties and mostly
watching nothing happen, often with good cheer.
</P>
<P>
	   On the chalkboard of the Washington County Emergency Command Center,
"TEOTWAWKI" was written on a chalkboard, reported the Glens Falls Post-Star.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's this?" asked Pete Zayachek, coordinator of the county's emergency
medical response system.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an acronym for 'The End Of The World As We Know It'," laughed
Emergency Services Coordinator Toby Dusha.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Subdued as New Year Arrives  </HEADLINE>
   By NANCY ROBERTS TROTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Their party canceled and their city shaken by street
violence and fears of terrorism, many in Seattle observed the changing year
quietly with friends and family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We get to watch 22 hours of people in major cities party around their
major icons and we don't get to party around ours,'' said Zachary Lyons, 36.
</P>
<P>
	   Party plans were scaled back just days before New Year's Eve. The move
followed riots during World Trade Organization meetings a month ago and news
last month that the landmark Space Needle was a possible target for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   An all-day event that was to include a circus, a fire ceremony and
late-night dancing on the Seattle Center grounds was cut to just a few hours of
performances before center gates were locked at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Few people ventured out, and only sparse crowds of several hundred gathered
below the Space Needle. Some complained about having to leave the celebration
before midnight and a big fireworks show at the Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our plan was to go to Seattle Center to the fire ceremony and see the
fireworks,'' said Esme Hillman, 48. ``Now we'll just watch from our window and
some of our neighbors said they were going to be in the hall and yell, 'Happy
New Year.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Chain-link fences were erected around the 75-acre center grounds, and
security officers checked bags and asked for identification. Officials were
taking no chances after a 32-year-old Algerian was arrested in Port Angeles on
Dec. 14 and accused of trying to bring bomb-making materials into the country
from Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Huw Gilbert, at the Seattle Center for lunch, joked about the tightened
security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The honest reason we came here is because we wanted to say we came to
Seattle Center on New Year's Eve and ate a frankfurter before Armageddon,''
laughed Gilbert, 24.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Actually, I feel like I'm in the safest place in the city,'' he said,
remarking on all of the fencing and security. ``This is the best thing that's
happened to Rent-A-Fence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most people asked said Mayor Paul Schell made the right decision when he
canceled most of the celebrations. Bob Kendrick of Mercer Island said Seattle
probably wouldn't have changed its party plans if it hadn't been for the WTO
violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Absent the WTO, it would have been a celebration,'' said Kendrick, who
planned to spend the evening at home with his family. ``We are healing, but it's
going to take a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Times Square Welcomes 2000  </HEADLINE>
   By G.G. LaBELLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Times Square celebrated New Year's Eve for the world Friday
in a wild street party that exploded when the millennium arrived in America. At
midnight, a flashing, glittering crystal ball dropped to a countdown from a
cheering, banner-waving crowd that flooded midtown.
</P>
<P>
	   The 20th century passed into history with more than a million people in and
around the square. The crystal ball's descent in Times Square is traditional,
but the ball was newly designed for the millennium -- with 90 rotating pyramid
mirrors that sent lights dancing across the crowd below.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite warnings of terrorism, people had come from around the world to
greet 2000 in the place that Americans traditionally look to for the signal of a
new year.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 500 perfomers presented music, dance, light shows and giant puppets to
mark the New Year in all the world's time zones, and 17 New Year's Eves had gone
by -- from New Zealand in the Pacific to Bermuda in the Atlantic -- before it
was New York's turn.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese visitors watched pink confetti fashioned to look like cherry
blossoms drift down, marking the new year in Tokyo. Englishmen yelled as 2000's
arrival in London flashed onto the square's giant TV screens, and Argentines
waved their flags at the appropriate hour.
</P>
<P>
	   But at midnight in New York, with strobe lights flashing from the Waterford
crystal ball, it looked like an American New Year -- with revelers kissing,
dancing, blowing horns and breaking into Auld Lang Syne.
</P>
<P>
	   The $7 million party started when it was midnight in New Zealand, Fiji and
Tonga (dawn Friday in New York) and was to end with the start of a new century
in Western Samoa, French Polynesia and Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can feel our country here,'' Miwa Shinoda, a Japanese living in New
York, said as the cherry blossom confetti rained and the boom of traditional
Taiko drums echoed through the square at 10 a.m. -- midnight in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1,070-pound Waterford crystal ball heralding the new millennium
descended a 77-foot pole at midnight as millions watched on television.
</P>
<P>
	   The peaceful crowd swelled northward up Broadway toward Central Park, nearly
20 blocks from the ball's home at One Times Square. Four hours before midnight,
police said the Times Square area was filled to capacity. They provided no
official crowd count, but veteran observers said it easily exceeded 1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Zarar Aflam of London said police at 9 p.m. turned him away from 45th Street
and told him to head north about 20 blocks, where people were being allowed to
enter the celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm quite appalled with the system,'' Aflam said. ``We spent so much money
to come here. They've overdone it with the precautions. They've gone over the
top.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others were taking the crush of people more in stride.
</P>
<P>
	   Patty Goss, 36, who suffered a cerebral hemorrhage several years ago and
uses a wheelchair, flew alone from Springfield, Mo., to see the
once-in-a-lifetime event.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My friends thought I was kind of crazy to do this, and nobody wanted to
come with me, but this was my lifelong dream,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Goss was even nonchalant about the 30-degree weather -- wearing only a
short-sleeved T-shirt and a sport jacket, which was all she had after the
airline lost her luggage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm kind of cold, but I'm not freezing, and I wouldn't leave if it killed
me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dustin Landis drove in from Green Lane, Pa., with his wife and two
daughters, 4 and 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When they grow up and someone asks where they were on New Year's Eve of
the millennium, I just want them to be able to say, `Times Square,''' Landis
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Security was tight because of fears that terrorists might see the big crowd
as a dream target. Only a day earlier, a man living in Brooklyn was arrested as
an accomplice to a fellow Algerian caught in Washington state Dec. 14 trying to
bring explosives into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   City and federal officials said they knew of no credible threat against the
city.
</P>
<P>
	   But by midnight, some 8,000 police officers were stationed in and around the
Times Square area -- more than double the usual number on New Year's Eve. Some
officers were equipped with anthrax antidote kits in case of a biological
attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also locked mailboxes, welded manhole covers shut, removed trash cans
and searched cars parked in nearby garages. Huge orange city sanitation trucks
blocked surrounding streets to prevent vehicles from reaching Times Square.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby, tractor-trailers with showers that can be used as decontamination
chambers were set up.
</P>
<P>
	   Late in the morning Friday, police shouted out a bomb warning between 46th
and 47th Streets. But the abandoned red knapsack that alarmed police turned out
to be harmless.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes New Millennium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed the new millennium today by
invoking a hope for ``the triumph of peace and harmony'' in America and beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   Even has he greeted the 21st century, Clinton had warm words for the
expiring one. Invoking the memory of one of the century's towering figures,
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., Clinton proclaimed, ``Let freedom
ring!''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking on the stairs of the Lincoln Memorial moments before the National
Mall erupted in a blaze of fireworks, Clinton said, ``We Americans must not fear
change. Instead, let us welcome it, embrace it and create it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the story of the 20th century is the triumph of freedom, then let the
21st century be the triumph of freedom wisely used,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will require us to share with our fellow Americans, and increasingly
with our fellow citizens of the world, the economic benefits of globalization,
the political benefits of democracy,'' Clinton said in brief remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   With the famous statue of a sober-faced Abraham Lincoln peering down behind
him, the tuxedo-clad president was surrounded by some of America's brightest
entertainers from actor Will Smith to country singer Trisha Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As powerful as our memories are, our dreams must be even stronger,''
Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
	   As Clinton spoke, a flash of light rolled from the Lincoln Memorial, down
the Reflecting Pool and then up the Washington Monument at the other end. The
light rose up the monument, striking the top as the clock struck midnight and
fireworks burst high over the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the eternal destiny of America to remain forever young,'' Clinton
told an audience of tens of thousands.

    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The New Year arrived in Connecticut on Saturday
apparently as glitch-free as it had been elsewhere around the world.
<P>
	   As fireworks erupted over downtown Hartford and computers and clocks rolled
over to the new year, the state Emergency Operations Center at the Armory
recorded no early problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. John G. Rowland - hosting a Millennium ball two floors above the EOC
(attendance was mandatory for top state officials) - offered a toast.
</P>
<P>
	   "To continued peace in our great nation, continued prosperity in our great
state and to good health to all the families in Connecticut and all the great
gifts God has given us," Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Rowland had said the threat of Y2K problems could not be taken
lightly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people may say there was a little too much hoopla over the last
several weeks, but I'd rather be safe than sorry," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland planned a news conference early Saturday morning, once reports were
in from all regions.
</P>
<P>
	   John Wiltse, director of the state Office of Emergency Management, said
officials in the emergency operations center in the Armory basement had
monitored the New Year's rollover around the world throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiltse said his chief concern was the potential that too many people would
try making telephone calls at midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   "No system is designed to handle that type of load," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland also urged residents to avoid overloading the telephone system.
</P>
<P>
	   "Spread those calls out to your loved ones," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley International Airport conducted a series of pre-midnight tests on
airport operations, maintenance and security systems.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything is running as it should," said Steve Korta, an airport
administrator. "Things are going very well."
</P>
<P>
	   There were no problems with flights at 7 p.m. EST, which is midnight
Greenwich Mean Time or Universal Coordinated Time. GMT is the standard time that
the FAA uses to track planes.
</P>
<P>
	   There were few people at the airport Friday night. Some flights were
canceled because there weren't enough riders.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 400 representatives from key state agencies and utilities were
staffing the command post around-the-clock, beginning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim LaChance, a system restoration administrator with Northeast Utilities,
said the company had electricians at 50 substations in the state and extra line
crews standing by.
</P>
<P>
	   "If something happens, we're ready to react," he said. "Our confidence is
very high."
</P>
<P>
	   The state spent more than $100 million over the last two years to prepare
for the Y2K glitch - the inability of some computers to distinguish between the
years 1900 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Bigger problems may come from revelers who have overindulged, Rowland said.
More than half of the 1,048-member state police force were to be on call
overnight to handle accidents or pranksters, said Lt. Ralph Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland also stressed that not every power outage or computer glitch that
occurs in the coming days will be Y2K-related.
</P>
<P>
	   One glitch that was Y2K-related but not a result of the turnover was the
failure of a clock on the state's Web site that was supposed to count down the
hours until midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Department of Information Technology Commissioner Rock Regan said the
problem was minor, but the clock would be taken down.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's definitely something we don't want to be showing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Armory also was the site of a $600-per-couple Millennium Ball. About
1,000 people were expected at the gala, including top-level state agency leaders
who were required to attend.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland arrived in a black tuxedo with a silver bow tie to match the gloves
of his wife, Patricia. Mrs. Rowland wore a sleeveless white gown with
elbow-length gloves. The Rowlands were ushered in by the governor's foot guard.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarians Celebrate Year 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -- It was the first New Year that the state TV didn't
air a recorded address by the president.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, President Petar Stoyanov spoke live to thousands of people who
accepted his invitation to greet the new millennium in front of his downtown
headquarters in Sofia.
</P>
<P>
	   People streamed to the scene from all parts of this city of 1.5 million
despite heavy snowfall that snarled traffic. The celebration was held near the
capital's St. George church, which dates from the 4th century A.D.
</P>
<P>
	   Stoyanov chose the venue to underline the historical accent of the
festivities. Recovering from a decade of post-communist doldrums, Bulgaria, an
ancient Balkan nation, enters the new century with an invitation for accession
talks with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   The invitation was extended at the EU's Dec. 10 summit in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In human history, unlike in divine, miracles don't happen. They are made
-- with faith, hope and love and with a lot of work,'' Stoyanov said in his
address. ``Bulgaria's success in the next century is dependent on the active
participation of all Bulgarian citizens in public affairs.''

<HEADLINE> 5 Hostages Released at Kansas Bank  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. (AP) -- Two women -- one of whom said she was upset about losing
her job and had no hope for the future -- took a group of bank employees hostage
Friday, but released six of them after several hours of negotiations with
police.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-takers remained inside the suburban Kansas City bank late Friday
night, and police didn't know whether other bank employees were also inside.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the bank employees inside the building had earlier called KMBC-TV and
said everyone was being treated well.
</P>
<P>
	   The employee was interrupted when one of the suspects took the phone and she
was upset because she had lost her job, her family and all hope for the future.
She said she would release the hostages if she could talk to a friend named
Sean.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once I talk to Sean, then I'll talk to them, that's when it all ends,''
the suspect said. ``I want to talk to Sean face-to-face first before I talk to
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, she yelled to the hostages, ``Are you being harmed?'' and
people in the background were heard saying ``No.''
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of injuries in the bank, and police said no shots had
been fired.
</P>
<P>
	   The women entered the Bank of America branch, a free-standing building in an
Olathe shopping district, as it was closing shortly after 5 p.m. on New Year's
Eve, FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one of the hostage-takers was armed, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With a SWAT team surrounding the building, police tried negotiating with the
women by phone. Officials said the women had abruptly broken off talks at least
once.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were tipped by a frantic call from inside the bank, Olathe Police Lt.
Larry Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The police department had increased the number of officers on patrol in case
of trouble New Year's Eve, and an officer was in the area when the call came in,
Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the standoff, one hostage walked outside the bank, retrieved
something from a car belonging to one of the suspects and went back inside,
Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials would not release further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Lanza said the incident was the Kansas City area's first hostage situation
at a bank in about nine years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've never seen two female bank robbers working as a team in Kansas
City,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leads Nation Into 2000  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FEINSILBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With an extravagant fireworks display dancing up the
sides of the Washington Monument as the 21st century arrived in America,
President Clinton called on the nation to fear not the future but to ``welcome
it, embrace it and create it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our children are ready. Again the torch is passed to a new century of
young Americans,'' he said, speaking from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the
statue of the Great Emancipator peering over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   He had the closing words of the closing century -- and his speech may have
been one of the shortest he'd ever delivered. At midnight, he stopped, so lights
could parade up the side of the monument, against the backdrop of a spectacular
display of pyrotechnics. Thousands counted down as the monument was lit up,
segment by segment.
</P>
<P>
	   Relieved that technology was behaving itself, 300 stars from the worlds of
entertainment, business, government and academia dined with Clinton, his wife
and daughter at the White House and then joined the first family for the $12
million extravaganza at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   The famous statue of a sober-faced Lincoln peered down on the Clintons and
3,000 other invited guests sitting in a semi-circle around the stairs of the
monument and thousands of ordinary Americans crowded around the reflecting pool.
</P>
<P>
	   They applauded as actor Will Smith introduced a show of song, dance and even
poetry. Among the performers were Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, Bobby McFerrin
and some known only by one name -- Bono, Stomp, Slash and Usher.
</P>
<P>
	   Remarked one member of the audience, Marie Trotta, who runs a
Meals-on-Wheels program in Bellport, N.Y., ``We were a little more concerned
about terrorism than we were about Y2K, but we figured, what the heck, if you're
going to blow up, why not in Washington?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We Americans must not fear change; instead, let us welcome it, embrace it
and create it,'' Clinton declared in his last burst of oratory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the eternal destiny of America to remain forever young.''
</P>
<P>
	   And his prayer, he said, was that the story of the 21st century would be
``the triumph of freedom wisely used.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was the first president to bring in a new century since William
McKinley did so with far less pizzaz. This president started Millennium Day by
stowing Army dog tags, a public library card and other artifacts of 20th century
America into a time capsule to be opened at the end of the 21st.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton found a happy omen in the beautiful winter weather -- crisp but
clear. ``The sun is still rising on America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At nightfall he donned a tuxedo to dance into the new year and shook the
hands of dinner guests streaming into the White House. Actor Robert De Niro,
former boxing champ Muhammad Ali and rock star Bono were among the famed and
accomplished who came for the roast lamb dinner and champagne toasts.
</P>
<P>
	   One guest was former senator and astronaut John Glenn, with a prediction:
``Will humankind get to Mars in the next century? Oh yes, certainly.'' He wore
his congressional space medal on a ribbon around his neck.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing at the East Portico of the White House, the president; first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton in a floor-length black silk dress with rhinestone
buttons down its front; and daughter Chelsea, wearing a dark blue taffeta dress
and a stand-up collar, received their guests.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton offered three toasts-- to his guests, his wife and humanity's
``shared future.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``By far my most solemn prayer for this new millennium is that we will find
somehow the strength and wisdom in our hearts to keep growing together, first as
one America and then as one people on this ever-smaller planet we all call
home,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Next came the star-filled and fireworks-lit party for the throngs at the
foot of the Lincoln Memorial, a hallowed obelisk that stood like an exclamation
mark aglow in the century's waning moments.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, the plan was all-night dancing at the White House, ending with
breakfast at sun-up.
</P>
<P>
	   But all was not fun. Clinton had solemn words in a day filled with
millennium-conscious oratory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the new century, we may not be able to eliminate hateful intolerance,''
he said, ``but we will see the rise of healthy intolerance of bigotry,
oppression and abject poverty in our own communities and across the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   And for his final speech of the century, he quoted Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let us pledge,'' he said in his short prepared speech, ``that the new
millennium will bring, in the words of the Great Emancipator, 'a new birth of
freedom.'''
</P>
<P>
	   The White House called the finale ``an unforgettable midnight moment.''
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour show competed on television for the home audience with the
customary Times Square countdown.
</P>
<P>
	   One difference: In New York the ball of light was descending in the seconds
before midnight while here the white light of fireworks was cascading up the
555-foot Washington Monument, sparked by a fuse racing along the reflecting pool
from the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the day, Clinton was kept up to date on the initially untroubled
Y2K computer rollover and on events in a far-off Kremlin, where Boris Yeltsin,
an unlikely and sometimes uncertain partner, peacefully yielded the presidency
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and his wife, sitting with an audience of diplomats in the soaring,
arched-glass atrium of the Ronald Reagan Federal Building, listened as children
from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Nigeria and Russia asked for a new
century built on peace, prosperity, security, unity, and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For all the billions of people who came before us,'' said Clinton, ``it
has been left to this generation to lead the world into a new millennium, to use
our freedom wisely, to walk away from war and hatred toward love and peace.''

<HEADLINE> New York braces for the millennium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Thousands of extra utility workers and emergency
personnel with generators and tanks of water at the ready reported no initial
problems statewide as the year 2000 arrived.
<P>
	   From Olean to Farmingdale the much feared Y2K bug was a dud, arriving with
lights on, dial tones and no serious mechanical disruptions shortly after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   State workers at the emergency operations center of the State Emergency
Management Office in Albany reported no problems shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   "Happy New Year, everybody!" said Ed Jacoby, SEMO director. "Now the work
begins for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Along the Canadian border, where fear of terrorism ran high in recent weeks,
no arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just did a tour of all seven of the ports of entry, and it's all very
quiet," Winston Barrus, the acting district director of Immigration and
Naturalization Services in Buffalo, N.Y., said just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Thousand Island Bridge in northern New York was closed by police and
traffic was being rerouted through the city of Ogdensburg, 120 miles north of
Syracuse. State police told WTVH-TV in Syracuse that a car was being detained at
the scene, but neither state nor federal officers would immediately comment on
the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Statewide, ground zero for Y2K preparations was a state-run underground
command bunker in Albany, which buzzed with activity Friday as 150 people
monitored the state's vital functions. Workers continued to take reports from
hospitals and utilities, but no Y2K-related troubles were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are still vigilant, there could still be problems, but we don't
anticipate any," said James Natoli, director of state operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "No state in America ... is more ready than we are to deal with any
potential problems that might come up tonight," said Gov. George Pataki, who
ends the century in the office held in 1900 by one of his idols, a 41-year-old
war hero named Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
	   The command center will remain staffed into the weekend, as will satellite
centers in places far afield as Canandaigua, Ray Brook and Farmingdale.
</P>
<P>
	   A key concern for state officials is making sure its sprawling power grid
continues to deliver electricity. The state's power utilities have each declared
themselves Y2K compliant, but thousands of extra workers were on duty overnight
at generating plants, electrical stations, gas pipelines and command centers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've done all our drilling, all our testing. We've completed our planning.
Now, we're just waiting and monitoring the world situation," said Mark Frank of
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. "We're confident that we'll encounter few, if any,
problems."
</P>
<P>
	   Niagara Mohawk scheduled about 1,000 additional workers - 10 times the
number of people who would ordinarily work a holiday weeknight. They included
radio-equipped technicians at 100 key substations from Olean to Ticonderga.
</P>
<P>
	   Just 17 of Niagara Mohawk's 1.3 million upstate customers were without
electricity at 7:30 p.m. - two in Buffalo, one in Schenectady, 12 in Utica and
two in the Adirondack Mountain hamlet of Silver Lake. Most were back on line by
10 p.m., Niagara Mohawk spokesman Gerald Rockower said from company headquarters
in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   "We went through the rollover just fine. There were no problems anywhere in
our transmission system," Rockower said. The few disruptions were about half the
norm for a New Year's Eve, Rockower said, and there was only one reason - the
mild weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's so good, it couldn't have been better weather if we had called for
it," Rockower said. "It's ideal. No winds knocking down lines and no road icing
causing cars to spin out."
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric spokesman Mike Power noted that isolated outages
due to a limb falling on a line or a car hitting a power pole are not uncommon
and that any outage overnight could be routine. Yet no power losses attributed
to Y2K or routine interruptions were reported through Friday evening in the
Rochester area, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic began an intensive around-the-clock watch Friday on its
telecommunications system.
</P>
<P>
	   The volume of telephone calls was heavier than normal for a New Year's Eve,
but the network was expected to handle the load with few if any delays, said
Bell Atlantic spokesman Cliff Lee.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've fixed, replaced or retired equipment," said Skip Patterson, who runs
Bell Atlantic's Year 2000 Program Office, "and we're confident Jan. 1 will be
just another day."
</P>
<P>
	   That refrain was common, but extraordinary precautions were taken just the
same:
</P>
<P>
	   -Albany International Airport had on hand a 1250 kilowatt mobile power
generator and a tank truck to supply water;
</P>
<P>
	   -University Hospital in Syracuse was bringing in its technical personnel to
watch over electronic systems;
</P>
<P>
	   -Keycorp was making extra deliveries of cash to its ATMs. However, bank
spokeswoman Therese Myers said had no evidence of a run on cash machines.
</P>
<P>
	   In Western New York, all was quiet as midnight approached. Officials said
there were no major problems at the border with Canada or in the city, where the
most serious mishap was a water main break.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would say it's even quieter than usual for a Friday night," said Harold
Litwin, chief of operations for police in Buffalo, which 100 years ago was a
bustling commercial center more populous than 12 states.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's dead," said a man selling hotdogs in front of the arena where the band
Bare Naked Ladies performed. "There's only about 8,000 people in there. We'll
get more tomorrow when Toronto comes to town to play the Sabres."
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester-based Wegmans Food Markets and rival Tops markets reported recent
increases in the sales of water, flashlights, canned soups, bathroom tissue,
cereals, baby food and other stables. At Wegmans, bags of charcoal were snapped
up at the same pace as in the peak barbecue summer season.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are stocking up in general but not to any unusual degree," said Jo
Natale, spokeswoman for the Wegmans Food Markets based in Rochester. "I wouldn't
characterize any of it as panic buying."
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds were large and problems were few at several "First Night" downtown
celebrations across the state. Most went off as planned, but as 13,000 revelers
began to filter into Binghamton's event, fire erupted in a downtown bar damaging
the tavern and an adjacent adult book store, reported the Binghamton Press &AMP;
Sun-Bulletin. No injuries were reported and the cause remained under
investigation. A couple acts had to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the newest First Night celebrations was in Saratoga Springs, near the
site of the Battles of Saratoga where 222 years ago America's citizen soldiers
shocked the world's most powerful empire and turned the tide of the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   In that city of 25,000 about 25 miles north of Albany, all 20,000 buttons
needed for First Night events were sold out for the first time in four years,
said police Sgt. Dan Noeker.
</P>
<P>
	   In the basements of local police stations and county office buildings,
emergency preparedness workers were on the job, missing parties and mostly
watching nothing happen, often with good cheer.
</P>
<P>
	   On the chalkboard of the Washington County Emergency Command Center,
"TEOTWAWKI" was written on a chalkboard, reported the Glens Falls Post-Star.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's this?" asked Pete Zayachek, coordinator of the county's emergency
medical response system.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an acronym for 'The End Of The World As We Know It'," laughed
Emergency Services Coordinator Toby Dusha.

<HEADLINE> At the drop of a ball, new millennium arrives for America  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Times Square celebrated New Year's Eve for the world
Friday in a wild street party that exploded when the millennium arrived in
America. At midnight, a flashing, glittering crystal ball dropped to a countdown
from a cheering, banner-waving crowd that flooded mid-town.
<P>
	   The 20th Century passed into history with as many as two million people in
and around the square. The crystal ball's descent in Times Square is
traditional, but the ball was newly designed for the millennium - with 90
rotating pyramid mirrors that sent lights dancing across the crowd below.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite warnings of terrorism, people had come from around the world to
greet 2000 in the place that Americans traditionally look to for the signal of a
new year.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those shouting raucously at midnight were a group of tuxedo-clad men
from Seattle, where a city-sponsored millennial party was dropped for fear of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since they canceled the celebration in Seattle, I think we made a great
choice. I feel great," said one of the revelers, John Bridger-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 500 performers presented music, dance, light shows and giant puppets to
mark the New Year in all the world's time zones, and 17 New Year's Eves had gone
by - from New Zealand in the Pacific to Bermuda in the Atlantic - before it was
New York's turn.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese visitors watched pink confetti fashioned to look like cherry
blossoms drift down, marking the new year in Tokyo. Englishmen yelled as 2000's
arrival in London flashed onto the square's giant TV screens, and Argentines
waved their flags at the appropriate hour.
</P>
<P>
	   But at midnight in New York, with strobe lights flashing from the Waterford
crystal ball, it looked like an American New Year - with revelers kissing,
dancing, blowing horns and breaking into Auld Lang Syne.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said up to 2 million people may have crowded into
midtown Manhattan. The peaceful crowd swelled northward up Broadway toward
Central Park, nearly 20 blocks from the ball's home at One Times Square. Police
said the area was filled to capacity but gave no official crowd count.
</P>
<P>
	   The $7 million party started when it was midnight in New Zealand (7 a.m.
Friday in New York) and was to end with the dawn of a new century 24 hours later
in Western Samoa and Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Island (6 a.m. Saturday New York
time).
</P>
<P>
	   "We can feel our country here," said Miwa Shinoda, a Japanese living in
Manhattan, as the cherry blossom confetti rained and the boom of traditional
Taiko drums echoed through the square at 10 a.m. - midnight in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   But this was, after all, Times Square U.S.A., and lots of Americans wanted
to share in person in the falling of the 1,070-pound Waterford crytal ball
heralding the new millennium that millions of others watched on television.
</P>
<P>
	   By 5:30 a.m., a crowd of hundreds had gathered to be a part of it in New
York, New York. At 7 a.m., a shouted count-down arose as the ball, with its 504
crystal triangles, was lighted and made its journey up the 77-foot flagpole atop
the building at One Times Square.
</P>
<P>
	   The visitors were not stopped by talk that a big crowd would be the dream
target for a terrorist wanting to deliver a terrible message just opposite the
celebration's theme - the Unity of Mankind.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrest of a man suspected of terrorist links on Thursday in Brooklyn
added to the tension. At midmorning Friday, police issued a bomb warning but the
abandoned knapsack that set it off turned out to be harmless.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowds kept coming. Times Square was the place to be, as Dustin Landis
said after driving in from Green Lane, Pa., with his wife and two daughters, 7
and 4.
</P>
<P>
	   "When they grow up and someone asks where they were on New Year's Eve of the
millennium, I just want them to be able to say, 'Times Square,"' Landis
explained.
</P>
<P>
	   A British woman wished she had brought her family, too. Caroline Tavernor of
Nottingham wept as England's celebration came, saying she missed her 4
1/2-year-old. But she quickly regained her composure.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the chance of a lifetime, and I'm having fun," Tavernor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Times Square did not disappoint, with its own brand of flash and kitsch,
with echoes of its role in history and images of the 20th Century.
</P>
<P>
	   The flash came from the giant neon signs, and the kitsch from African
immigrants who usually hawk jewelry but on this day dealt in foam rubber 2000
tiaras and oversized 2000-shaped eyeglasses where the eyes stare out through the
central O-Os.
</P>
<P>
	   A giant Kodak sign flashing pictures of America supplied the history.
Suddenly there was a young, pencil-thin Frank Sinatra before the microphone,
looking much like the did when he played the Paramount Theater in Times Square
back in 1942.
</P>
<P>
	   He brought out the bobby-soxers whose screams became an echo of the
century's music - from Ol' Blue Eyes to Elvis to the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not long after Sinatra rose to fame that Times Square saw its other
big party. An estimated 2 million had crowded into and around the square on Aug.
14, 1945, at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   How times have changed was apparent Friday as time ticked toward the new
millenium. At 47th Street, a building had room for giant neon ads for both
America's Cadillac and Japan's Suntory whiskey.

<HEADLINE> Times Square marks New Year - every hour on the hour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The gleaming crystal ball festooned with colored lights
and mirrors descended from the sky into a packed Times Square filled with
approximately two million gleeful revelers celebrating the last seconds of the
millennium.
<P>
	   Directly around the square, tens of thousands of people huddled in the
winter chill on Friday as confetti fell like thick snow. They cheered, kissed,
and hugged in excitement while waving multicolored balloons. Some had camped
out, waiting for the moment for as long as two days.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since I was a little boy, I wanted to come to New York for the millennium
and now my dream has come true," said Tiago Depuydt of Veurne, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Vasquez, 20, said he worried about terrorism but still drove from
Minneapolis, Minn., with several of his friends and arrived around lunchtime
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great to still be alive," Vasquez said. "I want to tell my grandkids
that we were here."
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudy Giuliani said he was relieved because there were worries "right
up to the last minute" but he cited the cooperation of everyone in New York for
a peaceful evening.
</P>
<P>
	   "Its the most diverse city in the world," Giuliani said. "It shows that we
can get along, we can have a great celebration, we can do it peacefully. It's a
great moment for the city of New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the evening, thousands of people poured into Times Square, where
the crowd alternated between somber pensiveness and jubilant expectation.
</P>
<P>
	   Around 9 p.m., Zarar Aflam, who came to Times Square from his London home,
said police turned him away from 45th Street and told to head north about 20
blocks, were people were being allowed to enter the celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm quite appalled with the system," Aflam said. "We spent so much money to
come here. They've overdone it with the precautions. They've gone over the top.
I don't think anything will happen."
</P>
<P>
	   But others simply enjoyed the festivities, especially the hourly countdowns
as a new year was celebrated somewhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "Three ..... two ..... one!!!," yelled Greg Packer just seconds before 4
p.m. - already the New Year in almost half the world. And Times Square, the
crossroads of the world, was marking New Year for everyone - on the hour every
hour for 24 consecutive hours.
</P>
<P>
	   By 6 p.m., it was the year 2000 from East Africa to Russia and points west.
</P>
<P>
	   Packer said he was counting down for "Russia, Georgia, Iraq, Iran, Kenya -
they're all Arab countries America doesn't like - except for Russia."
</P>
<P>
	   But what Packer lacked in geographical knowledge, he made up in enthusiasm:
He'd been camped out near West 46th Street since 9 a.m. Thursday, making house
in a pen behind metal police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've made new friends from Australia," said the 36-year-old highway
maintenance man from Huntington N.Y. as he pointed to a man nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind him, a man added, "London!"
</P>
<P>
	   "Chicago!" a woman piped in.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to go to sleep, but the spirit is keeping me up," said Packer.
</P>
<P>
	   The closer one got to the area near where the ball drops, the more
bleary-eyed and dirty the crowd looked, with a stench rising from a layer of
garbage that included pizza boxes and soft drink containers.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Rufino, a 19-year-old from Washington, D.C., was one of about 50
Guardian Angels who arrived from around the country and overseas, offering their
assistance. The group planned to wait until midnight and then walk out toward
New York's outer boroughs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's more under control than I thought," said Rufino, who added he hoped to
attend again next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Patty Goss, 36, who suffered a cerebral hemorrhage several years ago and is
confined to a wheelchair, said she flew alone from Springfield, Missouri, and
the airline lost all her luggage.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm wearing what I had on," she said - a short sleeved T-shirt and a sport
jacket.
</P>
<P>
	   "My friends thought I was kind of crazy to do this, and nobody wanted to
come with me, but this was my lifelong dream," she said. "I'm kind of cold, but
I'm not freezing, and I wouldn't leave if it killed me."
</P>
<P>
	   Clutching a disposable camera, Goss said: "I'll bring back the pictures and
I'll say to my friends 'Naa naaa naaa naaa naaaaah naaa. I was there."'

<HEADLINE> UPS Plane Makes Emergency Landing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLIANCE, Neb. (AP) -- A DC-8 United Parcel Service jet was forced to make an
emergency landing Friday in western Nebraska after an instrument screen blanked
out and smoke entered the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments before the crew detected the smoke, they had joked about the
possible perils of the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope we all don't disappear when it rolls over here,'' Capt. Joe Stidham
said he told an air traffic controller before the plane's troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   Then smoke appeared, and the plane made an emergency landing at the Alliance
Municipal Airport. The three crew members on board were not injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The problems were not believed to be Y2K-related, but the crew was unsure of
the cause, Stidham said. After the smoke entered the cockpit, the crew put on
oxygen masks and radioed the nearest airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane had left Louisville, Ky., and was due to arrive in Portland, Ore.

<HEADLINE> Calm reported inside prisons as 2000 arrives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - No organized protests were reported in the state's
prisons as the New Year arrived early Saturday, prison officials said.
<P>
	   "Everything is still quiet," prison spokesman James Flateau said just after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   For weeks, rumors have persisted that some prisoners were planning to
protest Pataki administration parole and prison labor policies with a strike or
some other demonstration beginning on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Flateau said the medium- and minimum-security facilities, where inmates
sleep in dormitory-style settings, were quiet. Inmates in the state's 16
maximum-security prisons were locked overnight in their cells and would not be
called out for breakfast until Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll monitor that in the morning and see what happens," Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, all 20 of the state Department of Correctional Services' SWAT
teams would continue to stand by Saturday at regional staging areas around the
state ready to respond to reports of prison disturbances. The teams, each with
about 50 officers, were also available to help local officials deal with
problems if they are called in by state emergency management officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The only two untoward incidents reported Friday by prison officials were
caused by animals.
</P>
<P>
	   A wild turkey flew into the path of a bus transporting inmates to Auburn on
the state Thruway about 35 miles southeast of Rochester, shattering the
windshield on one side and giving the driver and another guard minor injuries.
No inmates were hurt or tried to get away, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Beacon, an inmate working on kitchen detail at the Fishkill Correctional
Facility was bitten by a cat. The animal could not be found, and the inmate was
taken to a Poughkeepsie hospital so he could begin to receive rabies shots,
prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, clergymen and community leaders called on prison administrators
to address inmates' grievances to defuse possible disturbances.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly formed Coalition on Prison Affairs said it is not supporting the
rumored disturbances by inmates "whatever it is they're going to do," the Rev.
Herbert Daughtry of the House of the Lord Church in Brooklyn said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are concerned that people are not hurt," Daughtry, a leader of
Brooklyn's black community, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Daughtry called on state officials to address those inmate complaints they
can correct and to explain clearly to prisoners why they cannot address others.
</P>
<P>
	   "We humans have a way of being Monday morning quarterbacks, after things
explode, we say we could have done this or that differently," Daughtry said.
"Let's be proactive this time. If there are things that can be done with the
inmate population and the authorities, let's do them and let's do them now."
</P>
<P>
	   Other members of the Coalition on Prison Affairs are the Rev. Al Sharpton;
state Assemblyman Roger Green of Brooklyn; Eric Adams, co-founder of 100 Blacks
in Law Enforcement, and the president of the Dynamic of Leadership, Charles
Barron.
</P>
<P>
	   Flateau said administrators have not seen formal demands by would-be
demonstrators, and he noted that many of the things inmates appear to be
complaining about such as state parole policies cannot be altered by the state
Department of Correctional Services.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are very few issues here over which the prison system has any
control," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each prison in the state also had between 15 and 20 extra officers on duty
to cope with any problems, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The corrections department is on a heightened state of alert and prepared
to deal with any eventuality which may occur," Gov. George Pataki said at a news
conference at the state's Y2K emergency command center.
</P>
<P>
	   Two maximum-security prisons remained locked down as they have been all week
- Sing about 30 miles north of New York City and Green Haven about 50 miles
north of the city. Inmates there were being confined to their cells except to
see visitors and receive emergency medical care.

<HEADLINE> Y2K bug doesn't bite in NYC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - There was no bite from the Y2K bug.
<P>
	   At midnight at the city's $13 million emergency operations center, just
after the ball dropped in Times Square to mark the arrival of the year 2000,
Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota pronounced "Y2K is Y2-OK."
</P>
<P>
	   He said all of the city's crucial computer systems appeared to be
functioning, including ATM machines, credit card devices and other financial
services. The 911 system was running as well, and only the normal number of
arrests were being reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 200 or so officials gathered at 7 World Trade Center shook hands
and congratulated one another as the ball dropped and the lights stayed on. Many
had worked for months as part of New York's $350 million effort to combat any
Y2K-related computer problems.

<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The New Year arrived in Connecticut on Saturday
as glitch-free as it had been elsewhere around the world.
<P>
	   As fireworks erupted over downtown Hartford and computers and clocks rolled
over to the new year, the state Emergency Operations Center at the Armory
recorded no sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. John G. Rowland - hosting a Millennium ball two floors above the EOC
(attendance was mandatory for top state officials) - offered a toast.
</P>
<P>
	   "To continued peace in our great nation, continued prosperity in our great
state and to good health to all the families in Connecticut and all the great
gifts God has given us," Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference about 40 minutes later, Rowland confirmed that midnight
had passed uneventfully.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will continue to keep our eyes open over the next day and into Monday,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Wiltse, director of the state Office of Emergency Management, said
officials in the emergency operations center in the Armory basement had
monitored the New Year's rollover around the world throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiltse said his chief concern was the potential that too many people would
try making telephone calls at midnight. But no major phone system problems were
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Northeast Utilities and the Millstone Nuclear Power plant also reported no
problems in the transition.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley International Airport conducted a series of pre-midnight tests on
airport operations, maintenance and security systems.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything is running as it should," said Steve Korta, an airport
administrator. "Things are going very well."
</P>
<P>
	   There were no problems with flights at 7 p.m. EST, which is midnight
Greenwich Mean Time or Universal Coordinated Time. GMT is the standard time that
the FAA uses to track planes.
</P>
<P>
	   There were few people at the airport Friday night. Some flights were
canceled because there weren't enough riders.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 400 representatives from key state agencies and utilities were
staffing the command post around-the-clock, beginning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The state spent more than $100 million over the last two years to prepare
for the Y2K glitch - the inability of some computers to distinguish between the
years 1900 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Bigger problems may come from revelers who have overindulged, Rowland said.
More than half of the 1,048-member state police force were to be on call
overnight to handle accidents or pranksters, said Lt. Ralph Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Armory also was the site of a $600-per-couple Millennium Ball. Rowland
arrived in a black tuxedo with a silver bow tie to match the gloves of his wife,
Patricia. Mrs. Rowland wore a sleeveless white gown with elbow-length gloves.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Quits, Is Granted Immunity  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY RENFREW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Pleading for forgiveness, Boris Yeltsin resigned Friday as
president, clearing the way for his hand-picked successor to take Russia into a
new age and fix the mistakes he admitted having made through eight chaotic
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin, apologizing for failing to fulfill Russians' dreams for a better
life, turned over power to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the country's most
popular politician.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin took control of the government and will serve as acting president
until elections are held in 90 days. The change came just two weeks after
Putin's supporters scored a surprise triumph in parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Putin's first acts was to sign a grant of immunity to Yeltsin,
inviting speculation that a deal had been made to entice Yeltsin into early
retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Forgoing New Year's celebrations, Putin then flew to Chechnya early Saturday
to hand out awards to Russian servicemen and to remind Russians why the military
is fighting in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not simply about restoring honor and dignity to the country, no,''
Putin told the troops in Gudermes, a city east of the capital of Grozny that
Russian troops took several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is about more serious things. This is about how to bring about the
end of the breakup of Russia, that is your fundamental goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's confident handling of the war in Chechnya and no-nonsense manner
appeals to many Russians, who want take-charge leadership to tackle the nation's
enormous economic, political and social problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking grim and emotional, Yeltsin said he was stepping down immediately to
give Putin the best chance of winning the presidential elections. Putin, already
the top candidate to replace Yeltsin, now has a huge advantage that his rivals
probably won't be able to counter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am stepping down ahead of term,'' Yeltsin said during an address on
state television, speaking in front of a gaily decorated New Year's tree and a
blue, red and white Russian flag with a golden Russian eagle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I understand that I must do it, and Russia must enter the new millennium
with new politicians, with new faces, with new intelligent, strong, energetic
people, and we who have been in power for many years must go,'' he said, making
a surprise announcement during what was supposed to be a New Year's address.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin, who has ruled Russia with a strong hand since 1991 and was due to
step down in June, said he deeply regretted not meeting people's expectations in
the post-Soviet period.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to beg forgiveness for your dreams that never came true. And also I
would like to beg forgiveness for not having justified your hopes,'' said
Yeltsin, who rarely admits errors. ``I beg your forgiveness for having failed to
jump in one leap from the gray, stagnant, totalitarian past to the light, rich
and civilized future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, a former KGB officer, quickly assumed control of the government and
said he would continue as prime minister. Yeltsin turned over to Putin the
so-called nuclear suitcase controlling Russia's nuclear arsenal and the pen he
used to sign key measures.
</P>
<P>
	   The transition of power is likely to be smooth, with no destabilizing
effects. Russia has a decade of democratic elections under its belt, and
political parties were already preparing for the presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, President Clinton paid tribute to Yeltsin for dismantling the
communist system and putting a democratic structure in place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I liked him because he was always forthright with me,'' Clinton said. ``He
always did exactly what he said he would do. And he was willing to take chances
to try to improve our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin quickly signed a decree giving Yeltsin immunity from criminal
prosecution, a lifetime pension and a government country home, bodyguards and
medical care for him and his family.
</P>
<P>
	   But while the immunity will be seen by some as a key reason for Yeltsin's
decision, the deal did not include his family, which has been linked to
corruption allegations in recent months. Previous prime ministers, who also had
their eye on the presidency, had talked of such a deal for Yeltsin, who is also
concerned about Communist efforts to jail him for breaking up the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing of Yeltsin's resignation probably had more to do with
parliamentary elections less than two weeks ago, in which pro-Putin centrist
parties did unexpectedly well in parliamentary elections. With the backing of
the state media and showing strength in public opinion polls, Putin has a huge
advantage in the presidential election, expected to be held on March 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said Friday there would be no change in government policies, including
foreign relations. But he said efforts to modernize and strengthen the weakened
military would continue and the state would ensure stability.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The freedom of speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom of the press,
the freedom of property rights -- these fundamentals of civilized society --
will be reliably protected by the state,'' Putin said in a New Year's address to
the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Many in the West view Putin's rise with concern, and domestic critics claim
he wants to restore authoritarian controls because of his KGB past. He makes no
secret of wanting to revive Russia as a great power, but has also sought to
preserve the ties Yeltsin cultivated with the West.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin's resignation shocked ordinary Russians, but caused little
commotion. Most people were busy with preparations for New Year's Eve, the
country's most important holiday. The news dominated Russian newscasts, but with
few exceptions television stations did not interrupt their holiday programs for
detailed coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian stock market jumped to a 15-month high on the news, with dealers
saying hopes of strong new leadership would boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To be honest, I didn't think anything of Yeltsin lately,'' said
27-year-old teacher Lena Matrosova. ``He was doing nothing as president. There
was just this person we had, but he did not mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin's political opponents welcomed the president's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Yeltsin party of power has fallen,'' said Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov, who came in second in 1996 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Plagued for years by heart and other health problems, Yeltsin was often ill
and out of sight during his second term. But he continued to dominate Russian
politics nonetheless. He easily defeated a Communist-led effort in May to
impeach him and had dismissed four prime ministers in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin said he saw no point in staying in power for the last six months of
his term because Putin was well-suited to take over. He said he was confident
Russia would not return to its authoritarian past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I shouldn't be in the way of the natural course of history,'' Yeltsin
said. ``To cling to power for another six months when the country has a strong
person worthy of becoming president -- why should I stand in his way? Why should
I wait? It's simply not in my character.''

<HEADLINE> Casinos host New Year's Eve celebration of gambling and music  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) - Scott Alford had his own strategy for ringing
in the Year 2000 at Foxwoods Resort Casino: He planned to pump quarters into a
slot machine at the stroke of midnight and hope for a Y2K glitch.
<P>
	   "Everybody here is thinking that something will go wrong at midnight and the
machine will pay out a lot of money," said Alford, a social worker from Mount
Vernon, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Alford's hopes were dashed when, at midnight and beyond, the slot machines
functioned normally. No Y2K bugs were evident.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm still losing," said Fred Rehkop, who stopped playing the slot machiness
at midnight just long enough to kiss his wife, Gigi.
</P>
<P>
	   At a nearby roulette table, the play went straight through midnight, without
stopping even for a second. Bernie Hauser Jr., a Foxwoods employee who was
supervising the roulette tables, said one player was in the middle of a payout
so the play continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the gamblers in the room stopped long enough to shout out the
10-second countdown to midnight. They blew into noisemakers, cheered and erupted
in loud applause as the clock struck midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Crooner Barry Manilow, who was entertaining high-rollers down the hall, sang
"Auld Lang Syne." His song was piped into the gaming rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   The celebrating started much earlier in the evening.
</P>
<P>
	   By 10 p.m., the gaming floors were filled with revelers and gamblers hoping
lady luck would be kind to them as they welcomed the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Some gamblers put their money on '00,' for the Year 2000, hoping it was
their lucky number. For at least one man, it was. He won $2,000 after the
roulette ball landed on '00' several times, said Walter Swepson, a gaming
supervisor at the roulette wheels.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had 11 people bet on '00' tonight," Swepson said. "People said, "It's
for 2000 coming."
</P>
<P>
	   The Mashantucket Pequots estimated that about 70,000 people spent some part
of New Year's Eve at Foxwoods, trying their luck at the gaming tables or taking
in one of a half dozen parties.
</P>
<P>
	   As they waited for Manilow to start his show, Bernice and Ray Roccon of
Stonington danced a smooth fox trot to a warmup band's rendition of Frank
Sinatra's "Summer Wind."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a great celebration," said Bernice, 70.
</P>
<P>
	   At another private party, high-rollers were given foot-high chocolate
millennium clocks surrounded by petit fours.
</P>
<P>
	   At Connecticut's other American Indian casino, in Montville, the Mohegans
expected about 20,000 people to celebrate at the Mohegan Sun with laser light
shows, an all-night dance party and a free concert by the R&AMP;B group Tower of
Power.
</P>
<P>
	   Foxwoods, which opened in 1992, is the largest casino in the Western
Hemisphere, with 315,000 square feet of gaming space and more than 5,500 slot
machines. Since 1994, its slot machine revenues have grown from $375.5 million
to $694 million in Fiscal Year 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The 180,000-square-foot Mohegan Sun opened in 1996, and has more than 3,000
slot machines. Slot revenues have grown from $320.1 million in its first fiscal
year to $484.2 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Foxwoods reserved 40 cases each of Dom Perignon and Moet for its
high-rollers, while thousands of bottles of lower-priced bubbly were stacked in
a tractor-trailer waiting to be poured for the rest of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Year's Eve is our Super Bowl. We're popping all the corks and pulling
out all the stops to give our guests a great time," said Bruce MacDonald, a
Foxwoods spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Elevators and escalators at Foxwoods were shut down for a 30-minute period
just before and after midnight as a precaution in the event of a Y2K power
outage.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before midnight, champagne was passed out to gamblers for a New Year's
toast.
</P>
<P>
	   Cities and towns across Connecticut also welcomed 2000 with celebrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenwich residents rang in the new year about five hours early. They
celebrated with Greenwich's sister city in England, where the clock struck
midnight at 7 p.m. Eastern time. A live simulcast of the British celebration was
shown on two large screens.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizer Ian Kerr, a native of England who now lives in Greenwich, Conn.,
said the event took one and a half years of planning, including coordinating
with the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartford started even earlier than Greenwich. Fireworks exploded over the
city at 6 p.m. in a show designed for children unable to stay up until midnight.
The city planned a second fireworks show at that time.
</P>
<P>
	   Metro-North Railroad added trains traveling between New Haven and New York
to handle the load of passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Department of Transportation spokeswoman Sue Reynolds said there would be 43
extra trains going from New Haven to New York and 71 additional trains from New
York back to New Haven.

<HEADLINE> Jersey just fine as new millennium arrives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Is that all?
<P>
	   The new millennium arrived, and the world didn't end. Computers rolled over
effortlessly. There were dial tones on telephones. The lights stayed on, and
planes didn't fall from the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after midnight, officials at the state's emergency command center in
Ewing Township reported no Y2K-related problems at all. Electric, water and
natural gas systems all operated normally, and folks who had stocked up on
bottled water, batteries and groceries in anticipation of widespread chaos were
feeling somewhat foolish.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was all a bunch of superstition," said Sam Kandous of Paterson, who was
walking on the Atlantic City Boardwalk. "It was just to scare the people, but
also to protect the people so they wouldn't go out. They shouldn't have scared
people like that."
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Levy, Atlantic City's Director of Emergency Management, also viewed Y2K
in hindsight as a big bore.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a wonderful non-event," he said. "We sat up here bored, waiting for
something to happen. We're thankful it didn't, but it's better to be prepared."
</P>
<P>
	   The fears were due to the unpredictable nature of computer systems' rollover
from 1999 to 2000, and fear that they would misinterpret the date as 1900, with
unknown consequences. As it turned out, the fears were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been absolutely nothing," said Lt. Jim Dehart, the northern
regional coordinator for the state Office of Emergency Management. "I've had not
one call. It's been very quiet."
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Carson Dunbar, head of the State Police, concurred.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything's calm, and I'm happy," he said at 12:30 a.m. Saturday. "We
planned for a long period of time and our hope was we would not have to put our
people into action. We're gratified that's what happened."
</P>
<P>
	   NJ Transit halted its trains shortly before midnight so it could check its
computer systems, rail cars and overhead wires for potential problems. Nothing
was found, and the trains were rolling again at 12:10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think I'm surprised," executive director Jeffrey Warsh said. "I
think relieved is a better way to say it."
</P>
<P>
	   As the clock struck 12 in New Jersey, the head of the North American
Electric Reliability Council could hardly have been more pleased with how the
power grid was performing in the state and across the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's not a single glitch anywhere," said council president Michael Gent.
"As far as we can tell, there's so problems at all of any kind."
</P>
<P>
	   The only thing even approaching a Y2K glitch on the entire continent
happened somewhere in the Midwest, where a power company's software mistakenly
caused the system clock to read "Jan. 35."
</P>
<P>
	   The clock was quickly reset, and no outages were caused, said Gent, who
would not identify the company or where it is located.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline passengers took to the skies Friday night unafraid of potential Y2K
problems and eager to join loved ones to celebrate the new millennium in
far-flung places.
</P>
<P>
	   Dara Smith learned she'd be spending New Year's Eve in Las Vegas just 10
minutes before her fiance whisked her to Newark International Airport for a
surprise gambling jaunt. The southern New Jersey woman had no qualms about
boarding a Nevada-bound jet shortly before 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd be more afraid to go to New York than to fly in this plane," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   No problems were reported at the airport, where Port Authority crews tested
equipment and practiced drills for crashes that never happened. Things also were
fine at the Tosco Refinery in Linden.
</P>
<P>
	   "From the state's perspective, no news is good news," said state Attorney
General John Farmer. "It's premature to conclude everything's over with. But the
witching hour has come and gone. The power is on, the water's running. We're
happy at this point."
</P>
<P>
	   Farmer said the biggest concern of the night was that parts of the state
were foggy and there was black ice on the roads in part of central and southern
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   State computer chief Wendy Rayner said the state backed up its massive
computer system at 10 p.m. and then again shortly after midnight. She said she
is confident the state computers will function, and the state will test its
computer system on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our job really begins now," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elaborate precautionary measures remained in place through New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   State Police had triple the usual number of troopers on the road, and all
personnel were to be on call New Year's Day. Helicopters were at the ready,
tactical teams were on alert, and the high-tech crime unit was activated to
monitor computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   As time zone after time zone rolled over into the new millennium, telephone
service was not interrupted, said AT&AMP;T spokesman John Heath.
</P>
<P>
	   "So far, everything is normal with AT&AMP;T's network and the systems of
countries who have entered the new year," he said just after 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic had 20,000 workers - 25 percent more than normal - monitoring
its network, which provides local phone service from Maine to Virginia. It
reported no disruptions by mid-evening.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's toll roads also had contingency plans in place.
</P>
<P>
	   Garden State Parkway spokesman Dennis Ingoglia said traffic was expected to
be lighter than usual overnight, assuming most people celebrated New Year's Eve
at or close to home.

America's Heartland Welcomes the Year 2000
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- America's heartland rang in the year 2000, reveling in a
spectacle of song, light and fireworks. People danced to the wail of Buddy Guy's
blues band in Chicago and Lyle Lovett in Austin, Texas. Cities across Indiana
planned fireworks displays and outdoor celebrations, including a Times
Square-esque ball dropping on the circle in downtown Indianapolis and a New
Year's concert by Hoosier rocker John Mellencamp at the Conseco Fieldhouse.
Worries over terrorism and computer bugs were brushed aside as a party mood took
hold.

Clinton Invokes Hope for 21st Century
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed the new millennium by invoking
a hope for "the triumph of peace and harmony" in America and beyond. Even has he
greeted the 21st century, Clinton had warm words for the expiring one. Invoking
the memory of one of the century's towering figures, civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr., Clinton proclaimed, "Let freedom ring!" Speaking on the stairs
of the Lincoln Memorial moments before the National Mall erupted in a blaze of
fireworks, Clinton said, "We Americans must not fear change. Instead, let us
welcome it, embrace it and create it."

Few Y2K Glitches Reported So Far
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Computers silently switched to 2000 in country after
anxious country Saturday, but the dreaded Y2K bug's first bite was barely felt.
Japan reported the failure of a computer linked to radiation monitoring devices
at a nuclear plant, but said it wasn't considered serious enough to shut the
plant. Experts said many Year 2000 computer troubles still might take days or
weeks to develop. But after months of Y2K warnings, the prevailing feeling was
one of anticlimax. Cash machines kept working in New Zealand, one of the first
nations where computers were put to the test by the date change from 1999 to
2000.

6 Hostages Released at Kansas Bank
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   OLATHE, Kan. (AP) -- Two women -- one of whom said she was upset about
losing her job and had no hope for the future -- took a group of bank employees
hostage Friday, but released six of them after several hours of negotiations
with police. The hostage-takers remained inside the suburban Kansas City bank
late Friday night, and police didn't know whether other bank employees were also
inside. One of the bank employees inside the building had earlier called KMBC-TV
and said everyone was being treated well. The employee was interrupted when one
of the suspects took the phone and she was upset because she had lost her job,
her family and all hope for the future. She said she would release the hostages
if she could talk to a friend named Sean.

No Sign of Hijackers After Deadline
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) -- At dawn Saturday, there was no sign of the
five hijackers who sped off 10 hours earlier after releasing all 155 hostages on
the Indian Airlines plane they hijacked eight days earlier. Under the agreement
made between India, the hijackers and the Taliban militia who rule most of
Afghanistan, the hijackers agreed to end the eight-day crisis and free the
hostages in exchange for the three prominent militants, who were being held in
Indian jails. The hijackers were given 10 hours to find freedom. Their most
likely destination is the poorly guarded Pakistani border, just a few hours
drive from Kandahar.

Yeltsin Quits, Is Granted Immunity
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Pleading for forgiveness, Boris Yeltsin resigned Friday as
president, clearing the way for his hand-picked successor to take Russia into a
new age and fix the mistakes he admitted having made through eight chaotic
years. Yeltsin, apologizing for failing to fulfill Russians' dreams for a better
life, turned over power to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the country's most
popular politician. Putin took control of the government and will serve as
acting president until elections are held in 90 days.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended a boom year with an abbreviated New Year's Eve
session. A rally gathered momentum amid growing confidence that the Year 2000

industrial average rose 44.26 to close at 11,497.12. The Nasdaq composite index
rose 32.44 to 4,069.31 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 4.78 to 1,469.25.

Mississippi Defeats Oklahoma 27-25
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- Ole Miss is making itself right at home in the
Independence Bowl. The Rebels, after letting a 21-3 halftime lead slip away, got
a 39-yard field goal by Les Binkley on the game's final play Friday night to
beat Oklahoma 27-25. Ole Miss (8-4) won its second straight Independence Bowl
and fourth straight bowl game. Oklahoma, making its first bowl appearance since
1994, wound up 7-5 despite a record-setting performance by quarterback Josh
Heupel.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- International stars galore graced the Millennium Gala at
the Metropolitan Opera, offering songs ranging from Strauss to Rodgers and
Hammerstein.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3 1/2 hours Friday night held surprises, too, such as James Levine
conducting John Philip Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever" as a second-half
overture, with house lights turned on, the audience clapping along, and the
balcony lights blinking in syncopation.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Met, it was a let-the-hair-down evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Soprano Hei-Kyung Hong, who sang the elegant countess in "The Marriage of
Figaro" in the fall, danced in a tight red dress surrounded by chorus boys, and
sang some Franz Lehar.
</P>
<P>
	   Paolo Gavanelli, who played the title role in "Rigoletto" the night before,
sang "Come Back to Sorrento" for the millennium bash.
</P>
<P>
	   Other baritones and basses also chose popular songs: Samuel Ramey singing
"This Nearly Was Mine"; Dwayne Croft "Some Enchanted Evening"; Thomas Allen "If
I Loved You"; and James Morris a "Man of La Mancha" medley.
</P>
<P>
	   The evening ended with the stage full of couples whirling to "The Fledermaus
Waltz."

<HEADLINE> Presidential Millennium Message  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Text of a millennium message President Clinton delivered at the Millennium
New Year's Eve Gala on the Mall in Washington, D.C., as transcribed by the
Federal Document Clearing House:
</P>
<P>
	   CLINTON: Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we celebrate. The change of
centuries, the dawning of a new millennium are now just minutes away.
</P>
<P>
	   We celebrate the past. We have honored America's remarkable achievements,
struggles and triumphs in the 20th century. We celebrate the future, imagining
an even more remarkable 21st century.
</P>
<P>
	   As we marvel at the changes of the last 100 years, we dream of what changes
the next 100 and the next 1,000 will bring. And as powerful as our memories are,
our dreams must be even stronger. For when our memories outweigh our dreams, we
become old. And it is the eternal destiny of America to remain forever young --
always reaching beyond, always becoming, as our Founders pledged, ``a more
perfect union.''
</P>
<P>
	   So we Americans must not fear change. Instead, let us welcome it, embrace it
and create it.
</P>
<P>
	   The great story of the 20th century is the triumph of freedom and free
people. A story told in the drama of new immigrants, the struggles for equal
rights, the victories over totalitarianism, the stunning advances in economic
well-being and culture and health and space and telecommunications and in
building a world in which more than half the people live under governments of
their own choosing for the first time in all history.
</P>
<P>
	   We must never forget the meaning of the 20th century or the gifts of those
who worked and marched, who fought and died for the triumph of freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   So as we ring in this new year in a new century, in a new millennium, we
must now and always echo Dr. King, in the words of the old American hymn, ``Let
freedom ring.''
</P>
<P>
	   If the story of the 20th century is the triumph of freedom, what will the
story of the 21st century be?
</P>
<P>
	   Let it be the triumph of freedom wisely used to bring peace to a world in
which we honor our differences and even more our common humanity. Such a triumph
will require great efforts from us all.
</P>
<P>
	   It will require us to stand against the forces of hatred and bigotry, terror
and destruction. It will require us to continue to prosper, to alleviate
poverty, to better balance the demands of work and family and to serve, each of
us, in our communities.
</P>
<P>
	   It will require us to take better care of our environment. It will require
us to make further breakthroughs in science and technology, to cure dread
diseases, heal broken bodies, lengthen life and unlock secrets from global
warming to the black holes in the universe.
</P>
<P>
	   And perhaps most important, it will require us to share with our fellow
Americans and, increasingly, with our fellow citizens of the world, the economic
benefits of globalization, the political benefits of democracy and human rights,
the educational and health benefits of all things modern, from the Internet to
the genetic encyclopedia to the mysteries beyond our solar system.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, we may not be able to eliminate all hateful intolerance, but we can
develop a healthy intolerance of bigotry, oppression and abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   We may not be able to eliminate all the harsh consequences of globalization.
But we can communicate more and travel more and trade more in a way that lifts
the lives of ordinary working families everywhere and the quality of our global
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   We may not be able to eliminate all the failures of government and
international institutions. But we can certainly strengthen democracy so all
children are prepared for the 21st century world and protected from its harshest
side effects.
</P>
<P>
	   And we can do so much more to work together, to cooperate among ourselves,
to seize the problems and the opportunities of this ever-small planet we all
call home.
</P>
<P>
	   In short, if we want the story of the 21st century to be the triumph of
peace and harmony, we must embrace our common humanity and our shared destiny.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, we're just moments from that new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   Two centuries ago, as the Framers were crafting our Constitution, Benjamin
Franklin was often seen in Independence Hall, looking at a painting of the sun
low on the horizon. When at long last the Constitution finally was signed, Mr.
Franklin said, ``I have often wondered whether that sun was rising or setting.
Today, I have the happiness to know it is a rising sun.''
</P>
<P>
	   Well, two centuries later, we know the sun will always rise on America as
long as each new generation lights the fire of freedom. Our children are ready.
So again, the torch is passed to a new century of young Americans.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canada Celebrates New Year  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Starting in Newfoundland, which launched North America's
millennium celebration, Canadians welcomed the year 2000 on Friday night with
song, drink and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 50,000 revelers gathered at the waterfront in St. John's,
Newfoundland, which had a 30-minute head start on the new year over the rest of
the continent because of its easternmost location.
</P>
<P>
	   Bundled in overcoats, scarves, hats and gloves to ward off the winter cold,
people cheered and hugged one another as fireworks lit the sky when midnight
struck.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears that the Y2K computer bug could bring chaos with the new year caused
some people to stock up on emergency supplies and decide to stay home, and poor
ticket sales canceled some concerts and shows in Toronto and other cities.
</P>
<P>
	   But the major celebrations went on as scheduled. Celine Dion sang ``My Heart
Will Go On,'' her hit from the movie ``Titanic,'' at a farewell show she gave in
Montreal before taking a two-year break to be with her husband, who is battling
cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   In Ottawa, Prime Minister Jean Chretien spoke proudly of Canada, saying it
was respected worldwide for its talent and values.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We Canadians are one of the most privileged people of the world, and we
start the year 2000 with all the means at our disposal to build an even brighter
future,'' he said, his breath freezing in the night air. ``So let's welcome the
year 2000 and a future where everything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of people crowded the Lake Ontario shore in Toronto for a
concert and huge fireworks display. Other major celebrations took place in
Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary and other cities.
</P>
<P>
	   In central Alberta, the city of Red Deer held its celebration a night early
because of worries about Y2K problems. More than 3,000 people gathered in the
city center Thursday night for fireworks, singers, jugglers and comedians.
</P>
<P>
	   The government Y2K watchdog reported no problems in eastern portions when
midnight struck.
</P>
<P>
	   But Guy McKenzie, the federal Y2K spokesman, warned that Friday night and
Saturday were merely the start of a lengthy watch for trouble, saying ``Y2K is
not necessarily a problem that will manifest itself at 12:01.''
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government spent $1.7 billion to try to prevent Y2K troubles,
and 18,000 troops were on standby. All of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's
15,000 uniformed officers were also on call.
</P>
<P>
	   In Grise Fjord in the new territory of Nunavut, Inuit hunter Meeka Kiguktak
spent New Year's Eve as she does every year -- hunting seal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's what we do every year and I wasn't even thinking of the millennium,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi 27, Oklahoma 25  </HEADLINE>
    By OWEN CANFIELD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- Ole Miss is making itself right at home in the
Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels, after letting a 21-3 halftime lead slip away, got a 39-yard
field goal by Les Binkley on the game's final play Friday night to beat Oklahoma
27-25.
</P>
<P>
	   Ole Miss (8-4) won its second straight Independence Bowl and fourth straight
bowl game. Oklahoma, making its first bowl appearance since 1994, wound up 7-5
despite a record-setting performance by quarterback Josh Heupel.
</P>
<P>
	   Duece McAllister, who scored two touchdowns and prevented another with a
hustling tackle after an interception, helped set up the Rebels' game-winning
drive with a 41-yard kickoff return after Oklahoma had taken the lead with its
third touchdown of the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   McAllister, who finished with 121 yards, had gains of 8 and 9 yards to start
the drive. Later, Oklahoma was penalized five yards for having too many players
on the field on a third-and-2 play.
</P>
<P>
	   That gave Ole Miss a first down at the 27, and three plays later Binkley
came on and cleanly made the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments earlier, it looked as though Oklahoma had pulled off the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Heupel threw for all three second-half touchdowns, the last a 17-yarder to
Quenton Griffin with 2:17 remaining, and the wobbly extra point by Tim Duncan
made it 25-24.
</P>
<P>
	   Heupel was 39-of-53 for 390 yards, all Independence Bowl records. He led two
scoring drives in the third quarter to pull Oklahoma within 21-18, going
10-of-12 for 109 yards on the drives as the Sooners outgained Ole Miss 148-15.
</P>
<P>
	   His first touchdown was a 3-yard pass to Jarrail Jackson with 11:26 left in
the third. Heupel generated all 80 yards on the next scoring drive, going 6-of-6
and capping it with a 41-yarder to Brandon Daniels.
</P>
<P>
	   A 29-yard field goal by Binkley capped a 14-play drive for Ole Miss and gave
the Rebels a 24-18 lead with 11:18 remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Heupel appeared to commit a costly turnover when he fumbled at the Rebels 20
on Oklahoma's next drive, but Ole Miss didn't take advantage and Oklahoma got
another shot. The Sooners drove 79 yards, including a 24-yard run by Griffin and
a 22-yard completion to Brandon Daniels, before scoring the go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels used big plays on both sides of the ball to build a big
first-half lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sooners drove to the Ole Miss 18 on their first possession, but Tim
Duncan missed a 35-yard field goal. The Sooners also lost two fumbles, Heupel's
pass was intercepted in the end zone, and a fake field goal on the final play of
the half resulted in a 17-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Romaro Miller was especially sharp in the first half, when he completed
12-of-17 passes for 158 yards. He had two intercepted, but also had two
touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
	   The first was a 25-yarder to McAllister, one play after Miller had hit Mice
Flourney on a 45-yard completion.
</P>
<P>
	   McAllister came up with a big play three minutes later when he chased down
defensive end Cory Heinecke, who had intercepted a pass and returned it 51 yards
to the Ole Miss 20. Oklahoma wound up settling for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels used 12 plays and nearly six minutes to score their second
touchdown, which came on a 9-yard pass to tight end Adam Bettis. Miller was
5-of-5 passing and kept the drive alive with a 5-yard scramble on a third-and-5
play.
</P>
<P>
	   McAllister had an 80-yard touchdown run, the longest in Independence Bowl
history, on the first play after Tim Strickland intercepted Heupel's pass in the
end zone. McAllister bounced off a defender at the line, cut back and outran a
handful of Sooners to the end zone.

<HEADLINE> Va. Tech WR Breaks Bone in Foot  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Ricky Hall, Virginia Tech's leading punt returner and a
starting wide receiver, broke his left foot in practice Friday and probably will
miss the national championship game against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Duane Lagan, the Hokies' team physician, said it was "pretty doubtful"
that Hall could play in the Sugar Bowl on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "It may be too painful for him to run," Lagan said. "It's cracked, not
displaced, but it's still a fracture."
</P>
<P>
	   Hall broke a bone in the foot midway through the Hokies' practice at Tulane
University. He was running a pass route and "just put his foot down wrong. He
wasn't touched," Lagan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall wants to play and a protective device has been made for his foot, but
the doctor said he might need surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall returned 40 punts for a school-record 510 yards and a touchdown this
season. He rated 18th nationally with 12.75 yards a return. The senior ranked
second on the team with 25 passes for 398 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall split time with Emmett Johnson at wide receiver. Johnson dislocated a
finger while trying to catch a pass in practice Wednesday but is expected to
play against the top-ranked Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronyell Whitaker is listed as the backup punt returner for the No. 2 Hokies.
He fielded just one punt all season, returning it 5 yards.

<HEADLINE> Last Times Square party of the century standing room only  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - How good a spot did Mike Chung grab to greet the 21st
century in Times Square? When the 18-year-old looked up, he had a perfect view
of ageless New Year's toastmaster Dick Clark.
<P>
	   It doesn't get much better than that, especially when you consider he
outfought an estimated 2 million other folks for the position.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here I am, standing right under Dick Clark," said the excited Chung, a
North Brunswick, N.J., resident who arrived in Times Square at 5 a.m. Friday for
a front row seat at the dawn of the new millennium. "It's worth it."
</P>
<P>
	   The sentiment was widespread in the middle of Manhattan, where hundreds of
thousands of people turned out for a millennial party that stretched from 42nd
Street to Central Park, where cops were forced to turn away revelers hours
before the new crystal ball dropped to mark Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd members were Y2K-compliant: peaceful and orderly. They flooded a
nearby deli for an endless supply of beer, booze and hot chocolate on a night
when temperatures were in the 30s.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite fears that the bash might become a terrorist target, the 24-hour, $7
million event - three years in the making - came off with barely a hitch.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since I was a little boy, I wanted to come to New York for the millennium,
and now my dream has come true," Tiago Depuydt of Veurne, Belgium, said shortly
after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   It was at midnight that the Waterford crystal ball descended as the crowd
waved oversized flags, smaller American flags, tinsel pom-poms and multicolored
balloons. Giants puppets - an old man for 1999, a newborn for 2000 - wiggled
above the jam-packed crowd, which was illuminated by whirling spotlights.
</P>
<P>
	   A roar for the last 1,000 years arose as the ball slowly rode down a 77-foot
flagpole, starting in 1999 and finishing in the next millennium. A blizzard of
confetti blanketed the crowd as fireworks exploded overhead, ending a
near-perfect evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Vasquez, 20, staked out his Times Square site about 12 hours before
the ball dropped. Despite fears of terrorism, he and several friends drove to
Manhattan from Minneapolis, Minn.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great to still be alive," Vasquez said. "I want to tell my grandkids
that we were here."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, cops with their riot helmets tucked beneath their arms had walked
around with smiles. A McDonald's delivery woman schlepped Big Macs and fries
into the appreciative overflow crowd, which had assembled hours before the
millennial moment.
</P>
<P>
	   While the millennium arrived first in many other parts of the world, the
world came to Times Square for this party: Flags from Argentina, Malta and Japan
were draped over police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Packer, 36, a Long Island highway maintenance man, arrived about four
hours after Chung but still managed to snag a prime location: 46th Street, just
three blocks north of the ball.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've made new friends from Australia!" he announced.
</P>
<P>
	   "London!" shouted a nearby man.
</P>
<P>
	   "Chicago!" chimed in one woman.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to go to sleep," Packer confessed, "but the spirit is keeping me
up."

	   McAllister came up with a big play three minutes later when he chased down
defensive end Cory Heinecke, who had intercepted a pass and returned it 51 yards
to the Ole Miss 20. Oklahoma wound up settling for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels used 12 plays and nearly six minutes to score their second
touchdown, which came on a 9-yard pass to tight end Adam Bettis. Miller was
5-of-5 passing and kept the drive alive with a 5-yard scramble on a third-and-5
play.
</P>
<P>
	   McAllister had an 80-yard touchdown run, the longest in Independence Bowl
history, on the first play after Tim Strickland intercepted Heupel's pass in the
end zone. McAllister bounced off a defender at the line, cut back and outran a
handful of Sooners to the end zone.

<HEADLINE> TV Networks Mix Y2K, News Coverage  </HEADLINE>
    By BRYAN BRUMLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Television tracked the dawn of 2000 with a moving global feast. But finally
the hours ticked down to the main event: midnight at New York City's Times
Square, with an extraordinary side show at the mall in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't want to discount the possibility of anything going in the wrong
direction," cautioned CNN anchor Judy Woodruff nine minutes into the new
millennium, "but so far, the pictures are all positive. It's celebration, it's
lights, it's dancing, and a lot of happy faces."
</P>
<P>
	   And a happily explosive finish for many viewers who had been following the
westbound buildup -- and maybe wondering if ABC anchor Peter Jennings would
complete his 25-hour on-air marathon (by midnight, he had completed 19 hours).
</P>
<P>
	   "The celebration remains," NBC anchor Tom Brokaw summed up, "because the
century will go on."
</P>
<P>
	   TV's celebration took the form of a day-long electronic travelogue, with
cameras darting across time zones beginning with fireworks in New Zealand and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   At 7 p.m. EST, viewers saw a pyrotechnic spectacle in London, where coverage
even included video of the clapper within Big Ben's bell tower announcing 12
o'clock.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just amazing!" marveled ABC's Charles Gibson. "I'm a sucker for this kind
of thing. I just love it!"
</P>
<P>
	   An hour before that, there was almost a visual traffic jam as TV screens
blazed with scenes of fireworks over Paris' Eiffel Tower alternating with Pope
John Paul II addressing multitudes in Vatican City and searchlights piercing the
Berlin sky. Not to mention the extravaganza in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
	   If the epic countdown lived up to its billing, an accompanying story seemed
to fizzle: anticipated computer glitches by older computer systems unable to
cope with the four new digits of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everywhere we've looked, the Y2K problem hasn't materialized," said CNN
anchorman Jonathon Mann.
</P>
<P>
	   But early Friday, other breaking stories -- Russian leader Boris Yeltsin's
resignation and the close of an Afghan hijacking drama -- temporarily upstaged
the millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin's resignation became known and the hostage crisis began to end in
remote Kandahar, Afghanistan, as grass-skirted islanders in the Pacific danced
in the millennium and most Americans slept.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boris Yeltsin stole the headlines right out of the old and new millennium,"
said ABC's Morton Dean from Moscow shortly before 5 a.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC, PBS and the cable news networks stuck with New Year's coverage all day
starting before 5 a.m., while NBC and CBS picked their moments. NBC's "Today"
show opened with the ball being lifted over Times Square at 7 a.m., while CBS's
"Early Show" sent Jane Clayson to Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   CNN aired pictures of hijackers leaving the Indian Airlines plane sent via
satellite telephone. Because of the new technology, the pictures were
occasionally herky-jerky -- but it gave the network a leg up on its American
television competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   A fortunate coincidence also helped CNN on the Yeltsin story. On Thursday,
CNN's Moscow bureau interviewed Yeltsin's designated successor, Vladimir Putin,
in preparation for a profile. The network rushed clips from the interview on the
air within an hour of Yeltsin's announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think he knew then that Yeltsin was going to drop," CNN USA
President Rick Kaplan said in an interview. "He probably wouldn't have done the
interview."
</P>
<P>
	   In Europe, the competing stories happened during daylight and caused more
scrambling for journalists. Associated Press Television News was beginning 26
hours of live millennium coverage with a transmission from Kiribati in the South
Pacific when news of Yeltsin's resignation flashed onto the wire.
</P>
<P>
	   Within minutes, the global video agency transmitted portions of Yeltsin's
televised resignation speech as well as packaged profiles of Yeltsin and Russian
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in a regularly scheduled news bulletin.
</P>
<P>
	   "It caused a conflict because half the world wanted only to know about the
millennium, and the other half wanted breaking news at the same time," said
Nigel Baker, head of news for APTN.
</P>
<P>
	   American networks had some juggling to do at 11 a.m. EST, when President
Clinton delivered comments about Yeltsin's resignation simultaneous with
Beijing's millennium celebration. Fox News Channel ran a split screen with both
events.
</P>
<P>
	   C-SPAN twice briefly lost its signal just as it was about to show First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton speaking. A spokesman blamed "a garden variety signal
problem" with all the TV equipment covering the year 2000, and said it had
nothing to do with Y2K.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi Defeats Oklahoma 27-25  </HEADLINE>
    By OWEN CANFIELD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- Mississippi finally got one to go its way in the
fourth quarter, and the result was another Independence Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels, who closed out the regular season with three-point losses to
Georgia and Mississippi State after leading late, beat Oklahoma 27-25 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Les Binkley's 39-yard field goal on the final play gave Ole Miss (8-4) its
second straight Independence Bowl victory and fourth straight bowl win.
Oklahoma, making its first bowl appearance since 1994, finished 7-5 despite a
record-setting performance by quarterback Josh Heupel.
</P>
<P>
	   Heupel's third touchdown pass, a 17-yarder to Quenton Richardson, and the
point-after kick by Tim Duncan had given the Sooners a 25-24 lead with 2:17
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all had it going through our mind, what we had been through with Miss
State and Georgia," coach David Cutcliffe said. "But while they were driving, we
talked about what we were going to do, how we were going to approach it. We felt
we could get it done."
</P>
<P>
	   Deuce McAllister, who ran for 121 yards and scored twice, including an
80-yard run, got the Rebels started with a 42-yard kickoff return. Then he
carried for 8 and 9 yards on the first two plays of the drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Oklahoma was penalized five yards for having too many players on the
field on a third-and-2 play.
</P>
<P>
	   "They said defense broke the huddle with 12 men on the field. We don't
huddle," Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said. "I've never heard of defense being
called for breaking the huddle with 12 men on the field, have you?
</P>
<P>
	   "We called timeout before the snap and they threw a flag, so you figure it."
</P>
<P>
	   The penalty gave Ole Miss a first down at the 27. Three plays later, on
third down, Binkley came on and cleanly made the game-winner as time expired.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt pretty confident," said Binkley, who had hit from 49 yards during
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutcliffe said he knew Binkley was within range, and he didn't want to take
any chances by running one more play before the kick.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've just seen so many bizarre things happen, I just didn't think it was
worth the risk," he said. "The difference may have been two or three yards. I
didn't want to risk a turnover."
</P>
<P>
	   Moments earlier, it looked as though Oklahoma had pulled off the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Heupel was 39-of-53 for 390 yards, all Independence Bowl records, and led
two scoring drives in the third quarter to pull Oklahoma within 21-18. He was
10-of-12 for 109 yards on the drives as the Sooners outgained Ole Miss 148-15.
</P>
<P>
	   A 29-yard field goal by Binkley capped a 14-play drive for Ole Miss and gave
the Rebels a 24-18 lead with 11:18 remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Heupel appeared to commit a costly turnover when he fumbled at the Rebels 20
on Oklahoma's next drive, but Ole Miss didn't take advantage and Oklahoma got
another shot. The Sooners drove 79 yards, including a 24-yard run by Griffin and
a 22-yard completion to Brandon Daniels, before scoring the go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels used big plays on both sides of the ball to build a big
first-half lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sooners drove to the Ole Miss 18 on their first possession, but Duncan
missed a 35-yard field goal. The Sooners also lost two fumbles, Heupel had a
pass intercepted in the end zone, and a fake field goal on the final play of the
half resulted in a 17-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
	   "You think of all the points we let go in the red zone and it's hard to
win," Stoops said.
</P>
<P>
	   Romaro Miller was especially sharp in the first half, when he completed
12-of-17 passes for 158 yards. He had two intercepted, but also had two
touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
	   The first was a 25-yarder to McAllister, one play after Miller had hit Mice
Flourney on a 45-yard completion.
</P>
<P>
	   McAllister came up with a big play three minutes later when he chased down
defensive end Cory Heinecke, who had intercepted a pass and returned it 51 yards
to the Ole Miss 20. Oklahoma wound up settling for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels used 12 plays and nearly six minutes to score their second
touchdown, which came on a 9-yard pass to tight end Adam Bettis. Miller was
5-of-5 passing and kept the drive alive with a 5-yard scramble on a third-and-5
play.
</P>
<P>
	   McAllister's 80-yard touchdown run, the longest in Independence Bowl
history, came on the first play after Tim Strickland intercepted Heupel's pass
in the end zone. McAllister bounced off a defender at the line, cut back and
outran a handful of Sooners to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels gave the state of Mississippi a 3-0 record in bowls. Mississippi
State beat Clemson 17-7 in the Peach Bowl and Southern Mississippi beat Colorado
State 23-17 in the Liberty Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leads Nation Into 2000  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FEINSILBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With an extravagant fireworks display dancing up the
sides of the Washington Monument as the 21st century arrived in America,
President Clinton called on the nation to fear not the future but to ``welcome
it, embrace it and create it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our children are ready. Again the torch is passed to a new century of
young Americans,'' he said, speaking from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the
statue of the Great Emancipator peering over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   He had the closing words of the closing century -- and his speech may have
been one of the shortest he'd ever delivered. At midnight, he stopped, so lights
could parade up the side of the monument, against the backdrop of a spectacular
display of pyrotechnics. Thousands counted down as the monument was lit up,
segment by segment.
</P>
<P>
	   But many in the crowd in front of the memorial turned their backs to Clinton
as he spoke, anticipating the fireworks show from the Washington Monument, eight
blocks away. They were disappointed: It stopped minutes after it started,
causing many to ask, ``That's it?''
</P>
<P>
	   The show had been abbreviated to accommodate the departure of Clinton and
his entourage, back to the White House. That done, the fireworks resumed, but
many people were gone by then.
</P>
<P>
	   Relieved that technology was behaving itself, 300 stars from the worlds of
entertainment, business, government and academia dined with Clinton, his wife
and daughter at the White House and then joined the first family for the $12
million extravaganza at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   They applauded as actor Will Smith introduced a show of song, dance and even
poetry. Among the performers were Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, Bobby McFerrin
and some known only by one name -- Bono, Stomp, Slash and Usher.
</P>
<P>
	   Remarked one member of the audience, Marie Trotta, who runs a
Meals-on-Wheels program in Bellport, N.Y., ``We were a little more concerned
about terrorism than we were about Y2K, but we figured, what the heck, if you're
going to blow up, why not in Washington?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We Americans must not fear change; instead, let us welcome it, embrace it
and create it,'' Clinton declared in his last burst of oratory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the eternal destiny of America to remain forever young.''
</P>
<P>
	   And his prayer, he said, was that the story of the 21st century would be
``the triumph of freedom wisely used.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was the first president to bring in a new century since William
McKinley did so with far less pizzaz. This president started Millennium Day by
stowing Army dog tags, a public library card and other artifacts of 20th century
America into a time capsule to be opened at the end of the 21st.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton found a happy omen in the beautiful winter weather -- crisp but
clear. ``The sun is still rising on America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At nightfall he donned a tuxedo to dance into the new year and shook the
hands of dinner guests streaming into the White House. Actor Robert De Niro,
former boxing champ Muhammad Ali and rock star Bono were among the famed and
accomplished who came for the roast lamb dinner and champagne toasts.
</P>
<P>
	   One guest was former senator and astronaut John Glenn, with a prediction:
``Will humankind get to Mars in the next century? Oh yes, certainly.'' He wore
his congressional space medal on a ribbon around his neck.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing at the East Portico of the White House, the president; first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton in a floor-length black silk dress with rhinestone
buttons down its front; and daughter Chelsea, wearing a dark blue taffeta dress
and a stand-up collar, received their guests.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton offered three toasts -- to his guests, his wife and humanity's
``shared future.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``By far my most solemn prayer for this new millennium is that we will find
somehow the strength and wisdom in our hearts to keep growing together, first as
one America and then as one people on this ever-smaller planet we all call
home,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Next came the star-filled and fireworks-lit party for the throngs at the
foot of the Lincoln Memorial, a hallowed obelisk that stood like an exclamation
mark aglow in the century's waning moments.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, the plan was all-night dancing in a huge, heated tent outside
the White House, ending with breakfast at sun-up.
</P>
<P>
	   But all was not fun. Clinton had solemn words in a day filled with
millennium-conscious oratory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the new century, we may not be able to eliminate hateful intolerance,''
he said, ``but we will see the rise of healthy intolerance of bigotry,
oppression and abject poverty in our own communities and across the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   And for his final speech of the century, he quoted Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let us pledge,'' he said in his short prepared speech, ``that the new
millennium will bring, in the words of the Great Emancipator, 'a new birth of
freedom.'''
</P>
<P>
	   The White House called the finale ``an unforgettable midnight moment.''
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour show competed on television for the home audience with the
customary Times Square countdown.
</P>
<P>
	   One difference: In New York the ball of light descended in the seconds
before midnight while here the white light of fireworks cascaded up the 555-foot
Washington Monument, sparked by a fuse racing along the reflecting pool from the
Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the day, Clinton was kept up to date on the initially untroubled
Y2K computer rollover and on events in a far-off Kremlin, where Boris Yeltsin,
an unlikely and sometimes uncertain partner, peacefully yielded the presidency
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and his wife, sitting with an audience of diplomats in the soaring,
arched-glass atrium of the Ronald Reagan Federal Building, listened as children
from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Nigeria and Russia asked for a new
century built on peace, prosperity, security, unity, and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For all the billions of people who came before us,'' said Clinton, ``it
has been left to this generation to lead the world into a new millennium, to use
our freedom wisely, to walk away from war and hatred toward love and peace.''

<HEADLINE> Early reports: Millennium, Y2K fears pass New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Thousands of extra utility workers and emergency
personnel with generators and tanks of water at the ready reported no initial
problems statewide as the year 2000 arrived.
<P>
	   From Olean to Farmingdale the much feared Y2K bug was a dud, arriving with
lights on, dial tones and no serious mechanical disruptions shortly after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   State workers at the emergency operations center of the State Emergency
Management Office in Albany reported no problems shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   "Happy New Year, everybody!" said Ed Jacoby, SEMO director. "Now the work
begins for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Along the Canadian border, where fear of terrorism ran high in recent weeks,
no arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just did a tour of all seven of the ports of entry, and it's all very
quiet," Winston Barrus, the acting district director of Immigration and
Naturalization Services in Buffalo, N.Y., said just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thousand Island Bridge in northern New York was reopened at 1 a.m. and
traffic resumed after an initial scanner reading incorrectly identified nitrates
in a car. Earlier, police rerouted traffic through the city of Ogdensburg, 120
miles north of Syracuse and an explosives response team was called in.
</P>
<P>
	   At 10 p.m., customs had picked up traces of nitrate on a Canadian National
trying to come into New York state, which turned out to be in glue used to bind
books.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no nitrates there," said James McMahon, superintendent of the
state police. He said a scanner inadvertently picked up traces of nitrate while
searching a Canadian national. "Through the investigation and interview with the
motorist, it was proved to be a negative. The motorist was released."
</P>
<P>
	   Statewide, ground zero for Y2K preparations was a state-run underground
command bunker in Albany, which buzzed with activity Friday as 150 people
monitored the state's vital functions. Workers continued to take reports from
hospitals and utilities, but no Y2K-related troubles were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are still vigilant, there could still be problems, but we don't
anticipate any," Natoli said. "Y2K does not end at 12:01. We have hours of work
ahead of us."
</P>
<P>
	   "No state in America ... is more ready than we are to deal with any
potential problems that might come up tonight," said Gov. George Pataki, who
ends the century in the office held in 1900 by one of his idols, a 41-year-old
war hero named Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
	   The command center will remain staffed into the weekend, as will satellite
centers in places far afield as Canandaigua, Ray Brook and Farmingdale.
</P>
<P>
	   A key concern for state officials is making sure its sprawling power grid
continues to deliver electricity. The state's power utilities have each declared
themselves Y2K compliant, but thousands of extra workers were on duty overnight
at generating plants, electrical stations, gas pipelines and command centers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've done all our drilling, all our testing. We've completed our planning.
Now, we're just waiting and monitoring the world situation," said Mark Frank of
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. "We're confident that we'll encounter few, if any,
problems."
</P>
<P>
	   Niagara Mohawk scheduled about 1,000 additional workers - 10 times the
number of people who would ordinarily work a holiday weeknight. They included
radio-equipped technicians at 100 key substations from Olean to Ticonderga.
</P>
<P>
	   Just 17 of Niagara Mohawk's 1.3 million upstate customers were without
electricity at 7:30 p.m. - two in Buffalo, one in Schenectady, 12 in Utica and
two in the Adirondack Mountain hamlet of Silver Lake. Most were back on line by
10 p.m., Niagara Mohawk spokesman Gerald Rockower said from company headquarters
in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   "We went through the rollover just fine. There were no problems anywhere in
our transmission system," Rockower said. The few disruptions were about half the
norm for a New Year's Eve, Rockower said, and there was only one reason - the
mild weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's so good, it couldn't have been better weather if we had called for
it," Rockower said. "It's ideal. No winds knocking down lines and no road icing
causing cars to spin out."
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric spokesman Mike Power noted that isolated outages
due to a limb falling on a line or a car hitting a power pole are not uncommon
and that any outage overnight could be routine. Yet no power losses attributed
to Y2K or routine interruptions were reported through Friday evening in the
Rochester area, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic began an intensive around-the-clock watch Friday on its
telecommunications system.
</P>
<P>
	   The volume of telephone calls was heavier than normal for a New Year's Eve,
but the network was expected to handle the load with few if any delays, said
Bell Atlantic spokesman Cliff Lee.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've fixed, replaced or retired equipment," said Skip Patterson, who runs
Bell Atlantic's Year 2000 Program Office, "and we're confident Jan. 1 will be
just another day."
</P>
<P>
	   That refrain was common, but extraordinary precautions were taken just the
same:
</P>
<P>
	   -Albany International Airport had on hand a 1250 kilowatt mobile power
generator and a tank truck to supply water;
</P>
<P>
	   -University Hospital in Syracuse was bringing in its technical personnel to
watch electronic systems;
</P>
<P>
	   -Keycorp was making extra deliveries of cash to ATMs, even though bank
officials had no evidence of a run on cash machines.
</P>
<P>
	   In western New York, all was quiet after midnight. Officials said there were
no major problems in the city, where the most serious mishap was a water main
break.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would say it's even quieter than usual for a Friday night," said Harold
Litwin, chief of operations for police in Buffalo, which 100 years ago was a
bustling commercial center more populous than 12 states.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's dead," said a man selling hot dogs in front of the arena where the
band Bare Naked Ladies performed. "There's only about 8,000 people in there.
We'll get more tomorrow when Toronto comes to town to play the Sabres."
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester-based Wegmans Food Markets and rival Tops markets reported recent
increases in the sales of water, flashlights, canned soups, bathroom tissue,
cereals, baby food and other staples. At Wegmans, bags of charcoal were snapped
up at the same pace as in the peak barbecue summer season.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are stocking up in general but not to any unusual degree," said Jo
Natale, spokeswoman for the Wegmans Food Markets based in Rochester. "I wouldn't
characterize any of it as panic buying."
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds were large and problems were few at several "First Night" downtown
celebrations across the state. Most went off as planned, but as 13,000 revelers
began to filter into Binghamton's event, fire erupted in a downtown bar damaging
the tavern and an adjacent adult book store, reported the Binghamton Press &AMP;
Sun-Bulletin. No injuries were reported and the cause remained under
investigation. A couple acts had to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the newest First Night celebrations was in Saratoga Springs, near the
site of the Battles of Saratoga where 222 years ago America's citizen soldiers
shocked the world's most powerful empire and turned the tide of the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   In that city of 25,000 about 25 miles north of Albany, all 20,000 buttons
needed for First Night events were sold out for the first time in four years,
said police Sgt. Dan Noeker.
</P>
<P>
	   In the basements of local police stations and county office buildings,
emergency preparedness workers were on the job, missing parties and mostly
watching nothing happen, often with good cheer.
</P>
<P>
	   On the chalkboard of the Washington County Emergency Command Center,
"TEOTWAWKI" was written on a chalkboard, reported the Glens Falls Post-Star.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's this?" asked Pete Zayachek, coordinator of the county's emergency
medical response system.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an acronym for 'The End Of The World As We Know It'," laughed
Emergency Services Coordinator Toby Dusha.

<HEADLINE> Baby born in Hartford 30 seconds after midnight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Hartford Hospital welcomed a new baby into the
world just 30 seconds into the year 2000.
<P>
	   Miesha Latoya Walker weighed in at 7 pounds 13 ounces, and measured 21
inches.
</P>
<P>
	   Her mother, Yvette Walker of Hartford, had been in labor for two days and
delivered on her due date.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Catie Campbell said Walker, 34, was ready to deliver before midnight but
decided to wait until the new year had arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   "She was determined," said Dr. Campbell. "She looked at the clock and said
'I could have the millennium baby,' and I said 'You could.' She started pushing
just before midnight."
</P>
<P>
	   Miesha is Walker's second child. Her 10-year-old daughter, Desiree, named
the baby.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital planned to give the family a special gift basket filled with
toys and savings bonds for the baby, and flowers for the mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Both mother and baby were doing well, Dr. Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's perfect," she said.

<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Separated by the stroke of midnight, twin boys were born in
Berlin on opposite sides of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   The 25-year-old mother, a Bulgarian, first gave birth to Mircem, four
minutes before the end of 1999, doctors at St. Joseph's Hospital said. A minute
into New Year's Day, his brother Mircan followed.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital refused to identify the mother, but indicated all three were in
good health.
</P>
<P>
	   Mircan lost out to another boy in the race for the German capital's first
baby of the millennium. Florian Vincent was born seconds after midnight to an
18-year-old woman at the Charite hospital, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Gamblers bet on glitch-free rollover, welcome millennium in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - The clock struck midnight and a new
millennium dawned but many gamblers hardly noticed.
<P>
	   The slot machines kept jingling, the dealers kept dealing and the
Boardwalk's glittering, neon-lit casino hotel towers illuminated the night sky
like they always do.
</P>
<P>
	   For thousands of gamblers and revelers in this casino capital, the Year 2000
brought only good luck.
</P>
<P>
	   Ann and Don Justice, of Parma, Ohio, sat playing a 50-cent Jokers Wild slot
machine at Trump Plaza Hotel Casino. Except for the din of noisemakers and the
hooting of fellow gamblers, they didn't know when the clock struck midnight.
Casinos have no clocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Others were chagrined at the lack of a countdown or any formal recognition
of the rollover. Among them was Lisa Mall, 23, of Mount Laurel.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody cares," she said. "We care. We stopped and watched the TV. But these
people, this is just sin city."
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, unfazed by Y2K worries or doom-and-gloom projections, gamblers
ushered in the new millennium at craps tables, concerts and exclusive casino
hotel parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Few were betting that power outages or other glitches associated with the
Y2K bug would dampen their revelry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm a computer programmer, and I'm confident there won't be any problems,
especially in these gambling places," said gambler Dave Evans, 38, of
Washington, D.C., who was in the simulcasting parlor at Bally's Park Place.
"They've got the money and they're not gonna let these machines stop."
</P>
<P>
	   Glenn Lillie, vice president of marketing at the Claridge Casino Hotel, said
the casino had no problems when the Year 2000 arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   The casino had placed bottled water and a flashlight in each of its 502
rooms in anticipation of the worst as the date changed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're thinking we may have to have a bottled water and flashlight promotion
soon" to get rid of all the extra supplies, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of regular customers and high-rollers at the city's casinos donned
black tie and evening gown to attend lavish invitation-only parties.
</P>
<P>
	   At Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino, they noshed on crab legs served on a
giant buffet whose centerpiece was a 3-foot tall ice-sculpted numeral "2000."
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the 12 casinos devoted two or more ballrooms to the parties, which
consisted of cocktail receptions, dinner and dancing to live bands.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's fantastic, it's exciting," said Rose Mansuetto, 75, of Brooklyn, N.Y.,
who attended one of the galas at Bally's Park Place.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in New Jersey, millennium celebrations ranged from the solemn to
the silly. Point Pleasant planned to mark the occasion by lowering "Mo The
Millennium Mossbunker," a 10-foot-long wooden replica of an Atlantic baitfish
outside a bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
	   Folks in Maplewood built a replica of Stonehenge out of cardboard boxes and
carpet tubes. And Nutley held "First Nut," capped by the planned lowering of a
giant acorn at the stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   On New Year's Day, duffers from 200 golf clubs were to hit a synchronized
"Millennium tee shot."
</P>
<P>
	   And Middlesex Borough electrician Tony Sasso has built his own illuminated
New Year's ball, which he was to drop down a 20-foot pole outside his home.
</P>
<P>
	   Aided by relatively mild temperatures in the 40s, alcohol-free First Night
celebrations drew thousands in communities from Medford to Montclair.
</P>
<P>
	   In Trenton, the Greater Trenton Symphony Orchestra played 20th century
favorites at the newly refurbished Trenton War Memorial and fireworks were set
off just outside the building at the stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   In Camden, a program of music, dancing, tree-lighting and a wedding was
staged at Wiggins Waterfront Park, looking over the Delaware River toward
Philadelphia, where a massive fireworks show was held at midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Religious celebrations also were held.
</P>
<P>
	   In Newark, Roman Catholic Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick celebrated "the
last Mass of the Millennium," at 11 p.m. in the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred
Heart.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Joseph's Hospital in Paterson claimed the first baby of the millennium.
Yordy Hernandez, 6 pounds, 8 ounces, was born to Felicia Hernandez, of Paterson,
at one second after midnight. Hernandez was watching the ball drop on Times
Square on television while in labor.
</P>
<P>
	   "They had the TV on in this room," hospital spokeswoman Angela Daidone said.
"She was pushing with the countdown. "The head and shoulders came out at one
second after midnight."

<HEADLINE> Millennium Gets Off to Wacky Start  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM J. KOLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Spaniards celebrated by swallowing a grape and making a wish. Skydivers
plunged toward shark-infested waters as they glimpsed the new millennium's first
dawn off the coast of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
	   And at the South Pole, researchers shed their coats and chilled the
champagne at -- brrr! -- 26 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid the fireworks and other festivities, there was plenty of wackiness to
spice up the world's welcome of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of New Year's revelers crammed into Madrid's Puerta del
Sol plaza to cheer the new millennium by swallowing a grape along with their
bubbly. The tradition dates to 1916, when vine cultivators devised the strategy
to take advantage of a bumper harvest.
</P>
<P>
	   Nowadays, it's so established that few Spaniards would consider celebrating
without 12 grapes ready to pop into their mouths -- one for each month of the
new year.
</P>
<P>
	   With parades and processions pretty much a dime a dozen, some people just
couldn't resist greeting the new year with a new twist.
</P>
<P>
	   In Sweden, 100 anglers braved freezing temperatures Friday to try to hook
the largest sea trout or salmon in a Stockholm fishing competition celebrating
the new millennium. The big ones got away, but a good time was had by all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to do this another time, although we didn't catch any fish,''
said competitor Ulla Christiernsson.
</P>
<P>
	   In southern France, cave explorer Michel Siffre was planning to celebrate
the new year a little late. He thinks Friday was Dec. 27 and small wonder: He
has been nearly 3,000 feet underground without a watch since Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the transition to 2000, Michel is taking his time,'' his support team
said in a statement. ``He lives in his cloistered world, with only his thoughts
and reading to battle solitude.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the rarefied air above the South Pacific, six skydivers bailed out over
the international date line at 12,000 feet Saturday to stake their claim to be
among the first to see the millennium dawn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The weather was perfect, the sea was calm and we could see each other all
the time,'' said team leader Severn Smith of New Zealand. He jumped with two
compatriots, two Scots and an American -- Susan Waterfield, 57, a police officer
with the Chatham County, Ga., police department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're speechless, exhilarated and overawed by the whole moment,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Far closer to terra firma, 20 adventurers in Slovenia decided to spend a
frigid midnight on a ski lift in the town of Pohorje. Fine, said bemused
government officials; there was no Y2K trouble reported -- who were they to stop
a little innocent fun?
</P>
<P>
	   At the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, the champagne had been on ice for
months when the base's 220 employees emerged, shucked off their usual
down-filled parkas and shivered outside for a subzero millennium countdown and
toast.
</P>
<P>
	   After an annual New Year's chore of moving the post that marks the South
Pole -- because the polar ice sheet drifts a bit each year -- they popped the
corks, sipped the bubbly and hurried back indoors.
</P>
<P>
	   As in many time zones, millennium twins were born in Berlin. But talk about
sibling rivalry: One came into the world a few minutes before midnight, the
other a few minutes after. They shared the same womb, but will have different
centuries on their birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
	   Even in troubled East Timor, whose independence leader predicted it would
become the first independent nation of the new millennium, 2000 got off to a
goofy start.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of East Timorese gathered in front of the governor's mansion in
Dili to sing a song composed just for the occasion. Trouble was, Nobel Peace
laureate Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo lives next door and complained about the
noise, ordering the celebrants to disperse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The party promptly ended ... leaving the head of the U.N. mission, the
leader of the international force in East Timor and an Australian clown hired
for the occasion alone on the stage at midnight,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
	   In San Francisco, the Ad Hoc Committee Against the New Millennium staged a
solemn march against the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Growing up in the '60s and '70s we were promised things like rocket cars,
space travel, alien encounters ... android sex slaves,'' said Horace
Higginbottom, who thinks the world has been cheated out of the future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What do we get instead? They gives us the lousy Internet, crummy
e-commerce.''

<HEADLINE> Nation's Timekeeper Says It's 19100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an ironic Y2K computer glitch, the nation's official
timekeeper reported the date as ``19100'' during the earliest hours of the new
year on its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Naval Observatory, whose master clock in Washington serves as the
nation's official source of time, published a Web page to track the time -- down
to the precise second -- exactly as the century ended.
</P>
<P>
	   But a bug in the programming of the Web site informed visitors that the
current date for U.S. time zones that had already passed midnight was Jan. 1,
19100.
</P>
<P>
	   No one from within the Naval Observatory's computer department could be
reached immediately for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The government relies upon the Naval Observatory to determine precisely the
positions and motions of the Earth, moon, planets and stars to calculate the
exact time.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Alexandria Bay, N.Y., border crossing with Canada was

indicated possible chemical residue in a vehicle, the U.S. Customs Service said.

	   The crossing at the Thousand Island Bridge was reopened after inspectors
concluded the vehicle held no explosives, Customs spokesman Dennis Murphy said.
</P>

was called to the port. The crossing east of Buffalo was opened shortly after 1

<HEADLINE> No Sign of Hijackers After Deadline  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) -- Waving pistols in the air, five hijackers sped
off in waiting cars Friday with two Islamic militants and a Muslim cleric
released from Indian jails and escaped the country -- ending a tense eight-day
standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   All 155 hostages on the Indian Airlines plane were freed unharmed, but the
crisis -- the longest hijacking drama in more than a decade -- highlighted the
explosive nature of the long-running dispute over the Himalayan territory of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement made between India, the hijackers and the Taliban
militia who rule most of Afghanistan, the hijackers agreed to end the eight-day
crisis and free the hostages in exchange for the three prominent militants, who
were being held in Indian jails.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers and their three associates sped away at sunset in four-wheel
drive vehicles from the Kandahar airport, where they had kept the hostages in an
Indian Airlines plane parked on the tarmac. They also had one new hostage -- a
Taliban soldier who was to guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday morning, a Taliban official said the hijackers had crossed the
border. He did not say where they escaped to -- but most likely it was into
Pakistan, which shares a long, porous border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Taliban hostage has come back to Kandahar and (the hijackers) have
gone from the country,'' Taliban spokesman Rehnatullah Aga said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the freed hostages received a thunderous welcome in New Delhi,
with thousands of relatives, airport employees, bystanders, police and
journalists applauding and cheering as they landed from Kandahar and emerged one
at a time into the terminal at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Joyful relatives hoisted the survivors on their shoulders or tossed them
into the air. The plane's crew were carried through the terminal with garlands
around their necks. One old woman hugged her son until she fainted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were so terrorized nobody will be able to understand,'' said Indian
businessman R.K. Ghosh. ``... most of the time they told us: 'Keep your heads
down. If you see us we will shoot you.'''
</P>
<P>
	   While the hijackers dropped several demands during negotiations -- including
the release of 36 militants imprisoned in India -- they did win the release of
cleric Masood Azhar, a leader of Harkat ul-Ansar, a group on a U.S. list of
terrorist organizations. The group is believed to have its training camps in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The other prisoners released by India were Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, chief
commander of the rebel group Ul-Umar Mujahideen, and Ahmad Omar Sayed Sheikh,
who was held in a New Delhi prison. The three were flown to Afghanistan and the
exchange happened shortly before sunset.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the passengers appeared harmed as the crisis ended, though one
Indian passenger was killed shortly after the plane was seized Dec. 24 on a
flight from Katmandu, Nepal to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the hostage-release deal, the Taliban said Friday afternoon it would
not act against the hijackers for 10 hours -- a grace period that expires before
dawn Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban sent a heavily armed group of soldiers with the fleeing
hijackers to ensure that they left Afghanistan promptly.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan strongly denounced the hijacking, but has little control over its
lengthy western border that may have been used as an escape route.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hijackings are particularly abhorrent to us,'' said Pakistan's Foreign
Ministry. ``We have no sympathy for such desperate acts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Much remained at stake Friday for the Taliban, who have been ostracized
internationally and are now under U.N. sanctions for refusing U.S. demands to
hand over Osama bin Laden, a Saudi-born militant accused bombing two U.S.
embassies in Africa in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Taliban act against the hijackers, it could help improve their poor
international standing. But if the hijackers disappear, the Taliban's reputation
as a host for Islamic extremists will likely grow.
</P>
<P>
	   The names and nationalities of the hijackers remained a mystery, though they
carried out their acts in support of Kashmir militants, who want either
independence from India or union with Muslim Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking drama ended peacefully, but demonstrated the volatile nature
of the long-running dispute over Kashmir, the leading source of friction between
India and Pakistan. Both nations hold part of Kashmir and claim all of it.
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan traded recriminations during the latest hijacking crisis,
placing further strain on already bad relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said afterward that ``there is no
bowing to terrorism.'' The three prisoners, who had been convicted of terrorism,
were released only to protect the lives of the hostages, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came here in a purely humanitarian capacity,'' Singh told a news
conference shortly after the episode ended.
</P>
<P>
	   After the ordeal ended, some passengers were still trembling with fear, and
one teen-age boy was sobbing, according to Abdul Qadir, a Taliban soldier who
helped take the passengers off the plane. Some of the older passengers were
placed in wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So many times I thought I would never come back alive,'' said passenger
Rajiv Ahuja. ``Most of the time we were blindfolded.''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- With huge mariachi concerts and remembrances of their
long history, Mexicans rang in the new millennium at ancient pyramids,
centuries-old plazas and in the streets of the world's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are a country that doesn't measure its history in years, nor centuries,
but in millennia,'' President Ernesto Zedillo reminded his countrymen in a
broadcast address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A thousand years ago, the Mayans had already passed their highest point of
glory, and we are just now barely beginning to decipher their writing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Those ancient Mayans supplied the backdrops for some of Friday's most
dramatic celebrations of the new millennium. Orchestras performed simultaneous
concerts at pyramid sites at the ruins of three Mayan cities in Yucatan.
</P>
<P>
	   From the afternoon on, the party in Mexico City swayed to as many as 400
mariachi, salsa and rock groups, and thousands flocked to a parade of
flower-decked floats, topped with celebrities, along 50 blocks of Avenida
Reforma, the city's main east-west avenue.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers expected at least 80,000 people to attend the $3 million bash.
Hundreds of police in uniform and plainclothes were deployed all day to keep
order.
</P>
<P>
	   In Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city and birthplace of the
trumpet-based mariachi musical style, 100 mariachi groups gave a huge brassy
concert at a main square.
</P>
<P>
	   More spiritual celebrations took place just north of Mexico City at
Teotihuacan, site of some of Mexico's oldest pyramids.
</P>
<P>
	   Dressed in white clothing and red ribbons to symbolize blood -- the life
force -- members of the Tlahuizcalpan group gathered at sunset at the Pyramid of
the Sun to hold hands, blow shell horns, burn tree-bark incense and ``give
thanks for the new year,'' said group leader Leon Cortes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico was considered well prepared for the Y2K computer bug. But just in
case, the state oil monopoly Pemex, airlines and government agencies kept
technical crews on 24-hour alert.
</P>
<P>
	   No technological problems were reported. ``All flights continued as normal
... all equipment is operating correctly,'' Assistant Transportation Secretary
Aaron Dichter said of operations in Mexico's airspace.

<HEADLINE> Panama Celebrates Control of Canal  </HEADLINE>
   By ELOY O. AGUILAR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- As the first ships of the new millennium sailed
smoothly through the locks today, Panamanians celebrated the New Year, and above
all, the handover of the Panama Canal and the U.S-held territory that had long
cut this nation in two.
</P>
<P>
	   Firecrackers exploded throughout Panama City at midnight, and the canal went
on working normally, with no Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 ships moving through the 50-mile chain of locks and channels had no
reported problems, said Panama's Civil Defense Director, Moises Ortega. The
United States handed the canal to Panama in a ceremony earlier Friday, ending
nearly a century of American jurisdiction over one of the world's most strategic
waterways.
</P>
<P>
	   In that jubilant ceremony alongside the canal administration building,
President Mireya Moscoso and U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera signed a document
formalizing Panama's possession of the canal and a surrounding strip of land
that until recently was home to U.S. military and civilian installations.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds roared and released red, white and blue balloons as the Panamanian
flag was raised -- for the first time, alone -- over the canal headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will be no more fences, no more signs blocking our entrance. The
canal is ours and may God bless it,'' Moscoso said just before raising the flag,
as thousands of people jumped in the air and swirled their shirts over their
heads in joy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We didn't feel sovereign with this enclave in our heart,'' said Candelario
Rodriguez, a 61-year-old peasant from western Panama. ``This has great meaning
to us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The stars and stripes didn't flutter over the ceremony. It had been lowered
the day before in a quiet ceremony attended by U.S. Ambassador Simon Ferro.
Panamanian officials said the Americans were trying to avoid embarrassment at
Friday's event.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Panamanians said the United States had lost yet another opportunity to
commemorate the handover as a gesture -- not of weakness, but of respect for a
smaller nation.
</P>
<P>
	   The handover was the culmination of a process that started 22 years ago,
when military strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos and President Jimmy Carter signed the
treaties that set the transition period and transfer date of the canal, a marvel
of early century engineering, and the surrounding Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor refused Friday to
block transfer of the canal. Judicial Watch, a conservative legal foundation,
had applied for a court order that would have temporarily restrained the
turnover.
</P>
<P>
	   The 20-mile by 50-mile strip that makes up the Canal Zone, filled with U.S.
military and civilian installations, cut across Panama and was often seen as a
remnant of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
	   Its origins are linked to the beginnings of the nation. The United States
supported Panama's drive for independence from Colombia in 1903. After
independence, Panama signed a treaty with Washington for the construction of a
canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The United States was given
360,000 acres along the waterway.
</P>
<P>
	   Since, relations between Panama and the United States were strained at times
over the issue of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of jubilant Panamanians attended the ceremony, and greeted with
cheers the hoisting of Panama's flag over the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the culmination of a pending account,'' said Alcibiades Picota, a
17-year-old student marching with a Panamanian flag. ``This is the achievement
of complete sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 8,000 public high school students marched from Panama City to Balboa
High School, a former U.S. Defense Department school run mainly for Americans in
Panama, where they raised the Panamanian flag.
</P>
<P>
	   They were led by six students who marched the same route in 1964, only to be
rebuffed by U.S. Marines who opened fire and killed 23 marchers. Panama
suspended diplomatic relations with the United States and the controversy helped
spark the negotiations that eventually led to the transfer treaties.
</P>
<P>
	   With the transfer, the Panama Canal Commission, a U.S. government agency, on
Friday became the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous corporation with its own
budget that will administer the canal. Nearly 1,400 ships pass through every
year, bringing more than $600 million in tolls.
</P>
<P>
	   A special government agency handling the return of the canal areas now has
more than $1.5 billion in pledged investments in tourist and development
projects in the former military bases.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscoso said the transfer ``imposes challenges and obligations for ourselves
and future generations'' and urged that the canal be treated as a ``state
matter, free of all passion and political interest.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Takes Hostages at Kansas Bank  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. (AP) -- A woman who said she was upset about losing her job and
had no hope for the future took a group of bank employees hostage Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman and two hostages remained inside the suburban Kansas City bank
late Friday night, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier police reports that two suspects were involved in the standoff were
incorrect, said Olathe police Lt. Larry Griffin, who did not give any more
details.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't immediately clear how many people were initially taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of at least five people left the bank just before 10 p.m. and were
taken by police, said Lt. Joe Pruett of the Olathe Police Department.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said those five people were not taken hostage, but
had managed to hide inside the building and then escape. He had no other details
on where the people had been hiding or how they got out of the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the bank employees inside the building had earlier called KMBC-TV and
said everyone was being treated well.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-taker then took the phone and said she was upset because she had
lost her job, her family and all hope for the future. She said she would release
the hostages if she could talk to a friend named Sean.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once I talk to Sean, then I'll talk to them, that's when it all ends,''
the suspect said. ``I want to talk to Sean face-to-face first before I talk to
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, she yelled to the hostages, ``Are you being harmed?'' and
people in the background were heard saying ``No.''
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of injuries in the bank, and police said no shots had
been fired although the woman was believed to have a handgun.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman entered the Bank of America branch, a free-standing building in an
Olathe shopping district, as it was closing shortly after 5 p.m. on New Year's
Eve, Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   With a SWAT team surrounding the building, police tried negotiating with the
woman by phone. Officials said the woman had abruptly broken off talks at least
once.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were tipped by a frantic call from inside the bank, Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The police department had increased the number of officers on patrol in case
of trouble New Year's Eve, and an officer was in the area when the call came in,
Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the standoff, one hostage walked outside the bank, retrieved
something from a car belonging to the suspect and went back inside, Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials would not release further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Lanza said the incident was the Kansas City area's first hostage situation
at a bank in about nine years.

<HEADLINE> Many People Bugged About Y2K Hype  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The worst of the Y2K computer bug may be yet to come. But for now, anyway,
many people around the world are wondering what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
	   The cash machines worked. Air traffic wasn't disrupted. The lights stayed
on. Those were the main concerns for most people, far more important than
spreadsheet problems and other business glitches that may not become apparent
until Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's much ado over nothing. I think it's silly,'' said Dee Garvin,
of Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she had one gallon of bottled water at home, which is normal, and
wasn't going to buy more. ``That's OK, because I have plenty of beer,'' her
husband, Charles, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the fact that most things operated smoothly today, officials warned
that it may take days or weeks for problems to become apparent. Many people
feared that computers might misread the year 2000 as 1900 and cause systems to
shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   At about 3 a.m. this morning in Paris, Moroccan student Mounir Bennani
hesitantly approached the ATM at a Banque Nationale de Paris branch on the
city's grandest avenue, the Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to work, I hope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, after the machine dispensed some cash: ``They really played up the Y2K
bug, didn't they?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Mouse That Didn't Roar,'' read a headline in today's Bangkok Post
newspaper about the Y2K crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Early revelers on the historic downtown plaza in Santa Fe, N.M., Friday
night seemed unfazed by the potential for Y2K mishaps.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it's no big deal,'' said Jim Baker, 48, a financial consultant
from Austin, Texas, who brought his 2 1/2-year-old son to the plaza.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker, whose family joined friends for a vacation in Santa Fe, said: ``If
there is a challenge it will be a blip ... and nobody will notice any difference
in six months.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dustin McCullogh gassed up his pickup Friday in Albuquerque, but not because
of Y2K. ``I just picked up my truck from the shop and I needed gas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not too concerned. I'm going to wake up tomorrow and I'm going to have
heat, water and electricity.''
</P>
<P>
	   In December, people in Finland hoarded iodine pills, believed to stave off
radiation sickness, in fear of accidents at nuclear power stations across the
Russian border in St. Petersburg and the Russian Kola Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems people overreacted,'' said Heikki Reponen of Norway's Radiation
and Nuclear Safety Authority said. ``But iodine pills are good to have in the
medicine chest anyway.''
</P>
<P>
	   Becky Grichar of West Covina, Calif., said she tried to shop at a
supermarket this week but it was so crowded she walked out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At least every other person had 24 rolls of toilet paper in their
baskets,'' Grichar said. ``I'm not sure what they are preparing for.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I bought dog food,'' Grichar said. She said she has two dogs and ``they
are Y2K ready.''

<HEADLINE> New York crowd at almost 2 million welcomes in 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - It looked like a traditional New Year's Eve as lights
from 90 pyramid-shaped mirrors on the Times Square crystal ball danced across
expectant faces. But as the new millennium arrived, the chorus of nearly 2
million that arose in greeting surpassed tradition.
<P>
	   The mass of revelers surged north from the ball's home at One Times Square
nearly to Central Park, almost 20 blocks. The party was to go on for 24 hours -
marking hour-by-hour the advent of 2000 in each of the world's time zones.
</P>
<P>
	   The $7 million show featured a 16-foot elephant puppet to celebrate New
Year's in India, Lakota Sioux dancers from the American West and a figure of
Father Time operated by eight puppeteers.
</P>
<P>
	   The performances by some 500 dancers, singers and puppeteers started when it
was midnight in New Zealand (7 a.m. Friday in New York) and was to end with the
new century arriving 24 hours later at Nuku Hiva, an island in the Marquesas
chain (6 a.m. Saturday New York time).
</P>
<P>
	   The event - and the audience - gave truth to Times Square's nickname as
Crossroads of the World. Japanese, French and Britons watched as celebrations
from their homelands flashed across giant television screens.
</P>
<P>
	   They came despite fears of terrorism, made sharper by the arrest on Thursday
in Brooklyn of a man suspected of links to Algerian radicals and a bomb scare
before midday Friday. Police had welded shut manholes and locked mailboxes to
eliminate hiding places for bombs. In the end, they arrested only about a dozen
people for minor rowdiness.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Vasquez, 20, said he worried about terrorism but still drove from
Minneapolis, Minn., with several friends.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great to still be alive," Vasquez said. "I want to tell my grandkids
that we were here."
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he was relieved because there were worries
"right up to the last minute," but he cited the cooperation of everyone in New
York for a peaceful evening.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the most diverse city in the world," Giuliani said. "It shows that we
can get along, we can have a great celebration, we can do it peacefully."
</P>
<P>
	   There had been fears, too, of millennial blackouts should the feared Y2K
computer glitch prove a reality. But New York's utility, Consolidated Edison,
made good on its promise to light Times Square and the city with 7 billion watts
- the equivalent of 70 million 100-watt lightbulbs.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, people praised the police trying to protect against total
overcrowding, but Zarar Aflam from London complained that officers who turned
him away from 45th Street and told him to head 20 blocks north were too zealous
about crowd control.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm quite appalled with the system," Aflam said. "We spent so much money to
come here. They've overdone it with the precautions."
</P>
<P>
	   Others from abroad were delighted, however.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted to come to New York for the millennium, and now my dream has come
true," said Tiago Depuydt of Veurne, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   As much as the elaborate international displays, Times Square's own bright
lights seemed part of the show when New York's New Year arrived after 17 hours
of celebrations for the millennium's appearance around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Mary Ann Hopkins, a New York medical professor and volunteer with the
group that won this year's Nobel Peace Prize, had pushed the button to lower the
traditional crystal ball in her first time at a Times Square New Year.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's thrilling to be a part of it," she said. "The energy of the people is
exhilarating, and that's what I like to do in medicine - work with people."

Rocky Mountain States Ring in Year 2000
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Celebrations in cities across western United States ranged
from extravagant to low-budget as the final hours of 1999 came to a close. In
downtown Denver, the Tabor Center offered a $99,000 package that included a
luxury car, a champagne reception and 50 theater tickets. At "Celebration 2000"
in Phoenix, Ariz., however, revelers waited in long lines for hot dogs and
thousands wandered the streets in bizarre hats, glowing headbands, and antenna
topped with wobbly illuminated balls. Worries over terrorism and computer bugs
were brushed aside as a party mood took hold.

Clinton Welcomes New Millennium
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed the new millennium by invoking
a hope for "the triumph of peace and harmony" in America and beyond. Even has he
greeted the 21st century, Clinton had warm words for the expiring one. Speaking
on the stairs of the Lincoln Memorial moments before the National Mall erupted
in a blaze of fireworks, Clinton said, "We Americans must not fear change.
Instead, let us welcome it, embrace it and create it."

Some Computers Jump Ahead 17,100 Years
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- While computer programmers feared that the year 2000 would
cause internal clocks to roll back a century, a few systems jumped ahead 17,100
years instead. Forecasting maps at the French weather service and the Web site
for the U.S. Naval Observatory were among the systems that initially displayed
the New Year Day date as Jan. 1, 19100. Computer programming experts say the
display error results from a function that calculates the year as a number
beyond 1900 -- for example, 76 for 1976 and 100 for 2000. Computers that treat
the year as 19 followed that number would display 19100. In general, however,
computers silently switched to 2000 in country after anxious country Saturday,
but the dreaded Y2K bug's first bite was barely felt.

No Sign of Hijackers After Deadline

	   KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) -- At dawn Saturday, there was no sign of the
five hijackers who sped off 10 hours earlier after releasing all 155 hostages on
the Indian Airlines plane they hijacked eight days earlier. Under the agreement
made between India, the hijackers and the Taliban militia who rule most of
Afghanistan, the hijackers agreed to end the eight-day crisis and free the
hostages in exchange for the three prominent militants, who were being held in
Indian jails. The hijackers were given 10 hours to find freedom. Their most
likely destination is the poorly guarded Pakistani border, just a few hours

<HEADLINE> Clinton and Yeltsin Remain Friendly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boris Yeltsin ebulliently called him ``Beel.'' Bill
Clinton said he admired the Russian president's forthrightness.
</P>
<P>
	   When the two men said goodbye after a phone conversation Friday they
remained at odds over Russia's crackdown on Chechnya. While they hadn't spoken
in more than a month, Yeltsin said he wanted to keep in touch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very glad that I was your friend,'' Yeltsin told President Clinton.
``I will continue to be your friend.''
</P>
<P>
	   For seven years, Clinton and Yeltsin hugged, laughed and disagreed with each
other so regularly they at times seemed more like fraternity brothers than heads
of state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I liked him because he was always very forthright with me,'' Clinton told
reporters after Yeltsin's unexpected announcement Friday that he'd resigned.
``He always did exactly what he said he would do.''
</P>
<P>
	   If they were an improbable pair, their separate struggles bonded them as
friends and mutual defenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton would declare the sickly Yeltsin robust, even when his health was
clearly in decline. Yeltsin would wrap Clinton in bear hugs, as if to cheer up a
president laid low by impeachment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had our arguments, we had our fights, we had our genuine disagreement
about our national interests from time to time,'' Clinton said. ``But I think
that the Russian people were well-served to have a leader who honestly believes
that their votes ought to determine who was running the show in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Between mood swings, Clinton and Yeltsin could find each other hilarious.
Once, they met at Franklin Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park, N.Y., in October 1995.
Until then, Clinton and Yeltsin had talked mostly on the fringes of economic
summits, and there had been speculation that the session would be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   When they emerged from their talks, Yeltsin stood before reporters and
bellowed: ``Now, for the first time, I can tell you that YOU'RE a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, standing beside him, turned red as a beet and laughed until tears
ran from his eyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Letters and phone calls often flew between the two men. In September, with
Yeltsin in the midst of a money-laundering scandal, it was the much-investigated
Clinton who talked to him by phone for an hour, encouraging him to cooperate
with investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   As Clinton grappled with the NATO bombing mission in Yugoslavia earlier in
the year, it was Yeltsin who dispatched former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin to serve as a diplomatic intermediary, even though Yeltsin was a
virulent critic of the NATO campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin sent a congratulatory note for Clinton's 50th birthday three years
ago. But Yeltsin also chewed Clinton out for ordering air strikes on Afghanistan
and Sudan in retaliation for U.S. embassy bombings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am indignant,'' Yeltsin said. ``I didn't know that this strike would be
carried out, and that means the whole world was unaware of that. And this makes
the strike even more indecent.''
</P>
<P>
	   A month ago, it was Clinton's turn to do the chewing out, this time over
Russia's military crackdown on rebels in Chechnya. Yeltsin seemed sore over
growing international objections to Russia's actions, saying other countries
were meddling in an internal Russian affair.
</P>
<P>
	   During a meeting at a multinational summit in Turkey, Clinton reminded
Yeltsin that not too long ago, the Russian himself was a rebel who climbed atop
a tank to make the case for freedom, and who enjoyed the support of the very
nations he was now telling to butt out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your standing there on that tank said to those people, 'You can do this,
but you'll have to kill me first,''' Clinton said. ``If they had put you in jail
instead of electing you president, I would hope that every leader of every
country around this table would have stood up for you and for freedom in Russia
and not said, 'Well, that is an internal Russian affair that we cannot be a part
of.'''
</P>
<P>
	   The remarks only rankled Yeltsin even more -- so much so that he said: ``Mr.
Clinton has forgotten Russia is a great power that possesses a nuclear
arsenal.''
</P>
<P>
	   But their conversation Friday bore no traces of that chilly exchange.
Clinton told Yeltsin he believed historians would label him ``someone who guided
Russia to the point of democracy, where power is transferred by constitutional
and civil means,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin promised that he was leaving Russia in the hands of ``a strong,
intelligent, capable man'' in Vladimir Putin, Lockhart said, and immediately
Clinton said he would support Yeltsin's successor.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Clinton fell back into his usual mode as Yeltsin's defender.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president did say he was glad to hear him sounding so strong and
vigorous,'' Lockhart said. ``I believe the word was 'chipper.'''

<HEADLINE> Teens Ring in Year in 'Catacombs'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Jennifer Buttry couldn't think of a better way to
welcome 2000 than spending New Year's Eve with friends in candlelit
``catacombs'' assembled in church basements and other secluded places.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd rather be doing something like this because I've never been involved
in the alcohol or the drugs, and that's what a lot of New Year's is about,''
said Ms. Buttry, 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian youths around the country spent the last hours of 1999 playing
games, nibbling at food and discussing issues of faith as part of the ``The
Catacomb Project: Hope for 2000 and Beyond.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was developed by the United Methodist Publishing House in Nashville,
Tenn. The program, based on a study course of the Bible, is intended to reach
100,000 teen-agers nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The overall purpose is to give kids hope for being a Christian and for the
next millennium,'' said the Rev. Candace Lansberry, associate pastor of Paradise
Valley (Ariz.) United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Buttry was among eight young people, ages 12 to 19, who gathered in the
basement of Steve and Tammy Hodge's home. All attend Fairlawn United Methodist
Church and tried focusing on the trying times of first- and second-century
Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know they were persecuted back then but I didn't know how much, and it's
lifted my faith up, almost being in their shoes,'' Cole Cartwright, 12, said
during a break in the activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the group went to an 18-by-8-foot candlelit room in the basement
meticulously redone to resemble an ancient stone catacomb.
</P>
<P>
	   Biblical passages, religious symbols and drawings adorned the walls. An
altar on one wall was topped by 40 candles, one for each known country in the
world where people regularly face persecution for their religious beliefs, Hodge
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope they come out with a better understanding of what Christianity had
to go through, because there were a lot of people who were persecuted in the
past and are being persecuted today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Youths taking part in the project spend a couple of hours in the catacombs
praying and discussing faith and Christianity, without benefit of Bibles, hymn
books or other religious publications.
</P>
<P>
	   Karen Lucas, 15, who recently started attending Fairlawn, said she would
much rather spend New Year's Eve strengthening her religious convictions than at
a party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought this would be a lot more fun because I've gotten to really know
these people,'' she said. ``I've got no regrets. This is the best thing that's
ever happened to me.''

<HEADLINE> World Greets Year 2000 Safely  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCUS ELIASON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Millions joyously packed the city streets of Europe and the Americas to join
in a worldwide welcome for the new millennium, ignoring fears of terrorist
attack and computer collapse to revel in a shimmering spectacle of song, light
and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   From South Sea islands to the southernmost city in the world, from the
Eiffel Tower to New York's Times Square, they partied and prayed for a better
world.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop of a huge crystal ball in Times Square, a ritual almost as old as
the century, set off an explosion of fireworks, cheering and tears as the
millennium came to the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with choreographed spectacle came reminders Friday of the turmoil of
the dying century -- political upheaval in Russia and the dramatic end of a
hijacking in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Woven together by satellite TV, the world's nearly 200 countries, in their
24 time zones, became a jamboree of disparate cultures -- South Pacific
islanders singing Handel's ``Hallelujah'' chorus, Buddhist monks praying for
peace in Japan, a German choir singing in a church in Nazareth, Israel, and a
huge French-made bell tolling a welcome in Newport, Ky. for each time zone
entering 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Fireworks lighted up the skies over Rome, where Pope John Paul II gave
thanks for humanity's triumphs and asked forgiveness for its sins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What suffering, what dramatic events!'' the frail 79-year-old pontiff said
of the 1900s. ``But, also, what incredible achievements.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1 million people packed Times Square, ``crossroads of the world,''
for the biggest, splashiest American celebration, guarded by 8,000 police, some
equipped to deal with bombs and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, President Clinton helped stow artifacts of 20th century
America -- including Army dog tags and a public library card -- into a time
capsule to be opened at the 21st century's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, he led the nation in splashy celebrations and predicted humankind
will turn away from bigotry, oppression and poverty. ``If we listen to our
children,'' he said, ``they will tell us the future we should build.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the millennial midnight rolled across the country, Americans celebrated
in ways large and small, at Las Vegas spectaculars, at corner bars, in simple
toasts on family homesteads.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a half-million thronged Chicago's lakefront to see the sky set
ablaze with fireworks. But downstate, in Springfield, Ill., Ethel Stephens made
it a private observance, paying a hospital visit to husband Byron, suffering
respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just going to stay with him until after midnight and then I'll go
home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   People everywhere worried about the potential for Y2K technological trouble.
But they breathed a little easier as the 1999-to-2000 date changes failed to
awaken any immediate disruptions of the world's major computer systems. Experts
cautioned, however, that problems could still arise in the next few days or even
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   But even on this most widely celebrated midnight in history, amid the
fireworks, prayers and revelry, old hatreds and unscripted events surfaced.
</P>
<P>
	   An hour before Tonga and Kiribati in the south Pacific became the first
countries to welcome 2000, Boris Yeltsin announced he was resigning the Russian
presidency to make way for Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia must enter the new millennium with new politicians, with new faces,
with new intelligent, strong, energetic people, and we who have been in power
for many years must go,'' the 68-year-old Yeltsin told his people over
television.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a gesture to democracy that would have been unimaginable until the
collapse of communism in the last years of the century -- a century of tumult
that began with world war, split the atom, spliced the gene and pitted East
against West in Cold War and proxy wars.
</P>
<P>
	   As Yeltsin was making his announcement, word came that the hijack drama in
Afghanistan had ended peacefully after eight days.
</P>
<P>
	   Both events highlighted the unpredictability of a world that has never
marched to the mathematical beat of a calendar. Those who inherit the new
century can expect huge strides in medicine to lengthen their lives, and in
communications to bring nations closer together. But genetic engineering and the
globalization of culture and commerce is expected to produce ethical dilemmas
and conflicts undreamed of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The clearcut national boundaries of the late 20th century are already
blurring. Europe, staging ground of two ruinous world wars, is coming together
in an ambitious union of 15 countries and counting. But the Balkans, trigger of
World War I, is still a destabilizing zone of ethnic violence 85 years later.
</P>
<P>
	   As if to illustrate the borderless nature of today's conflicts, a quiet
Pakistani enclave of New York woke up on the century's next-to-last day to the
spectacle of American law agents swarming through the streets hunting for
suspects in an alleged Arab terrorist plot.
</P>
<P>
	   The freeing of 155 hostages from a hijacked Indian Airlines jetliner,
innocent victims of a half-century struggle over Indian-controlled Kashmir, came
as the welcome for 2000 was in full swing.
</P>
<P>
	   The capitals of Europe, the continent that dominated the past millennium,
put on dazzling spectacles. From London to Lisbon, and Rome to Reykjavik,
1,000-year-old cathedrals and medieval citadels of trade were lit up by laser
lights and pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
	   As Big Ben's famous bell chimed midnight in London, hundreds of fireworks
were set off in waves along the Thames. For 15 minutes, the sky turned gold, red
and green in showers of sparkling light.
</P>
<P>
	   At midnight, Queen Elizabeth II toasted the new millennium with a glass of
champagne and kissed her husband, Prince Philip, on the cheek. They linked arms
with Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, and sang ``Auld Lang
Syne.''
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland, savoring the promise of peace after decades of political
and religious strife dating back to the 1600s, drew huge crowds to celebrations
in its main cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 2 million people massed in central Berlin. And even Albania, Europe's
poorest country, splurged on an hour-long fireworks show in Tirana, the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The people of a disintegrated Yugoslavia, winners and losers in a wave of
civil wars in the 1990s, welcomed the new millennium with hopes for new,
peaceful beginnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Bosnia reported no Y2K problems -- since its older computers were destroyed
in its 1992-95 war and the newer ones ane thought to be Y2K- proof.
</P>
<P>
	   The show began at 5 a.m. EST near the international date line in the south
Pacific, and swept westward, giving pause -- at the end of a speeded-up century
of shortened memory -- for reflection on the past.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tokyo, a focal point of celebrations was the Meiji Shrine, destroyed in
World War II and rebuilt, like much of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Signs of Asia's long-running conflicts haunted the festivities.
</P>
<P>
	   South Koreans gathered at their barbed-wire border with North Korea to pray
for peace, and more than 3,500 prison inmates, including two convicted North
Korean spies, were released in a millennium amnesty. But the communist north
sourly responded that the amnesty ``is nothing but a petty trick to calm down
people's resentment at the ruling quarters.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak marked the last day of
the century with a prediction that peace was coming to a country at war for 50
years. ``The decisive moment is very near, even within a few months, and we
should ready our hearts appropriately,'' he wrote in a newspaper article.
</P>
<P>
	   Yasser Arafat, leader of a Palestinian people homeless for 50 years,
promised statehood early in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   Bethlehem, Jesus' birthplace, greeted the new millennium with 2,000 doves
soaring above a floodlit Manger Square. Tens of thousands of Palestinians
cheered as fireworks lighted the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   In stark contrast, many streets of nearby Jerusalem were deserted. Orthodox
Jews, oblivious to the millennium hoopla, observed the 17th Sabbath of the
Hebrew calendar year 5760 at home with traditional Friday evening meals and
prayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent history -- South Africa's Nelson Mandela revisiting the prison cell
he occupied until 1990 -- became bound up in images of the ancient past --
Egypt's pyramids, built more than 2,000 years before the birth of Christ, or
hikers in the Grand Canyon descending through 120,000 years of geological strata
with every step they took.
</P>
<P>
	   The Western calendar is the world's calendar in its everyday business, but
it is hardly a universal timekeeper. Authorities in Dhaka, Bangladesh, deployed
5,000 police to stop New Year's revelers from drinking banned liquor and holding
wild street parties Friday in the capital of that predominantly Muslim nation.
</P>
<P>
	   And, strictly speaking, the millennium doesn't really begin until 2000 is
over, as Arthur C. Clarke, celebrated author of the ``2001'' series of
science-fiction novels, reminded the world Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, I think it is a good excuse to make the whole of 2000 one long
party,'' the British-born author told the AP at his home in Sri Lanka. ``But
this is not the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
	   His analogy:
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the scale of your grocer's weighing machine began at 1 instead of 0,
would you be happy when he claims he had sold you 10 kilograms of tea? And it is
exactly the same with time. We will have had only 99 years of this century by
Jan. 1, 2000. We will have to wait until December 31, 2000, for the full
hundred.''

<HEADLINE> Prayers, dances and a few worries in the suburbs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Praying on a hilltop, monitoring computers in
an underground bunker or just dancing to the oldies, residents of the northern
suburbs met the year 2000 with considerable awe and a little relief.
<P>
	   "There's something a little bit cosmic about this New Year's," said Ed Moran
of Peekskill, after jitterbugging at Westchester County's alcohol-free First
Night party in White Plains. "When you start thinking about millenniums you
start thinking about time and space. We should all have been thinking more about
the big picture and less about some computer glitch."
</P>
<P>
	   That glitch, the much-anticipated Y2K computer bug, was not in evidence
despite an aggressive search concentrated at Westchester's emergency command
center in the sub-basement of the county office building.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems we were well prepared," County Executive Andrew Spano said early
today. "Whatever we've done to meet this day has worked."
</P>
<P>
	   A couple of hundred county workers were on the job, along with
party-deprived representatives of Consolidated Edison, Bell Atlantic, the Red
Cross, the FBI, state and county police and more. They sat at mostly silent
phones into the wee hours and reported no interruptions in phone or electric
service, no problems at nuclear plants or sewage treatment plants, no need for
hospital beds or emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   Orange &AMP; Rockland Utilities, across the Hudson River, also reported no
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   A spot check of stores in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam counties found
good crowds but no shortages in advance of midnight, except for a lack of 9-volt
batteries at a Mount Vernon candy store. The clerk blamed that on Christmas toys
rather than millennial hoarding.
</P>
<P>
	   Lydia Scotto, who had a cart full of diapers, water and motor oil at the
Costco warehouse store in New Rochelle, said, "I suppose this is all for
nothing, but if bad things happened and I wasn't prepared, I'd be upset with
myself."
</P>
<P>
	   At the big new Stew Leonard's grocery in Yonkers, manager John Iniguez said
there was heavy demand for bottled water, but nothing he couldn't handle.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a big crowd, sure, but honestly it's a lot of party shopping," Iniguez
said. "I don't think people are buying fresh meat and fish to stock up."
</P>
<P>
	   There was no obvious hoarding of cash, either. A test of six automated
teller machines found cash in all of them Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   A much-publicized "Millennium Moms" contest for the first baby at White
Plains Hospital Center was somewhat sabotaged by 10-pound, 7-ounce Jason Smith,
who was born to Darlene and Christopher Smith of Valhalla at 12:05 a.m. - at
nearby St. Agnes Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   At Graymoor, the Franciscan friary in Putnam County, brothers in robes and
guests in fancy dress gathered on the hill known as Holy Mountain and sang "Holy
God, We Praise Thy Name" just before midnight. When a church bell rang in the
new year, they answered it with a variety of handbells. Then they walked in a
torchlight procession to midnight Mass.

<HEADLINE> Twins Born in Different Centuries  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Separated by the stroke of midnight, at least three sets of twins were born
on opposite sides of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   The births occurred in Indianapolis, Fairfax, Va., and Berlin, Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis nor parents Julie and Tim Wallman
planned the births to coincide with history, said hospital spokeswoman Leslie
Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The husband told a funny story when he got to the emergency room, that he
had taken her to the mall today and walked her over and over to get her into
labor,'' Smith said. ``I do know that she came into the hospital already in
labor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jacob Wallman was born at 11:59 p.m. Friday. His sister, Jordan, was
delivered at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Berlin, a 25-year-old Bulgarian mother first gave birth to Mircem, four
minutes before the end of 1999, doctors at St. Joseph's Hospital said. A minute
into New Year's Day, his brother Mircan followed.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital refused to identify the mother, but indicated all three were in
good health.
</P>
<P>
	   At Inova Fairfax Hospital in Virginia, a woman gave birth to a girl at 11:52
p.m., making her the one of the last Virginians born in the 1900s. The baby
girl's brother then arrived at 12:01 p.m. The hospital refused to identify the
mother.

<HEADLINE> Calm reported inside prisons as 2000 arrives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - No immediate signs of a possible strike or other
form of protest by disgruntled state prison inmates were apparent today as New
Year's Day arrived, prison officials reported.
<P>
	   Rumors have persisted for weeks that inmates would demonstrate their
unhappiness with Pataki administration parole and prison labor policies
beginning today.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything is still quiet," prison spokesman James Flateau said early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Flateau said there were no problems in medium- and minimum-security
facilities, where inmates sleep in dormitory-style settings. Inmates in the
state's 16 maximum-security prisons were locked overnight in their cells and
would not be called out for breakfast until later in the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll monitor that in the morning and see what happens," Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, all 20 of the state Department of Correctional Services' SWAT
teams will continue to stand by today at regional staging areas around the state
ready to respond to disturbances. The teams, each with about 50 corrections
officers, were also available to help local officials deal with problems if they
are called in by state emergency management officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The only two untoward prison incidents reported Friday by prison officials
were caused by animals.
</P>
<P>
	   A wild turkey flew into the path of a bus transporting inmates to Auburn on
the state Thruway about 35 miles southeast of Rochester, shattering one side of
the windshield and giving the driver and another guard minor injuries. No
inmates were hurt or tried to get away, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Beacon, an inmate working on kitchen detail at the Fishkill Correctional
Facility was bitten by a cat. The animal could not be found, and the inmate was
taken to a Poughkeepsie hospital so he could begin to receive rabies shots,
prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, clergymen and community leaders called on prison administrators
to address inmates' grievances to defuse possible disturbances.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly formed Coalition on Prison Affairs said it is not supporting the
rumored disturbances by inmates "whatever it is they're going to do," the Rev.
Herbert Daughtry of the House of the Lord Church in Brooklyn said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are concerned that people are not hurt," Daughtry, a leader of
Brooklyn's black community, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Daughtry called on state officials to address those inmate complaints they
can correct and to explain clearly to prisoners why they cannot address others.
</P>
<P>
	   "We humans have a way of being Monday morning quarterbacks, after things
explode, we say we could have done this or that differently," Daughtry said.
"Let's be proactive this time. If there are things that can be done with the
inmate population and the authorities, let's do them and let's do them now."
</P>
<P>
	   Other members of the Coalition on Prison Affairs are the Rev. Al Sharpton;
state Assemblyman Roger Green of Brooklyn; Eric Adams, co-founder of 100 Blacks
in Law Enforcement, and the president of the Dynamic of Leadership, Charles
Barron.
</P>
<P>
	   Flateau said administrators have not seen formal demands by would-be
demonstrators, and he noted that many of the things inmates appear to be
complaining about such as state parole policies cannot be altered by the state
Department of Correctional Services.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are very few issues here over which the prison system has any
control," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each prison in the state also had between 15 and 20 extra officers on duty
to cope with any problems, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The corrections department is on a heightened state of alert and prepared
to deal with any eventuality which may occur," Gov. George Pataki said at a news
conference Friday at the state's Y2K emergency command center.
</P>
<P>
	   Two maximum-security prisons remained locked down as they have been all week
- Sing Sing about 30 miles north of New York City and Green Haven about 50 miles
north of the city. Inmates there were being confined to their cells except to
see visitors and receive emergency medical care.
</P>
<P>
	   A strike pamphlet titled "Wake Up" cites the Pataki administration's parole
policies as a major grievance, arguing that some inmates convicted of violent
offenses essentially have no hope of winning parole despite clean prison
records. It's unclear who wrote the pamphlet.

<HEADLINE> US Electric System Passing Y2K Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's electric power system appeared to pass muster
Saturday as the Eastern half of the country moved into the new year without any
reports of significant energy-related computer glitches or interruption of
power, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the Eastern time zone all utilities reported they are Y2K ready, every
one of them,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said an hour after midnight.
Later, officials said no major problems had been reported in the Midwest as the
transition moved through that time zone.
</P>
<P>
	   The two regions have most of the country's nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   John Koskinen, President Clinton's chief Y2K troubleshooter, said the
electric power grids in the Eastern and Central time zones were working without
any problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson made no predictions about other parts of the country, but said
there was every confidence that there would be no computer problems that would
interrupt power or cause other energy problems
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson made a round of post-midnight calls to energy ministers of oil
producing nations, including Venezuela and Mexico. ``There's no oil disruption
problem. We're in good shape,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said the problem-free transition stemmed from months of
preparation and that people did not panic and ``acted sensibly, not hoarding
gasoline or buying generators.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two nuclear power plants -- one in Pennsylvania and another in South
Carolina -- were shut down and a third had trouble with a scheduled startup as
the new year approached. Federal and industry officials said none of the three
was related to a Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
	   And in Wisconsin, a Y2K glitch caused a clock at a power plant operated by
Wisconsin Electric Power to jump 35 hours ahead, but it was reset immediately.
Officials said at least one other unidentified plant experienced a similar
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Hilt of the North American Electric Reliability Council, an industry
group that keeps tabs on the dependability of the U.S. power system, called it
``a nuisance problem'' that was quickly corrected. Officials said it caused no
problems with computers nor interruption of electricity service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All indications are we are going to successfully roll over,'' Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson said as he received reports from across the country
showing that computers operating the interconnecting electricity grids passed
muster.
</P>
<P>
	   These grid computers, which direct communications and transfer of power
nationwide, are tied to Greenwich Mean Time -- five hours ahead of the first
U.S. time zone. They passed the transition without incident, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said no signs have been noted of any disruption in oil supplies anywhere
in the world. The first two-thirds of the oil-producing regions reached midnight
without computer problems, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the nuclear power front, 311 of 434 of the world's nuclear power plants
-- including those in Russia and Ukraine -- rolled through the Y2K transition by
7 p.m. EST Friday, generally without problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Three computer glitches occurred in Japan, including an incident in which a
reactor -- the Shika plant -- reported problems with a monitoring system that
shut down unexpectedly. The plant continued to operate safely, U.S. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two U.S. reactors shut down, and one in Georgia had problems restarting on
schedule, but Richardson said Friday night the incidents were not related to
Y2K. ``All safety systems at all three reactors are fully operative,''
Richardson said. The utilities had other power sources, and there was no
interruption of electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   The three plants are:
</P>
<P>
	   --The Catawba reactor in South Carolina, operated by Duke Power Co. The
problem was a turbine, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   --The Vogtle reactor in Georgia, operated by Southern Co. The reactor failed
to restart as scheduled after a routine shutdown. There was no danger to the
reactor, said Laura Gillig, a spokeswoman for Southern Co.
</P>
<P>
	   --The Limerick reactor in Pennsylvania, operated by Philadelphia Electric
Co., shut down after a transformer problem.

<HEADLINE> Putin Takes Over in Russia  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM HEINTZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin assured Russians there would
be no ``vacuum of power'' after Boris Yeltsin's surprise resignation, and on his
first full day in office today visited Russian troops in Chechnya to reiterate
support for their campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin handed out awards to the soldiers battling rebels in the breakaway
republic, where Russia's successes in the latest war have helped elevate him to
the country's most popular politician.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not simply about restoring honor and dignity to the country, no,''
Putin told the servicemen in Gudermes, a city east of the capital of Grozny that
Russian troops took several weeks ago. ``This is about more serious things. This
is about how to bring about the end of the breakup of Russia, that is your
fundamental goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin named Putin -- whom he raised from political obscurity five months
ago when he appointed him prime minister -- to act as president until new
elections are held, which the constitution requires within 90 days of
resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At no minute will there be a vacuum of power in the country,'' Putin said
in a nationally televised speech Friday aimed at reassuring Russians astonished
by Yeltsin's move. ``I want to give notice that attempts to act outside the
framework of Russian law, of the Russian Constitution, will be decisively cut
short.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's firm words and sober demeanor were in marked contrast to Yeltsin's
emotional appearance on television about 12 hours earlier, when what appeared to
be a routine presidential New Year's message veered into a statement of regret
and resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he asked for Russians' forgiveness ``for the fact that many of the
dreams we shared did not come true,'' Yeltsin also noted his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Seeing with what hope and faith people voted in the Duma (parliamentary)
elections for a new generation of politicians, I understood that I have
completed the main thing of my life,'' he said. ``Already, Russia will never
return to the past. Now, Russia will always move only forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the parliamentary elections on Dec. 19, centrists including the
Kremlin-backed Unity party gained enough seats to overshadow the communists, who
had dominated the Duma and blocked many of Yeltsin's reform attempts.
</P>
<P>
	   The election results strengthened Putin's hand, already strong because of
wide public approval for the offensive in Chechnya. Russia maintains the war is
aimed at Islamic militants based in Chechnya who invaded the neighboring region
of Dagestan in August and are blamed for apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia
that killed some 300 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin's resignation six months before his term's end was seen as an
attempt to capitalize on the centrists' new position ahead of the communists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federation Council, parliament's upper chamber, will set the date for
the new election, which Russian news agencies said would probably be March 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin immediately signed a decree offering Yeltsin immunity from
prosecution, a lifetime pension, a government country home, and bodyguards and
medical care for him and his family.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kremlin has been under political attack during the past year with
widespread allegations of corruption and other irregularities. Members of the
Yeltsin's family, particularly his daughter Tatyana Dyachenko, have been linked
to the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors in Switzerland and Russia have been investigating the
allegations, but no charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
	   Plagued for years by heart problems and other health problems, Yeltsin was
often ill and out of sight during his second term. He spent many weeks sidelined
at his country residence outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   In eight tumultuous years, though, he established democracy in a country
that had known only authoritarian rule for centuries. Still, his economic reform
efforts have foundered, and Russian society is marked by the flamboyantly
wealthy and the desperately poor.
</P>
<P>
	   With deep military cuts, Yeltsin softened Russia's militaristic image that
worried the West, but the previous war in Chechnya, from 1994 to 1996, left
Moscow appearing aggressive and foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin bewildered Russians and foreign observers alike with frequent,
unexpected changes of prime ministers. He gained Russians' esteem by jumping on
a tank to denounce a 1991 coup attempt by hardline Communists.
</P>
<P>
	   By his last days in office, many Russians said they were tired of his
contradictions and seeming capriciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To be honest, I didn't think anything of Yeltsin lately,'' said Lena
Matrosva, a 27-year-old teacher. ``There was just this person we had, but he did
not mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, a former KGB officer, is widely seen as the most popular politician
in Russia. His no-nonsense manner has appealed to many Russians, who say they
want strong leadership to tackle their country's enormous economic, political
and social problems.

<HEADLINE> Americans Marking 2000 in Many Ways  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A few of the ways -- some frivolous, some serious -- that Americans were
welcoming the year 2000:
</P>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA: Taking a cue from Sylvester Stallone in ``Rocky,'' 2,000
people ran up the steps of the Art Museum and wave their arms in the air. Later,
the city staged a mass wedding for about 700 couples and a reading of a copy of
the Declaration of Independence by torch light at Independence Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   CENTURY, Fla.: In a town that got its name from the last turn of the
century, the new millennium was welcomed with a special Postal Service
cancellation and a Y2K-5K Last Run of the Century.
</P>
<P>
	   MILLENNIUM, N.C.: Three hours of gospel singing outside the Millennium
Pentecostal Holiness Church, whose founder also founded the 80-year-old town,
were culminating in a spotlight shining on a ``dove of peace,'' hoisted 80 feet
above the assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C.: A giant acorn, an emblem of the ``city of oaks,'' was dropped
100 feet at midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   SALISBURY, Md.: In a New Orleans-style funeral for the old millennium,
revelers followed a funeral leader carrying a black umbrella and a box
containing ``all the things we hope not to take with us into the new
millennium,'' as an organizer put it.
</P>
<P>
	   OGDENSBURG, N.J.: A group of millennium revelers rang in the new year
underground, in a mine.
</P>
<P>
	   HOWES CAVE, N.Y.: ``We have 75 guests who are on the planet who will be IN
the planet at the turn of the millennium,'' said the general manager of Howe
Caverns, an underground network of tunnels.
</P>
<P>
	   PROVIDENCE, R.I.: Ice sculptures were on display in front of City Hall to
greet a crowd of revelers.
</P>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H.: It wasn't much of a party for about 50 business leaders,
state officials and reporters who spent the last night of the 1900s in the
basement of the state Office of Emergency Management, just in case.
</P>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE, N.C.: At the Charlotte Museum of History, a 7 1/2-ton bell tolled
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C.: The Black Tie was flooded with last-minute requests for
tuxedoes from men who decided do something special or found their own suit
didn't fit as they remembered.
</P>
<P>
	   DICKSON, Tenn.: A new bank that just got a charter dated Jan. 1 opened for
business at 12:01 a.m. and was staying open until it gets $1 million in
deposits.
</P>
<P>
	   MEMPHIS: Thousands of people jammed Beale Street in Memphis, where blues
guitarist B.B. King was the featured act at a free concert and The Commodores
were booked for the Crystal Ball at the elegant Peabody Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   CARBONDALE, Ill.: The Interfaith Center at Southern Illinois University was
marking the new century with a labyrinth -- a maze meant to foster
introspection. Participants wrote down what they want to purge from their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND: Police cars were on every corner in downtown Cleveland as
thousands showed up to watch the lighting of a seven-story, 10,000-light sign
shaped like a light bulb.
</P>
<P>
	   NEWPORT, Ky.: The 33-ton World Peace Bell sounded hourly as the new year
made its way west.
</P>
<P>
	   OKLAHOMA CITY: Thousands converged on downtown Oklahoma City to see
magicians, mimes and music -- and for those who were tempted to stay home to
watch the Oklahoma Sooners play Mississippi in the Independence Bowl, the
televised game was projected onto the side of the Sonic building downtown.
</P>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.: Before trying their New Year's luck at craps tables and
slot machines, gamblers noshed on crab legs at the Caesars Atlantic City Hotel
Casino, where the buffet centerpiece was 3-foot tall ice-sculpted numeral
``2000.''
</P>
<P>
	   EVANSVILLE, Ind.: Christian youths here and in other parts of the country
spent New Year's Eve huddled in candlelit ``catacombs'' in church basements and
other secluded places, exploring their faith and learning more about religious
persecution.
</P>
<P>
	   DETROIT: The low, dull ringing of the 10-ton shimmering Millennium Bell set
the tone for church bells throughout the city to ring in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   BRANSON, Mo.: Despite a relatively low turnout, Branson went ahead with a
dizzying 24-hour millennium show at the Grant Palace theater featuring about 100
performers who rocked, bopped, swung, strung and plucked the remainder of the
millennium away. ``Music has brought so much to our lives over the last century,
it's only appropriate to usher in the new millennium with more of the same,''
said singer Jimmy Osmond, who headlined the celebration with his brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   BIG CYPRESS SEMINOLE INDIAN RESERVATION, Fla.: It was peace, love, happiness
and drugs in the middle of the Everglades, where the rock band Phish performed
at a two-day outdoor concert for 75,000 people. Twelve people were treated and
released for drug overdoses -- mostly LSD, hallucinogenic mushrooms and ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
	   LOUISVILLE, Ky.: A green laser beamed messages into outer space, making the
world's first ``interstellar time capsule.'' Thousands of people from as far
away as Germany sent in e-mail messages to be beamed skyward.
</P>
<P>
	   MILFORD, Mich.: A 40-foot ``millennium tower'' was illuminated to the sound
of 600 shells of fireworks shooting off amid the buzz of 5,000 kazoos.
</P>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS: The dying millennium got this city's traditional sendoff, an
often rollicking jazz funeral procession that meandered past French Quarter
bars.
</P>
<P>
	   ATLANTA: To rival New York City, Atlanta dropped its 8-by-8-foot fiberglass
Big Peach. In southwest Georgia, near Tifton, the tiny town of Ty Ty had a
``drop'' of its own: The First Baptist Church had a 3-foot-tall peanut drop in
its social hall after a pancake supper.
</P>
<P>
	   DALLAS: Mayor Ron Kirk, on cue from a satellite-linked atomic clock, flipped
a switch to start a two-minute countdown to the new millennium, with the clock's
time displayed by lasers on giant screens.
</P>
<P>
	   TOPEKA, Kan.: The state Capitol, not quite finished when 1900 dawned, was
the site of a party highlighted by a show of laser lights that bounced off the
inside of the dome.
</P>
<P>
	   DENVER, Colo.: Runners and walkers -- some with dogs and baby strollers,
others in funny hats and party clothes -- participated in a 5K run and walk.
</P>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS: Barbra Streisand, Elton John and Bette Midler were headliners at
Las Vegas Strip resorts, where revelers who could afford it enjoyed a
neon-bathed bash of booze, big-name entertainment and New Year's excess.
</P>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO: San Francisco originally planned a world-class fireworks show
over the Golden Gate Bridge, but crowd-control fears from the National Park
Service forced the city to settle for a smaller fireworks show and party
overlooking the Bay Bridge instead.
</P>
<P>
	   BALTIMORE: A sculpture resembling Stonehenge was erected, with spaces for
people to place cards with their New Year's resolutions, hopes and wishes. ``I
want my daughter to stop using drugs,'' said one. ``I hope that the computers
don't affect Maria's sub shop because I want a whole cheesesteak, everything, no
hots,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
	   CYBERSPACE: America Online prepared a ``Party of the Millennium'' with chat
rooms and 11 live celebrations from 11 cities, while a Times Square Web site
offered views of the ``crossroads of the world.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Surrenders in Bank Standoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. (AP) -- A woman who said she was upset about losing her job and
had no hope for the future surrendered after taking a group of bank employees
hostage Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Two hostages who had been held throughout the ordeal were released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Olathe police Lt. Larry Griffin said the woman came out of the bank and was
arrested. Griffin said he did not know yet what prompted the woman to give up.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier police reports that two suspects were involved in the standoff were
incorrect, said Griffin, who did not give any more details.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't immediately clear how many people were initially taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of at least five people left the bank just before 10 p.m. and were
taken by police, said Lt. Joe Pruett of the Olathe Police Department.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said those five people were not taken hostage, but
had managed to hide inside the building and then escape. He had no other details
on where the people had been hiding or how they got out of the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the bank employees inside the building had earlier called KMBC-TV and
said everyone was being treated well.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-taker then took the phone and said she was upset because she had
lost her job, her family and all hope for the future. She said she would release
the hostages if she could talk to a friend named Sean.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once I talk to Sean, then I'll talk to them, that's when it all ends,''
the suspect said. ``I want to talk to Sean face-to-face first before I talk to
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, she yelled to the hostages, ``Are you being harmed?'' and
people in the background were heard saying ``No.''
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of injuries in the bank, and police said no shots had
been fired although the woman was believed to have a handgun.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman entered the Bank of America branch, a free-standing building in an
Olathe shopping district, as it was closing shortly after 5 p.m. on New Year's
Eve, Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   With a SWAT team surrounding the building, police tried negotiating with the
woman by phone. Officials said the woman had abruptly broken off talks at least
once.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were tipped by a frantic call from inside the bank, Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The police department had increased the number of officers on patrol in case
of trouble New Year's Eve, and an officer was in the area when the call came in,
Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the standoff, one hostage walked outside the bank, retrieved
something from a car belonging to the suspect and went back inside, Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials would not release further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Lanza said the incident was the Kansas City area's first hostage situation
at a bank in about nine years.

<HEADLINE> A Quiet Transition in the Holy Land  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- On the Mount of Olives, where the Bible says Jesus will
return to Earth, the new millennium arrived quietly. In the surrounding Muslim
Middle East, it was even quieter.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of large-scale disruptions never materialized in the Holy Land, though
police had feared delusional tourists might commit suicide to hasten the second
coming of Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   Many streets in Jerusalem were deserted as Orthodox Jews, indifferent to the
millennium hoopla, observed the 17th Sabbath of the Hebrew calendar year 5760 at
home with traditional Friday evening meals and prayers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a very special night for us -- it's the Sabbath,'' said Ilana Sharon,
42, as she walked home from a prayer service in the Orthodox neighborhood of
Makor Baruch.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday evening, hundreds of worshippers chanting hymns marched peacefully
in a candlelight procession up the Mount, where according to tradition Jesus
ascended to heaven. Brown-robed Franciscan monks carried a 10-foot-long wooden
cross.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is where everything we believe began,'' said Jude Alvarando, 29, a
theology student from the Philippines, as he walked along the walls of
Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The year 2000 is based on the birth of Christ here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Around midnight, a lone American stood atop the Mount and yelled he was
God's messenger. He was immediately surrounded by dozens of Israeli border
police and detained.
</P>
<P>
	   In nearby Bethlehem, Jesus' birthplace, tens of thousands of Palestinians
packed a floodlit Manger Square, cheering as 2,000 doves of peace were released
at the stroke of midnight to the sounds of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
	   For many Palestinians, the celebrations were a warmup for the independence
bash they expect to hold in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At the turn of the millennium, my people will see independence,'' said a
hopeful Firaz Abdallah, a 26-year-old Palestinian-American from Long Beach,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, addressing the largest rally since his
1994 return from exile, told tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza City that
statehood would become a reality in 2000. ``We are with you, Arafat,'' the crowd
chanted.
</P>

millennium this year, which fell during the holy month of Ramadan, a time for

<HEADLINE> No Sign of Hijackers After Deadline  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) -- The five hijackers of an Indian Airlines plane
vanished into the desert of southern Afghanistan and by this morning had crossed
the border into a neighboring country, according to a Taliban official.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers presumably went to Pakistan, the nearest country and the only
one they could easily reach within the 10 hours they were given to get out of
Afghanistan under a deal struck Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal peacefully ended a tense eight-day standoff in the southern Afghan
city of Kandahar. All 155 hostages were freed and were flown to New Delhi,
India.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers sped out of the airport in several vehicles, taking three
Muslim militants freed from Indian jails and one hostage -- a soldier from
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Taliban hostage has come back to Kandahar and (the hijackers) have
gone from the country,'' Taliban spokesman Rehnatullah Aga said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Aga declined to say where the hijackers went, but the only realistic
possibility was that the group drove for several hours to the border with
Pakistan, where there are countless places to cross the frontier on foot.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban initially had been reluctant to get involved in negotiations
with the hijackers, and when the crisis ended Friday, the movement hurried the
men out of its territory as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban sent a heavily armed group of soldiers with the hijackers to
ensure that they left Afghanistan promptly.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan strongly denounced the hijacking, but it has little control over
its lengthy western border that may have been used as an escape route.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hijackings are particularly abhorrent to us,'' Pakistan's Foreign Ministry
said Friday evening in a statement. ``We have no sympathy for such desperate
acts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Identifying the hijackers could prove difficult because they remained masked
throughout the eight days. Taliban authorities said they did not know the names
or nationalities of the hijackers, though they acted in support of Kashmir
militants who are fighting to end Indian rule of the Himalayan territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers were traveling with three prominent Kashmiri militants, who
were freed by India in exchange for the release of the hostages on the airplane.
</P>
<P>
	   Masood Azhar, a leader of Harkat ul-Ansar, a group on a U.S. list of
terrorist organizations, was the best known of the three men released. In
addition, the Indians freed Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, chief commander of the rebel
group Ul-Umar Mujahideen, and Ahmad Omar Sayed Sheikh, who was held in a New
Delhi prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking demonstrated the volatile nature of the long-running dispute
over Kashmir, the leading source of friction between India and Pakistan. Both
nations hold part of Kashmir and claim all of it.
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan traded recriminations during the latest hijacking crisis,
placing further strain on already bad relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said Friday that ``there is no bowing
to terrorism.'' The three Muslim militants, who had been convicted of terrorism,
were released only to protect the lives of the hostages, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane on which the hostages were held left the airport at Kandahar this
morning and headed back to India after authorities had completed repairs and
checked for any potential problems.

   ORANGE CITY, Fla. (AP) -- A small post office inside a museum will be open
Saturday, offering a one-of-a-kind postmark -- for Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Other area post offices will be closed for Saturday's New Year holiday, but
the Orange City Postal Museum at the Heritage Inn will be open -- and so will
its small post office, housed in a side room.

first day of the year with the unique postmark.

<HEADLINE> W. Va. Town To Stage Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- It's not that this Eastern Panhandle town isn't
used to political celebrities -- just not at this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
	   A host of politicians, along with hundreds of staff members and journalists,
are scheduled to arrive this week for a new round of peace talks between Israel
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright are among the dignitaries expected.
President Clinton, who is scheduled to arrive Monday, is expected to
occasionally sit in during the two-week event.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time 1,000 visitors stayed at this quaint town 70 miles from
Washington for any length of time was during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to have to put up with some inconvenience, we recognize that,
but we think it's worth it,'' Mayor Vincent Parmesano said. ``It would be
wonderful to have something called the Shepherdstown Accord that would go down
in history as another step toward peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department chose the town for its relative seclusion, 10 miles
from the nearest interstate highway. Parmesano said local, state and federal
security officers will keep the peace as well as they can.
</P>
<P>
	   The venue is a world away from West Virginia's sometimes-backwoods image.
</P>
<P>
	   Several presidents have visited over the years, and Nancy Reagan is said to
have liked the Yellow Brick Bank, a restaurant at one end of the town's
two-block business district lined with coffee shops, gift boutiques, bookstores
and an art-film theater.
</P>
<P>
	   It's home to Shepherd College and a collection of scholars, artists,
software engineers, commuters and retired federal workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On the whole, it's got people who follow a variety of different lifestyles
who all manage to get along,'' said Alan Levitan, a National Park Service
worker. ``Maybe we're a good role model for the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many buildings in the town display window posters with a simple message for
the negotiators: ``Peace'' in English, Hebrew and Arabic.
</P>
<P>
	   Some folks, however, are fretting about traffic jams and the threat of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the timing is unfortunate,'' said Phillip M. Coffey, a retired
National Security Agency employee. ``All the terrorists are looking for the
biggest bang for their buck with this Y2K thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others in the town of 1,300 worry that the media horde and the motorcades
will tie up traffic at the four-way stop between the Clarion Hotel and the
National Conservation Training Center -- the peace talk venues -- especially if
the president sits in.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People have no idea how discombobulated life can be when an event of this
magnitude happens,'' said Tom Martin, who settled in Shepherdstown after a
33-year diplomatic career. Nevertheless, he and wife Laura support the new round
of peace talks between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   The influx of visitors also poses a problem for restaurateurs, who normally
run with skeleton staffs in early January, when Shepherd College and its 4,500
students are on break.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were expecting to be nice and easy and slow, and now we're expecting to
be busy,'' said Yellow Brick Bank floor manager Meredith Poffenberger.
</P>
<P>
	   The selection of a fairly remote meeting site is reminiscent of the talks
held by the Wye River -- on Maryland's Eastern Shore -- that produced a peace
agreement between Israel and Palestine in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Children's librarian Hallie Taylor foresees similar success at the
Shepherdstown talks. The peace posters in downtown windows are photocopies of a
yellowed page her mother clipped from the Los Angeles Times in the 1960s and
stuck on a kitchen cupboard. Taylor kept it after her mother died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I heard the peace talks were going to be happening here, all of a
sudden it seemed like this had been in my family all these years for a reason,''
she said. ``It was almost as if it was waiting for this moment.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Newspaper Defends Coverage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- After receiving hundreds of complaints from readers, a Japanese
newspaper today defended its coverage of a royal pregnancy that eventually ended
in a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
	   The mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun received about 390 angry letters about
its decision last month to break the news that Crown Princess Masako had shown
signs of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Crown Prince and Crown Princess are public figures, and the imperial
family and issues concerning imperial succession are of great concern to the
nation,'' Asahi managing director Akihiko Miura said in the paper's New Year's
Day edition.
</P>
<P>
	   The Asahi story triggered a media frenzy, with camera crews trying to track
Masako's every move and reporters hanging around paparazzi-style outside her
parents' home.
</P>
<P>
	   After six years of marriage, Crown Prince Naruhito and Masako have yet to
produce a child, raising concerns about the future of the imperial line. The
reports of a possible pregnancy were greeted with jubilation in Japan until
palace officials said the pregnancy could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Palace officials announced Friday that the princess had been pregnant but
suffered a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
	   Miura expressed remorse for any distress the Asahi report may have caused.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If our reporting put emotional pressure on the princess, we are at loss
for words,'' said.
</P>
<P>
	   Masako, a Harvard graduate, was a diplomat before to her marriage to Prince
Naruhito.

<HEADLINE> Heavy police presence at Times Square and environs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Guarding against the threat of terrorism, thousands of
police officers fanned out across Times Square to ensure that the massive
celebration to usher in the new millennium was a safe one.
<P>
	   By midnight Friday, when the 1,070-pound crystal New Year's ball slid slowly
down the flagpole at 1 Times Square, some 8,000 police officers were stationed
in and around the area - more than double the number during an ordinary New
Year's Eve celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 37,000 of the police department's 40,000 officers were on duty,
including officers equipped with anthrax antidote kits in case of a biological
terrorist attack and others flying above in police helicopters.
</P>
<P>
	   During the celebration, the Federal Aviation Administration prohibited all
aircraft flying lower than 4,000 feet within a 3-mile radius around Times Square
except police choppers.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of a possible terrorist strike against the city - and Times Square in
particular - were heightened this week after members of the Joint Terrorist Task
Force arrested a Brooklyn man, saying he had possible ties to an Algerian who
allegedly tried to smuggle explosives into the United States from Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   City and federal officials said they had no knowledge of a credible threat
against New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, during the hours leading up to the 24-hour Times Square
extravaganza, authorities locked mailboxes, welded shut manhole covers, removed
trash cans and searched cars parked in nearby garages. Huge orange city
sanitation trucks blocked surrounding streets to prevent vehicles from reaching
Times Square. And police and fire officials set up tractor-trailer rigs parked
just off Times Square equipped with showers that could be used as
decontamination chambers.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also towed cars on nearby streets, and hundreds of officers were
positioned in nearby subway stations, store doorways and hotel lobbies.
</P>
<P>
	   City officials, including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said repeatedly that the
city could not guarantee anyone's safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything appears to be as normal as anything ever is in the city of New
York," Giuliani said early this morning, referring to the dual threats of
terrorism and potential computer snafus that some believed would wreak havoc on
the city's traffic signal, electricity, sewage and water systems.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reported problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout Friday, authorities noted a spike in the number of bomb hoaxes,
including a threat against the Verrazano Bridge, said police Commissioner Howard
Safir.
</P>
<P>
	   "Each one had to be responded to," Safir said. "Each one had to be cleared
by the bomb squad, and each one turned out to be hoaxes."
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday morning, police briefly evacuated a small area of 46th and 47th
streets near the Times Square visitors center after officers observed a red
backpack leaning against a building. Police found nothing dangerous in the
backpack, and people were allowed back into the area after about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   There were 14 arrests in the Times Square area, including that of a man
found with a loaded shotgun in his car inside a parking garage on 53rd Street.
The man, identified as George James, 29, of Saranac, Mich., was charged with
criminal possession of a weapon. The gun was unlicensed, police said.

<HEADLINE> Mass Weddings Mark Millennium  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER BROWN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Austin Cushing and Laura Boechat met in classic
late-20th century fashion -- on the Internet -- and greeted the 21st as
newlyweds after tying the knot in a mass ceremony in Philadelphia, one of dozens
of New Year's Eve weddings planned around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're so special together. We wanted to do it on a special day,'' said the
new Mrs. Cushing, 29, of Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   She wore a ``Happy New Year'' party hat, while her betrothed wore jeans and
a plastic derby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the millennium. It seemed right,'' he said of the timing and his
attire.
</P>
<P>
	   About 700 couples participated in the Philadelphia ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve time zones away, 2,000 couples took the plunge at a mass ceremony in
Bangkok, Thailand. Despite some no-shows due to Y2K-affected flights and fears,
several hundred foreigners from Europe, North America and other Asian nations
joined in the elaborate Thai wedding rites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We joined this ceremony because it is a time we will remember forever,''
said Alexander Hay, a 53-year-old Briton residing in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment for us. This is a time of great
happiness,'' said Rojana Lar-on, 30, as her groom smiled and confessed the two
had already honeymooned last week on the resort island of Phuket.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, on a remote island in Fiji, a Virginia couple was married at
midnight local time in what an Internet site devoted to weddings dubbed the
first nuptials of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Berthelsen and Matthew Beach, both 28, of Leesburg, Va., wed on
Turtle Island in a private ceremony on the beach, weddingchannel.com spokeswoman
Meredith Mansfield said. Turtle Island is on daylight savings time, so it
celebrated the year 2000 one hour sooner than the rest of Fiji.
</P>
<P>
	   Another mass wedding, of 110 couples, went off at midnight EST along the
Delaware River in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm only going to be around for one millennium,'' said Kellie Melba, 29,
explaining why she signed up to renew her wedding vows with her husband of seven
years, Scott Melba.
</P>
<P>
	   Danielle McMullen, 22, and Richard Cressman, 23, were among 20 couples who
were married in the final hour of 1999 in the courthouse in Howard County, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   Dim lights, organ music, poinsettias, candles, a two-tier wedding cake on
one attorney's table and nonalcoholic champagne made a chapel out of the
courtroom where Monica Lewinsky testified in the Linda Tripp case two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   In Las Vegas, an Elvis impersonator flanked by showgirls planned to marry
about 30 couples at a wedding chapel Friday night. A larger traditional ceremony
was planned for midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Philadelphia ceremony, bride Leigh Costa, 26, of Pittman, N.J., said
the hardest part about getting married with 700 other brides was the possibility
of being upstaged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of competition. But there's only one groom here I want,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> Millennium, Y2K fears pass New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Early accounts statewide seemed to indicate the
much-feared, much-planned for Y2K bug was a dud.
<P>
	   Thousands of extra utility workers and emergency personnel with generators
worked through the night to make it so.
</P>
<P>
	   "We went through the rollover just fine," Niagara Mohawk spokesman Gerald
Rockower said from company headquarters in Syracuse. "There were no problems
anywhere in our transmission system."
</P>
<P>
	   While even Dick Clark was off the clock shortly after midnight, state
Emergency Management Office workers staffed phones and computers from the
state's "bunker" through this morning.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are still vigilant, there could still be problems, but we don't
anticipate any," said state Operations Director James Natoli from a state-run
underground command center in Albany, which buzzed with activity Friday as 150
people monitored the state's vital functions. Workers continued to take reports
from hospitals and utilities, but no Y2K-related troubles were reported. "Y2K
does not end at 12:01. We have hours of work ahead of us," he said early today.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made it through Y2K, no hitch," said Terry Dunford, spokesman for the
West Valley Demonstration Project. Located in West Valley, 40 miles south of
Buffalo, the site was once the country's only commercial reprocessing center for
nuclear fuel. "We spent two years planning for this and we had 100 people in
here tonight," Dunford said. "In our case, if we make a mistake, it will take
10,000 years to fix."
</P>
<P>
	   The new year, however, didn't come without a scare.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thousand Island Bridge in northern New York was reopened at 1 a.m. after
three hours after an initial scanner reading incorrectly identified nitrates in
a car. Earlier, police rerouted traffic through the city of Ogdensburg, 120
miles north of Syracuse and an explosives response team was called in.
</P>
<P>
	   James McMahon, superintendent of the state police, said a scanner
inadvertently picked up traces of a potential explosive material while searching
a Canadian driver. The reading was proved wrong and the motorist released.
</P>
<P>
	   After midnight, Winston Barrus, the acting district director of Immigration
and Naturalization Services in Buffalo, reported no incidents at the state's
seven ports of entry with Canada, where fear of terrorism had risen in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Even New York's prisons, a hotbed for rumors of a statewide riot and protest
in recent weeks, were quiet shortly after midnight, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "No state in America ... is more ready than we are to deal with any
potential problems that might come up tonight," said Gov. George Pataki, who
ends the century in the office held in 1900 by one of his idols, a 41-year-old
war hero named Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's command center will remain staffed into the weekend, as will
satellite centers around New York.
</P>
<P>
	   A key concern for state officials is making sure its sprawling power grid
continues to deliver electricity. The state's utilities have each declared
themselves Y2K compliant, but thousands of extra workers were on duty overnight
at generating plants, electrical stations, gas pipelines and command centers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've done all our drilling, all our testing. We've completed our planning.
Now, we're just waiting and monitoring the world situation," said Mark Frank of
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. "We're confident that we'll encounter few, if any,
problems."
</P>
<P>
	   Niagara Mohawk scheduled about 1,000 additional workers - 10 times the
number of people who would ordinarily work a holiday night. They included
radio-equipped technicians at 100 key substations from Olean to Ticonderoga.
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric spokesman Mike Power noted that isolated outages
due to a limb falling on a line or a car hitting a power pole are not uncommon
and that any outage today could be routine.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic began an intensive around-the-clock watch Friday on its
telecommunications system.
</P>
<P>
	   The volume of telephone calls was heavier than normal for a New Year's Eve,
but the network handled the load with few if any delays, said spokesman Cliff
Lee.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've fixed, replaced or retired equipment," said Skip Patterson, who runs
Bell Atlantic's Year 2000 Program Office, "and we're confident Jan. 1 will be
just another day."
</P>
<P>
	   That refrain was common, but extraordinary precautions were taken just the
same:
</P>
<P>
	   -Albany International Airport had on hand a 1250 kilowatt mobile power
generator and a tank truck to supply water;
</P>
<P>
	   -hospitals brought in technical personnel to watch electronic systems;
</P>
<P>
	   -Keycorp was making extra deliveries of cash to ATMs, even though bank
officials had no evidence of a run on cash machines.
</P>
<P>
	   In western New York, all was quiet after midnight. Officials said there were
no major problems in the city, where the most serious mishap was a water main
break.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would say it's even quieter than usual for a Friday night," said Harold
Litwin, chief of operations for police in Buffalo, which 100 years ago was a
bustling commercial center more populous than 12 states.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's dead," said a man selling hot dogs in front of the arena where the
band Bare Naked Ladies performed. "There's only about 8,000 people in there.
We'll get more tomorrow when Toronto comes to town to play the Sabres."
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester-based Wegmans Food Markets and rival Tops markets reported recent
increases in the sales of water, flashlights, canned soups, bathroom tissue,
cereals, baby food and other staples. At Wegmans, bags of charcoal were snapped
up at the same pace as in the peak barbecue summer season.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are stocking up in general but not to any unusual degree," said Jo
Natale, spokeswoman for the Wegmans Food Markets based in Rochester. "I wouldn't
characterize any of it as panic buying."
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds were large and problems were few at several "First Night" downtown
celebrations across the state. Most went off as planned, but as 13,000 revelers
began to filter into Binghamton's event, fire erupted in a downtown bar damaging
the tavern and an adjacent adult book store, reported the Binghamton Press &AMP;
Sun-Bulletin. No injuries were reported and the cause remained under
investigation. A couple acts had to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the newest First Night celebrations was in Saratoga Springs, near the
site of the Battles of Saratoga where 222 years ago America's citizen soldiers
shocked the world's most powerful empire and turned the tide of the American
Revolution.

<HEADLINE> Paris, London, Berlin Greet 2000  </HEADLINE>
   By MORT ROSENBLUM AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- The European millennium arrived to champagne parties at the
Eiffel Tower, to cracking fireworks along the River Thames and to a street party
along an area once cut in two by the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
	   On Paris' jammed Champs-Elysees, revelers gathered around a row of
imaginative Ferris wheels, ablaze with light and color -- each designed by
artists to reflect hope for the next 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oooohhhhh,'' yelled Majorie Fraisse as she and her friends watched
brilliant blues, reds, greens and golden yellows swirl about the century-old
tower.
</P>
<P>
	   People spilled from restaurants, sated and awash in wine, to dance on the
streets. Impromptu concerts of saxophones, bongos and guitars set a backdrop to
bursting firecrackers and the din of canned fog horns.
</P>
<P>
	   As Big Ben's famous bell chimed midnight in London, a 15-minute fireworks
show there flashed sparkling lights across the sky as the crackle of explosions
echoed above some 2.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   Queen Elizabeth II lit a huge millennium beacon afloat on a barge, then
joined the celebrations at the Millennium Dome, the huge new edifice perched
like a spaceship on the riverside at Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
	   As midnight tolled, the queen toasted the new century with a glass of
champagne and kissed husband Prince Philip on the cheek. They linked arms with
Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife to sing ``Auld Lang Syne'' with the rest
of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   In Berlin, some 2 million revelers came from east and west, packing both
sides of the Brandenburg Gate and squeezing along a 3-mile stretch of Germany's
freshly restored capital.
</P>
<P>
	   From the angel-capped Victory Column in western Berlin to the futuristic
television tower in the east, the street party swirled as fireworks streamed
across Berlin's hazy sky.
</P>
<P>
	   Many French celebrated in private homes with old friends peacefully working
through stuffed goose liver, lobster, smoked salmon, venison and other holiday
delicacies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the most beautiful city in the world, and you can overeat to your
heart's content,'' said Jane Miller, a poet from Tucson, Ariz. ``Where else
would I be?''
</P>
<P>
	   Just days ago, the mood was less bacchanalia as killer winds savaged France,
tearing out 150,000 trees around Paris, many planted two centuries ago when the
Sun King ruled at Versailles.
</P>
<P>
	   Rains swelled the Seine, flooding its fabled quays and washing away plans
for dinner cruises amid fairy-lit boats. Cracked tree trunks and blown-down
signs smashed cars along the Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
	   But Paris got over it.
</P>
<P>
	   Odile Saturnin, a real estate agent, brought her 3-year-old daughter,
Jennifer, to the foot of the Eiffel Tower from their home on the French
Caribbean island of Martinique.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't expect to live another 100 years,'' she said, ``so I decided to
get an eyeful this time.''

<HEADLINE> New Year's downtown: self-imposed surveillance, drag, velvet ropes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Kisa Lala entered the new millennium this way: wearing a
backless, lime green gown and blasting away with a submachine gun.
<P>
	   The gun, like the Y2K scare, was loaded with blanks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fun," said Lala, 31, after putting down her weapon and joining dozens of
other avant-garde revelers who celebrated New Year's Eve 50 blocks away from
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
	   The gunfire was part of "Quiet," an experiment in ironic,
Orwellian-survivalist living launched by artist and self-proclaimed "cyber
mogul" Josh Harris.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris had more than 100 video cameras installed in 30,000 square feet of
Tribeca loft space to watch resident "voyagers"' every move - at a mock indoor
shooting range, in a glass-walled co-ed shower, in 4-by-8-foot sleeping
capsules. Each was ordered to don an orange, inmate-like outfit and was
encouraged to engage in "millennium coupling."
</P>
<P>
	   The project was one of several events staged for downtown scene-makers who
consider Times Square too square a spot to celebrate New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is everything that other New Year's Eve events aren't," said Leo
Koenig, 23, an artist participating in Harris' gala. "It's not programmed, it's
real. It's a social experiment."
</P>
<P>
	   Creator Harris, who claims to have spent $700,000 setting up the project,
said his event offered an alternative to more traditional celebrations.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not about getting drunk," Harris said. "There's enough going on here
that you don't need that."
</P>
<P>
	   The participants couldn't escape scrutiny even when they slept. Each of
their sleeping "pods" was under constant video surveillance. Participant Cynthia
DeMoss, after stepping from a shower, commented dryly, "The documentation is
insatiable in here."
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, the dressed-in-black set was invited to Fifth Avenue's Toy
Building for "Shagallennium 2000," billed as a hip all-night bash hosted by some
of the city's top club promoters and DJs. Ticket prices ranged from $250 to
$1,000, the top price including a bottle of Dom Perignon and - for even greater
value - "complimentary coat check."
</P>
<P>
	   A gay and transvestite crowd commandeered a dungeon-like club in the heart
of the trendy meatpacking district, Mother's, for a Medieval-themed party
featuring a performance by an "industrial opera diva." Hosts warned of a strict
dress code: "Court of King Arthur, wizard's robes, armor, fetish or Gothic
costume."
</P>
<P>
	   Revelers also could find bouncers, velvet ropes and rejection at Chaos in
the East Village, where rapper Sean "Puffy" Combs' record company booked an
invitation-only party. Combs was arrested on a weapons charge last week after a
shooting at another Manhattan club but is free on $10,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Panama Celebrates Control of Canal  </HEADLINE>
   By ELOY O. AGUILAR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- As the first ships of the new millennium sailed
smoothly through the locks today, Panamanians celebrated the New Year, and above
all, the handover of the Panama Canal and the U.S-held territory that had long
cut this nation in two.
</P>
<P>
	   Firecrackers exploded throughout Panama City at midnight, and the canal went
on working normally, with no Y2K problems: The controls at the locks are
mechanical -- not computerized -- and haven't changed much at all since the U.S.
put the waterway into operation in 1914.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 ships moving through the 50-mile chain of locks and channels had no
reported problems, said Panama's Civil Defense Director, Moises Ortega. The
United States handed the canal to Panama in a ceremony earlier Friday, ending
nearly a century of American jurisdiction over one of the world's most strategic
waterways.
</P>
<P>
	   In the jubilant ceremony alongside the canal administration building,
President Mireya Moscoso and U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera signed a document
formalizing Panama's possession of the canal and a surrounding strip of land
that until recently was home to U.S. military and civilian installations.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds roared and released red, white and blue balloons as the Panamanian
flag was raised -- for the first time, alone -- over the canal headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will be no more fences, no more signs blocking our entrance. The
canal is ours and may God bless it,'' Moscoso said just before raising the flag,
as thousands of people jumped in the air and swirled their shirts over their
heads in joy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We didn't feel sovereign with this enclave in our heart,'' said Candelario
Rodriguez, a 61-year-old peasant from western Panama. ``This has great meaning
to us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The stars and stripes didn't flutter over the ceremony. It had been lowered
the day before in a quiet ceremony attended by U.S. Ambassador Simon Ferro.
Panamanian officials said the Americans were trying to avoid embarrassment at
Friday's event.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Panamanians said the United States had lost yet another opportunity to
commemorate the handover as a gesture -- not of weakness, but of respect for a
smaller nation.
</P>
<P>
	   The handover was the culmination of a process that started 22 years ago,
when military strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos and President Jimmy Carter signed the
treaties that set the transition period and transfer date of the canal, a marvel
of early century engineering, and the surrounding Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor refused Friday to
block transfer of the canal. Judicial Watch, a conservative legal foundation,
had applied for a court order that would have temporarily restrained the
turnover.
</P>
<P>
	   The 20-mile by 50-mile strip that makes up the Canal Zone, filled with U.S.
military and civilian installations, cut across Panama and was often seen as a
remnant of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
	   Its origins are linked to the beginnings of the nation. The United States
supported Panama's drive for independence from Colombia in 1903. After
independence, Panama signed a treaty with Washington for the construction of a
canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The United States was given
360,000 acres along the waterway.
</P>
<P>
	   Since, relations between Panama and the United States were strained at times
over the issue of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of jubilant Panamanians attended the ceremony, and greeted with
cheers the hoisting of Panama's flag over the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the culmination of a pending account,'' said Alcibiades Picota, a
17-year-old student marching with a Panamanian flag. ``This is the achievement
of complete sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 8,000 public high school students marched from Panama City to Balboa
High School, a former U.S. Defense Department school run mainly for Americans in
Panama, where they raised the Panamanian flag.
</P>
<P>
	   They were led by six students who marched the same route in 1964, only to be
rebuffed by U.S. Marines who opened fire and killed 23 marchers. Panama
suspended diplomatic relations with the United States and the controversy helped
spark the negotiations that eventually led to the transfer treaties.
</P>
<P>
	   With the transfer, the Panama Canal Commission, a U.S. government agency, on
Friday became the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous corporation with its own
budget that will administer the canal. Nearly 1,400 ships pass through every
year, bringing more than $600 million in tolls.
</P>
<P>
	   A special government agency handling the return of the canal areas now has
more than $1.5 billion in pledged investments in tourist and development
projects in the former military bases.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscoso said the transfer ``imposes challenges and obligations for ourselves
and future generations'' and urged that the canal be treated as a ``state
matter, free of all passion and political interest.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Surrenders in Bank Standoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. (AP) -- A woman who said she was upset about losing her job and
had no hope for the future took a group of employees hostage inside a bank
Friday, then surrendered about eight hours later after setting her captives
free.
</P>
<P>
	   Olathe police Lt. Larry Griffin said he did not know what prompted the woman
to surrender. She was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
	   One person was released about four hours after the standoff began, and two
others who had been held throughout the ordeal were unharmed when the woman gave
herself up around 1 a.m., police said.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of at least five people left the bank just before 10 p.m. and at
least four others managed to escape at different times while negotiations
continued, Griffin said. He could not provide details of where the people hid or
how they escaped from the large bank, which has several different doors.
</P>
<P>
	   All were in good condition, Griffin said, and were reunited with family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza declined to release the suspect's name. He said she
could be charged on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier police reports that two suspects were involved in the standoff were
incorrect, said Griffin, who did not give any more details.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the bank employees inside the building had earlier called KMBC-TV and
said everyone was being treated well.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-taker then took the phone and said she was upset because she had
lost her job, her family and all hope for the future. She said she would release
the hostages if she could talk to a friend named Sean.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once I talk to Sean, then I'll talk to them, that's when it all ends,''
the suspect said. ``I want to talk to Sean face-to-face first before I talk to
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, she yelled to the hostages, ``Are you being harmed?'' and
people in the background were heard saying ``No.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police said no shots had been fired although the woman was believed to have
a handgun.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman entered the Bank of America branch, a free-standing building in an
Olathe shopping district, as it was closing shortly after 5 p.m. on New Year's
Eve, Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   With a SWAT team surrounding the building, police tried negotiating with the
woman by phone. Officials said the woman had abruptly broken off talks at least
once.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were tipped by a frantic call from inside the bank, Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The police department had increased the number of officers on patrol in case
of trouble New Year's Eve, and an officer was in the area when the call came in,
Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the standoff, one hostage walked outside the bank, retrieved
something from a car belonging to the suspect and went back inside, Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials would not release further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Lanza said the incident was the Kansas City area's first hostage situation
at a bank in about nine years.

<HEADLINE> Baby born in Hartford 30 seconds after midnight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Hartford Hospital welcomed a new baby into the
world just 30 seconds into the year 2000.
<P>
	   Miesha Latoya Walker weighed in at 7 pounds 13 ounces, and measured 21
inches.
</P>
<P>
	   Her mother, Yvette Walker of Hartford, had been in labor for two days and
delivered on her due date.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Catie Campbell said Walker, 34, was ready to deliver before midnight but
decided to wait until the new year had arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   "She was determined," said Dr. Campbell. "She looked at the clock and said
'I could have the millennium baby,' and I said 'You could.' She started pushing
just before midnight."
</P>
<P>
	   Miesha is Walker's second child. Her 10-year-old daughter, Desiree, named
the baby.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital planned to give the family a special gift basket filled with
toys and savings bonds for the baby, and flowers for the mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Both mother and baby were doing well, Dr. Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's perfect," she said.

the border into a neighboring country, according to a Taliban official. The
hijackers presumably went to Pakistan, the nearest country and the only one they
could easily reach within the 10 hours they were given to get out of
Afghanistan. The deal peacefully ended a tense eight-day standoff, in which one
hostage was killed. The other 155 hostages were freed. The hijackers left the
airport with three Muslim militants freed from Indian jails and one hostage -- a
soldier from Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement, who was later freed.

Few Y2K Glitches Reported So Far

the failure of a computer linked to radiation monitoring devices at a nuclear

In Spain, minor Y2K glitches at two nuclear plants were quickly fixed. Experts
said many Year 2000 computer troubles still might take days or weeks to develop.
But as the new year was completing its victory lap around the globe, crossing
into the United States without a stumble, the prevailing feeling about Y2K was

hostage was killed. The other 155 hostages were freed. The hijackers left the
airport with three Muslim militants freed from Indian jails and one hostage -- a
soldier from Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement, who was later freed.

Few Y2K Glitches Reported So Far
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   Computers silently switched to 2000 in country after anxious country
Saturday, but the dreaded Y2K bug's first bite was barely felt. Japan reported
the failure of a computer linked to radiation monitoring devices at a nuclear
power plant, but said it wasn't considered serious enough to shut the facility.
In Spain, minor Y2K glitches at two nuclear plants were quickly fixed. Experts
said many Year 2000 computer troubles still might take days or weeks to develop.
But as the new year was completing its victory lap around the globe, crossing
into the United States without a stumble, the prevailing feeling about Y2K was
one of anticlimax.

Muller and fired a one-timer past goalie Guy Hebert to tie it at 4 with 13:24
left in the third period. Hull added the winning goal 2:13 later, connecting
from the left circle. Hull and his father, Bobby, are the first father-son
combination in the 600 club. Bobby Hull had 610 goals. Wayne Gretzky is the
leader with 894.

<HEADLINE> Troubled Basque Region Begins 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILBAO, Spain (AP) -- Spain's troubled Basque country kicked off the new
millennium in familiar style with a Molotov cocktail attack on a Spanish Civil
Guard barracks early today, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   One civil guardsman was treated at a hospital for minor burns from the
attack, which involved about 35 Molotov cocktails and slightly damaged the
barracks located just outside the city of Bilbao, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Such attacks are fairly frequent occurrences in Spain's northern Basque
region and are normally blamed on young hooded supporters of the armed Basque
separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was typical, a group of people attacked and then ran away,'' the
spokesman added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spanish Civil Guard -- a paramilitary force with policing duties -- is
viewed as an occupying force by ETA and its supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, ended a 14-month cease-fire in December, deflating hopes for a
negotiated peace. The group has yet to stage an attack, but earlier this month
police seized two explosives-laden vans they said were primed to got off at an
imminent date in an unknown location.
</P>
<P>
	   ETA is blamed for nearly 800 deaths since beginning its violent campaign in
1968 for an independent Basque state straddling parts of northern Spain and
southern France.

<HEADLINE> US Military Reports No Y2K Problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Department officials said the transition to 2000
was equally uneventful at foreign and domestic military bases, although they
cautioned it could take days or weeks for some Y2K-related problems to be
recognized.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our systems thus far are free of year 2000 glitches or anything that we
can attribute to year 2000,'' Rear Adm. Robert F. Willard, head of a Y2K task
force for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Friday, several hours after
U.S. forces in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific entered the new
century.
</P>
<P>
	   Later a Pentagon official said a military intelligence system, which he
declined to identify more specifically because of its sensitivity, was knocked
offline briefly by a Y2K-related problem but was put back into service with a
temporary fix. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said full
details were not immediately available but that the interruption had no effect
on U.S. military operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The military has contingency plans for aiding communities at home and abroad
in the event of major Y2K disruptions. None was activated.
</P>
<P>
	   Having spent $3.6 billion to make its thousands of computer systems ready
for the Y2K bug, the Pentagon had hoped New Year's Eve would pass with no
glitches that could threaten national security.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon considers 2,101 of its computer systems to be
``mission-critical,'' meaning computer failure would cause serious disruption.
Virtually all were declared ready by early December.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Pentagon's National Military Command Center, where commanders can
monitor events and communicate with forces worldwide, about 30 people -- the
usual number -- were at work New Year's Eve. A ``Y2K augmentation cell'' of
about 10 monitored computer systems for viruses or hacker activity. Willard said
there had been some unauthorized intrusions into Pentagon web sites but ``no
more than normal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some Pentagon technicians spent part of Friday trying to figure out why
access to the department's main web site (www.defenselink.mil) was partially
blocked, depending on the Internet service provider involved. The problem was
traced to local human error, not Y2K.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi Defeats Oklahoma 27-25  </HEADLINE>
    By OWEN CANFIELD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- Mississippi finally got one to go its way in the
fourth quarter, and the result was another Independence Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels, who closed out the regular season with three-point losses to
Georgia and Mississippi State after leading late, beat Oklahoma 27-25 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Les Binkley's 39-yard field goal on the final play gave Ole Miss (8-4) its
second straight Independence Bowl victory and fourth straight bowl win.
Oklahoma, making its first bowl appearance since 1994, finished 7-5 despite a
record-setting performance by quarterback Josh Heupel.
</P>
<P>
	   Heupel's third touchdown pass, a 17-yarder to Quenton Griffin, and the
point-after kick by Tim Duncan had given the Sooners a 25-24 lead with 2:17
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all had it going through our mind, what we had been through with Miss
State and Georgia," coach David Cutcliffe said. "But while they were driving, we
talked about what we were going to do, how we were going to approach it. We felt
we could get it done."
</P>
<P>
	   Deuce McAllister, who ran for 121 yards and scored twice, including an
80-yard run, got the Rebels started with a 42-yard kickoff return. Then he
carried for 8 and 9 yards on the first two plays of the drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Oklahoma was penalized five yards for having too many players on the
field on a third-and-2 play.
</P>
<P>
	   "They said defense broke the huddle with 12 men on the field. We don't
huddle," Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said. "I've never heard of defense being
called for breaking the huddle with 12 men on the field, have you?
</P>
<P>
	   "We called timeout before the snap and they threw a flag, so you figure it."
</P>
<P>
	   The penalty gave Ole Miss a first down at the 27. Three plays later, on
third down, Binkley came on and cleanly made the game-winner as time expired.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt pretty confident," said Binkley, who had hit from 49 yards during
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutcliffe said he knew Binkley was within range, and he didn't want to take
any chances by running one more play before the kick.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've just seen so many bizarre things happen, I just didn't think it was
worth the risk," he said. "The difference may have been two or three yards. I
didn't want to risk a turnover."
</P>
<P>
	   Moments earlier, it looked as though Oklahoma had pulled off the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Heupel was 39-of-53 for 390 yards, all Independence Bowl records, and led
two scoring drives in the third quarter to pull Oklahoma within 21-18. He was
10-of-12 for 109 yards on the drives as the Sooners outgained Ole Miss 148-15.
</P>
<P>
	   A 29-yard field goal by Binkley capped a 14-play drive for Ole Miss and gave
the Rebels a 24-18 lead with 11:18 remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Heupel appeared to commit a costly turnover when he fumbled at the Rebels 20
on Oklahoma's next drive, but Ole Miss didn't take advantage and Oklahoma got
another shot. The Sooners drove 79 yards, including a 24-yard run by Griffin and
a 22-yard completion to Brandon Daniels, before scoring the go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels used big plays on both sides of the ball to build a big
first-half lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sooners drove to the Ole Miss 18 on their first possession, but Duncan
missed a 35-yard field goal. The Sooners also lost two fumbles, Heupel had a
pass intercepted in the end zone, and a fake field goal on the final play of the
half resulted in a 17-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
	   "You think of all the points we let go in the red zone and it's hard to
win," Stoops said.
</P>
<P>
	   Romaro Miller was especially sharp in the first half, when he completed
12-of-17 passes for 158 yards. He had two intercepted, but also had two
touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
	   The first was a 25-yarder to McAllister, one play after Miller had hit Mice
Flourney on a 45-yard completion.
</P>
<P>
	   McAllister came up with a big play three minutes later when he chased down
defensive end Cory Heinecke, who had intercepted a pass and returned it 51 yards
to the Ole Miss 20. Oklahoma wound up settling for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels used 12 plays and nearly six minutes to score their second
touchdown, which came on a 9-yard pass to tight end Adam Bettis. Miller was
5-of-5 passing and kept the drive alive with a 5-yard scramble on a third-and-5
play.
</P>
<P>
	   McAllister's 80-yard touchdown run, the longest in Independence Bowl
history, came on the first play after Tim Strickland intercepted Heupel's pass
in the end zone. McAllister bounced off a defender at the line, cut back and
outran a handful of Sooners to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels gave the state of Mississippi a 3-0 record in bowls. Mississippi
State beat Clemson 17-7 in the Peach Bowl and Southern Mississippi beat Colorado
State 23-17 in the Liberty Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Banks: No Run on Money Before Y2K  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Y2K uncertainties about money eased as ATMs continued to
work and some banks opened for business today.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not afraid of Y2K," read T-shirts worn by tellers at City National
Bank in Charleston, W.Va., which kept 10 drive-thru windows open all night New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this point everything is 100 percent," said Jeff Legge, the bank's
information systems director as customers were served shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Although most big national banks will be closed today, City National,
scheduled to stay open until noon, is among several small regional banks
planning to unlock their doors, despite the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was just a matter of trying to make our customers feel more
comfortable," said Legge.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Helwig, executive director of the Electronic Funds Transfer
Association, which represents the nation's major ATM networks, said cash
machines also were functioning normally after the midnight rollover. He tried
one in the Virginia suburbs outside Washington himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "My little receipt from the ATM says 12:05 on Jan. 1, 2000. I may have to
frame it," said Helwig, expressing relief that many in the financial services
industry shared.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday night at the Federal Reserve, Chairman Alan Greenspan dropped by the
Y2K command center after dinner at the White House for a briefing and to wish
staff a happy new year. But with all quiet, he left well before midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed spokesman Dave Skidmore said the nation's central bank still has a lot
of follow-up work to do but added: "Given the experience of the day, we look
forward to good results."
</P>
<P>
	   ATM networks and banks reported brisk business Friday but no more than on a
normal long holiday weekend that coincided with a payday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had a good bit of traffic at both our ATMs and our branches, ... but
we were certainly not unprepared or overwhelmed," said Lynn Drury, spokeswoman
for Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America, the nation's second largest bank with
4,800 branches nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed said it has delivered $80 billion in cash to banks since Oct. 1,
after recommending that they stock up in case of increased consumer demand. That
compares with $23 billion requested by banks in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed officials said they will not know until later how much of the padding
was needed.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. financial institutions with systems overseas, including credit card
companies such as American Express and MasterCard, were reporting uninterrupted
operations as the century date change rolled across the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "It bodes well for our country," said American Bankers Association spokesman
John Hall. "Of course, we'll all be looking to the first business day as well."
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has said all the nation's banks, thrifts
and credit unions passed Y2K inspections. Financial institutions have spent an
estimated $9 billion getting ready for the Year 2000 date change.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the Fed is requiring banks to check in regularly into next
week, to report computer problems or unusual customer behavior.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Track star Mary Slaney was kicked in the thigh by a man
on a bicycle while running along a bike path.
</P>
<P>
	Slaney suffered cuts and bruises, but the extent of the damage won't be known
until the swelling subsides, according to Slaney's husband, Richard.
</P>
<P>
	She was able to walk home after the incident Thursday afternoon, but won't be
able to run for a while, he said.
</P>
<P>
	Slaney was running when a man riding a bicycle approached her from the front.
As he passed, without a word, he kicked her in the left thigh, according to
Eugene police.
</P>
<P>
	Slaney doubts her assailant -- who remains unidentified -- knew she is a famous
runner, Richard Slaney said.
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's just some random jerk,'' Richard Slaney said. ``I only wish I
was 100 yards behind her.''
</P>
<P>
	Slaney won world titles in the 1,500 and 3,000 meters in 1983, and has held
world and American records. She hopes to qualify for the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, Australia.

<HEADLINE> Nation's Timekeeper Says It's 19100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an ironic Y2K computer glitch, the nation's official
timekeeper briefly reported the date as ``19100'' during the earliest hours of
the new year on its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Naval Observatory, whose master clock in Washington serves as the
nation's official source of time, published a Web page to track the time -- down
to the precise second -- exactly as the century ended.
</P>
<P>
	   But a bug in the programming of the Web site informed visitors that the
current date for U.S. time zones that had already passed midnight was Jan. 1,
19100.
</P>
<P>
	   Cmdr. Carl Rusnok of the Naval Observatory said the service's master clock
was not affected by the problem. Navy technicians fixed the problem by 2:10 a.m.
EST.
</P>
<P>
	   Rusnok said the affected Web page included software code that had been
written with an older version of programming language that was not Y2K-ready.
Other Navy Web pages were not affected.
</P>
<P>
	   The government relies upon the Naval Observatory to determine precisely the
positions and motions of the Earth, moon, planets and stars to calculate the
exact time.

vanished into the desert of southern Afghanistan and by this morning had crossed
the border into a neighboring country, according to a Taliban official.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers presumably went to Pakistan, the nearest country and the only
one they could easily reach within the 10 hours they were given to get out of
Afghanistan under a deal struck Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal peacefully ended a tense eight-day standoff in the southern Afghan
city of Kandahar. All 155 hostages were freed and were flown to New Delhi,
India.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers sped out of the airport in several vehicles, taking three
Muslim militants freed from Indian jails and one hostage -- a soldier from
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Taliban hostage has come back to Kandahar and (the hijackers) have
gone from the country,'' Taliban spokesman Rehnatullah Aga said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Aga declined to say where the hijackers went, but the only realistic
possibility was that the group drove for several hours to the border with
Pakistan, where there are countless places to cross the frontier on foot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm sure we will hear something in a few days,'' said Erick de Mul, the
U.N. representative to Afghanistan. ``I'm sure they will be spotted somewhere.
They can't just evaporate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban initially had been reluctant to get involved in negotiations
with the hijackers, and when the crisis ended Friday, the movement hurried the
men out of its territory as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban sent a heavily armed group of soldiers with the hijackers to
ensure that they left Afghanistan promptly.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan strongly denounced the hijacking, but it has little control over
its lengthy western border that may have been used as an escape route.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hijackings are particularly abhorrent to us,'' Pakistan's Foreign Ministry
said Friday evening in a statement. ``We have no sympathy for such desperate
acts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Identifying the hijackers could prove difficult because they remained masked
throughout the eight days. Taliban authorities said they did not know the names
or nationalities of the hijackers, though they acted in support of Kashmir
militants who are fighting to end Indian rule of the Himalayan territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers were traveling with three prominent Kashmiri militants, who
were freed by India in exchange for the release of the hostages on the airplane.
</P>
<P>
	   Masood Azhar, a leader of Harkat ul-Ansar, a group on a U.S. list of
terrorist organizations, was the best known of the three men released. In
addition, the Indians freed Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, chief commander of the rebel
group Ul-Umar Mujahideen, and Ahmad Omar Sayed Sheikh, who was held in a New
Delhi prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking demonstrated the volatile nature of the long-running dispute
over Kashmir, the leading source of friction between India and Pakistan. Both
nations hold part of Kashmir and claim all of it.
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan traded recriminations during the latest hijacking crisis,
placing further strain on already bad relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said Friday that ``there is no bowing
to terrorism.'' The three Muslim militants, who had been convicted of terrorism,
were released only to protect the lives of the hostages, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane on which the hostages were held left the airport at Kandahar this
morning and headed back to India after authorities had completed repairs and
checked for any potential problems.

<HEADLINE> New Year's Eve in Harlem: a quiet celebration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Harlem met the millennium with a fist today as the Rev.
Al Sharpton and others clenched their hands and Sharpton vowed the next 100
years must be "the century that brings justice."
<P>
	   As 1999 turned to 2000, Sharpton led about 100 gathered on the sidewalk in
front of a building on Madison Avenue in Harlem in a chant of "no justice, no
peace."
</P>
<P>
	   "There are those downtown celebrating. We uptown are commemorating," he said
as he stood beside a 300-pound, 3-foot-tall sculpture of a fist.
</P>
<P>
	   As the muffled sound of fireworks over Times Square reached 124th Street,
Sharpton urged the others to "raise your fist as we go into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
	   A man who identified himself only as Dwight smiled as he held his fist in
the air.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just glad to see the millennium like this instead of going downtown to
all the madness," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "So many things we've triumphed over in the last century," said Gerard
Graddy, 32.
</P>
<P>
	   Harlem had been unusually quiet throughout the evening until a gunshot on
Madison Avenue 35 minutes before midnight drew a half-dozen police cars and two
dozen officers to arrest a man who had fired a gun into the air.
</P>
<P>
	   At Sylvia's Restaurant, a landmark Harlem eatery, there were empty tables on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   That left 91-year-old vibraphonist Lionel Hampton in a peaceful setting to
enjoy his pork chitterlings, the New Year's Eve special at Sylvia's. Hampton has
played for every president since Harry Truman,
</P>
<P>
	   Joan Charles, a lawyer from lower Manhattan, said she was shocked to find
the bus to Harlem so desolate and 125th Street so quiet just two hours before
midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expected to come here and hear people shouting, 'Happy New Year!"' she
said. "It's empty."
</P>
<P>
	   She speculated that all the talk of terrorists and Y2K problems had silenced
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think people are probably afraid," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seemingly proving her point, a supermarket down the street sold flashlights
to local residents afraid that Y2K problems might knock out electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those who haven't benefited as much from Wall Street's boom, the worry
was more about paying for their family's dinner than celebrating the infancy of
the next 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
	   While midtown Manhattan hosted a $7 million party, the scene was quite
different uptown. Some building windows were boarded over. Five large machines
on 125th Street allowed those who collect bottles and cans to redeem them for
cash. A woman walked along the street with a broken crutch, collecting coins in
a coffee cup.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the hair salons, and among young couples on the street, there was
loud laughter and the expectation that the next century for Harlem will be
better than the last.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's a great time for somebody to be alive - the end of 1,000
years," Ms. Charles said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby, Hampton was finishing his dinner. He offered a suggestion for
improving the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "If more people would sing and hear music, the world would have freedom and
wouldn't depend too much on wars and rumors of wars," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Electric System Passing Y2K Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's electric power system appeared to pass the Year
2000 test Saturday as the country moved into the new year without any reports of
significant energy-related computer glitches or power interruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the Eastern time zone all utilities reported they are Y2K-ready, every
one of them,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said an hour after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, officials said no major problems had been reported in the Midwest and
Western mountain states, or in the massive electrical grid that stretches into
California and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 2 a.m. EST, 95 of 103 U.S. nuclear power plants had gone through the
transition without a Y2K interruption, officials said. Only those in the Far
West still awaited the transition.
</P>
<P>
	   John Koskinen, President Clinton's chief Y2K troubleshooter, said the
electric power grids were working without any problems. Richardson said there
was every confidence that there would be no computer problems that would
interrupt power or cause other energy problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson made a round of post-midnight calls to energy ministers of oil
producing nations, including Venezuela and Mexico. ``There's no oil disruption
problem. We're in good shape,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said the problem-free transition stemmed from months of
preparation and that people did not panic and ``acted sensibly, not hoarding
gasoline or buying generators.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two nuclear power plants -- one in Pennsylvania and another in South
Carolina -- were shut down and a third had trouble with a scheduled startup as
the new year approached. Federal and industry officials said none of the three
was related to a Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
	   A Y2K glitch caused clocks used to synchronize power system time with the
Global Positioning System of satellites to race ahead in eight power systems in
the Midwest and East, in one case jumping 35 hours forward. Officials said the
clocks are used in the distribution and energy management systems, but did not
affect power production or distribution.
</P>
<P>
	   It was first reported by Wisconsin Electric Power and later found to be a
brief problem in other power systems in the Midwest and East, Deputy Energy
Secretary T.J. Glauthier said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Hilt of the North American Electric Reliability Council, an industry
group that keeps tabs on the dependability of the U.S. power system, called it
``a nuisance problem'' that was quickly corrected. Officials said it caused no
problems with computers nor interruption of electricity service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All indications are we are going to successfully roll over,'' Richardson
said as he received reports from across the country showing that computers
operating the interconnecting electricity grids passed muster.
</P>
<P>
	   The energy secretary also said no signs had been noted of any disruption in
oil supplies anywhere in the world. The first two-thirds of the oil-producing
regions reached midnight without computer problems, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the nuclear power front, 311 of 434 of the world's nuclear power plants
-- including those in Russia and Ukraine -- rolled through the Y2K transition by
7 p.m. EST Friday or midnight Greenwich Mean Time, generally without problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Three computer glitches occurred in Japan, including an incident in which a
reactor -- the Shika plant -- reported problems with a monitoring system that
shut down unexpectedly. The plant continued to operate safely, U.S. officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Nation's Timekeeper Says It's 19100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an ironic Y2K computer glitch, the nation's official
timekeeper briefly reported the date as ``19100'' during the earliest hours of
the new year on its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Naval Observatory, whose master clock in Washington serves as the
nation's official source of time, published a Web page to track the time -- down
to the precise second -- exactly as the century ended.
</P>
<P>
	   But a bug in the programming of the Web site informed visitors that the
current date for U.S. time zones that had already passed midnight was Jan. 1,
19100.
</P>
<P>
	   Cmdr. Carl Rusnok of the Naval Observatory said the service's master clock
was not affected by the problem. Navy technicians fixed the problem by 2:10 a.m.
EST.
</P>
<P>
	   Rusnok said the affected Web page included software code that had been
written with an older version of programming language that was not Y2K-ready.
Other Navy Web pages were not affected.
</P>
<P>
	   The government relies upon the Naval Observatory to determine precisely the
positions and motions of the Earth, moon, planets and stars to calculate the
exact time.

<HEADLINE> Terrorism suspect appears in New York court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A lawyer for an Algerian man alleged to be an accomplice
of a man accused of smuggling explosives into the United States says the charges
against his client are insufficient and should be dropped.
<P>
	   The lawyer, Roland Thau, argued Friday that prosecutors failed to support
the charges brought against 31-year-old Abdel Ghani when he was arrested a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   But Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kelley told U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald
Ellis that Ghani was living in the United States illegally. And he portrayed
Ghani as eager to assist in raising money for the terrorist organization for
which Ahmed Ressam was allegedly transporting explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   An FBI criminal complaint said Ghani was apprehended after his name and
telephone number were found on a piece of paper belonging to Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   Ghani was arrested in a nationwide sweep by federal authorities who
questioned and detained dozens of people in major cities. Many of the people
were believed to be tied to Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam was arrested Dec. 14 in Port Angeles, Wash., on explosives smuggling
charges after he allegedly tried to smuggle RDX, a powerful demolition
explosive, and timing devices into Washington from Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   At Blaine, Wash., one of the busiest U.S.-Canada border crossings in the
country, traffic was light Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 10 p.m., "It's like a ghost town," said a U.S. Customs Service
supervisor who declined to give his name. "We haven't had hardly a car in the
last 15 minutes."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the light traffic is not unusual for holidays. Border Patrol
reported no unusual activity.
</P>
<P>
	   Ghani was charged with concealing his support for Ressam's efforts to
violate federal explosives laws and with conspiring with others to traffic in
and use fraudulent credit cards and bank cards.
</P>
<P>
	   Thau, Ghani's lawyer, said in court that the charges against his client
should be dropped because they exaggerate and distort the facts.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is not an iota of factual assertion in this complaint which shows us
this defendant in any way assisted Mr. Ressam," Thau said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyer said the case brought by prosecutors "does not even assert that
this defendant ever met Mr. Ressam or communicated ... with Mr. Ressam in any
fashion."
</P>
<P>
	   A government source, referred to by prosecutor Kelley as an "unindicted
confederate of the overall operation," was quoted in court papers as saying
Ghani was angry about the explosives but said he "would have been with Ressam to
the end had he known" Ressam's plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The source allegedly told the government that Ghani mentioned "that the
situation was boiling in Algeria and that the United States and the CIA are
running everything over there."
</P>
<P>
	   Algeria has been locked in a bloody civil war for nearly eight years.
</P>
<P>
	   The source told the FBI that Ghani had conversed with another person
recently, agreeing that "Allah will shake up this world, that a new generation
will punish America and that Islam's renaissance will rise from Algeria," the
complaint said.

<HEADLINE> Calm reported inside prisons as 2000 arrives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - No immediate signs of a possible strike or other
form of protest by disgruntled state prison inmates were apparent as New Year's
Day arrived, prison officials reported.
<P>
	   Rumors have persisted for weeks that inmates would demonstrate their
unhappiness with Pataki administration parole and prison labor policies
beginning today.
</P>
<P>
	   The inmates "slept quietly and without incident into the new millennium,"
Glenn S. Goord, prison commissioner, said in a statement released around 3 a-m.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman James Flateau said there were no problems in medium- and
minimum-security facilities, where inmates sleep in dormitory-style settings.
Inmates in the state's 16 maximum-security prisons were locked overnight in
their cells and would not be called out for breakfast until later in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll monitor that in the morning and see what happens," Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, all 20 of the state Department of Correctional Services' SWAT
teams will continue to stand by today at regional staging areas around the state
ready to respond to disturbances. The teams, each with about 50 corrections
officers, were also available to help local officials deal with problems if they
are called in by state emergency management officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The only two untoward prison incidents reported Friday by prison officials
were caused by animals.
</P>
<P>
	   A wild turkey flew into the path of a bus transporting inmates to Auburn on
the state Thruway about 35 miles southeast of Rochester, shattering one side of
the windshield and giving the driver and another guard minor injuries. No
inmates were hurt or tried to get away, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Beacon, an inmate working on kitchen detail at the Fishkill Correctional
Facility was bitten by a cat. The animal could not be found, and the inmate was
taken to a Poughkeepsie hospital so he could begin to receive rabies shots,
prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, clergymen and community leaders called on prison administrators
to address inmates' grievances to defuse possible disturbances.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly formed Coalition on Prison Affairs said it is not supporting the
rumored disturbances by inmates "whatever it is they're going to do," the Rev.
Herbert Daughtry of the House of the Lord Church in Brooklyn said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are concerned that people are not hurt," Daughtry, a leader of
Brooklyn's black community, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Daughtry called on state officials to address those inmate complaints they
can correct and to explain clearly to prisoners why they cannot address others.
</P>
<P>
	   "We humans have a way of being Monday morning quarterbacks, after things
explode, we say we could have done this or that differently," Daughtry said.
"Let's be proactive this time. If there are things that can be done with the
inmate population and the authorities, let's do them and let's do them now."
</P>
<P>
	   Other members of the Coalition on Prison Affairs are the Rev. Al Sharpton;
state Assemblyman Roger Green of Brooklyn; Eric Adams, co-founder of 100 Blacks
in Law Enforcement, and the president of the Dynamic of Leadership, Charles
Barron.
</P>
<P>
	   Flateau said administrators have not seen formal demands by would-be
demonstrators, and he noted that many of the things inmates appear to be
complaining about such as state parole policies cannot be altered by the state
Department of Correctional Services.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are very few issues here over which the prison system has any
control," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each prison in the state also had between 15 and 20 extra officers on duty
to cope with any problems, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The corrections department is on a heightened state of alert and prepared
to deal with any eventuality which may occur," Gov. George Pataki said at a news
conference Friday at the state's Y2K emergency command center.
</P>
<P>
	   Two maximum-security prisons were to remain locked down today as they have
been all week - Sing Sing about 30 miles north of New York City and Green Haven
about 50 miles north of the city. Inmates there were being confined to their
cells except to see visitors and receive emergency medical care.
</P>
<P>
	   A strike pamphlet titled "Wake Up" cites the Pataki administration's parole
policies as a major grievance, arguing that some inmates convicted of violent
offenses essentially have no hope of winning parole despite clean prison
records. It's unclear who wrote the pamphlet.

<HEADLINE> Washington Y2K Notebook  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With no emergencies to manage, the director of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency wanted to spend midnight with his wife
watching fireworks from the roof of FEMA's eight-story office building.
</P>
<P>
	   But the notion was deemed too dangerous -- not by his fellow federal
emergency officials, but by managers of the building. FEMA rents its Washington
office space and officials in the building services department refused to allow
James Lee Witt and his wife, Lea Ellen, on the roof because of liability
concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They wouldn't let me up there -- security reasons,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Like millions of other Americans, he had to settle for watching the
fireworks on TV.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   It was hardly the end of the world. In fact, there was so little news coming
from the government's Y2K command center that some television technicians popped
in a video -- ``Apocalypse Now.''
</P>
<P>
	   After being ratted out in a CNN news broadcast, the TV crews turned off the
movie. Still there will be plenty more time for news hounds to kill in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington's Y2K Information Coordination Center, in rented office space
four blocks from the White House, began 24-hour operations Thursday and planned
to maintain its round-the-clock vigil until the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The facility will then go to more normal business hours but stay in
operation through the month, said John Koskinen, chairman of the Council on Year
2000 Conversion.
</P>
<P>
	   The center is collecting and analyzing reports from regional centers on the
United States, U.S. embassies, foreign governments, and trade associations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It may be three or four days before we know conclusively how the
infrastructure'' in China, Russia and Indonesia is operating, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 150 people, mostly senior government executives, are working in the
facility, updating status reports on energy, finance, transportation and other
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior White House advisers were briefed periodically through the day
Friday. Koskinen said he was talking directly with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The media were kept in a room two floors above the center. A closed-circuit
TV camera periodically gave reporters in the press room a picture of the
government officials at work.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon had so little Y2K news to report that spokesman P.J. Crowley
began an evening briefing on a sporting note.
</P>
<P>
	   As a diehard fan of the Boston Red Sox baseball team, Crowley said, he hopes
the dread ``curse of the Bambino'' is not Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
	   In baseball lore, the Red Sox supposedly are hexed for having traded Babe
Ruth -- ``the Bambino'' to fans -- to the New York Yankees in 1920. The Sox, who
had won the World Series twice in the previous four seasons, have not won it
since.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You wanted news, and I'm here to tell you that the curse of the Bambino
expires in 2 1/2 hours,'' Crowley said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   They were all wisecracks -- Federal Aviation Administrator Jane Garvey and
Sen. Slade Gorton -- before boarding American Airlines flight 1099 in a show of
confidence in the air-traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's lonely at the top,'' Garvey cracked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would not have volunteered for this flight in Russia,'' Gorton, R-Wash.,
joked to reporters before the flight from Washington to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Koskinen, the Y2K chief, was flying a 6:30 p.m. shuttle from
Washington to New York to fulfill a promise he made long ago to be in the air at
midnight Greenwich Mean Time in England, on which the nation's air traffic
system operates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said I'm going to fly and so I'm going to fly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Garvey said officials found no Y2K problems on any of the 3,000 flights that
the FAA monitored early Friday. But significantly fewer planes were in the air
Friday evening because of the public's lack of confidence in aviation safety
systems.
</P>
<P>
	   So will they pop open champagne at the appointed hour? Garvey shook her
head. ``We're traveling in coach.''

<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Y2K bug didn't bite here either.
<P>
	   At midnight at the city's $13 million emergency operations center, just
after the ball dropped in Times Square to mark the arrival of the year 2000,
Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota pronounced, "Y2K is Y2-OK."
</P>
<P>
	   He said all the city's crucial computer systems appeared to be functioning

services. The 911 system was running smoothly, too. And a plane took off.
</P>
<P>
	   It was welcome news to the 200 or so officials gathered at 7 World Trade
Center, many of whom had worked for months - even years - on New York's $350
million effort to combat the Y2K computer glitch, which threatened this and
every other industrialized city around the globe.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as the date change went smoothly across the planet, so it did in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our systems are not that much different from what they have in Frankfurt
and in Paris and in London, and everything there has worked according to the way
it's supposed to work," Lhota said, adding later that he was able to call his
wife from his cellular telephone around midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerome Hauer, commissioner of the Office of Emergency Management, went so
far as to proclaim there was nothing magic about midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   And at 12:36 a.m., Lhota announced that initial testing showed the city's
computer systems for police, fire, emergency management, water, the hospitals
and traffic were all in order.
</P>
<P>
	   Only the tiniest of electrical problems was reported. Consolidated Edison
was able to reset the clocks affecting power lines on Staten Island and in
Brooklyn after an early warning system indicated trouble. It was taken care of
without disrupting service to any of the company's 3 million customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents in Queens experienced a brief outage, but it wasn't Y2K-related.
Instead, some balloons with a metallic outer layer got stuck in power lines and
caused a short. Service was restored within an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the Long Island Power Authority, which provides electric
service to 1.1 million customers in Long Island and parts of Queens, and KeySpan
Energy, which provides gas to 1.6 million customers in the area, said they
experienced no service disruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 1 a.m., all Port Authority facilities were operating normally. The
first 2000 flight out of Kennedy Airport, a Korean Air jet to Seoul, took off at
12:28 a.m. The first flight out of LaGuardia Airport was scheduled for 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said it would take until at least this evening to complete testing
all the city's computers, but early results looked good.
</P>
<P>
	   "Happy millennium," Mayor Rudolph Giuliani offered. "Welcome to the 21st
century - with all the lights on."

    NEW YORK (AP) -- All in all, it was perfect TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Extraordinary settings around the world. A series of spectacular events
pegged to a single huge theme. Towering issues on which to reflect. A cast of
millions.
</P>
<P>
	   And it built to a crescendo at midnight in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, they're in a party mood," said Dick Clark after delivering his
time-honored countdown for ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   Some viewers may have found that watching TV's coverage of the millennium
required some nimble channel-surfing.
</P>
<P>
	   However generously ABC tracked the story, did you really want to see
magician David Blaine eat a thread he had pulled off the sports jacket of anchor
Peter Jennings; swallow it; then extract it from a hole in the flesh of his
abdomen?
</P>
<P>
	   However impressive was CBS' airing of the entertainment from the mall in
Washington, D.C., did you really want to hear Tom Jones sing "It's Not Unusual"
with the Lincoln Memorial looming over his shoulder?
</P>
<P>
	   Or maybe you did.
</P>
<P>
	   But more to the point of TV's Coming of 2000 was the global wave after wave
of televised observances, beginning Friday at 5 a.m. EST and finally marching,
hour by hour, across the U.S.
</P>
<P>
	   By Friday night, it began to be almost giddy-making, a near overload of
images. Moments before 11 p.m. EST, a Fox News Channel anchor announced
deliriously, "It's about to be New Year's somewhere just east of where we are!"
</P>
<P>
	   Four hours earlier, viewers saw London's pyrotechnic spectacle, with
coverage even including video of the clapper within Big Ben's bell tower
announcing 12 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
	   And an hour before that, there was almost a visual traffic jam as TV screens
lit up with scenes of fireworks over Paris' Eiffel Tower alternating with Pope
John Paul II addressing multitudes in Vatican City and searchlights piercing the
Berlin sky. Not to mention the extravaganza in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC News threw itself into the coverage, packaging the millennium as a
showcase for its stars (Barbara Walters in Paris, Charles Gibson in London,
etc.), with Jennings presiding throughout from the network's Times Square
studio.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC's 25 hours of airtime seemed to add up to fewer than 25 hours of
content. But Jennings held up nicely, including regular wardrobe changes.
Receiving a compliment from musician Kenny G for his endurance at Hour 18,
Jennings replied, "We're standing up, that's the main thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Part of a worldwide broadcast consortium, PBS provided a thoughtful, even
leisurely viewing experience, while the cable news networks stuck with the story
throughout.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC aired an expanded "Nightly News," then resumed coverage at 9 p.m. EST,
which stretched into the wee hours with Tom Brokaw anchoring.
</P>
<P>
	   But CBS was largely missing in action. Other than a regular edition of the
"Evening News," anchor Dan Rather was glimpsed only in 30-second updates. It was
a disappointing way for that news organization to enter a new era.
</P>
<P>
	   If the epic countdown lived up to its billing, an accompanying story seemed
fortunately to fizzle: feared computer glitches by older computer systems unable
to cope with the four new digits of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   And neither terrorists nor rowdies caused a problem, as correspondents were
grateful to report.
</P>
<P>
	   "So far, the pictures are all positive," said CNN anchor Judy Woodruff as
fireworks erupted over Times Square. "It's celebration, it's lights, it's
dancing and a lot of happy faces."
</P>
<P>
	   Over on NBC, Brokaw offered his own hopeful postscript. "The celebration
remains," he said, "because the century will go on."

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Alexandria Bay, N.Y., border crossing with Canada was

concluded the vehicle held no explosives, Customs spokesman Dennis Murphy said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leads Nation Into 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the Washington Monument aglow like an exclamation
mark, the 21st century began with chilly revelers toasting champagne in paper
cups and President Clinton urging Americans to bridge divisions that scarred the
millennium just passed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the story of the 20th century is the triumph of freedom, what will the
story of the 21st century be?'' Clinton asked, speaking from the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial, the nation's 16th president in stone peering over his
shoulder. ``Let it be the triumph of freedom, wisely used, to bring peace to a
world in which we honor our differences and even more, our common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
	   The millennium party in Washington was staged along the National Mall and
reflecting pool that first mirrored the date 1999 and then a giant 2000.
Revelers wore bright-colored sunglasses with zeros for eyes, party hats and
glittery tiaras and sparkles in their hair. Neon green light sticks doubled as
head bands and necklaces.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spoke just moments before midnight. The crowd, anxious for the new
year, listened with only one ear. Instead, children blew bubbles into the air,
toddlers were hoisted to shoulders for a better view, a boy shook a can of silly
string, getting ready to squirt it as the countdown ended.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour show with songs, dances and a film about America's past and
future, competed on television with the traditional Times Square countdown. In
New York the ball of light descended in the seconds before midnight; in
Washington, a white light of fireworks cascaded up the 555-foot Washington
Monument, sparked by a fuse racing along the reflecting pool.
</P>
<P>
	   The year 2000 had arrived. Fireworks exploded in the sky. Confetti and
streamers showered the crowd. Lovers kissed. Three friends -- Debbie Clark of
Washington, Glen Fisher of Fairfax, Va., and Scott Slater of Alexandria, Va. --
clinked paper cups of champagne and toasted health and happiness. Children sang
``America'' along with performers they watched on giant television screens.
</P>
<P>
	   For some, the midnight moment ended a little too abruptly. The fireworks
were brief. A longer, fireworks show came an hour later, after much of the crowd
had left.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a little disappointing,'' Jean Dinkel of Towson, Md., said as she
and her husband left, unaware of the second set of fireworks to come. ``But the
monument was beautiful. And the crowd was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was a night to think about the future, make resolutions and speak of
hopes for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   For Vernice Guthrie, a lawyer in Washington: ``As we walk into the new
century what people will be looking for and what will sustain them is the truth.
People are demanding the truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others had simpler thoughts about 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Tahnee Poafpybitty, 10, of Springfield, Va., one of the children who lighted
a fuse that began the fireworks, said: ``I think it's exciting and they might
have like flying cars and they might have like a faster Ferris wheel.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. John Glenn said his new year's plan was to ``just keep
pluggin'.'' Actor Robert DeNiro was ``just ... happy to be around.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two came to the party from a blacktie dinner at the White House, where
all-night dancing in a huge, heated tent on the south lawn followed the
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton offered three toasts -- to his more than 300 guests, to his wife and
to humanity's ``shared future.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``By far my most solemn prayer for this new millennium is that we will find
somehow the strength and wisdom in our hearts to keep growing together, first as
one America and then as one people on this ever-smaller planet we all call
home,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Cezanne Painting Stolen in Oxford  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    OXFORD, England (AP) -- Art thieves broke into an Oxford museum and made off
with a painting by the French artist Paul Cezanne early Saturday, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The thieves broke through the glass roof of the Ashmolean Museum, housing
one of Britain's finest art collections, and grabbed the painting valued at
about $3.2 million, before escaping unnoticed, the museum's director Roger Hobby
told the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the theft probably happened around 1:30 a.m. while the streets of
Oxford were crowded with noisy millennium revelers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Officers are currently liaising with museum staff to ascertain exactly what
has happened," said a spokesman for Thames Valley Police, speaking with a
customary policy of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The museum, in a 17th-century building, houses paintings by artists such as
Leonardo da Vinci and Pablo Picasso. The stolen Cezanne work, "Auvers-Sur-Oise,"
was painted between 1879 and 1882.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, another Cezanne painting -- stolen from a Massachusetts' home in
1978 and recovered last October -- was sold at a Sotheby's auction in London for
$30 million.

<HEADLINE> US Electric System Passing Y2K Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new millennium began and the lights stayed on.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of preparation, America's electric power systems passed the
Year 2000 test in the early hours of the new year with no interruption of
electricity and only a scattering of minor glitches that did not affect the
power grids or generating plants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even though there are some glitches, the news is good both in the United
States and around the world,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson declared as the
nation rolled into the new century.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson and other U.S. officials had been concerned about the Y2K
computer bug's possible impact on nuclear power reactors in Russia and the rest
of the former Soviet Union. But hours before the new year came to America, the
Russians reported no problems.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a sign of good things to come.
</P>
<P>
	   As the new year moved across the United states from the eastern to western
time zones, utilities reported good news: No interruption of electricity. And
the country's 103 commercial reactors gave no sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   The electricity grids from Maine to California were working normally, said
John Koskinen, President Clinton's chief Y2K troubleshooter as the reports came
in from the East, then the Midwest, and finally the western states.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson, meanwhile, made a round of post-midnight calls to energy
ministers of oil producing nations, including Venezuela and Mexico. ``There's no
oil disruption problem. We're in good shape,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said the problem-free transition stemmed from months of
preparation and that people did not panic and ``acted sensibly, not hoarding
gasoline or buying generators.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like electricity and oil, the natural gas industry also reported smooth
sailing without pipeline interruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   There were some minor glitches, and because of the overall system
performance they gained attention beyond their actual impact.
</P>
<P>
	   Clocks used to synchronize power system time with the Global Positioning
System of satellites went haywire in parts of the Midwest and East. At last
eight utilities' power systems were affected by the glitch first reported by the
Wisconsin Electric Power Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The clocks race ahead by as much as 35 hours, but the problem was quickly
noticed and the clocks were reset. It was ``a problem corrected quickly and had
no affect on the operation of the power systems,'' said Deputy Energy Secretary
T.J. Glauthier.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson and others said it was ``too early to declare victory'' and that
other problems could surface in the coming days as a result of the Y2K rollover.
</P>
<P>
	   But from all signs there appeared to be little likelihood of a significant
electricity or energy disruption linked to Y2K, said Richardson, who spent 18
hours at the department, missing the New Year's Eve celebrations at the White
House, and at the National Mall not far away.
</P>
<P>
	   No matter, he said. ``Things are going well.''

<HEADLINE> White House Disavows In-Laws' Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House told officials in the former Soviet
republic of Georgia this week that President Clinton does not approve of a
controversial international business deal sought by his wife's brother,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would let Tony Rodham export hazelnuts from Georgia with
cooperation from the leading political rival of Georgian President and Clinton
ally Eduard Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If in fact this project is still going forward, we don't approve and will
continue to make clear to Georgian officials that this venture has no connection
with or sanction from the U.S. government,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the White House contacted Georgian diplomats earlier this
week to say the same thing, and urge that the issue not cause a rift between the
two governments.
</P>
<P>
	   The Shevardnadze rival, Aslan Abashidze, has flaunted his connections to
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's brothers, Tony and Hugh Rodham, as evidence
he holds Clinton administration support.
</P>
<P>
	   That caused political discomfort for Shevardnadze and led to complaints from
his government to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said national security adviser Sandy Berger intervened in
September, asking the Rodhams to drop the deal. The Rodhams ``indicated at that
time that they would do so,'' Lockhart said. The White House did not explain why
the Rodhams did not comply.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Rodhams were originally involved in the hazelnut deal, but Tony Rodham
has since said that his brother is no longer involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Rodham recently told The Washington Post that he is still pursuing a
deal, although the terms have changed. Instead of investing in hazelnut
production and then working to export the crop, Rodham said he is now interested
only in exporting.

<HEADLINE> Eating Home-Cooked Meals Less Common  </HEADLINE>
    By MARIA CODER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- If it seems like you hardly eat at home any more -- you're
right.
</P>
<P>
	   While the home-cooked meal is not yet an endangered species, the number of
meals prepared and eaten at home is at an all-time low, according to the 14th
annual NPD Group report on Eating Patterns in America.
</P>
<P>
	   And, not surprisingly, the number of meals purchased in restaurants is at a
record-breaking high, the market research firm reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The November study found that the average American consumed 917 home-cooked
meals and 139 restaurant meals during the year ending in February, the period
tracked by the report.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, the average person ate 933 home-cooked meals and 122 restaurant
meals. That means that there has been a 14 percent increase in the number of
restaurant meals during the decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Fast food restaurants captured more than 80 percent of the growth in
restaurant meals in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
	   NPD Vice President Harry Balzer, who has been monitoring national eating
patterns for 20 years, believes consumers are more concerned with their time and
money than they are with maintaining a balanced diet.
</P>
<P>
	   "After years of attempting to eat our way to better health, with the only
tangible result being a heavier American, we are back at looking for the easiest
and cheapest way to take care of feeding ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And people aren't shy about admitting they eat out.
</P>
<P>
	   "By the time I get home I'm exhausted," Kathleen Ignozzi, a student in the
New York area, explained as she looked over a Chinese food menu in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Dayton, a lawyer in Salt Lake City, visiting New York's Rockefeller
Center, said he too prefers to eat his meals outside the home. "I eat cheap food
out a lot. I don't know how to cook and Doritos every night is really gross."
</P>
<P>
	   Balzer believes that while supermarkets and food manufacturers may be
feeling the pinch from the growth in the restaurant industry, home-cooked food
may make a comeback if it comes down in price and is made easier to prepare.
</P>
<P>
	   Other findings show that "heat and eat" meals are becoming increasingly
popular.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, 34 percent of all home-cooked meals included at least one item
where the preparation was just "warmed" or "heated."
</P>
<P>
	   The NPD's annual report is based on information provided by 15,000
households where nearly 40,000 individuals complete food and beverage
consumption journals for a two-week period.

<HEADLINE> GM Unveils Car That Delivers 80 Mpg  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is unmasking a five-passenger
test car that can travel about 80 miles on a gallon of gasoline -- the product
of six years of research and hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   While meeting several goals set out by President Clinton and industry
leaders in 1993, the GM Precept also uses technology that is years away from
everyday use.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Ford Motor Co.'s Prodigy high-mileage car, Precept uses a small diesel
engine linked to electric motors.
</P>
<P>
	   Such diesel cars could run afoul of U.S. anti-pollution rules like the new
standards for auto emissions President Clinton unveiled in November, which even
the Precept and Prodigy would not meet.
</P>
<P>
	   Engineers say a byproduct of more efficient diesel engines is more nitrogen
oxides in the exhaust -- a prime component of smog.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we are ever going to deliver true environmental benefits with lower
emissions ... we've got to convince the federal government to relax the
(nitrogen oxide) standards," GM Vice Chairman Harry Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Prodigy gets about 70 mpg and sticks to the basic outlines of
today's mid-size sedans, GM's engineers had to break several conventions to get
the extra 10 mpg.
</P>
<P>
	   The Precept's Isuzu-built three-cylinder diesel engine is in the rear of the
car to improve airflow around the vehicle. One electric motor powers the front
wheels while a "multi-purpose unit" built onto the diesel engine acts as another
electric motor and a generator, recharging a battery pack under the seats. The
motors help the 54-horsepower engine during acceleration and capture energy
during braking.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather than rearview mirrors, the car uses tiny cameras, and the doors use
electronic controls rather than handles.
</P>
<P>
	   GM engineers also tried to save weight by using aluminum and titanium rather
than steel in many parts. The seats are made of mesh, and even the stereo
speakers have a weight-saving design. The result is a car that is the size of a
Chevrolet Malibu but weighs about 460 pounds less.
</P>
<P>
	   The Precept is the result of the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, an effort backed by $250 million in federal funding this year and $980
million from GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler. All three targeted 2000 as the year
to show test cars that had three times a standard sedan's fuel economy and
promises of no compromises in safety, performance or price.
</P>
<P>
	   Honda and Toyota also will sell vehicles this year that rely on similar
power sources, but no automaker has committed to making such cars in any great
numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pearce said the Precept's technology could end up in similar GM vehicles in
five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our view at GM is that environmental issues will become increasingly
important to people," he said. "Can I tell you when that's going to happen? No."

<HEADLINE> New York crowd at almost 2 million welcomes in 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - It looked like a traditional New Year's Eve as lights
from 90 pyramid-shaped mirrors on the Times Square crystal ball danced across
expectant faces. But as the new millennium arrived, the chorus of nearly 2
million that arose in greeting surpassed tradition.
<P>
	   The mass of revelers surged north from the ball's home at One Times Square
nearly to Central Park, almost 20 blocks. The party would go on for 24 hours -
marking hour-by-hour the advent of 2000 in each of the world's time zones.
</P>
<P>
	   The $7 million show featured a 16-foot elephant puppet to celebrate New
Year's in India, Lakota Sioux dancers from the American West and a figure of
Father Time operated by eight puppeteers.
</P>
<P>
	   The performances by some 500 dancers, singers and puppeteers started when it
was midnight in New Zealand (7 a.m. Friday in New York) and ended with the new
century arriving a day later at Nuku Hiva, an island in the Marquesas chain (6
a.m. today New York time).
</P>
<P>
	   The event - and the audience - gave truth to Times Square's nickname as
Crossroads of the World. Japanese, French and Britons watched as celebrations
from their homelands flashed across giant television screens.
</P>
<P>
	   They came despite fears of terrorism, made sharper by the arrest on Thursday
in Brooklyn of a man suspected of links to Algerian radicals and a bomb scare
before midday Friday. Police had welded shut manholes and locked mailboxes to
eliminate hiding places for bombs. In the end, they arrested only about a dozen
people for minor rowdiness.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Vasquez, 20, said he worried about terrorism but still drove from
Minneapolis, Minn., with several friends.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great to still be alive," Vasquez said. "I want to tell my grandkids
that we were here."
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he was relieved because there were worries
"right up to the last minute," but he cited the cooperation of everyone in New
York for a peaceful evening.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the most diverse city in the world," Giuliani said as the crowd began
to dwindle in the early morning. "It shows that we can get along, we can have a
great celebration, we can do it peacefully."
</P>
<P>
	   In the darkness just before 6 a.m., the last few hundred revelers counted
down to the New Year in French Polynesia, the Midway Islands, Nuku Hiva and
Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the final seconds of the 20th century in the whole world," exclaimed
Brian Perkins, 19, as revelers around him erupted in tears at the end of Times
Square's 24-hour celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   There had been fears of millennial blackouts should the feared Y2K computer
glitch prove a reality. But New York's utility, Consolidated Edison, made good
on its promise to light Times Square and the city with 7 billion watts - the
equivalent of 70 million 100-watt lightbulbs.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, people praised the police trying to protect against total
overcrowding, but Zarar Aflam from London complained that officers who turned
him away from 45th Street and told him to head 20 blocks north were too zealous
about crowd control.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm quite appalled with the system," Aflam said. "We spent so much money to
come here. They've overdone it with the precautions."
</P>
<P>
	   Others from abroad were delighted, however.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted to come to New York for the millennium, and now my dream has come
true," said Tiago Depuydt of Veurne, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   As much as the elaborate international displays, Times Square's own bright
lights seemed part of the show when New York's New Year arrived after 17 hours
of celebrations for the millennium's appearance around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Mary Ann Hopkins, a New York medical professor and volunteer with the
group that won this year's Nobel Peace Prize, had pushed the button to lower the
traditional crystal ball in her first time at a Times Square New Year.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's thrilling to be a part of it," she said. "The energy of the people is
exhilarating, and that's what I like to do in medicine - work with people."

<HEADLINE> Year 2000 partying goes deeper - down 156 feet to be exact  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HOWES CAVE, N.Y. (AP) - While thousands of New Yorkers gazed at
fireworks as 1999 turned into 2000, some partiers in the rural hills of upstate
New York dropped off the face of the Earth - or descended into it.
<P>
	   At midnight, 70 people wearing "Y2K Cave" jackets celebrated the New Year in
Howe Caverns, an underground maze of tunnels 156 feet underground that was
carved millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The popular tourist destination located about 30 miles west of Albany held a
champagne toast underground after an evening of dinner and dancing above.
</P>
<P>
	   And Y2K worries didn't bug the crowd anymore than those above ground.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a generator had the need been there," Richard Nethaway, guest
services manager, said after midnight. But the lights and the partying continued
uninterrupted. "Everything went just fine. Everyone had a ball."
</P>
<P>
	   The $250 per person included a beef and shrimp dinner and the jackets for
revelers to wear below where it was 52 degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the state, the doings were more traditional.
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester held the largest fireworks show in the city's history, a $50,000
extravaganza with sparkling lights and explosive bursts enveloping downtown.
</P>
<P>
	   Fireworks were set off from five locations, the Rochester Philharmonic
Orchestra performed a free, sold-out concert and a projection television screen
broadcast live telecasts of celebrations from cities worldwide from a skyway
bridge above Main Street.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was fantastic," said Chris Russel of Palmyra, Wayne County. "Never,
never, never have I seen anything like it in Rochester before. It was a great
night, no snow and all these people."
</P>
<P>
	   Citywide celebrations were also held in Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people were expected to celebrate at the Oneida Indian Nation's
Turning Stone casino, 35 miles east of Syracuse. The casino-convention
center-luxury hotel complex has a number of parties planned.
</P>
<P>
	   Parties weren't scheduled everywhere, though.
</P>
<P>
	   In the city of Auburn, officials planned to greet 2000 not with fireworks,
but with bagels and coffee.
</P>
<P>
	   A "Millennium Breakfast at Dawn" was scheduled for this morning at 6:30
a.m., followed by a 1.25 mile Millennial Y "2K" Race.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's on a relatively small scale compared to what other municipalities are
doing across the country and across the world, but we wanted to make sure we
didn't let the event pass us without celebrating," said Auburn Mayor-elect
Melina Carnicelli.
</P>
<P>
	   Town of East Fishkill Supervisor Peter Idema said his municipality, which
had originally decided to hold a New Year's Eve party for residents who live 50
miles north of New York City, canceled the idea due to a lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   "We received two calls and said, 'Forget it,"' said Idema, who believes many
people chose to stay home not out of fear but because it is a meaningful way to
start the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   Krista Gore and Mikhail Yefimenko did make meaningful plans for New Year's
Eve - to get married in Glens Falls, about 40 miles north of Albany. The
24-year-olds got engaged last Christmas and were able to book their wedding
reception at the Queensbury Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Plenty of other couples also celebrated the new millennium with new
marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvette Smead and Brian Sesselman decided to marry two months ago and picked
a New Year's Eve wedding at the Hadley Town Hall west of Glens Falls with a
reception at the American Legion Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   "My father works for NiMo and he assured me that the power's not going to go
out," Smead said. "If it does, we've got plenty of candles."
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Giordano and Rebecca Harris surprised their wedding guests with an
exploding canon, sparklers and showers of confetti in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
	   John Marvel and Carol Phillips tied the knot in a simple afternoon ceremony
in their Victor home, four weeks after John threw his back out while proposing
to Carol in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
	   Johanna Gaudino and Shawn Whitney exchanged vows at midnight in Dansville -
and invited strangers who wanted to propose, marry or renew commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just had to get married at midnight," said Gaudino, a mail clerk. "We
didn't want to be the last of 1999. We wanted to be the first of 2000."

<HEADLINE> Millennium, Y2K fears pass New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Early accounts statewide seemed to indicate the
much-feared, much-planned for Y2K bug was a dud.
<P>
	   Thousands of extra utility workers and emergency personnel with generators
worked through the night to make it so. But some were sent home early because
there was nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every passing minute is another good indication that we passed the test of
Y2K," Dennis Michalski, spokesman for the State Emergency Management Office said
shortly before 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Michalski said several counties lined up command centers and manpower to
deal with disruptions - but closed a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   It appeared the same with utility companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "We went through the rollover just fine," Niagara Mohawk spokesman Gerald
Rockower said from company headquarters in Syracuse. "There were no problems
anywhere in our transmission system."
</P>
<P>
	   State Emergency Management Office workers staffed phones and computers from
the state's "bunker" through this morning.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are still vigilant, there could still be problems, but we don't
anticipate any," said state Operations Director James Natoli from the state-run
underground command center in Albany, which buzzed with activity Friday as 150
people monitored the state's vital functions. Workers continued to take reports
from hospitals and utilities, but no Y2K-related troubles were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made it through Y2K, no hitch," said Terry Dunford, spokesman for the
West Valley Demonstration Project. Located in West Valley, 40 miles south of
Buffalo, the site was once the country's only commercial reprocessing center for
nuclear fuel. "We spent two years planning for this and we had 100 people in
here tonight," Dunford said. "In our case, if we make a mistake, it will take
10,000 years to fix."
</P>
<P>
	   The new year, however, didn't come without a scare.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thousand Island Bridge in northern New York was reopened at 1 a.m. after
three hours after an initial scanner reading incorrectly identified nitrates in
a car. Earlier, police rerouted traffic through the city of Ogdensburg, 120
miles north of Syracuse and an explosives response team was called in.
</P>
<P>
	   James McMahon, superintendent of the state police, said a scanner
inadvertently picked up traces of a potential explosive material while searching
a Canadian driver. The reading was proved wrong and the motorist released.
</P>
<P>
	   After midnight, Winston Barrus, the acting district director of Immigration
and Naturalization Services in Buffalo, reported no incidents at the state's
seven ports of entry with Canada, where fear of terrorism had risen in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Even New York's prisons, a hotbed for rumors of a statewide riot and protest
in recent weeks, were quiet shortly after midnight, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "No state in America ... is more ready than we are to deal with any
potential problems that might come up tonight," said Gov. George Pataki, who
ends the century in the office held in 1900 by one of his idols, a 41-year-old
war hero named Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's command center will remain staffed into the weekend, as will
satellite centers around New York.
</P>
<P>
	   A key concern for state officials is making sure its sprawling power grid
continues to deliver electricity. The state's utilities have each declared
themselves Y2K compliant, but thousands of extra workers were on duty overnight
at generating plants, electrical stations, gas pipelines and command centers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've done all our drilling, all our testing. We've completed our planning.
Now, we're just waiting and monitoring the world situation," said Mark Frank of
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. "We're confident that we'll encounter few, if any,
problems."
</P>
<P>
	   Niagara Mohawk scheduled about 1,000 additional workers - 10 times the
number of people who would ordinarily work a holiday night. They included
radio-equipped technicians at 100 key substations from Olean to Ticonderoga.
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric spokesman Mike Power noted that isolated outages
due to a limb falling on a line or a car hitting a power pole are not uncommon
and that any outage today could be routine.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic began an intensive around-the-clock watch Friday on its
telecommunications system.
</P>
<P>
	   The volume of telephone calls was heavier than normal for a New Year's Eve,
but the network handled the load with few if any delays, said spokesman Cliff
Lee.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've fixed, replaced or retired equipment," said Skip Patterson, who runs
Bell Atlantic's Year 2000 Program Office, "and we're confident Jan. 1 will be
just another day."
</P>
<P>
	   That refrain was common, but extraordinary precautions were taken just the
same:
</P>
<P>
	   -Albany International Airport had on hand a 1250 kilowatt mobile power
generator and a tank truck to supply water;
</P>
<P>
	   -hospitals brought in technical personnel to watch electronic systems;
</P>
<P>
	   -Keycorp was making extra deliveries of cash to ATMs, even though bank
officials had no evidence of a run on cash machines.
</P>
<P>
	   In western New York, all was quiet after midnight. Officials said there were
no major problems in the city, where the most serious mishap was a water main
break.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would say it's even quieter than usual for a Friday night," said Harold
Litwin, chief of operations for police in Buffalo, which 100 years ago was a
bustling commercial center more populous than 12 states.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's dead," said a man selling hot dogs in front of the arena where the
band Bare Naked Ladies performed. "There's only about 8,000 people in there.
We'll get more tomorrow when Toronto comes to town to play the Sabres."
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester-based Wegmans Food Markets and rival Tops markets reported recent
increases in the sales of water, flashlights, canned soups, bathroom tissue,
cereals, baby food and other staples. At Wegmans, bags of charcoal were snapped
up at the same pace as in the peak barbecue summer season.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are stocking up in general but not to any unusual degree," said Jo
Natale, spokeswoman for the Wegmans Food Markets based in Rochester. "I wouldn't
characterize any of it as panic buying."
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds were large and problems were few at several "First Night" downtown
celebrations across the state. Most went off as planned, but as 13,000 revelers
began to filter into Binghamton's event, fire erupted in a downtown bar damaging
the tavern and an adjacent adult book store, reported the Binghamton Press &AMP;
Sun-Bulletin. No injuries were reported and the cause remained under
investigation. A couple acts had to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the newest First Night celebrations was in Saratoga Springs, near the
site of the Battles of Saratoga where 222 years ago America's citizen soldiers
shocked the world's most powerful empire and turned the tide of the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   In that city of 25,000 about 25 miles north of Albany, all 20,000 buttons
needed for First Night events were sold out for the first time in four years,
said police Sgt. Dan Noeker.
</P>
<P>
	   In the basements of local police stations and county office buildings,
emergency preparedness workers were on the job, missing parties and mostly
watching nothing happen, often with good cheer.
</P>
<P>
	   On the chalkboard of the Washington County Emergency Command Center,
"TEOTWAWKI" was written on a chalkboard, reported the Glens Falls Post-Star.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's this?" asked Pete Zayachek, coordinator of the county's emergency
medical response system.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an acronym for 'The End Of The World As We Know It'," laughed
Emergency Services Coordinator Toby Dusha.

<HEADLINE> Calm reported inside prisons as 2000 arrives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - No immediate signs of a possible strike or other
form of protest by disgruntled state prison inmates were apparent today as New
Year's Day arrived, prison officials reported.
<P>
	   Rumors have persisted for weeks that inmates would demonstrate their
unhappiness with Pataki administration parole and prison labor policies
beginning today.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything is still quiet," prison spokesman James Flateau said this
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Flateau said there were no problems in medium- and minimum-security
facilities, where inmates sleep in dormitory-style settings. Inmates in the
state's 16 maximum-security prisons were locked overnight in their cells.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakfast of cold cereal was being served shortly after 8 a.m. and was
without problems, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Generally speaking across the system we're running things a little bit
slower than we usually would just to look at the tenor" of the population,
Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, all 20 of the state Department of Correctional Services' SWAT
teams will continue to stand by today at regional staging areas around the state
ready to respond to disturbances. The teams, each with about 50 corrections
officers, were also available to help local officials deal with problems if they
are called in by state emergency management officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The only two untoward prison incidents reported Friday by prison officials
were caused by animals.
</P>
<P>
	   A wild turkey flew into the path of a bus transporting inmates to Auburn on
the state Thruway about 35 miles southeast of Rochester, shattering one side of
the windshield and giving the driver and another guard minor injuries. No
inmates were hurt or tried to get away, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Beacon, an inmate working on kitchen detail at the Fishkill Correctional
Facility was bitten by a cat. The animal could not be found, and the inmate was
taken to a Poughkeepsie hospital so he could begin to receive rabies shots,
prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, clergymen and community leaders called on prison administrators
to address inmates' grievances to defuse possible disturbances.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly formed Coalition on Prison Affairs said it is not supporting the
rumored disturbances by inmates "whatever it is they're going to do," the Rev.
Herbert Daughtry of the House of the Lord Church in Brooklyn said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are concerned that people are not hurt," Daughtry, a leader of
Brooklyn's black community, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Daughtry called on state officials to address those inmate complaints they
can correct and to explain clearly to prisoners why they cannot address others.
</P>
<P>
	   "We humans have a way of being Monday morning quarterbacks, after things
explode, we say we could have done this or that differently," Daughtry said.
"Let's be proactive this time. If there are things that can be done with the
inmate population and the authorities, let's do them and let's do them now."
</P>
<P>
	   Other members of the Coalition on Prison Affairs are the Rev. Al Sharpton;
state Assemblyman Roger Green of Brooklyn; Eric Adams, co-founder of 100 Blacks
in Law Enforcement, and the president of the Dynamic of Leadership, Charles
Barron.
</P>
<P>
	   Flateau said administrators have not seen formal demands by would-be
demonstrators, and he noted that many of the things inmates appear to be
complaining about such as state parole policies cannot be altered by the state
Department of Correctional Services.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are very few issues here over which the prison system has any
control," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each prison in the state also had between 15 and 20 extra officers on duty
to cope with any problems, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The corrections department is on a heightened state of alert and prepared
to deal with any eventuality which may occur," Gov. George Pataki said at a news
conference Friday at the state's Y2K emergency command center.
</P>
<P>
	   Two maximum-security prisons remained locked down as they have been all week
- Sing Sing about 30 miles north of New York City and Green Haven about 50 miles
north of the city. Inmates there were being confined to their cells except to
see visitors and receive emergency medical care.
</P>
<P>
	   A strike pamphlet titled "Wake Up" cites the Pataki administration's parole
policies as a major grievance, arguing that some inmates convicted of violent
offenses essentially have no hope of winning parole despite clean prison
records. It's unclear who wrote the pamphlet.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Concerns About Banks Ease  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Y2K uncertainties about money eased as ATMs continued to
work and some banks opened for business today.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not afraid of Y2K," read T-shirts worn by tellers at City National
Bank in Charleston, W.Va., which kept 10 drive-thru windows open all night New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this point everything is 100 percent," said Jeff Legge, the bank's
information systems director as customers were served shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Although most big national banks will be closed today, City National,
scheduled to stay open until noon, is among several small regional banks
planning to unlock their doors, despite the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was just a matter of trying to make our customers feel more
comfortable," said Legge.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Helwig, executive director of the Electronic Funds Transfer
Association, which represents the nation's major ATM networks, said cash
machines also were functioning normally after the midnight rollover. He tried
one in the Virginia suburbs outside Washington himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "My little receipt from the ATM says 12:05 on Jan. 1, 2000. I may have to
frame it," said Helwig, expressing relief that many in the financial services
industry shared.
</P>
<P>
	   Donna Tanoue, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the agency
that insures deposits at the nation's 10,300 banks and savings and loans, made
her withdrawal more publicly, taking $20 out of an ATM machine one block from
the White House early Saturday morning for the benefit of a bank of television
cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   "In this country, we anticipated business as usual for banks and their
customers and I am here to demonstrate that," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said that the FDIC and other federal banking agencies had received no
reports through the night of major problems in the transition.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday night at the Federal Reserve, Chairman Alan Greenspan dropped by the
Y2K command center after dinner at the White House for a briefing and to wish
staff a happy new year. But with all quiet, he left well before midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed spokesman Dave Skidmore said the nation's central bank still has a lot
of follow-up work to do but added: "Given the experience of the day, we look
forward to good results."
</P>
<P>
	   ATM networks and banks reported brisk business Friday but no more than on a
normal long holiday weekend that coincided with a payday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had a good bit of traffic at both our ATMs and our branches, ... but
we were certainly not unprepared or overwhelmed," said Lynn Drury, spokeswoman
for Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America, the nation's second largest bank with
4,800 branches nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed said it has delivered $80 billion in cash to banks since Oct. 1,
after recommending that they stock up in case of increased consumer demand. That
compares with $23 billion requested by banks in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed officials said they will not know until later how much of the padding
was needed.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. financial institutions with systems overseas, including credit card
companies such as American Express and MasterCard, were reporting uninterrupted
operations as the century date change rolled across the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "It bodes well for our country," said American Bankers Association spokesman
John Hall. "Of course, we'll all be looking to the first business day as well."
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has said all the nation's banks, thrifts
and credit unions passed Y2K inspections. Financial institutions have spent an
estimated $9 billion getting ready for the Year 2000 date change.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the Fed is requiring banks to check in regularly into next
week, to report computer problems or unusual customer behavior.

<HEADLINE> Rain Fizzles Tijuana New Year's Eve  </HEADLINE>
   By BEN FOX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- The eve of the Year 2000 may be remembered here as
the night Tijuana failed to live up to its rowdy reputation.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of crowds of boisterous drunks, only a few thousand New Year's
revelers ventured through the rain to party in the border city's six-block
nightclub district along Avenida Revolucion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's dead,'' said Sergio Lopez, 30, a bus mechanic from San Diego, as he
emerged from a nightclub with two friends. ``It's the weather and Y2K, the
scare. People just wanted to stay home.''
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities on both sides of the border were expecting about 60,000 people,
especially young Americans, to celebrate the new century in Tijuana, where the
booze is cheaper, the legal drinking age is 18 and bars stay open until 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   But at midnight, only about 3,000 gathered in the street for the countdown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are actually very glad that a lot of people didn't come out,'' said
Mario Rodriguez, one of the millennium coordinators for Baja California's state
office of civil protection. ``It means less work for us.''
</P>
<P>
	   An expected traffic jam at the border after midnight didn't materialize. At
times, there were lines of only two or three cars and waits of less than 10
minutes, atypical even for a regular weeknight, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   David Rubi, chief of the Tijuana's special police forces, said many
Americans crossed the border earlier in the day, then returned to the United
States well before midnight. He estimated about 20,000 Americans and Mexicans
attended the city's day-long New Year's celebration before rain started falling
in the evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Patricia Harrell, 18, and friend Shyvonn Bester, 19, were among those who
partied in Tijuana before ringing in the new year in San Diego. They spent a few
hours at Excess, a nightclub where women didn't have to pay a cover charge and
could drink for free all night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to lie to you. We're just going to get wasted,'' Harrell
of Kansas City, Kan., said as she crossed into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   Returning early was a safety precaution for Rick Mendez, 20, who was in a
group of sailors from the San Diego Naval Station who started their night in
Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd rather be in America. It's safer,'' said Mendez of Modesto.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Mosley, a Camp Pendleton Marine, went to Club A, a bar on the main
tourist strip where a $10 cover included an unlimited flow of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the millennium,'' said Mosley, 19, of Birmingham, Ala. ``I can't stay
on base for that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tijuana doubled its police force to 1,200 officers for the night, but they
had little to do. Few arrests were made in the tourist zone and most were for
minor offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   There were four reported shootings by 1:30 a.m., including one in which a
police officer was shot in the back. Rodriguez said that's a normal night in his
city of 1.2 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootings were the results of fights rather than celebratory New Year's
Eve gunfire, which caused two deaths in Tijuana last year, Rodriguez said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Residents of Sierra Leone, a nation ruined by
eight years of civil war, spent New Year's Eve huddled in their homes in the
dark, with only the gunshots of a foreign peacekeeping force to mark the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   A 9 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew kept most civilians inside with the doors locked.
Sierra Leone has largely been without power for months, and New Year's Eve was
no exception.
</P>
<P>
	   A five-minute celebratory fusillade broke the silence at midnight, fired by
soldiers of the Nigerian-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   The peacekeepers are enforcing a July truce in the West African country's
disastrous civil war, which left tens of thousands dead and many more mutilated
in attacks that often targeted civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Police forbade the usual holiday parades of men masked as devils.
</P>
<P>
	   President Ahmed Tijan Kabbah went on state-run radio at dawn to tell Sierra
Leone's people that things might get better.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who have inflicted pain and suffering on others, let them repent,''
Kabbah said. ``And those who have suffered, forgive, so that we can have genuine
reconciliation to rebuild our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Freetown resident Mohammed Samura said he hadn't even thought about
celebrating. ``I hardly know whether we have entered a new millennium,'' Samura
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- The Education Ministry has asked a primary school math
publication to remove the letters P and K from an equation because together, the
letters resemble the acronym of the banned Kurdish rebel group, PKK, reports
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ministry asked publishers of the Can Mathematics magazine to use E, G, F
and H in algebra instead to avoid ``wrongful interpretations,'' the daily
Milliyet reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The publishers obeyed and removed the offending P and K from subsequent
publications, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
	   The PKK stands for Kurdistan Workers Party. The group, which is banned in
Turkey, has recently decided to lay down its arms, but its calls for peace have
been ignored by Turkish authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen years of fighting between the PKK and Turkish troops has killed
close to 37,000 people, mostly Kurds.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Millennium Remarks  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Text of President Clinton's remarks at the Lincoln Memorial just before
midnight New Year's Eve, as transcribed by the White House:
</P>
<P>
	   Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we celebrate. The change of centuries, the
dawning of a new millennium are now just minutes away. We celebrate the past. We
have honored America's remarkable achievements, struggles, and triumphs in the
20th century. We celebrate the future, imagining an even more remarkable 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
	   As we marvel at the changes of the last hundred years, we dream of what
changes the next hundred, and the next thousand, will bring. And as powerful as
our memories are, our dreams must be even stronger. For when our memories
outweigh our dreams, we become old; and it is the eternal destiny of America to
remain forever young, always reaching beyond, always becoming, as our founders
pledged, a more perfect union. So we Americans must not fear change. Instead,
let us welcome it, embrace it and create it.
</P>
<P>
	   The great story of the 20th century is the triumph of freedom and free
people, a story told in the drama of new immigrants, the struggles for equal
rights, the victories over totalitarianism, the stunning advances in economic
well-being, in culture, in health, in space and telecommunications, and in
building a world in which more than half the people live under governments of
their own choosing, for the first time in all history. We must never forget the
meaning of the 20th century, or the gifts of those who worked and marched, who
fought and died, for the triumph of freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   So as we ring in this new year, in a new century, in a new millennium, we
must, now and always, echo Dr. King, in the words of the old American hymn,
``Let freedom ring.''
</P>
<P>
	   If the story of the 20th century is the triumph of freedom, what will the
story of the 21st century be? Let it be the triumph of freedom wisely used, to
bring peace to a world in which we honor our differences, and even more, our
common humanity. Such a triumph will require great efforts from us all. It will
require us to stand against the forces of hatred and bigotry, terror and
destruction. It will require us to continue to prosper, to alleviate poverty, to
better balance the demands of work and family and to serve each of us in our
communities.
</P>
<P>
	   It will require us to take better care of our environment. It will require
us to make further breakthroughs in science and technology, to cure dread
diseases, heal broken bodies, lengthen life and unlock secrets from global
warming to the black holes in the universe. And, perhaps most important, it will
require us to share -- with our fellow Americans and, increasingly, with our
fellow citizens of the world -- the economic benefits of globalization; the
political benefits of democracy and human rights; the educational and health
benefits of all things modern, from the Internet to the genetic encyclopedia to
the mysteries beyond our solar system.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, we may not be able to eliminate all hateful intolerance, but we can
develop a healthy intolerance of bigotry, oppression, and abject poverty. We may
not be able to eliminate all the harsh consequences of globalization, but we can
communicate more and travel more and trade more, in a way that lifts the lives
of ordinary working families everywhere and the quality of our global
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   We may not be able to eliminate all the failures of government and
international institutions, but we can certainly strengthen democracy so all
children are prepared for the 21st century world and protected from its harshest
side effects. And we can do so much more to work together, to cooperate among
ourselves, to seize the problems and the opportunities of this ever small planet
we all call home. In short, if we want the story of the 21st century to be the
triumph of peace and harmony, we must embrace our common humanity and our shared
destiny.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, we're just moments from that new millennium. Two centuries ago, as the
framers were crafting our Constitution, Benjamin Franklin was often seen in
Independence Hall looking at a painting of the sun low on the horizon. When, at
long last, the Constitution finally was signed, Mr. Franklin, said: ``I have
often wondered whether that sun was rising or setting. Today I have the
happiness to know it is a rising sun.''
</P>
<P>
	   Well, two centuries later, we know the sun will always rise on America, as
long as each new generation lights the fire of freedom. Our children are ready.
So, again, the torch is passed -- to a new century of young Americans.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leads Nation Into 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the Washington Monument aglow like an exclamation
mark, the 21st century began with chilly revelers toasting champagne in paper
cups and President Clinton urging Americans to bridge divisions that scarred the
millennium just passed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the story of the 20th century is the triumph of freedom, what will the
story of the 21st century be?'' Clinton asked, speaking from the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial, the nation's 16th president in stone peering over his
shoulder. ``Let it be the triumph of freedom, wisely used, to bring peace to a
world in which we honor our differences and even more, our common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a New Year's Day radio address he shared with first lady and New York
Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president expressed gratitude that
the world turned from the 20th to the 21st century in jubilant and wholly
peaceful celebration witnessed by billions across the planet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With America fulfilling our ideals and responsibilities we can make this
new century, a time of unprecedented peace, freedom and prosperity for our
people and all the citizens of the world,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton said the United States finds itself setting the example for
making the world better.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we in America can extend prosperity to people and places in this
country that have not yet felt it, then perhaps the global economy can bring a
better life ... to 1.4 billion people who live on less then $1 a day,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The millennium party in Washington was staged along the National Mall and
reflecting pool that first mirrored the date 1999 and then a giant 2000.
Revelers wore bright-colored sunglasses with zeros for eyes, party hats and
glittery tiaras and sparkles in their hair. Neon green light sticks doubled as
head bands and necklaces.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spoke just moments before midnight. The crowd, anxious for the new
year, listened with only one ear. Instead, children blew bubbles into the air,
toddlers were hoisted to shoulders for a better view, a boy shook a can of silly
string, getting ready to squirt it as the countdown ended.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour show with songs, dances and a film about America's past and
future, competed on television with the traditional Times Square countdown. In
New York the ball of light descended in the seconds before midnight; in
Washington, a white light of fireworks cascaded up the 555-foot Washington
Monument, sparked by a fuse racing along the reflecting pool.
</P>
<P>
	   The year 2000 had arrived. Fireworks exploded in the sky. Confetti and
streamers showered the crowd. Lovers kissed. Three friends -- Debbie Clark of
Washington, Glen Fisher of Fairfax, Va., and Scott Slater of Alexandria, Va. --
clinked paper cups of champagne and toasted health and happiness. Children sang
``America'' along with performers they watched on giant television screens.
</P>
<P>
	   For some, the midnight moment ended a little too abruptly. The fireworks
were brief. A longer, fireworks show came an hour later, after much of the crowd
had left.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a little disappointing,'' Jean Dinkel of Towson, Md., said as she
and her husband left, unaware of the second set of fireworks to come. ``But the
monument was beautiful. And the crowd was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was a night to think about the future, make resolutions and speak of
hopes for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   For Vernice Guthrie, a lawyer in Washington: ``As we walk into the new
century what people will be looking for and what will sustain them is the truth.
People are demanding the truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others had simpler thoughts about 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Tahnee Poafpybitty, 10, of Springfield, Va., one of the children who lighted
a fuse that began the fireworks, said: ``I think it's exciting and they might
have like flying cars and they might have like a faster Ferris wheel.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. John Glenn said his new year's plan was to ``just keep
pluggin'.'' Actor Robert DeNiro was ``just ... happy to be around.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two came to the party from a blacktie dinner at the White House, where
all-night dancing in a huge, heated tent on the south lawn followed the
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton offered three toasts -- to his more than 300 guests, to his wife and
to humanity's ``shared future.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``By far my most solemn prayer for this new millennium is that we will find
somehow the strength and wisdom in our hearts to keep growing together, first as
one America and then as one people on this ever-smaller planet we all call
home,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Havel Urges Debt Relief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- President Vaclav Havel urged developed
countries to pay more attention to charity, suggesting that the world's richer
nations cancel debts to the poorest ones.
</P>
<P>
	   Havel painted a grim picture in his annual New Year's address to the nation,
lamenting that the world was increasingly run by international conglomerates and
threatened by terrorism, drugs and greed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guess it's not right when the world's three wealthiest people own more
than the value of (the gross domestic product) in developing countries with more
than 600 million often-hungry people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In an IMF-brokered deal spearheaded by the United States and Canada last
fall, the world's richest countries agreed to write off $90 billion in Third
World debt on the condition that the money saved would be used for health,
education and poverty relief programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A modest beginning will do: Let us support, for example, all organizations
that help suffering people,'' he said, urging the rich to be ``more generous in
forgiving debt to the poorest countries``.
</P>
<P>
	   Havel, the dissident playwright-turned-president has often played the role
of a moral beacon for his people in their transition from communism to
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, he criticized his fellow Czechs for going too far in embracing
capitalism after throwing off communism in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes I think we have rushed to adopt the worst in global market
economies,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Few Problems As Canada Cheers 2000  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Canadians launched North America's millennium celebration
and carried on the singing, dancing and drinking well into Saturday, welcoming
the year 2000 and the failure of feared Y2K problems to occur.
</P>
<P>
	   A small earthquake in Ontario was the biggest unplanned event, causing no
reported damage or injuries when it shook parts of the provinces' central and
eastern territory for 10 seconds at 6:22 a.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   Government Y2K watchdogs reported only one minor glitch -- a computer
failure at an Ontario ambulance service that handles some communications with
hospitals. Toronto Ambulance spokesman Ric Rangel-Bron said an Internet-linked
backup system prevented any problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, the $1.7 billion spent by the federal government for Y2K
preparedness appeared well spent, according to Guy McKenzie, the government's
Y2K spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No news is good news when it comes to Y2K,'' he told a morning media
briefing in Ottawa. ``We have invested significant time effort and money, our
efforts are now paying off.''
</P>
<P>
	   While many Canadians said before Friday they would stay home because of
possible chaos from Y2K troubles, hundreds of thousands braved chilly winter
weather to celebrate in cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The partying began on Newfoundland, the eastern island that launched North
America's millennium celebration. More than 50,000 revelers gathered at the
waterfront in St. John's, which had a 30-minute head start on the rest of the
continent because of its easternmost location.
</P>
<P>
	   Bundled in overcoats, scarves, hats and gloves to ward off the winter cold,
the crowd cheered and hugged as fireworks lit the sky when midnight struck. A
national television broadcast showed a young couple who said they just decided
to get married.
</P>
<P>
	   Singer Celine Dion performed a farewell show at the Molson Center in
Montreal before taking a two-year break to be with her husband, who is battling
cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   She opened the show with ``My Heart Will Go On,'' her hit from the movie
``Titanic,'' then wished President Clinton and his wife a happy New Year, saying
she knew they were watching the show televised in Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In Ottawa, Prime Minister Jean Chretien spoke proudly of a nation he said
was respected worldwide for its talent and values.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We Canadians are one of the most privileged people of the world, and we
start the year 2000 with all the means at our disposal to build an even brighter
future,'' said Chretien, his breath freezing in the night air at a celebration
outside parliament. ``So let's welcome the year 2000 and a future where
everything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of people crowded the Toronto lakefront for a concert and
huge fireworks display, and celebrations also took place in Winnipeg, Edmonton,
Calgary and other cities.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18,000 military troops and 15,000 Royal Canadian Mounted police officers
on standby for possible emergencies or Y2K-related problems had little to do,
though government officials warned the Y2K-watch would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   In Grise Fjord in the new territory of Nunavut, Inuit hunter Meeka Kiguktak
spent New Year's Eve as she does every year -- hunting seal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just another of those yearly things we do,'' said Kiguktak, who won
the Last Seal of the Millennium contest held by her tiny Arctic community.
``It's what we do every year and I wasn't even thinking of the millennium.''

<HEADLINE> Bullet Shells Bell Rings in Tirana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania (AP)-- A bell made of bullet casings collected by children
from a northern Albanian town rang for the first time Saturday, offering a
message of hope and peace for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   The project to create the 1,100-pound bell was started by Father Don Antonio
Scara, a priest serving at a small church in Lezha, 35 miles north of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
	   The city was one of thousands across Albania where angry protesters, who
lost their life savings in collapsed pyramid schemes, looted army depots of
weapons in 1997. Some 2,000 people died in the chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   Scara called on children to collect brass bullet casings lying around and
``clean the earth,'' trading them books and pens for all the ones they could
find. When the shells arrived in tens of thousands, he persuaded an Italian
foundry to melt them into a ``peace bell.'' About 30,000 bullet casings were
collected in all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was born of bullets, and will sing in the road of peace of the Albanian
children in the third millennium,'' the bell's inscription said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scara's initiative was supported by the presidents of Albania and Italy and
several Italian groups.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, the ``peace bell'' was blessed by Pope John Paul II in the
Vatican. The bell traveled for two months through Italy, Kosovo and Albania
before ringing in Tirana on Saturday.

behind Putin's expressionless face, the man and his plans for the crisis-ridden
nation remain an enigma.
</P>
<P>
	   As prime minister, Putin's resolve and vigor swiftly earned him the
adoration of millions of Russians. Now that Boris Yeltsin has resigned and named
Putin acting president pending new elections, the ex-KGB agent's popularity
appears likely to translate into an easy win at the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the West dwell warily on Putin's spy background and his gospel of
restoring Russia's global clout, painting him as a warmonger for his stance on
Chechnya. He talks of ``crushing the vermin'' in the breakaway republic and
spent his first day as acting president Saturday visiting Russian troops in
Chechnya to show his support for the war, which has strong popular backing.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet many analysts see Putin as a pragmatist and skillful political player
ready to feed nationalist sentiment at home and willing to work with the West
when occasion calls, especially if Russia's cupboards are bare.
</P>
<P>
	   Above all, Putin appeals to Russians tired of years of inept leadership and
rampant corruption. They want a leader who will restore order and build a
government that cares about their problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a person who can lead and manage. The people don't care about his
economic qualifications, they want a father-czar with a strong hand,'' said
Alexei Chaplygin, a political analyst with the Center for Civil Society Studies
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's speaking style is choppy, and his posture is unbending. But that
seems to add to his popular appeal, bolstering his image as a man of action.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin talks little of his personal life. He has a wife, two teen-age
daughters and a poodle.
</P>
<P>
	   Russians also welcome a leader who's not Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
	   The 68-year-old Yeltsin was sick for huge chunks of his tenure, and left
behind a Russia mired in poverty and disillusioned about reforms and the future.
Russians grew weary of Yeltsin's caprice, particularly his penchant for firing
governments every few months, and his circle was tainted by corruption
allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rare admission of fallibility, Yeltsin apologized to Russians in his
resignation speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to beg forgiveness for your dreams that never came true,'' he said
Friday. ``I beg your forgiveness for having failed to jump in one leap from the
gray, stagnant, totalitarian past to the light, rich and civilized future.''
</P>
<P>
	   In comparison, the 47-year-old Putin represents a new generation, and he
appears decisive, clear-eyed and unmarred by scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's level-headedness appeals to voters exhausted by extremist rhetoric,
and his calls for security soothe Russians' fears of mounting crime. Popular
support for the war in Chechnya reflects people's fear of the kidnapping and
other violence that have ruled the region since the 1994-96 Chechnya war.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin says he will defend democracy in Russia and market reforms should
continue, though cautiously and with more attention to social welfare. He has
stressed land privatization and revising the arcane tax system, but he's been
short on specifics.
</P>
<P>
	   In dealing with the West, Putin has adopted a tough stance against
international interference in Chechnya, and Russians see him as reasserting
their role on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Concerning national strategy ... we all want one thing: for Russia to
become a great power,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   But on topics such as the START-II nuclear arms reduction treaty and foreign
investment, he has shown a willingness for compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes he has to strike a hawkish pose for domestic political
reasons,'' said Yevgeny Volk, head of the Moscow office of the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative U.S. think tank. ``He'll pursue relations with the
East and West, to the degree that is politically reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Always neat and rarely smiling, Putin worked for 15 years in the KGB,
including stints in Germany during the Cold War. He later became director of the
Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the KGB.
</P>
<P>
	   While some in the West worry about Putin's years in one of history's most
ruthless police organizations, his KGB background has caused little comment at
home. Most prominent Russian politicians held roles in the Soviet government and
Yeltsin was a member of the Politburo, which ran the USSR.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's state-controlled media has helped lionize Putin, showing him doing
everything from a victory lap around a village wrested from Chechen rebels to a
judo demonstration at which the black-belt leader flipped a series of
challengers onto their backs.
</P>
<P>
	   He can now call on the huge resources of the state to back his presidential
bid while other candidates will have to scramble to find funds and backers for
the early campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   But after just a few months in the limelight, some say Putin is little more
than a paper figure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's too early to talk of Putin as a policy-maker. His popularity is
artificial, based on propaganda on Kremlin-run television,'' Chaplygin said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Clash Leaves 14 Dead  </HEADLINE>
   By SLOBODAN LEKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Dozens of houses and a mosque were set ablaze
Saturday as Christians and Muslims clashed in Indonesia's Spice Islands, leaving
14 people dead and three others missing, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The clash occurred in Masohi, a small town on the island of Seram, said
Malik Selang, an administrator at Al Fatah Hospital in Ambon, capital of Maluku
province. Nine Muslims were killed, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Christian clergyman in Ambon, 1,500 miles east of Jakarta, said five
Christians were also slain in the clash and three were missing. He declined to
be identified for fear of reprisals.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men said that most of the casualties were caused by security forces
firing into battling mobs. Military officials were not available for comment,
and the claims could not be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of at least 1,200 people have died in the region -- known as the
Spice Islands during Dutch rule -- since sectarian clashes first erupted a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Indonesia has been plagued by violence in recent months as several
provinces seek independence, this week's carnage was the worst of any religious
conflict in the republic's 50-year history. About 350 people have been killed in
the past week.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday, the army dispatched more reinforcements to end the fighting. About
500 troops landed on Morotai island in North Maluku province, local commander
Lt. Col. Slamet Riyadi said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, news reports Saturday said Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid
agreed that his country's easternmost province should change its name from Irian
Jaya back to its traditional name of Papua, but he ruled out the possibility of
independence for the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking Friday in Jayapura, the province's capital, Wahid also apologized
for human rights violations committed against civilians by Indonesian forces in
their battle against a pro-independence insurgency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As for an independent Papua state ... I will not tolerate efforts to build
a country within a country,'' Wahid told community leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels of the Free Papua Movement maintain that the region has been
independent since 1961, when its Dutch rulers agreed to allow
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesian forces occupied the region in 1963, and Indonesian rule was
approved by a hastily convened assembly of village chiefs that pro-independence
activists dismiss as a sham.
</P>
<P>
	   The region of Papua -- known simply as Irian in Indonesia -- was renamed
Irian Jaya, meaning Glorious Irian, by former dictator Suharto in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   While Wahid expressed support for allowing the province to revert to its old
name of Papua, such a change would require the approval of the Indonesian
legislature.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Faces Economic Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Despite billions of dollars in foreign
aid since the end of the Bosnian war, experts fear the collapse of the nation's
economy as that money is cut in half by the end of the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 1995 Dayton agreement ended Europe's bloodiest conflict since
World War II, the United States and other major powers agreed to provide $5.1
billion over four years to rebuild the country and set Bosnia-Herzegovina on its
way to a sustainable market economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The last installment of $1.05 billion was approved in May at a donors'
conference in Brussels. Bilateral aid programs will continue, but Bosnian and
international officials expect total foreign assistance to be cut to half the
current levels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Economic collapse is possible,'' Neven Tomic, a vice chairman of the
Bosnian council of ministers, told The Associated Press. ``The donor supply is
going down, and we didn't solve all of the political problems. There is still no
framework for (foreign) investment.''
</P>
<P>
	   The $5.1 billion package was supposed to jump start the economy and
encourage foreign investment, which the World Bank and others see as the key to
Bosnia's long-term economic future.
</P>
<P>
	   Rampant corruption and communist-style bureaucracies, however, have
discouraged foreign investment. Most economists agree that there is not enough
capital inside the country to revive the economy without substantial foreign
funds. What money there is here is believed to be controlled by politically
connected criminal syndicates that emerged during the 1992-1995 war.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the office of Bosnia's top international overseer, Wolfgang
Petritsch, of roughly $2 billion that flowed into the country between 1996 and
1998, only 2.3 percent of that was private funds, invested in the manufacturing
sector.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, unemployment in the Muslim and Croat part of the country stands
at about 70 percent, according to the government's statistics office.
Unemployment in the Serb-ruled area is believed to be even higher although
current figures are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
	   The bureaucracy was inherited from the old Yugoslav model. Entrepreneurs
must submit reams of paperwork, acquire official stamps and wait in line at
various offices to obtain necessary approvals.
</P>
<P>
	   Bosnians have friends within the bureaucracy to help them move through it
with comparative ease. For foreign investors, the system has spawned a
subculture of well-connected fixers, who find shortcuts through the bureaucratic
web -- for a fee.
</P>
<P>
	   An American businessman who spoke on condition of anonymity, however, said
it took him nearly four months simply to register his private company.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has recently announced a campaign to fight
corruption and organized crime in Bosnia's police forces and judiciary. But the
nature of Bosnia's ethnically based political system, codified in the Dayton
agreement, complicates those efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayton allowed the Bosnian Serbs to run their own autonomous region, which
comprises nearly half the territory. Bosnian Serbs have resisted demands by
international overseers to allow a multiethnic police force to patrol its
borders with Croatia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, border guards are vulnerable to bribery by smuggling gangs of
similar ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
	   James Lyon, a former American businessman who now heads an independent think
tank here, estimates that the Bosnian Serb region alone loses over $8 million a
month because smugglers evade customs fees.
</P>
<P>
	   Lost fees as well as widespread tax evasion means there is not enough money
to pay pensions, unemployment insurance and salaries, encouraging officials to
seek bribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Bosnians and international officials fear corruption will continue as
long as the ethnically based political parties, which took Bosnia into the
1992-1995 war, still run the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government names the directors of the big (state-run) companies,''
said Cedo Volas, who heads the main trade union in the Serb republic.
``Consequently, most directors are heads of political parties.''
</P>
<P>
	   Volas said the unions are ``on the verge of a general strike'' to demand
higher wages, public accountability in the running of state companies and the
establishment of a government-run pension fund for workers.
</P>
<P>
	   But Milorad Dodik, the Western-backed president of the Bosnian Serb
republic, denies any problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can exist with lower international donations,'' Dodik said. He insisted
that a new social program planned for 2000 would create new jobs through
construction projects -- including a $21 million government complex his
administration is building in the Bosnian Serb capital, Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
	   Dodik had no figures on how many jobs would be created. And the Office of
the High Representative, the international body which oversees government
operations, doubts such public works projects can replace a healthy private
economy.

<HEADLINE> China Rounds Up Dissidents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police rounded up five dissidents trying to hold a
prayer meeting for the new millennium Saturday, knocking a Protestant doctor who
organized the gathering to the ground and splitting open his head, dissidents
and family members said.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor, Xu Yonghai, had wanted to convene the prayer meeting at his
home. China's communist government bans all public dissent and forbids worship
outside state-sanctioned churches.
</P>
<P>
	   Uniformed and plainclothes police were waiting for Xu as he got off the
overnight shift at his Beijing hospital and detained the others, most of them
Christians, as they showed up at the his house, said He Depu, an outspoken
dissident who was among those detained.
</P>
<P>
	   Police struggled with Xu outside the hospital, pushing him to the ground and
splitting his head open, said He Depu, adding that he later saw the doctor being
dragged along the floor at a local police station.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was being dragged back and forth,'' said He Depu. ``We were really
angry. Such mistreatment on the first day of the new century. It was a complete
trampling on human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   Xu is a democracy campaigner and has long been active in the underground
Protestant church.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past year, the government has cracked down on dissidents and
underground churches and sects, hoping to eliminate rallying points for workers
and farmers angry over unemployment and corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   He Depu and the three others -- Liu Fenggang, Sha Yuguang and Hou Jie --
were released after three or four hours in police custody. But as of late
Saturday, Xu had not been set free, his family said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another figure in Beijing's persecuted dissident community, He Xintong, the
wife of jailed veteran campaigner Xu Wenli, said she barely escaped being
detained Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   He Xintong said she had planned to attend the doctor's gathering but spied
police waiting outside his home and quickly turned into a nearby store, evading
detection.
</P>
<P>
	   Xu Wenli, a seminal figure in the democracy movement and a key organizer of
the China Democracy Party, was sentenced to 13 years in December 1998 and at
least 17 other party members have been jailed -- all for subversion.
</P>
<P>
	   The crackdown silenced the China Democracy Party for months until He Depu
released a bold declaration just before the new year. He demanded the Communist
Party end its political monopoly and begin democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   He Depu, who has been in and out of detention over the past few years, said
police didn't even bother to discuss the manifesto. ``They know I'm
unreformable,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Zapatistas Mark Uprising  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEJANDRO RUIZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LA REALIDAD, Mexico (AP) -- Hundreds of Zapatista supporters on Saturday
marked the sixth anniversary of the leftist rebel's uprising by pledging to
continue their battle for Indian rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will struggle, we will defend, we will resist, we will fight, and we
will die for a Mexico with liberty, democracy and justice,'' said a Tzotzil
Indian woman who identified herself only as Claudia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Zapatistas emerged Jan. 1, 1994, stunning the country by capturing
several towns in the southern state of Chiapas on the same day that Mexico
formed a trade bloc with the United States and Canada under the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The army retook control of all areas days later and the government declared
a cease-fire. Peace talks broke down in 1996. Fighting between the two sides has
been rare, but tensions remain high.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are commemorating our just and necessary war to liberate millions of
human beings who have been forgotten and humiliated by the bad government,''
said Claudia, who wore the Zapatistas' trademark ski mask.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebel supporters marked the uprising anniversary with speeches, music and
dances in La Realidad, a village about 95 miles west of San Cristobal de las
Casas, the center of Zapatista support. Top Zapatista leaders did not attend.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of soldiers patrolled nearby and helicopters flew overhead, but no
violence was reported.

<HEADLINE> Cezanne Painting Stolen From Museum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England (AP) -- Art thieves broke into an Oxford museum and made off
with a painting by the French artist Paul Cezanne early Saturday, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The thieves broke through the glass roof of Oxford University's Ashmolean
Museum, housing one of Britain's finest art collections, and grabbed the
painting valued at about $4.8 million, before escaping unnoticed, the museum's
director Roger Hobby told the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the theft probably happened around 1:30 a.m. while the streets of
Oxford were crowded with noisy millennium revelers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whoever has taken this painting has given it some thought,'' John Carr,
superintendent of the Oxford Police, said at a news conference. ``The person has
some reason for it and some outlet for it. One possibility is that it has been
stolen to order.''
</P>
<P>
	   The oil painting, ``Auvers-Sur-Oise,'' was painted between 1879 and 1882. It
measures 18 by 22 inches and depicts a cluster of small white cottages in a
tree-filled valley under a pink-gray sky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not just a criminal act but it is a very selfish act,'' said
Christopher Brown, the museum director. ``This is a great public museum, visited
by 250,000 people a year from all over the world. Those people are being denied
access to this great painting by this selfish criminal act.''
</P>
<P>
	   The museum, in a 17th century building, houses paintings by artists such as
Leonardo da Vinci and Pablo Picasso. The stolen work was the only Cezanne in its
collection.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite 24-hour security, the gallery has attracted art thieves in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, two 17th century bottles were stolen. But the following year, the
attempted theft of a 1,100-year-old jewel made for Alfred the Great was blocked
when the three-person gang triggered an alarm as they tried to break through the
jewel's glass encasing.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown said all security arrangements were now being reviewed.

<HEADLINE> Germany Welcomes New Citizens  </HEADLINE>
   By COLLEEN BARRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Three German officials came bearing gifts for a newborn
chosen as the symbol of a new law granting automatic citizenship to children of
foreign parents born here.
</P>
<P>
	   As with another historic visit by three men 2000 years earlier, the gifts
were largely symbolic. The still-unnamed infant, born to Turkish parents three
hours into the new millennium, received a teddy bear, a pacifier and a copy of
the German constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   To parents Mesut and Saliha Kurt, the real gift was the right to claim
German citizenship under the law that took effect at midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's super,'' said Mesut Kurt, 21, who was born in Berlin. ``I
know how hard it is to live as a foreigner in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cradled by her 20-year-old mother, the black-haired baby girl stared
wide-eyed at the cameras as a prominent ethnic Turkish lawmaker, Germany's
federal commissioner for foreigners and her Berlin counterpart welcomed the
newborn.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials expressed hope that children born under the new law would more
easily integrate into society.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These babies born today won't experience what I experienced,'' said Cem
Ozdemir, the first ethnic Turk elected to parliament and a key proponent of the
liberalized law. ``They won't grow up as foreigners. They will grow up as
citizens and it will change the future of this country.''
</P>
<P>
	   The law also makes it easier for foreigners to become citizens by reducing
the required residency from 15 to eight years. But Ozdemir said it excludes the
first generation of Germany's 7.2 million Turks, who arrived as guest workers in
the 1960s, by making the language requirement stricter and closing a loophole
allowing dual citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   But unlike her father, Baby Kurt won't have to apply to become a German. She
will, however, have to choose at age 23 whether she retains her German or her
Turkish passport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're a colorful land with many cultures,'' said Marieluise Beck,
Germany's federal commissioner for foreigners. ``That's why it's nice that these
children have the possibility immediately to belong.''

<HEADLINE> Farm Policy Overhaul on Agenda  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new year is expected to bring a battle in Congress
over government farm policy as lawmakers seek to deal with a third straight year
of depressed commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's enough desire on the part of my farm-state colleagues to
make changes," said Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, a Missouri Republican who serves on a
key farm spending subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   She applauded House Agriculture Committee Chairman Larry Combest, R-Texas,
for scheduling hearings on farm policy from February through March in Washington
and seven to 12 regions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Shrinking export markets have sent prices for wheat, corn, soybeans and
other crops plummeting, and the Agriculture Department forecast for 2000 is
bleak, too. Farm income is predicted to drop $7.6 billion next year to $40.4
billion, unless Congress takes the unlikely step -- because it is an election
year -- of another multibillion-dollar bailout.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at the third year in a row of a disastrous ag situation,"
Combest said in an interview. "We've got to look at this. Something is not
working."
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman agreed, saying Congress has lurched from
one patchwork emergency bill to the next. His comments came in October on the
heels of an $8.7 billion emergency aid package.
</P>
<P>
	   "And we shouldn't wait until the expiration of the Farm Bill in 2002,"
Glickman said. "The fact is, with two years of emergency payments to farmers,
Congress has already seriously amended the farm bill."
</P>
<P>
	   "What is needed now is a thought-out, well-balanced farm bill that we can
work on if we address it early in the year -- before we are looking again at
emergency farm legislation," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trouble is, there's not much consensus in Congress or among the major farm
interest groups on what should be done.
</P>
<P>
	   Combest's Senate counterpart, GOP Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, has no
plans for hearings because he believes there is no need to change farm policy.
Several farm-state Democrats, meanwhile, will be pushing to boost U.S. farm
subsidies as a tool in trade negotiations with the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts said change in farm policy, even before the current
law expires in 2002, is inevitable. Citing statements by Glickman and by
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, Roberts said the question is not
whether the so-called Freedom to Farm legislation will be rewritten, but when
and how.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts, who as House Agriculture Committee chairman was chief author of the
1996 reforms, argues it is disingenuous to blame the farm bill for a failing
safety net when its component parts -- a crop insurance overhaul, aggressive
trade policies and regulatory and tax reforms -- were never put in place.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only the Clinton administration but GOP leaders in Congress have failed,
he said. Next year, Roberts plans to introduce his own package that incorporates
those elements as an alternative to rewriting farm policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like Freedom to Farm was the horse you wanted to ride in the Derby,
but you hobbled him first -- there's no jockey, no saddle and all the rest,"
Roberts said. "We said these component parts had to be part of the policy or
this wouldn't work."
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts has been reluctant to step forward until now, he said, because he
wanted to be part of the Senate GOP team after serving as the farm panel's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I don't see a team effort, and I'm tired of it," Roberts said. "People
are going to see exactly where I stand."
</P>
<P>
	   Many regard trade issues as having the best potential to shore up struggling
farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican who attended the World Trade
Organization talks in Seattle, emerged as a leader on legislation to stop the
president from imposing sanctions on U.S. food and medicine, a measure that
stalled amid House controversy over trading with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was disappointed in the collapse of trade talks in Seattle," Ashcroft
said, referring to the WTO's failure to agree on a new round of negotiations. "I
feel like the administration didn't do everything it could, but I would commend
them for not taking a bad deal. It's better to get no deal than a bad deal."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the Clinton administration's top priorities in a new round of global
trade talks is to get the European Union to lower its farm subsidies. EU farm
supports are worth $324 per acre, compared with $34 for the United States,
according to the Agriculture Department. Canada and Australia have even lower
supports.
</P>
<P>
	   Combest has said the House Agriculture Committee also will consider
proposals for bolstering U.S. export programs to counter European crop
subsidies.

<HEADLINE> Four Lebanese Soldiers Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Lebanon (AP) -- A militant Muslim group ambushed an army patrol in
northern Lebanon, killing four soldiers and kidnapping two others, the Lebanese
army said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident occurred Friday night in Dinniyah when ``a group of extremists
ambushed (the army) patrol on a routine inspection in a remote area by opening
fire on its vehicles, killing four soldiers and wounding three,'' a statement by
the army's Directorate of Orientation said.
</P>
<P>
	   A lieutenant colonel and a soldier were kidnapped after the officer reported
the incident to his command and asked for reinforcement, the army said.
</P>
<P>
	   The army ``has apprehended several unruly individuals and a large quantity
of guns'' and continues to patrol the area, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dinniyah is a sparsely populated mountainous area 45 miles east of the
northern city of Tripoli, known to be a haven for a group of Sunni Muslim
militant fundamentalists known as the Jamaa Al-Islamiya.
</P>
<P>
	   Security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Lebanese troops
raided a two-story building that used to house the Jamaa's radio station in
search of the kidnapped men.

<HEADLINE> Alarming rise in debt total written off as sound bookkeeping  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The audit books give critics the simple number they
need to attack Gov. Christie Whitman for plunging the state's taxpayers into
record debt.
<P>
	   The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the 1998-1999 fiscal year,
completed last week, shows state government's "general long-term debt" to be
$14.6 billion, squeezing the Legislature into a $465 million debt payment this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, covering the fiscal year Whitman took office, the Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report showed the "general long-term debt" to be $7.2 billion.
That means the state's debt has grown 103 percent between 1994 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   It is an outrage, say the governor's critics.
</P>
<P>
	   It is dangerous, said Assemblyman Joseph Roberts, D-Camden. "This governor
will go down in history for her unprecedented and reckless reliance on debt to
balance the state's budget and to fund our obligations," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is honest bookkeeping, said Treasurer Roland Machold.
</P>
<P>
	   Machold said those who compare the annual financial reports of 1999 and 1994
are missing a crucial part of the picture, or are deliberately comparing apples
and oranges to make a political point.
</P>
<P>
	   He said some $3 billion in debt owed and paid by the state in 1994 was not
listed as "general long-term debt" for the annual financial report when Whitman
took office, but it is now.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to address the fact that Christie Whitman has raised the debt
astronomically," Machold said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you look at the (financial report) numbers, the debt has gone up rather
sharply," he said. "But if you look at the history going back, including those
for other administrations, her debt, the total debt, has gone up 6 percent,"
well within the growth rate of state revenue and of private earnings statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual debt totals, when tallied, show a growth rate that appears closer
to 9 percent than to Machold's 6 percent. Nevertheless, it is hardly staggering.
</P>
<P>
	   Machold said there are two parts to his explanation:
</P>
<P>
	   -Debts of major state authorities such as the Transportation Trust Fund and
the authority that runs the Meadowlands sports complex were all "off the budget"
and were never covered as general debt for the annual financial report. "We
certainly paid them, but they were not recognized," Machold said.
</P>
<P>
	   -Money owed to the pension fund every year to pay off a section of a large
shortfall was not counted as a debt even though it had to be paid every year.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, this shortfall was closed in part with the $2.8 billion pension
bond deal. The new, 32-year bond debt appeared as a new "general debt"
component, while the money owed to the pension fund had never been shown in this
manner. But in reality, Machold said, the pension bond deal merely replaced one
debt with another. "We are matching one liability with another, dollar for
dollar," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   So with all of the debts that were not recognized in the 1994 financial
report now being recognized, Whitman has increased reliable bookkeeping more
than anything else.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of Governor Whitman's goals was to get everything up front and get it
on the balance sheet, including the pension debt through the pension
refinancing," Machold said. "It is better accounting. We pay for it, and I think
it is just a more honest way of doing it."
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts, the budget officer for the Assembly Democrats when Whitman took
office and when she sold all of those pension bonds, said he was buying none of
it.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state's outstanding debt has tripled in the term she has been in
office," Roberts claimed. "The notion that the state's reliance on debt has not
changed appreciably in this administration, and the only change is a bookkeeping
revision, is ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts noted that in the New Jersey system, the treasurer's office has
unilateral power to measure debts, forecast revenues and stipulate necessary
obligations to be paid. "There is no mechanism for independent examination," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, Roberts said the heavy debt loading has diminished the state's
ability to borrow money for buildings and roads, "the stuff you are supposed to
go into debt for."
</P>
<P>
	   "She has wasted our bonding capacity," Roberts said. He said this may not
matter in a good economy when state-issued bonds are a popular seller on the
securities market, but it could leave the state in a terrible freeze if and when
the economy tightens up.

<HEADLINE> Hijackers Vanish Into Afghan Desert  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) -- The five hijackers of an Indian Airlines plane
vanished into the desert of southern Afghanistan and by this morning had crossed
the border into a neighboring country, according to a Taliban official.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers presumably went to Pakistan, the nearest country and the only
one they could easily reach within the 10 hours they were given to get out of
Afghanistan under a deal struck Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said today that the five hijackers
were Pakistanis -- though he gave no information about how Indian officials
learned the nationalities of the hijackers, who wore masks.
</P>
<P>
	   The tense eight-day standoff ended with the deal Friday in the southern
Afghan city of Kandahar. All 155 hostages were freed and were flown to New
Delhi, India.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers sped out of the airport in several vehicles, taking three
Muslim militants freed from Indian jails and one hostage -- a soldier from
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Taliban hostage has come back to Kandahar and (the hijackers) have
gone from the country,'' Taliban spokesman Rehnatullah Aga said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Aga declined to say where the hijackers went, but the only realistic
possibility was that the group drove for several hours to the border with
Pakistan, where there are countless places to cross the frontier on foot.
</P>
<P>
	   Singh said an Afghan official had revealed that the hijackers headed for
southwestern Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have with me a statement of the Taliban information minister that all
five hijackers, along with the terrorists, have left for Quetta, Pakistan,''
Singh said. However, the name he gave was not the information minister, but a
lower level spokesman for the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban officials have said that the agreement to free
the hostages involved not revealing where the hijackers had gone. Taliban
officials insisted today that they were sticking to the agreement after Singh
made his comments at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm sure we will hear something in a few days,'' said Erick de Mul, the
U.N. representative to Afghanistan. ``I'm sure they will be spotted somewhere.
They can't just evaporate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban initially had been reluctant to get involved in negotiations
with the hijackers, and when the crisis ended Friday, the movement hurried the
men out of Afghan territory, sending an armed group of soldiers with the
hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan strongly denounced the hijacking, but it has little control over
its western border, which may have been used as an escape route.
</P>
<P>
	   Taliban authorities said they did not know the names or nationalities of the
hijackers, though they acted in support of Kashmir militants who are fighting to
end Indian rule of the Himalayan territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking demonstrated the volatile nature of the long-running dispute
over Kashmir, the leading source of friction between India and Pakistan. Both
nations hold part of Kashmir and claim all of it.
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan traded recriminations during the latest hijacking crisis,
placing further strain on already bad relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Singh said today that the hijackers had wired the plane to explode and may
have kept rifles, pistols and grenades in the cargo hold ``from the beginning.''
He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Another pilot who flew the hijacked plane back to India said on television
that departure was delayed ``because there were explosives on board.'' But the
hijacked plane's captain, Devi Sharan, told The Associated Press he did not know
about any explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane on which the hostages were held left the airport at Kandahar this
morning and headed back to India after authorities had completed repairs and
checked for any potential problems.

<HEADLINE> Hostages Recovering From Hijacking  </HEADLINE>
   By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- As freed hostages recovered from their eight-day
hijacking nightmare, India's foreign minister said today that their captors had
wired their jet to explode and possibly kept extra weapons in the cargo hold.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a joyful and relieved welcome for the 155 passengers and crew from
the hijacked Indian Airlines jet, some predicted today that India would pay a
heavy price for swapping the release of three Muslim militants for their
freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   After receiving the three militants Friday, the hijackers fled the airport
in Kandahar, Afghanistan, where they had been holding the plane, and disappeared
into the desert. Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia said today they had left
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said the five hijackers were Pakistanis. The
identity of the hijackers -- who wore masks -- has not been clear, and Singh did
not specify how he knew they were Pakistani.
</P>
<P>
	   Singh also said the five hijackers had crossed into southwestern Pakistan to
the town of Quetta, citing information he said he received from a Taliban
official. The Taliban have not announced publicly which country the hijackers
fled to. There was no immediate reaction to the allegations from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Freed crew members said the plane had been wired with enough explosives to
blow it up, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
	   A pilot who flew the hijacked plane back to India said on television that
departure was delayed ``because there were explosives on board.'' But the
hijacked plane's captain, Devi Sharan, told The Associated Press today he did
not know about any explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers may have also had AK47 automatic rifles, pistols and grenades
hidden in the cargo hold ``from the beginning,'' he said. On Dec. 26, two days
into the seizure, the hijackers got access to the cargo and suddenly appeared
with more sophisticated weapons, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
	   With joy and tears, the freed hostages were welcomed back Friday evening by
a huge crowd of relatives, friends and well-wishers at New Delhi's international
airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was very suffocating inside. I feel great to be able to look at the sun
again,'' said Himanshu Sharma, 12, who was held hostage with his parents and
9-year-old brother.
</P>
<P>
	   The only American hostage, Jeanne Moore of Bakersfield, Calif., was in good
health, said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Elizabeth Corwin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were scared a lot -- we never knew what was going to happen to us,''
Moore, a special education teacher, was quoted as saying in today's Los Angeles
Times. ``It was a very interesting study in people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moore's son, Jim, a Bakersfield police officer, left for India on Friday
upon news of his mother's release.
</P>
<P>
	   Kanwar Thukral, who had a childhood friend on board the flight, said he had
mixed feelings about the Indian government's decision to swap the militants for
the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think releasing these prisoners will give a boost to the militant
movement. It will be a crutch for the militants. They know now they can always
hold the government hostage,'' Thukral said. ``I guess the government had only
one option. But I still wish the militants had not been released.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a New Year's Eve message to the nation, Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee said the deal was in the nation's long-term interest. ``India shall not
spare any effort to thwart the phenomenon of terrorism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of Kashmir is a focus of nationalist feeling in India. The
territory has been divided between India and Pakistan since independence in
1947. India has been battling Muslim insurgents in the part under its control,
who demand either independence or union with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Masood Azhar, a leader of Harkat ul-Ansar, a group on a U.S. list of
terrorist organizations, was the best known of the three men released. In
addition, the Indians freed Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, chief commander of the rebel
group Ul-Umar Mujahideen, and Ahmad Omar Sayed Sheikh, who was held in a New
Delhi prison.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first three days of the hijacking, the passengers said, they were
given half of an orange for breakfast and lunch. Later, they were given hard
bread.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indian Airlines plane was headed to New Delhi from Katmandu, Nepal, when
the hijackers took control on Dec. 24, carrying pistols, grenades and knives.
One Indian passenger was killed shortly after the plane was seized.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane hopped from Amritsar, India, to Lahore, Pakistan, to Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates before finally landing in Kandahar on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
	   When it originally took off from Katmandu, the plane was carrying 178
passengers and 11 crew members. The passengers included 150 Indians, eight
Nepalese, one Canadian, one American, four Swiss, four Spaniards, one Belgian,
one Japanese, one Australian, two French citizens and one Italian. Four
passengers were not listed by nationality.
</P>
<P>
	   Captors freed 27 hostages and unloaded Katyal's body during the stopover in
the Emirates, and another passenger had been released for medical reasons.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton congratulated Vladimir Putin, Russia's
new acting president, on his selection to succeed Boris Yeltsin and assured him
``we are always together on the core points,'' the White House spokesman said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 10-minute New Year's morning telephone call, the president told Putin
he believes the acting Russian president is ``off to a good start'' and that the
move is ``encouraging for democracy in Russia,'' presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said that issues of concern remain on the table between the two
nations, especially over the Russian military thrust into Chechnya. He said the
two leaders have had just two brief meetings in the past. He described those
sessions as good but said he could not draw conclusions about their relationship
because the encounters have not been lengthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said the president wished Putin a happy millennium and ``much
happiness and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Clinton was not
discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin, who became Russia's first democratically elected leader after the
fall of communism, resigned unexpectedly New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin, 68, has been chronically ill in recent years. His successor is 47.

<HEADLINE> An Unclean Slate as Century Begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Generations down the road, the hunt goes on for Nazi
treasure. America's treatment of citizens of Italian descent in World War II is
coming under new scrutiny. The Rwandan genocide, a more recent horror, eats at
the world's conscience.
</P>
<P>
	   The new century has some unfinished business with the old one. Atonement for
sins of the past -- often the distant past -- is far from complete.
</P>
<P>
	   In just one example, a U.S. commission searching for Nazi assets in the
United States has been given until the end of 2000, an extra year, to complete
its work and propose ways to ``do justice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, President Clinton says the world starts ``a new millennium on
higher ground'' now that a deal has been reached to pay forced and enslaved
laborers of the Third Reich -- one of the final broad categories of claims to be
resolved from the war against Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   If this is higher ground, it affords a panoramic view of all that is left
undone.
</P>
<P>
	   There's been an expression of ``deep remorse'' from U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, but no official U.N. apology, for not acting to stop the slaughter
of 800,000 in Rwanda in 1994. Also, an acknowledgment by Japan, but no
compensation or apology, for the women coerced into prostitution for the
Imperial Army in Asian brothels.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1 million Korean War documents are being reviewed in government
investigations launched on the strength of reports by The Associated Press that
American soldiers killed hundreds of South Korean citizens at the hamlet of No
Gun Ri during the war.
</P>
<P>
	   The process of redressing old wrongs has proceeded under different names,
none quite right.
</P>
<P>
	   In modern psycho-parlance, the idea is to achieve ``closure.'' In postwar
West Germany, the term was ``wiedergutmachung'' -- making good again -- as one
of the first forms of compensation to Nazi victims was called.
</P>
<P>
	   Holocaust survivors rejected the label, reasoning that what Jews went
through can't be made good.
</P>
<P>
	   As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright put it: ``We strive then not for
perfect justice which is beyond our power, but rather for the best possible
justice which is within our power to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes, atonement consists largely of facing up to what went on in the
past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless we look the beast in the eye, we find that it has an uncanny habit
of returning and holding us hostage,'' says Archbishop Desmond Tutu, head of
South Africa's pioneering truth and reconciliation commission, which expects to
deal with final amnesty requests by June.
</P>
<P>
	   These days the atoners are often diplomats and accountants -- the people
negotiating the deals and tallying up claims and assets, such as the 10,817,021
ounces of Nazi monetary gold recovered by a reparations commission before its
dissolution in 1998 after 52 years of work.
</P>
<P>
	   The timepiece they are watching is not the clock that ticked toward the new
century, but the calendar marking the march of years and the passing of the
aggrieved generations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It truly is a race against time,'' said Delissa Ridgway, chief of the
Justice Department division that oversees Americans' claims against other
governments. ``We know that people are dying.''
</P>
<P>
	   It is also a race for younger generations, those wanting to look ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   In Guatemala, the Commission for Historical Clarification has reported with
brutal precision on the 42,000 deaths it investigated from a 36-year civil war,
finding the army responsible for 93 percent of them. Often, a full accounting is
the first step in reconciliation, sometimes the only step.
</P>
<P>
	   Tutu, in speeches and a new book, recommends South Africa's brand of
measured forgiveness, ``abandoning your right to pay back the perpetrator in his
own coin.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, most of the 80,000 Japanese-Americans who applied for
compensation from World War II internment camps were paid $20,000 each. But
Latin Americans of Japanese descent say not enough money has been set aside to
make good on a 1998 offer of $5,000 to those who were confined in the United
States in the war.
</P>
<P>
	   Atonement remains incomplete, if even begun, for other wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   --Under a new California law allowing victims of slave labor to sue
multinationals in state courts, a survivor of the Bataan Death March last year
sued a Japanese company that he said forced him to work in an unsafe mine as a
prisoner of war in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   --Legislation passed in the House and introduced in the Senate would direct
the government to detail injustices against Italian-Americans in World War II.
Sponsors say thousands were subjected to curfews, relocated away from military
installations or confined.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Won-ki, a South Korean who says he lost his parents in a U.S. air
attack in 1951, had a different way of describing the closure he seeks: ``We
need to console those souls who still wander because the truth about their
unjust death was not told.''

   WHITEFISH, Mont. (AP) -- Four naked women streaking through a Montana ski
resort town triggered a riot early Saturday. Fifteen people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Chief William LaBrie said the riot began about 15 minutes into New
Year's Day when the women ran nude down Central Avenue. Officers caught and
arrested three of them on indecent exposure charges.
</P>
<P>
	   But more than 400 people spilled out of the surrounding bars and began
pelting police with bottles, snowballs, rocks and fireworks, LaBrie said.
</P>
<P>
	   The police called in help from the sheriff's department, the Montana Highway
Patrol, the U.S. Border Patrol and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad
Police.

<HEADLINE> N.D. Governor Looks Toward Future  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans made a plug for GOP leadership Saturday,
reminding Americans they will be electing 11 governors and hundreds of
congressional lawmakers along with a new president next year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our challenge is to elect leaders for the next century who will continue
to nurture the American spirit, leaders who understand and respect the values
that have propelled the United States to our current position of strength and
opportunity,'' Gov. Ed Schafer of North Dakota said in the weekly GOP radio
address.
</P>
<P>
	   Schafer, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said that
Republican presidents over the past centuries have helped end slavery and bring
the Cold War to an end.
</P>
<P>
	   He also reminded his radio audience that ``Republican governors lead 70
percent'' of Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We strive to apply those values in governing our states. We are guided by
a philosophy that places trust in our citizens,'' he said. ``It is a philosophy
of limited government that favors leaving money in the hands of the people who
earn it -- the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schafer said his organization, which represents the nation's 31 GOP
governors, promises ``to maintain vigilance, a respect for history and a sense
of the future that will carry these rights into a new century.''

<HEADLINE> Prison Spanking Being Investigated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Two prison guards have been fired for taking part in
the spanking of an inmate, apparently because it was his birthday, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers at the medium-security Fort Dodge Correctional Facility used
handcuffs to restrain the unidentified prisoner in a stairwell Dec. 18 so he
could be spanked by other inmates, said W.L. ``Kip'' Kautzky, director of the
Iowa Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, one officer put the prisoner in a headlock and took part in a
separate spanking, Kautzky said. The inmate, who was clothed, suffered some
bruises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was horseplay, but as a practical matter it was inappropriate use of
force,'' Kautzky said Friday. He said there are clear policies about the use of
handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of personnel policies, he refused to identify the two officers who
were dismissed, or a third officer who has been suspended with pay while the
investigation continues.

<HEADLINE> Record pension bond deal overshadowed by stock market gains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The search for the record financial deal of the
decade, or of the century, for that matter, does not take long in New Jersey.
<P>
	   It takes you back only two years to the massive pension bond deal, when New
Jersey on one day in June 1997 sold more bonds than any other government entity
ever had to borrow money and then pay it into its own state employee pension
fund.
</P>
<P>
	   In the two years since New Jersey borrowed that $2.8 billion, the booming
stock market has increased the value of the pension fund by 10 times that
amount.
</P>
<P>
	   The fund was valued at $48 million in early 1997 when the two-part deal was
proposed to close a $4 billion hole in the pension fund - and a $590 million
hole in Gov. Christie Whitman's election-year budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The fund's assets today are worth $76 billion, though the recognized
valuation under law is about $10 billion less than that.
</P>
<P>
	   By any measure, it is fantastic growth that might lead some to conclude that
all of that record borrowing two years ago was never necessary in the first
place - and now it has left taxpayers locked into a fixed debt for another 30
years.
</P>
<P>
	   "The pension bond fiasco was particularly noteworthy," said Assemblyman
Joseph Roberts, D-Camden. "It was used to continue to build the house of cards
that has been her fiscal policy."
</P>
<P>
	   Treasurer Roland Machold, who was director of pension investments in 1997,
said no one knew the stock market funds would grow as dramatically as they have.
</P>
<P>
	   "The answer is the markets were remarkably strong," Machold said. "For that
two-year period, the market return has been 19.5 percent. We certainly wouldn't
have known that at the time."
</P>
<P>
	   What they did know in 1997, Machold said, was that billions could be
borrowed at a discount price to close a shortfall in the pension fund that would
have cost substantially more to pay off over four decades, as had been the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, because the market can drop - and certainly will sometime in the
coming decades - inflated growth does not equate to pension security.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike ordinary small-time investors, the state cannot simply fold stock
dividends and profits into its holdings, nor can the state cash it in.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather, the state under law must wait for years to make sure the "profits"
earned in any given year remain in place long enough to really count.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, in June 1998, the pension fund assets totaled $69 billion, but
law limited the state to recognizing only $59 billion of it as a reliable value
not likely to vanish in a sudden down tick on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The forecasted costs for employee retirement were $56.6 billion in June
1998. That was a safety cushion of $2.4 billion between the reliable value of
the pension fund and the estimate of how much it actually needed to cover its
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   That $2.4 billion seems like a comfortable cushion created by stock market
growth, but it is less than 5 percent of the total fund and it would not have
been enough to close the shortfall looming in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "It might have been close but I don't think it would have closed up
entirely," said Jim Poole, director of public finance.
</P>
<P>
	   "And who knows how long it would have lasted," Machold added.
</P>
<P>
	   No current figures are available on the estimated costs of the retirement
benefits - an estimate that is revised annually at great difficulty through
studies, mortality trends and employment levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The details of the pension system, and the mechanics of the 1997 deal, are
horribly complicated to explain.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one fact was easy: The borrowing of $2.8 billion for the pension fund
enabled the governor to skip the scheduled payment of $590 million that the
state owed to the pension fund in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman structured her 1997-1998 budget proposal with this $590 million
savings in mind, so if the deal had collapsed, it would have torn a massive hole
in the budget.
</P>
<P>
	   After all the big numbers are tossed around, the proof is in these annual
payments, according to Poole.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the pension bond deal, the treasurer every year must make
contributions into the pension fund. The 1997 pension bond deal simply reduced
these payments.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, budget officials this year plan on paying $237 million into
the pension system, plus $108 million for the annual installment owed on the
32-year pension bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the shortage in the pension fund not been closed, this year's payments
would have been $841 million - about $496 million higher. That higher cost would
have gobbled up the funds set aside this year for school tax rebates and
increased school aid combined.
</P>
<P>
	   "Because of the two good years, there has been surplus, which has reduced
considerably in the last couple of years the amount of money we have had to put
into the system," Poole said.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics question the savings. Judith Cambria of the League of Women Voters
attacked the 1997 deal, claiming the only reason there was a shortfall in the
pension fund the first place was because Whitman when she took office in 1994
began to cut pension payments. Cambria was unavailable for comment last week.

<HEADLINE> Child Hostage Recalls Hijackers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Holding the wrapper of a chocolate given to him by a
hijacker, 12-year-old ex-hostage Himanshu Sharma recalled Saturday how one of
his captors handed him a gun during the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said it is a revolver. It has six bullets,'' the boy said, taking a
break from playing soccer with his brother and cousins a day after his family's
release. ``He asked me if I felt scared and I said, 'No.' So he said what you
don't get by asking you have to snatch with the power of the gun.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharma and his family were among the 155 hostages held captive for eight
days on an Indian Airlines plane in Afghanistan. The plane was hijacked by
masked gunmen while en route from Nepal to New Delhi, India on Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   After making three stops, it landed in Kandahar, Afghanistan and stayed
there until Friday, when India freed three convicted prisoners in exchange for
the lives of Sharma and the other hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was very suffocating inside,'' Sharma said of the plane. ``I feel great
to be able to look at the sun again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharma said the experience has not made him afraid of flying in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is only sometimes that it gets hijacked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another former hostage, a 12-year-old boy named Anshul, was praying with his
family at a Sikh temple on Saturday. He said he had been eating on the flight
when his sister grabbed his hand and pointed out a masked man with a gun headed
their way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Then they told us to put our trays down on which we were eating,'' Anshul
told Associated Press Television News. ``Then I looked down, and for about two
to three hours I was in the same position.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``After two to three days they started becoming very friendly,'' Anshul said
of the hijackers. ``They played little games and treated us very well.''

<HEADLINE> Man celebrating New Year's Eve dies in fall from fire escape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Police were investigating whether alcohol played a
role in the death of a New Year's Eve reveler who was fatally injured moments
before midnight when he fell down a fire escape.
<P>
	   Shawn Wolfe, 34, of Syracuse, fell three stories and suffered massive head
and neck injuries when he landed in the midst of other revelers. Witnesses said
the victim struck another man as he fell but the other man disappeared into the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had conflicting reports about how much drinking was going on. We are
awaiting the medical examiner's report," said Sgt. J.F. Sweeny.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe was among a large group of people attending a private party at a
lawyer's office in a building located in Syracuse's Armory Square section, a
popular downtown nightspot.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before midnight, people began moving outside onto the building's
streetside fire escape to watch a lighted ball drop from a bar across the
street. Below, people were milling on the sidewalks and in the streets counting
down to the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   "He walked out onto the fire escape. It appears he didn't even know the hole
was there," Sweeny said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe fell through the opening to the ladder. He was unconscious but
breathing when paramedics took him to University Hospital, where he died a few
hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   Rik and Bonnie Lykling were horrified by Wolfe's fall and by the partiers
who ignored the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   They said as they stood in the street, they noticed a man on the balcony
waving and hollering with a buddy. Just as the ball began to drop, they caught a
glimpse of something falling, felt a whoosh of air and heard a thump when the
object hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   To their horror, it was a man.
</P>
<P>
	   The Liverpool couple said the revelry went on as the man lay on the ground,
not moving, with his jacket pulled up over his head.
</P>
<P>
	   "The partying just continued right on," Rik Lykling said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the minutes after the accident, the crowd ignored police officers who
were trying to get them away from the area. Several people were arrested on
charges of disorderly conduct, Sweeny said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley no hero in South Dakota  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Should presidential hopeful Bill Bradley win the
Democratic nomination, his campaign is likely to hit a brick wall in South
Dakota. Make that a Black Hill.
<P>
	   Bradley, a hero in New York and other states because of his playing days
with the NBA's New York Knicks, has a less favorable legacy in South Dakota. As
a senator from New Jersey in the 1980s, he sponsored legislation to return the
Black Hills to the Sioux Indians, a wildly unpopular move in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's more likely to win another NBA championship than the general election
in South Dakota," quipped Rep. John Thune, a Republican who represents the
entire state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley discusses the legislation at length in his 1996 memoir, "Time
Present, Time Past."
</P>
<P>
	   As a Knick in the early 1970s, he and teammate Phil Jackson would travel to
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and give basketball clinics.
Eventually Bradley was made an honorary member of the Lakota Sioux tribe, and in
1983, in his first term in the Senate, "several Lakota Sioux visited me with a
request to redress an old wrong," Bradley wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   He goes on to describe how the United States, in 1868, signed a treaty
setting aside the western half of South Dakota, including the Black Hills, for
the Sioux. Six years later, gold was discovered in the Black Hills, and white
prospectors swarmed the land. The resulting battles culminated in the Battle of
Little Big Horn, where General Custer and more than 200 of his soldiers were
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress responded by voting to cut off all food, medicine and blanket
rations until the Sioux gave up 7.3 million acres of land including the Black
Hills, which they did the following year, 1877.
</P>
<P>
	   "They literally gave up gold mines for welfare checks," Bradley wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   A century later, in 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the government
had illegally seized the Black Hills, and upheld a $105 million award to eight
Sioux tribes (the value of the land in 1877 - $17.5 million - plus interest).
</P>
<P>
	   The Sioux refused to take the money, however, holding out for the land,
which they consider sacred. In the meantime, the award has been put in a
government account, earning interest.
</P>
<P>
	   A request for help from eight Sioux tribes struck a chord with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "The suggestion was a big-picture reform that remedied injustice," Bradley
wrote. "I had gotten into politics to do exactly that."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley drafted legislation that would return 1.3 million acres of land in
the western part of the state to the Sioux, including some parts of the Black
Hills owned by the U.S. government. The Sioux would also receive the Supreme
Court award, which by the mid-80s was approaching $200 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley wrote that he tried to take into account the political environment
in South Dakota by exempting private land, Mt. Rushmore, Ellsworth Air Force
Base, and federal courthouses; grandfathering timber, mining and grazing rights;
and preserving rights of free passage through the 1.3 million acres.
</P>
<P>
	   That didn't quite do it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Introducing the Black Hills bill was like dropping a match onto a pile of
oil-soaked rags," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was very controversial at the time," recalled Thune, who was working for
Sen. James Abdnor, R-S.D. "It had people in South Dakota very much worked up."
</P>
<P>
	   The South Dakota congressional delegation strongly opposed the bill, calling
Bradley an intrusive Easterner trying to impose a divisive solution.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even the late Governor George Mickelson, who launched the Year of
Reconciliation and later the century of reconciliation, did not want to approach
the Black Hills issues," said Bob Burns, distinguished professor and chairman of
the political science department at South Dakota State University in Brookings.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Mickelson, who was governor at the time, met with Bradley and
presented him with a detailed memo that argued, among other things, that the
Sioux had no historical claim to the land.
</P>
<P>
	   Not all the opposition was as reasoned. Bradley received hundreds of
letters, some of which threatened physical violence if he ever set foot in the
state. And South Dakota's attorney general, Mark Meierhenry, suggested giving
New Jersey to Sicily, because "most of us recognize that Sicilians run and own
New Jersey anyway."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley called it a "gross smear of Italian Americans," a charge Meierhenry
now acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't meant to be," he said. "It was meant to add a little levity - it
was meant to match the stupidity of his bill with the stupidity of my comment."
</P>
<P>
	   Meierhenry, now a personal injury lawyer in Sioux Falls, joked he may have
to move to Mexico if Bradley becomes president.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looking back, I was wrong but so was he," Meierhenry said. "Every
restaurant I went in I was a hero because I told that dumb-ass Bradley where to
get off."
</P>
<P>
	   Prospects for the bill, remote in any event, evaporated when two Sioux
tribes withdrew their support, enticed by a rival effort by a man claiming to be
part Sioux to seek $3.1 billion in compensation - which also went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley campaign spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke said that without a consensus
among the Sioux, Bradley would not push the proposal again as president.
</P>
<P>
	   "He continues to believe there is an injustice and the problem is still
there. If there was a consensus, and it didn't impose a hardship on South
Dakota, he'd be interested," she said, adding that Bradley still believes his
legislation did not impose a such a hardship.
</P>
<P>
	   South Dakota's June primary is so late as to be irrelevant to the nominating
process, but should Bradley advance to the general election, some politicians
think he would have a hard time winning votes in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "When his name comes up, invariably it's linked" to the Black Hills bill,
said Thune. "That's what people think of when they hear Bill Bradley."
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., said Bradley's sponsorship of the bill would "be a
bit of political baggage."
</P>
<P>
	   But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, South Dakota's senior senator, said
Democratic candidates for president are generally doomed in the state anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you look at the record for Democratic presidential candidates, we
haven't won one since 1964," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley campaign argues voters will look beyond the Black Hills issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's always been straightforward about where he stands. Often people
respect his honesty even if they disagree with him on a particular issue," said
spokeswoman Ludecke, reiterating a central campaign message.
</P>
<P>
	   And the issue is likely to help Bradley with American Indians, who make up
about 7 percent of the state's population.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know the majority of Sioux voters will vote for Bradley because of his
support for the Black Hills bill," said Gregg Bourland, tribal chairman of the
Cheyenne River Sioux.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the birthplace for the Sioux nation. It's our spiritual homeland. It's
equivalent to what Jerusalem is to the Israelis, Palestinians and Christians.
Only one senator has stood up for the great Sioux nation to have our homeland
returned to us, and that was Senator Bradley."

<HEADLINE> 2000 May Be Good for Resolutions  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   While 2000 was heralded as the grand start of a new millennium, many
Americans who made New Year's resolutions weren't thinking in such lofty epochal
terms.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sampling taken by The Associated Press, most people were less concerned
about marking our moment in history than they were about staying in shape, being
a little more frugal and finding a little more peace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to lose 10 pounds, do more business and buy a new car -- a Volvo,''
said Dennis Tanner of Hopewell, N.J., a 51-year-old stockbroker who makes New
Year's resolutions every other year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oh, and I'm going to make sure I don't get married again,'' said the
twice-divorced Tanner, chasing after his son, who ran into a Wal-Mart without
him.
</P>
<P>
	   While watching the Mummers parade in Philadelphia on New Year's Day,
Georgette Roberts, 52, thought of quite a few changes she would like to make in
2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not sure there's enough time,'' the accounting clerk said. ``I want to
go on a diet, make amends with my sister who I haven't seen in years, learn to
keep my house clean, stop hanging around with drunks, learn how to save money
and stop going to Atlantic City. That's about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Sindoni, 43, of Springfield, Pa., said: ``I'm hoping to slow down and
enjoy the moment more and not be in such a hurry. Hard to do, but important.''
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Birch, a 30-year-old disc jockey, wandered along the Champs-Elysees in
Paris on Saturday afternoon. He was retracing his New Year's Eve, when he
partied until dawn, swigging champagne with friends.
</P>
<P>
	   So his resolution was not that surprising, really: ``To have shorter and
less painful hangovers.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, cutting back on vice and indulgence was a rather common theme.
</P>
<P>
	   April Jaramillo, a waitress in Albuquerque, N.M., said she had behaved sort
of badly in the last year. Her resolution: ``To pretty much change my ways. I go
out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   She added that Y2K fears led her to live a little more recklessly during the
holidays, so now, ``my resolution is not to eat as much as I did before.''
</P>
<P>
	   Louise Poulin, a pastry cook at a restaurant in Gorham, N.H., said she has
resolved to abstrain from desserts while at home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have started -- yesterday, in fact -- eating more healthy foods,'' she
said Friday. ``Being a pastry cook, I find myself eating stuff I shouldn't
because I have to taste it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gene Johnson, a convenience store employee in Albuquerque, said his
resolution ``is to save more money.''
</P>
<P>
	   June Pease, who works at a quilting store in Concord, N.H., said she doesn't
really believe in New Year's resolutions, but made one this time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think resolutions should be all year, every year. Nothing should really
be different,'' she said. ``But yes, I need to lose weight.''
</P>
<P>
	   And even though Ms. Pease said she was sick of millennium hype, she was
willing to offer her hopes for a resolution she hoped the world would actually
stick to: ``That we have no war and that we could get along and there would be
no racial tension -- all those big things. That's all I've ever wanted.''

<HEADLINE> Asbestos Stigma Worries Mont.  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN GALLAGHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIBBY, Mont. (AP) -- Bob and Carrie Dedricks' children are so worried about
the hidden threat of asbestos in and around their parents' house that they won't
allow the Dedricks' seven grandchildren to visit.
</P>
<P>
	   So the Dedricks invited the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to take
dirt from the garden, air and dust from the house and test them for asbestos.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's find out, let's find out,'' Dedrick told Montana Gov. Marc Racicot
when he came to the house to talk about the couple's fears.
</P>
<P>
	   Libby, tucked away in Montana's mountainous northwest corner, is a
blue-collar timber and mining town at heart, and it's taken some hard punches in
the past decades as those industries tumbled. But with the Cabinet Mountains
Wilderness out its back door and the Kootenai River hardly a fly-cast away, the
town has worked hard to become a vacation destination and a place for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, with its efforts starting to bear fruit, the town has been shaken by
reports that asbestos from an old vermiculite mine killed nearly 200 people,
sickened hundreds of others and may pose a continuing health threat. Town
boosters fear they are being knocked to their knees once again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of mixed emotions right now,'' said Linda Beaulieu,
executive director of the Libby Area Chamber of Commerce. ``There is much
compassion for these families that are ill, but a lot of people feel the facts
aren't on the table. Let's not condemn our entire town that has worked so hard
to get a place on the map.''
</P>
<P>
	   Business leaders complain there is a perception that the streets are coated
with asbestos from the W.R. Grace and Co. mine, which closed nearly 10 years
ago, and that sickness is everywhere in the town of 2,700 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Newspapers in Montana and Washington state reported the asbestos issue in
November, quoting medical authorities, survivors of asbestosis victims and
people now suffering the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports prompted a series of environmental tests that will continue at
least into next spring. State officials say that until complete test results are
in, they won't know the extent of the health risk, if any.
</P>
<P>
	   Racicot, 51, who lived in Libby for his first 18 years, promised that the
state and federal governments will answer the health concerns of Libby
residents, determine the extent of asbestos contamination and do something about
it. He also plans to get a chest X-ray.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing here is determining facts,'' he said. ``If there
is a public health problem or a problem with an individual family or house, they
have to get it exposed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Racicot also said he wants to know whether state health and environmental
officials, as some critics have alleged, knew of the danger in Libby and turned
a blind eye.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Michael Spence, the state's chief medical officer, estimated that 300
people in the Libby area have been diagnosed with asbestosis, but he disputed
news reports that put the number of asbestos-related deaths at almost 200. He
said the number is less than 100 statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   For Irene Sirey, statistics are less important than the safety of her
grandchildren. She recently bought a house and had started renovating it when
the asbestos concerns arose. Behind a door in a closet was a blanket of
insulation, just like the mineral suspected of being laced with asbestos. The
clumpy insulation was seeping from a wall socket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very concerned for my grandkids; I have them in the summer,'' said
Sirey, who plans to wait for results of EPA tests on samples taken from her home
before continuing with remodeling.
</P>
<P>
	   Libby is steeling itself against an image problem that could dampen business
recruitment and real estate prices in a town where $75,000 to $90,000 still buys
a three-bedroom house.
</P>
<P>
	   Irene Loveless of Loveless Realty said three out-of-state clients who
anticipated moving here changed their minds immediately after the news coverage.
They were worried about asbestos.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What can we tell them, except that until the tests are complete, we don't
know if there's any danger?'' said Loveless, a 40-year resident.
</P>
<P>
	   Off the beaten path yet still positioned to catch some of the traffic
heading to and from Glacier National Park, Libby is prominent on the maps of
fishermen who come from around the country and abroad, drawn by the Kootenai
River's bull trout, westslope cutthroat trout and native rainbows. Kootenai
Angler, an outfitter, already has summer bookings and co-owner Tammy Blackburn
doesn't expect the asbestos issue to hurt business.
</P>
<P>
	   If Libby's image takes a hit, it will be short-term, said Gayla Benefield, a
leading supporter of the asbestos investigation. Her father was a former Grace
mine worker who died in 1974 of asbestos exposure, at age 62. Benefield said her
mother, also deceased, suffered secondary exposure from the asbestos dust that
her husband wore home from the mine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've got to weigh the possibility that asbestos contamination is an
ongoing situation, and weigh the cost of lives compared to tourist dollars,''
Benefield said. ``If there is a problem, let's find it and solve it.''
</P>
<P>
	   State tourism director Matthew Cohn said Montana has withstood a series of
image blows -- the Unabomber, the Freemen, the killing of bison wandering out of
Yellowstone National Park. Those controversies had no impact on tourism, he
said, and he doesn't anticipate a setback in Libby.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the outcome of the asbestos testing, Libby will not rise or fall
with industries such as tourism and retirement, said Crismore. He still hopes
for a comeback by mining, logging and wood processing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would take forever to build a tourism industry that would support us as
we were supported by natural resources,'' Crismore said.

<HEADLINE> Dominica Premier Calls Elections  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLSWORTH CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROSEAU, Dominica (AP) -- Dominica's prime minister on Saturday announced
early elections at a sunrise ceremony ushering in the year 2000, saying it was
time to choose leaders for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Edison James said he would dissolve the Caribbean country's
parliament on Monday. He set a Jan. 31 date for the elections, which would have
been due by September under the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   James has enjoyed popular support since his United Workers Party ousted the
Dominican Freedom Party in 1995. The early vote is seen as an effort to get
elections out of the way before the government embarks on some costly public
works projects, including improvements to the country's airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am confident that the Dominican people will elect a government that will
understand the issue of development,'' he told hundreds of New Year's revelers.
``I do not expect you to settle for mediocrity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dominica, an island nation of 66,000 people located between the French
islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, has been struggling to broaden its economy
under the James government.
</P>
<P>
	   It and other Eastern Caribbean countries are worried by U.S. challenges to
the European trade perks given to Caribbean bananas, their most important
agricultural export.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Trade Organization has agreed with U.S. complaints that the
European benefits are unfair to Central American banana growers and their
U.S.-owned fruit distributors.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Workers Party controls 12 seats in the country's legislature. The
Labor Party, headed by former Marxist Rosie Douglas, has five seats. The Freedom
Party, led by trade union leader Charles Savarin controls four seats.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pushing Hard for Mideast Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When peace talks resume Monday between Israel and Syria in
Shepherdstown, W.Va., the Clinton administration will be leaning on both sides
to finally resolve their bitter dispute over the Golan Heights, captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes are high for the region and for President Clinton, who is
scheduled to open the new round of talks that resumed in Washington two weeks
ago after a 3 1/2-year impasse.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, pressing for a land-for-peace deal, has made Mideast peace a top
foreign policy goal for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria's government newspaper, Tishrin, warned in an editorial on Saturday
that failure of the talks could lead to ``severe tension in the region and to
turbulence that would negatively affect the world's peace.'' An Israeli
political commentator, Ehud Yaari, predicted ``extremely tough bargaining'' in
the West Virginia college town.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting site, about 90 miles from Washington, was chosen in the
tradition of Camp David and Wye River, Md., both for its semi-seclusion and its
proximity to the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the senior U.S. mediator Dennis B.
Ross, are expected to be at the talks for as long as they last.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who got his feet wet in active Mideast diplomacy with late-night
bargaining with Israel and the Palestinians at Wye River in October 1998, is
scheduled to open the talks Monday and could get involved in the details later.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the talks, peace would come with a price tag of billions of dollars
for new security arrangements on the Israel-Syria border and possibly to help
evacuate the 18,000 Jews who live on the vital Golan Heights that Prime Minister
Ehud Barak seems ready to turn over to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States would pay a key role in organizing funding, but Congress
would have to approve any extra U.S. spending. Syria is ineligible for most U.S.
assistance now because it is one of seven nations the State Department has
branded as a supporter of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a lot of work ahead of us and while there is a desire to work
very hard, everybody knows the road ahead is not an easy one,'' Albright said at
the end of a first, inconclusive round in Washington Dec. 16. ``We are looking
forward to an intensive round.''
</P>
<P>
	   Over the last quarter-century, the United States has played a constant and
active role in mediating between Israel and the Arabs. Always denying any
pressure was being applied to either side, succeeding administrations never made
a secret of their support for Israel surrendering land to the Arabs in exchange
for peace pledges.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has relinquished Sinai to Egypt, part of the West Bank and all of
Gaza to the Palestinians and a sliver of land to Jordan. The Palestinians are
demanding the rest of the West Bank and part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   In this case, Syria is insisting on recovering the Golan Heights plateau
that it lost in the 1967 war. It has served as a buffer for Israel. In exchange,
President Hafez Assad is offering peace, with terms still to be spelled out.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998 negotiations that produced a partial Israeli withdrawal on the West
Bank, Clinton engaged in detailed diplomacy and mediator Ross composed much of
the accord.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It can be an opportunity to pressure the Syrians because they are panting
after a relationship with the United States,'' said Patrick Clawson of the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United States is more of a player than in the Israeli-Palestinian
talks because an agreement is likely to call on the United States to do a
variety of things, some of them controversial,'' Clawson said at the private
research group.
</P>
<P>
	   Ted Galen Carpenter, of the private Cato Institute, said he did not object
to the United States playing the role of mediator or honest broker for peace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I do object to the U.S. bankrolling possible political agreements and
inadvertently funding a growing malaise of corruption in the Palestinian
Authority, as we did in Egypt, and which, I suspect, we will do eventually with
regard to Syria and possibly Lebanon,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Jon B. Alterman, analyst at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said one problem in
Middle East peacemaking is the parties always want highest U.S. participation.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Syrian-Israeli talks, Alterman said, ``I sense Clinton would like to
come in as a closer, but not get into a Wye situation (the West Bank accord last
year) where he has to negotiate every comma and semicolon.''

<HEADLINE> Man Makes Threats at U.S. Border  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man trying to enter New York state from Canada Friday
night was turned back after he made threatening statements, U.S. authorities
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alexandria Bay, N.Y., border crossing was closed more than three hours
beginning 9:30 p.m. EST Friday after a scanner and bomb-sniffing dog indicated
possible chemical residue in the man's vehicle, U.S. Customs Service officials
said. An explosives team found no bomb-making chemicals or materials.
</P>
<P>
	   The man, who officials would not identify, was then turned over to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and eventually to Canadian authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He made threatening statements with respect to exploding something,'' INS
spokesman Russ Bergeron said. ``As a result, he was refused admission as a
potential threat to public safety.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Yorkers end the party - and go back to work  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - As the first day of the new millennium dawned in New
York City, the party finally ended - and the work began.
<P>
	   A baker unlocked the gates of a bagel store on a Brooklyn street corner
Saturday while trucks dropped off newspapers dated Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   A man in a tuxedo slumped in a Manhattan doorway next to a woman in a blue
evening gown and fur coat.
</P>
<P>
	   And Melvin Smith, a street cleaner who started his shift in Times Square at
7 p.m. New Year's Eve, was still pushing his broom through the eddies of festive
garbage swirling ankle-deep in Times Square at 6 a.m. New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   "You sweep it up and it blows right back," he said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
	   Bright bits of confetti swirled as far away as Rockefeller Plaza into the
afternoon. A typical New Year's Eve in Times Square generates 21 tons of
garbage; this celebration was expected to produce 35 tons.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the worst mess I've ever seen - and I've been cleaning up after New
Year's and after ticker tape parades for 15 years," said sanitation worker John
Hartmann, of Valley Stream, on Long Island. "I'm hoping to finish by 2 p.m., but
something tells me it'll be a lot later than that."
</P>
<P>
	   While he and dozens of other bleary-eyed workers struggled to clear away a
colorful mosaic of crushed pizza boxes, confetti, broken balloons and empty
champagne bottles, happy tourists posed ankle deep in the debris.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is wonderful and historic," said Stephen Freeze, 53, a postal worker
from Southampton, Mass, as he filled a plastic bag full of the bright and
sparkling shreds. "I figure we'll send some to friends in Arizona, and some to
Tulsa, Okla., where I'm originally from."
</P>
<P>
	   A bundled up woman who gave her name as Madeline J filled a shopping bag and
took pictures of the glittering trash. "I'm collecting confetti as a memento for
my son in Philadelphia. He's going to love this," she said, sounding nostalgic
about the party she chose to watch on television.
</P>
<P>
	   Habib Sadegh, 29, a medical student, spent much of New Year's Eve in the
emergency room of St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. "We had heroin overdoses,
people who drank too much and either fell or got in fights, and one guy who lost
his eye after getting hit in the face with a telephone," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After dealing with all that misery, he headed to Times Square a few hours
before midnight and stayed till morning.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expected it would be chaos here too, but it was so serene," Sadegh said.
"It was great."
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of terrorism and Y2K problems proved groundless. As in the rest of the
world, New York's ATM machines, subway trains, airports and electricity
functioned normally.
</P>
<P>
	   Police made only 14 arrests overnight in Times Square - nearly all for
disorderly conduct - despite a crowd estimated as high as 2 million. Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said his department would remain on high alert for the
next couple weeks, just in case.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday morning, two dozen officers converged after a small pipe-bomb
exploded outside a catering kitchen a few blocks from Times Square. Safir said
the incident may have been related to a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The party at the Crossroads of the World began at 5 a.m. Friday, New York
time, as midnight approached in Fiji and other countries that were the first on
Earth to celebrate 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The cheering crowds counted down the final seconds every hour on the hour,
until 6 a.m. Saturday, when islands on the other side of the international
dateline became the last in the world to welcome the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   Each hourly celebration was marked by a pageant of dancers in ethnic
costumes, 12-foot-tall puppets, serpentine flags and soaring music. John Soto of
the Bronx witnessed all of them, partying in the square for 24 hours straight.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm feeling great right now," he said Saturday morning, despite the lack of
sleep. "I feel like I could go for another millennium."
</P>
<P>
	   For some, the holiday meant profits. "We got a lot of business. I make
money," said Mujeeb Binnsaleh, who sells magazines, gum and candy at a newsstand
at 46th Street and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pete Tate said his bottom line was hurt by the throngs and police
barricades. Tate, who is homeless, collects cans and bottles and recycles them
for a nickel apiece. Although his shopping cart was piled high with them
Saturday, he insisted: "I don't have what I normally would get." He ran his
fingers through a pile of small heap of garbage - but found only paper.

<HEADLINE> First Day of New Millennium Begins  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA KING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Within her first few moments of wakefulness, Britt-Marie Paeiviaa knew all
the important things about this day: how cold it had grown overnight, the
hardness of the snow's glittering crust, the speed of the biting Arctic wind.
</P>
<P>
	   And, oh yes. That it was the beginning of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   While much of the world was sleeping off the epic festivities that had swept
from one continent to the next the night before, Paeiviaa, a 45-year-old
reindeer herder in remote northern Sweden, arose at dawn Saturday and set about
the same humble task that had shaped her family's life for generations: tending
to the animals that are their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
	   Man is made of ordinary things, said the poet. And so is time made up of
ordinary moments.
</P>
<P>
	   No matter that the planet had just thrown itself the biggest, loudest,
costliest party ever seen. No matter that it celebrated the start of an
extravagant span of time: a millennium, 10 times longer than most humans -- for
now, anyway -- can even hope to live.
</P>
<P>
	   On the first day of the new era, in every corner of the world, the simple
but powerful rhythms of daily life were already reasserting themselves: birth
and death, faith and family, hope and despair.
</P>
<P>
	   A South Seas family matriarch told her grandchildren ancestral tales. A
desperately ill man in the American heartland wondered how much time was left to
him. Street kids huddled together for warmth in a rain-slicked Brazilian slum. A
striving Chinese entrepreneur was happily on the job at his start-up Internet
venture.
</P>
<P>
	   In dawn chill of Dublin, Ireland, Father Patrick Carroll was greeted by a
parishioner as he unlocked the wrought-iron gates of his stately cathedral: a
homeless man looking for a sleeping bag.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first request of the new century,'' said Father Carroll, ushering the
man into a pew before hastening off to look for one. ``And it's for something as
basic as a blanket.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Two babies, two mothers, two worlds.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth Castilia and Justin Soderstrom both came early to the new
millennium. Each was born shortly after midnight Saturday: one in Haiti, one of
the world's poorest countries, and the other in Sweden, one of the world's
wealthiest.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth's mother, Jeannette Germain, went into labor so fast she gave
birth in her street clothes. Half an hour later, she was on her feet, cuddling
her newborn and posing for a family photo.
</P>
<P>
	   The overcrowded hospital where Elizabeth was born, serving the slums of the
Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, charges about $8 for a basic delivery. That's
a major expenditure for Elizabeth's father, a street peddler.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to knock myself out to provide for her,'' Reynold Castilia
vowed.
</P>
<P>
	   At Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm, a world-renowned facility affiliated
with the institute that awards the Nobel Prize in medicine, Justin's mother
Jennie said she was glad that Sweden's social welfare system would guarantee her
80 percent of her salary as a nurse's assistant while she took a year off to
care for him.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet for all the vast disparity of their circumstances, the two young mothers
-- Jeannette Germain is 25 and Jennie Soderstrom, 24 -- voiced similar
sentiments as they watched dreamily over their newborns' first hours.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every mother hopes for their offspring to be happy,'' said Soderstrom.
``So do I.''
</P>
<P>
	   Said Germain: ``I want my daughter to have a beautiful life.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   For many, the turning of the millennium was little more than a peculiar
preoccupation of the outside world, even if that world was close at hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt staged a glitzy millennium fete at its Great Pyramids, but in a
middle-class Cairo neighborhood a few miles away, Sayed Abdul Moneim and his
family welcomed the day as yet another morning of the holy month of Ramadan,
when observant Muslims fast from dawn to dusk.
</P>
<P>
	   At 3 a.m., the family -- Abdul Moneim and his wife Sumaia, along with
teen-age daughters Basma and Doua and toddler Mae -- gathered in their kitchen,
the muddy streets outside lit by the glow of brightly colored Ramadan lanterns.
</P>
<P>
	   In silence, they shared a ``sohour,'' the pre-dawn Ramadan meal of fava
beans with lime and olive oil, boiled eggs, black olives, yogurt and unleavened
bread.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Islam, New Year's is not important,'' said Abdul Moneim, 41, an
accountant in a government engineering company. ``All those parties are for
foreigners, for Americans and Europeans. It is not the Islamic way.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was not the way, either, of Dina and Jonathan Bressel, observant Jews in
a religious neighborhood of Jerusalem. They spent Saturday as they spend every
Jewish Sabbath: as a day of rest from profane matters, of prayer and study, of
time with their four children, all under the age of 9.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the strict prohibition against work on the Sabbath, they make
painstaking preparations. They clean and cook beforehand. They even cut toilet
paper into strips ahead of time, because tearing it would be considered work.
</P>
<P>
	   A new millennium? Not according to the Jewish calendar, which puts this year
at 5760.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's exactly the same as any other Sabbath,'' said Dina Bressel, a
35-year-old native of Palo Alto, Calif., who immigrated to Israel with her
husband 12 years ago. ``We're not going to know what's going on on the other
side of town, even.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the other side of the globe, at a Zen temple outside Tokyo, chief priest
Kenichi Ashibe presided over an early-morning New Year's service. Clad in
brilliantly embroidered robes, he read aloud parishioners' wishes for the new
year: good health, success in business, getting into the right school. It is
natural, he said, to pray for such things, but worldly matters are not all that
matters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is time for us to stop,'' he said, ``and reflect upon ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Green has had a decade to do that. In 1990, the 42-year-old
Indianapolis man learned he was HIV-positive. Now he has full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, he is embarking on the new millennium in the spirit of hope,
writing poetry and volunteering at a local AIDS clinic. The early hours of New
Year's Day saw him puttering around his cluttered apartment, working on a book
of memoirs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been telling everybody ... that I'm going to live to be a crotchety
old man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hope was more elusive in the Brazilian seaside city of Natal, where
Saturday's first light found a 12-year-old street kid named Cleberson Barbosa de
Souza bedding down on a rain-soaked sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
	   Most nights, he and other abandoned or runaway children who panhandle and
shine shoes on a beachfront boulevard -- part of an army of tens of thousands of
such children throughout Brazil -- don't sleep until after 8 a.m. Bed is a
cardboard mattress on a mosaic of stones, with not even a blanket or a plastic
sheet for protection from the downpour.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would like for things to be different,'' Cleberson said, as a sleeping
8-year-old friend nuzzled his shoulder. ``I'd like to buy things -- clothes,
food. It won't happen. Things don't change much when you're on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Far, far to the north in Massachusetts, that's just the sort of scene that
breaks Laura Ryan's heart.
</P>
<P>
	   In her 13 years as an emergency medical technician for Boston EMS, one of
the oldest ambulance services in the country, she has never been able to steel
herself to the sight of a neglected child.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's that constant barrage. Kids aren't taken care of,'' said Ryan, who
began her New Year's Day on the graveyard shift.
</P>
<P>
	   But small mercies are the saving ones. Early Saturday, Ryan and partner Bill
Tuttle ministered to an 81-year-old woman who had called for help. They found
her in bed, crying out in agony.
</P>
<P>
	   Before whisking the woman off to the hospital, the pair saw to it that a
neighbor fetched a blue slipper that was left behind. She'd been worried about
it.

	   If time is about the getting of wisdom, Kin Narita and Gin Kanie -- Japan's
eldest and most famous twins -- are wise in abundance. They're 107.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday at their homes in Nagoya, west of Tokyo, they relished special
New Year's delicacies and chatted about their long lives. The pair, whose first
names mean silver and gold, are beloved by the Japanese public.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've come a long way!'' said Kin. Her New Year's resolution was to stay
healthy and live longer.
</P>
<P>
	   Even at only 70, Winnie Powell has the formidable respect that only a family
matriarch can command.
</P>
<P>
	   Powell, who lives on Tarawa -- the main island of the tiny Pacific nation of
Kiribati, one of the first to welcome the millennium -- spent the night
presiding over a family feast of fish and breadfruit, telling the children
traditional stories.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All night we remembered our ancestors and sang very, very old songs,'' she
said. When morning came, it was time for a big cleanup -- sternly presided over,
of course, by Powell.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Is the turn of a millennium a time for looking back, or forward? Cynthia
Ngewu, who lives just outside Cape Town, South Africa, is firmly on the side of
the future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I say thanks to God we are in the year 2000 now,'' said Ngewu, whose
teen-age son Christopher Piet was gunned down in a police ambush in 1986, when
apartheid held full sway.
</P>
<P>
	   At home with her family on New Year's Day, the portly 58-year-old -- regal
in an blue African print dress and headdress -- said she had finally begun to
come to terms with what had happened.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My child is dead,'' she said. ``I must just forgive them.''
</P>
<P>
	   The future is on Chen Rui's side, too -- or so he firmly believes. An
Internet entrepreneur in the hyper-dynamic Chinese city of Shanghai, he spent
New Year's Day in the office tapping away on a business proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Working for yourself is a real hardship ... but when you succeed this way
it's much bigger,'' said Chen.
</P>
<P>
	   Like so many lives in China, Chen's is but a brushstroke in a vast tableau.
A defining question of the coming century will be whether China can balance
freewheeling entrepreneurship with political reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Anwari, a stooped 45-year-old who works on the banks of India's Ganges
River, takes an even longer view of things.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, he was at his usual task, carefully arranging the body of a
woman in a red sari on one of the funeral pyres that blaze on the Manikarnika
Ghat, the main cremation site in the holy city of Varanasi.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby, children shrieked in joy as they tugged at strings to prevent their
colorful kites from falling into the river. On the bank, women bent over their
washing.
</P>
<P>
	   Anwari, who uses one name, said his labors did not unduly distress him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Like I am burning other bodies today,'' he said, ``someone will burn
mine.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Normally punctilious about correcting its own errors, The
New York Times used the new millennium to fess up to a mistake that had appeared
on its front page every day for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's Times is actually issue No. 51,254 -- not No. 51,754.
</P>
<P>
	   You hadn't noticed?
</P>
<P>
	   Neither had anyone else, according to the paper, until 24-year-old news
assistant Aaron Donovan recently ``became curious about the numbering,'' a task
that he performs as part of his nightly duties, and ``wondered about the
potential for self-perpetuating error.''
</P>
<P>
	   Using a spreadsheet computer program, Donovan ran the numbers back to issue
No. 1 on Sept. 18, 1852, and discovered they added up to 500 fewer than had been
thought. Then, doing further research, Donovan homed in on Feb. 6, 1898, as the
date of infamy.
</P>
<P>
	   On that day, he found, a now-anonymous predecessor -- they were known then
as copy boys -- added 1 to 14,499 and came up with 15,000 rather than 14,500.

	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Revelers in New Orleans' French Quarter treated their
New Year's Day hangovers Saturday with a drink from a 10-foot vat billed as
``The World's Biggest Bloody Mary.''
</P>
<P>
	   The clear plastic vat was equipped with spigots. Workers drew off generous
samples in big souvenir cups and gave them out to the crowd.
</P>

people have the world's largest hangovers,'' said Paul McIlhenny, president of
the Louisiana company that makes Tabasco sauce.

	   Black-eyed peas are a Southern tradition. On plantations in the 19th

</P>
<P>
	   This year's buffet included cornbread muffins, pickled okra and eggnog.

<HEADLINE> Hostages Remember 8 Days of Terror  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) -- For eight days, at the whim and command of
armed hijackers, the 155 hostages on board Indian Airlines Flight 814 lived each
hour in fear for their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   During the grueling ordeal, one Indian passenger returning from his
honeymoon would be stabbed to death. His new wife, who had been separated from
him on the plane, would go days without learning of her husband's death. And a
young Belgian man -- singled out by the hijackers, bound and beaten -- would
wait in terror, expecting to become the next victim.
</P>
<P>
	   Passenger Ravi Kumar kept an account of the whole ordeal, scribbling a
makeshift diary on his denim jeans, boarding card and scraps of paper. The
account was published Sunday by the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
	   From his notes for Dec. 24, the day the flight took off from Katmandu,
Nepal, headed for New Delhi, India:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Out of the executive class in front of me emerges a tall and lean boy, who
might have just crossed his teens, wearing a monkey cap through which his eyes
and nose can be seen. He carried a pistol and a hand grenade,'' Kumar wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Years ago I had seen a Hollywood movie in which an airline did a mock
exercise to judge the reaction of passengers to a hijacking scenario,'' he
wrote. ``I thought Indian Airlines was doing the same. Soon I realized I was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   The five hijackers, seeking the release of Kashmiri militants in India, were
armed with pistols, grenades and knives, and immediately began threatening all
the passengers with death.
</P>
<P>
	   They singled out three men from among the passengers and took them to the
front section of the plane. The three -- Belgian David Jansen and two Spaniards
-- were seated there, their hands tightly bound and their eyes covered by
blindfolds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The hijackers were very cruel,'' Indian passenger Ashok Chawla said.
``They kept frightening us. Especially when the talks broke down. They kept
saying, `your government is not concerned about you. You will be killed.'''
</P>
<P>
	   During the chaotic first day, the Airbus A300 went on a wild ride across
south Asia as the hijackers looked for a safe base.
</P>
<P>
	   Running low on fuel, the plane was denied permission to land in Lahore,
Pakistan and instead touched down in Amritsar, India. It took off after 40
minutes without refueling and made an emergency landing in a darkened Lahore
airport. It later went on to the United Arab Emirates before settling in
Kandahar, Afghanistan, where the airport consists of a single landing strip and
a decrepit terminal building on the barren plains outside the city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I kept telling myself that we could do it, although we feared death every
day,'' pilot Devi Sharan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the hijackers' aggressiveness, Rippan Katyal, a 25-year-old Indian
man returning home from his honeymoon, seemed defiant. Passengers were forced to
wear blindfolds, but he refused to keep his on. He ignored orders not to look at
his captors.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after, the hijackers stabbed him, slitting his throat. Jansen could
hear the sound of blood gurgling in Katyal's throat as he died, diplomats who
spoke with the Belgian said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the back of the plane, Katyal's wife, Rachna, was unaware her new husband
had been killed. She had been separated from him earlier, according to relatives
quoted in Indian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   Katyal's body was removed from the plane during the brief stop in the
Emirates. But his wife remained ignorant of her husband's death throughout the
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The girl still does not know anything,'' Katyal's uncle, Kanwal Katyal,
was quoted as telling the Times of India soon after the hostages were released.
``We are trying to prepare her mentally before breaking the news.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jansen, meanwhile, feared he could be the next victim. The gunmen
periodically hit him and seemed to single him out for punishment, diplomats
said. The two Spaniards also were bound and blindfolded but were not hit.
</P>
<P>
	   The worst days were Dec. 26 and Dec. 27, the third and fourth days of the
ordeal, many passengers said. Negotiations were going nowhere, and the hijackers
were making incessant threats to kill everyone aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   People became sick. The toilets were full, and an oppressive stench
permeated the craft. Food grew scarce. The problem was exacerbated because many
on board were Hindu vegetarians who declined to eat the meat dishes being
served.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing they were doomed, some passengers quietly wrote letters intended for
family members. They gave the letters to their seatmates, asking them to pass
the notes on if they were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If two doctors were not on board, I don't know what would have happened,''
said passenger Ranjit Laturia, weeping as he recounted the experience.
``Everybody was praying and praying. On the 26th and 27th things were bad, very
bad.''
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the plane, diplomats were receiving threats from the hijackers that
they would start killing passengers unless their demands were met. They dropped
that threat only when India agreed to send negotiators to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia also played a role, said Erick de Mul,
the United Nations coordinator for Afghanistan. The Taliban told the hijackers
by radio that if one passenger were harmed, they would bring out their heavy
weapons and attack the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The hijackers knew (the Taliban) could do it and they knew they meant
business,'' de Mul said.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations-- and the waiting -- continued. Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil
Ahmed Muttawakil said the breakthrough came Thursday, when the Indian government
agreed to release three Kashmiri militants.
</P>
<P>
	   Suddenly, after days without any sign of a resolution, the crisis was
resolved swiftly on Friday. The Indians flew the three prisoners to Kandahar,
where they were united with the hijackers. The group sped away from the airport
in a convoy of cars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By the afternoon, when the hijackers were going to leave the plane, their
sub-leader said, 'Sorry for what happened, but it was beyond our control,'''
Kumar wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   On the messy plane, strewn with clothes and food wrappers, the passengers
were free.
</P>
<P>
	   Many were trembling as they came off the plane. The elderly were placed in
wheelchairs. Jansen, the Belgian man, wept uncontrollably as he was led off the
plane after eight days.
</P>
<P>
	   As the new year approached, the hostages began flying home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I sighted the glittering runway of New Delhi airport,'' Kumar wrote.
``Finally, my Katmandu-New Delhi flight had landed via Amritsar, Lahore, Dubai
and Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had regained my freedom.''

<HEADLINE> New Ukranian Cabinet Complete Soon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko promised Saturday to
complete the task of forming a new Cabinet by next week, filling the five
remaining posts left vacant after presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Yushchenko said he would submit the list of names to President Leonid
Kuchma, who earlier this week approved the nominations of 14 other Cabinet
members, as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuchma soundly defeated a communist opponent and won a second, five-year
term as president on Nov. 14. After the vote, he said he would use the new
electoral mandate to accelerate stalled economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Yushchenko has said that only a few ministers in the outgoing government
would preserve their posts, but many ministers have managed to keep their jobs,
including Interior Minister Yuriy Kravchenko, Foreign Minister Borys Tarasiuk,
Defense Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk, Labor Minister Ivan Sakhan, and Finance
Minister Ihor Mitiukov.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tyhypko will now work as the minister of
economics. New faces include Education Minister Vasyl Kremen and actor Bohdan
Stupka as Minister of Culture.
</P>
<P>

    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An airport security checkpoint wasn't very secure for
Cameron Diaz, who walked away from the scanners minus $7,000 and her passport.
</P>
<P>
	   A security guard operating an X-ray machine at Los Angeles International
Airport was arrested for investigation of grand theft on Thursday after Diaz
noticed the cash and her passport missing, said airport spokeswoman Nancy
Castles.
</P>
<P>
	   A surveillance videotape showed the guard taking the items from Diaz's
purse, Castles said. The stolen items were recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   The guard's name was not immediately released. She worked for a private
company that operates the X-ray machines.

<HEADLINE> Prince Charles: Preserve Tradition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prince Charles welcomed 2000 with a special New Year's message
urging Britons to preserve tradition as they enter the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is all the difference in the world between renewing what is old and
replacing old with new,'' the 51-year-old heir to the British throne said
Saturday on BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this sense, the dawn of a new millennium should not be the excuse for a
bonfire of the past, but a chance to rediscover the profound wisdom of those who
have made the difficult journey through this life before us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prince also emphasized the importance of religious faith.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In an age of secularism, I hope with all my heart that in the new
millennium we will begin to rediscover a sense of the sacred in all that
surrounds us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Meloni's Big Break Takes 15 Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Chris Meloni of "Law &AMP; Order: Special Victim's Unit" didn't
think becoming a star was going to be so tough.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought I'd get to Hollywood and all these producers would be at the side
of the road yelling, 'Chris! Where ya been? I've got a script here for you,"'
Meloni told People magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   After 15 years, Meloni was still waiting for his big break.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had to go through a lot of dreck," he said. "I was like Tarzan. As one
vine broke, the next one was there."
</P>
<P>
	   His roles as a jilted groom in "Runaway Bride" and as a devious convict in
HBO's "Oz" finally put him in the spotlight. His part as a cop on the "Law &AMP;
Order" spinoff solidified his position.
</P>
<P>
	   Success means 16-hour work days, but Meloni remembers the struggle that got
him there.
</P>
<P>
	   "This job has put the kibosh on any kind of life, that's for sure," he said.
"But after living through the opposite? This is awesome."

   WHITEFISH, Mont. (AP) -- Four naked women streaking through a Montana ski
resort town triggered a riot early Saturday. Fifteen people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Chief William LaBrie said the riot began about 15 minutes into New
Year's Day when the women ran nude down Central Avenue. Officers caught and
arrested three of them on indecent exposure charges.
</P>
<P>
	   But more than 400 people spilled out of the surrounding bars and began
pelting police with bottles, snowballs, rocks and fireworks, LaBrie said.
</P>
<P>
	   The police called in help from the sheriff's department, the Montana Highway
Patrol, the U.S. Border Patrol and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad
Police.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 men arrested were released from jail Saturday morning as they sobered
up, police said, and the three streakers were freed on $150 bail each. As for
the fourth streaker, police said they had a good description.

	   PHOENIX (AP) -- A teen-ager was struck in the head by a rifle bullet fired
into the air by someone celebrating the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors removed the slug from the base of Gabriel Vergara Jr.'s skull, about
an inch above his spine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I felt like a baseball hit my head, then I realized I was shot,'' the
14-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabriel was shot early Saturday as he hugged his aunt in the yard of his
home, where they were trying to watch the downtown fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabriel said he felt lucky to be alive and was praying for the shooter.
``Just tell God I forgive him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In one Phoenix neighborhood, gunfire could be heard steadily for about two
minutes after midnight. Three men were arrested for shooting in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   During a special session of the Legislature last month, lawmakers failed to
pass a bill that would have made such random gunfire a felony.
</P>
<P>
	   In Houston, a woman seven months pregnant was struck in the neck by a stray

<HEADLINE> Canal Passes Panamanian Test  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHIA MARTINEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Ships crossed the isthmus of Panama without
problems Saturday, the nation's first full day as sole administrator of the
canal. Popular concern about the canal's security, however, remained.
</P>
<P>
	   The transfer of the waterway and surrounding property from the United States
to Panamanian hands was finalized at noon Friday, ending 85 years of American
control. Panamanians celebrated what they described as the start of full
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of problems stemming from the feared Y2K computer
glitch. Canal authorities had stressed that operations would go smoothly since
the technology used to run the canal is largely the same as it was when it
opened in 1914.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities had closely watched electricity and water generators for any
trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything has come out well. ... All is normal without any problems,'' a
Canal Authority spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of customary anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirteen ships traversed the 50-mile-long canal in the first hours of the
new year, the department of maritime traffic control reported.
</P>
<P>
	   A refrigerated cargo ship, the Balboa Reefer, was the first to cross the
canal in 2000, passing the Miraflores locks on the Pacific side at 3:06 a.m. A
Greek ship, Chios Beauty, entered the Atlantic side locks at Gatun at 3:48 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The greatest popular concern about the canal is whether Panama is ready to
defend it against a potential attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's army was dissolved following the 1989 U.S. invasion to unseat
military strongman Manuel Noriega. The country since has relied on a national
police force, currently 18,000 strong.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll of 1,200 Panamanians by the La Prensa newspaper showed 70 percent
believe Panama is not capable of defending the strategic waterway. More than 72
percent said Panama needs the United States to protect the canal and 68 percent
opposed the withdrawal of U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll, published Thursday, was taken Dec. 10-12 and had a margin of error
of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities, however, have insisted that Panama is ready to defend the canal
without the U.S. military, which had maintained a presence here since 1903 when
the country became independent of Colombia.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Trade Accusations  </HEADLINE>
   By GREG MYRE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistani officials pledged Saturday to arrest
the five Indian Airlines hijackers if they enter the country, but the officials
denied India's claim that the hijackers are already there.
</P>
<P>
	   India said the hijackers are from Pakistan and have quietly slipped back
into their homeland. Pakistan disagreed, saying it was on ``high alert'' to
prevent the gang from entering its territory.
</P>
<P>
	   A day after the hijacking crisis ended in southern Afghanistan, the
perpetrators remained elusive and mysterious figures. There was still no
definitive word on the names, nationalities or whereabouts of the men, who are
the subject of increasingly bitter claims and counterclaims between rivals India
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking episode appeared likely to further raise tensions between the
two countries, which are in an almost constant state of rhetorical conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers fled the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Friday, releasing
155 hostages who they had held on board a plane for eight days. In return, the
hijackers won the release of three Muslim militants jailed in India.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia on Friday gave the hijackers 10 hours
to get out of the country, and Pakistan was the only state the group could
realistically reach during that grace period. Also, Pakistan's lengthy border
with Afghanistan is extremely porous, and the frontier can be crossed on foot in
countless places.
</P>
<P>
	   In Afghanistan, Taliban spokesman Rehnatullah Aga said Saturday that the
hijackers had fled the country. He didn't say where they had gone, but it was
widely believed Pakistan was the destination.
</P>
<P>
	   In India, Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said the hijackers were Pakistani
citizens who had fled to the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta. He also
alleged that the hijackers had wired the plane to explode, and that they
obtained additional weapons after they got into the cargo hold of the aircraft
when it landed in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   But the hijacked plane's captain, Devi Sharan, told The Associated Press he
didn't know about any explosives. Pakistan promptly accused India of ``leveling
false and baseless allegations.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pakistan is on high alert, and in case they enter Pakistan territory, they
will be apprehended and tried (according to) established international rules,''
Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm sure we will hear something in a few days,'' said Erick de Mul, the
U.N. representative to Afghanistan. ``I'm sure they will be spotted somewhere.
They can't just evaporate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers sped out of the Kandahar airport in several vehicles on
Friday, taking the three Muslim militants freed from Indian jails and one new
hostage -- a Taliban soldier. The Taliban hostage later was released, and he
returned safely to Kandahar on Saturday, the militia said.
</P>
<P>
	   If the hijackers are in Pakistan, the country's government could find itself
in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers were acting in support of militant Muslim Kashmiris fighting
against Indian control of part of the Himalayan territory. Pakistan insists it
opposes hijackings and terrorism. But it is the leading supporter of the
Kashmiri cause and could face strong opposition at home if it acts against
Kashmiris.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan and India each hold part of Kashmir, but both countries claim all
of it.

<HEADLINE> First Day of New Millennium Begins  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA KING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Within her first few moments of wakefulness, Britt-Marie Paeiviaa knew all
the important things about this day: how cold it had grown overnight, the
hardness of the snow's glittering crust, the speed of the biting Arctic wind.
</P>
<P>
	   And, oh yes. That it was the beginning of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   While much of the world was sleeping off the epic festivities that had swept
from one continent to the next the night before, Paeiviaa, a 45-year-old
reindeer herder in remote northern Sweden, arose at dawn Saturday and set about
the same humble task that had shaped her family's life for generations: tending
to the animals that are their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
	   Man is made of ordinary things, said the poet. And so is time made up of
ordinary moments.
</P>
<P>
	   No matter that the planet had just thrown itself the biggest, loudest,
costliest party ever seen. No matter that it celebrated the start of an
extravagant span of time: a millennium, 10 times longer than most humans -- for
now, anyway -- can even hope to live.
</P>
<P>
	   On the first day of the new era, in every corner of the world, the simple
but powerful rhythms of daily life were already reasserting themselves: birth
and death, faith and family, hope and despair.
</P>
<P>
	   A South Seas family matriarch told her grandchildren ancestral tales. A
desperately ill man in the American heartland wondered how much time was left to
him. Street kids huddled together for warmth in a rain-slicked Brazilian slum. A
striving Chinese entrepreneur was happily on the job at his start-up Internet
venture.
</P>
<P>
	   In dawn chill of Dublin, Ireland, Father Patrick Carroll was greeted by a
parishioner as he unlocked the wrought-iron gates of his stately cathedral: a
homeless man looking for a sleeping bag.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first request of the new century,'' said Father Carroll, ushering the
man into a pew before hastening off to look for one. ``And it's for something as
basic as a blanket.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Two babies, two mothers, two worlds.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth Castilia and Justin Soderstrom both came early to the new
millennium. Each was born shortly after midnight Saturday: one in Haiti, one of
the world's poorest countries, and the other in Sweden, one of the world's
wealthiest.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth's mother, Jeannette Germain, went into labor so fast she gave
birth in her street clothes. Half an hour later, she was on her feet, cuddling
her newborn and posing for a family photo.
</P>
<P>
	   The overcrowded hospital where Elizabeth was born, serving the slums of the
Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, charges about $8 for a basic delivery. That's
a major expenditure for Elizabeth's father, a street peddler.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to knock myself out to provide for her,'' Reynold Castilia
vowed.
</P>
<P>
	   At Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm, a world-renowned facility affiliated
with the institute that awards the Nobel Prize in medicine, Justin's mother
Jennie said she was glad that Sweden's social welfare system would guarantee her
80 percent of her salary as a nurse's assistant while she took a year off to
care for him.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet for all the vast disparity of their circumstances, the two young mothers
-- Jeannette Germain is 25 and Jennie Soderstrom, 24 -- voiced similar
sentiments as they watched dreamily over their newborns' first hours.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every mother hopes for their offspring to be happy,'' said Soderstrom.
``So do I.''
</P>
<P>
	   Said Germain: ``I want my daughter to have a beautiful life.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   For many, the turning of the millennium was little more than a peculiar
preoccupation of the outside world, even if that world was close at hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt staged a glitzy millennium fete at its Great Pyramids, but in a
middle-class Cairo neighborhood a few miles away, Sayed Abdul Moneim and his
family welcomed the day as yet another morning of the holy month of Ramadan,
when observant Muslims fast from dawn to dusk.
</P>
<P>
	   At 3 a.m., the family -- Abdul Moneim and his wife Sumaia, along with
teen-age daughters Basma and Doua and toddler Mae -- gathered in their kitchen,
the muddy streets outside lit by the glow of brightly colored Ramadan lanterns.
</P>
<P>
	   In silence, they shared a ``sohour,'' the pre-dawn Ramadan meal of fava
beans with lime and olive oil, boiled eggs, black olives, yogurt and unleavened
bread.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Islam, New Year's is not important,'' said Abdul Moneim, 41, an
accountant in a government engineering company. ``All those parties are for
foreigners, for Americans and Europeans. It is not the Islamic way.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was not the way, either, of Dina and Jonathan Bressel, observant Jews in
a religious neighborhood of Jerusalem. They spent Saturday as they spend every
Jewish Sabbath: as a day of rest from profane matters, of prayer and study, of
time with their four children, all under the age of 9.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the strict prohibition against work on the Sabbath, they make
painstaking preparations. They clean and cook beforehand. They even cut toilet
paper into strips ahead of time, because tearing it would be considered work.
</P>
<P>
	   A new millennium? Not according to the Jewish calendar, which puts this year
at 5760.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's exactly the same as any other Sabbath,'' said Dina Bressel, a
35-year-old native of Palo Alto, Calif., who immigrated to Israel with her
husband 12 years ago. ``We're not going to know what's going on on the other
side of town, even.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the other side of the globe, at a Zen temple outside Tokyo, chief priest
Kenichi Ashibe presided over an early-morning New Year's service. Clad in
brilliantly embroidered robes, he read aloud parishioners' wishes for the new
year: good health, success in business, getting into the right school. It is
natural, he said, to pray for such things, but worldly matters are not all that
matters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is time for us to stop,'' he said, ``and reflect upon ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Green has had a decade to do that. In 1990, the 42-year-old
Indianapolis man learned he was HIV-positive. Now he has full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, he is embarking on the new millennium in the spirit of hope,
writing poetry and volunteering at a local AIDS clinic. The early hours of New
Year's Day saw him puttering around his cluttered apartment, working on a book
of memoirs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been telling everybody ... that I'm going to live to be a crotchety
old man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hope was more elusive in the Brazilian seaside city of Natal, where
Saturday's first light found a 12-year-old street kid named Cleberson Barbosa de
Souza bedding down on a rain-soaked sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
	   Most nights, he and other abandoned or runaway children who panhandle and
shine shoes on a beachfront boulevard -- part of an army of tens of thousands of
such children throughout Brazil -- don't sleep until after 8 a.m. Bed is a
cardboard mattress on a mosaic of stones, with not even a blanket or a plastic
sheet for protection from the downpour.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would like for things to be different,'' Cleberson said, as a sleeping
8-year-old friend nuzzled his shoulder. ``I'd like to buy things -- clothes,
food. It won't happen. Things don't change much when you're on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Far, far to the north in Massachusetts, that's just the sort of scene that
breaks Laura Ryan's heart.
</P>
<P>
	   In her 13 years as an emergency medical technician for Boston EMS, one of
the oldest ambulance services in the country, she has never been able to steel
herself to the sight of a neglected child.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's that constant barrage. Kids aren't taken care of,'' said Ryan, who
began her New Year's Day on the graveyard shift.
</P>
<P>
	   But small mercies are the saving ones. Early Saturday, Ryan and partner Bill
Tuttle ministered to an 81-year-old woman who had called for help. They found
her in bed, crying out in agony.
</P>
<P>
	   Before whisking the woman off to the hospital, the pair saw to it that a
neighbor fetched a blue slipper that was left behind. She'd been worried about
it.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   If time is about the getting of wisdom, Kin Narita and Gin Kanie -- Japan's
eldest and most famous twins -- are wise in abundance. They're 107.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday at their homes in Nagoya, west of Tokyo, they relished special
New Year's delicacies and chatted about their long lives. The pair, whose first
names mean silver and gold, are beloved by the Japanese public.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've come a long way!'' said Kin. Her New Year's resolution was to stay
healthy and live longer.
</P>
<P>
	   Even at only 70, Winnie Powell has the formidable respect that only a family
matriarch can command.
</P>
<P>
	   Powell, who lives on Tarawa -- the main island of the tiny Pacific nation of
Kiribati, one of the first to welcome the millennium -- spent the night
presiding over a family feast of fish and breadfruit, telling the children
traditional stories.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All night we remembered our ancestors and sang very, very old songs,'' she
said. When morning came, it was time for a big cleanup -- sternly presided over,
of course, by Powell.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Is the turn of a millennium a time for looking back, or forward? Cynthia
Ngewu, who lives just outside Cape Town, South Africa, is firmly on the side of
the future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I say thanks to God we are in the year 2000 now,'' said Ngewu, whose
teen-age son Christopher Piet was gunned down in a police ambush in 1986, when
apartheid held full sway.
</P>
<P>
	   At home with her family on New Year's Day, the portly 58-year-old -- regal
in an blue African print dress and headdress -- said she had finally begun to
come to terms with what had happened.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My child is dead,'' she said. ``I must just forgive them.''
</P>
<P>
	   The future is on Chen Rui's side, too -- or so he firmly believes. An
Internet entrepreneur in the hyper-dynamic Chinese city of Shanghai, he spent
New Year's Day in the office tapping away on a business proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Working for yourself is a real hardship ... but when you succeed this way
it's much bigger,'' said Chen.
</P>
<P>
	   Like so many lives in China, Chen's is but a brushstroke in a vast tableau.
A defining question of the coming century will be whether China can balance
freewheeling entrepreneurship with political reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Anwari, a stooped 45-year-old who works on the banks of India's Ganges
River, takes an even longer view of things.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Y2K more Dullsville than Doomsday in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Whew! The new year began with the lights on, ATMs
dispensing cash and dialtones humming. But people remained on guard in New York
state Saturday for latent Y2K computer glitches.
<P>
	   "It's like a baseball game, we're only in the third or fourth inning maybe,"
said Tony DeRosa, who lives near Rochester.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let's finish playing this game and see what happens."
</P>
<P>
	   A team of 150 state emergency workers continued to do just that Saturday,
monitoring power lines, hospitals and other vital services at the state's
underground Y2K command center in Albany. Reports continued to be good.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki proudly told emergency workers that New York - after a
tremendous amount of effort - updated its computer systems for the 21st Century
and passed the Y2K test with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were hoping for the most expensive non-event in history. That would be
good news," Pataki said. "And it was a non-event."
</P>
<P>
	   There were scattered power outages - including a temporary power loss to 966
customers Saturday in Eden in Erie County. But Gary Davis, the state's Y2K
project director, said those outages were ordinary occurrences unrelated to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   The lone Y2K problem identified by the state was a minor disruption to a
computer system serving a small non-commerical bank. Davis said the bank's
customers would not be affected, because the problem would be corrected by the
start of business on Monday. He would not identify the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said he was confident the state's power grid would handle its next
benchmark test Monday morning, when many offices and factories power back up.
Regardless, the state's Y2K command center will remain fully activated through
Tuesday, when officials will decide if operations can be scaled back.
</P>
<P>
	   While state officials exulted in their initial success, others wondered if
maybe the Y2K wasn't quite the monster it was made out to be.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think a lot of it was the media, it scares you more than anything," said
Chris Ericson, a North Carolina resident shopping in Albany's Colonie Center
Mall with her family. "I think they got people overly worried about it."
</P>
<P>
	   DeRosa, who is married with two children, stocked up on MREs (Meals Ready to
Eat) and filled four 55-gallon drums with tap water.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll probably hold on to it for a month just to see what happens" he said.
"If nothing, I'll put it in the pool."
</P>
<P>
	   Davis said the state will be on heightened alert for Y2K problems for a
while. He noted that this is a leap year, and Feb. 29 is being mentioned as a
potential trouble date for computers.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Mills, a power engineer from Schenectady who has done Y2K consulting,
said computer glitches are expected to pop up for many months.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not over yet," he said.

<HEADLINE> Banks Sail Into New Century  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's banks and savings and loans reported no
problems as the calendar flipped to a new century. But they had an army of
computer experts working at facilities around the country Saturday to make sure
that all the sophisticated financial accounting equipment kept working.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the effort at the nation's 10,300 financial institutions was done
behind the scenes by special teams rechecking their account reconciliation
procedures to verify that the rollover from 1999 to 2000 did not cause any mixup
in customers' deposits.
</P>
<P>
	   A handful of banks opened for business on New Year's Day just to allay
depositors' fears about whether they could access their accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit Bank opened more than 400 of its branches in New Jersey, Pennsylvania
and Connecticut as a confidence booster, but officials reported no unusual
worries or large withdrawals by customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The banking industry did a good job of installing confidence in their
customers that their money would be safe," said Summit Bank spokeswoman Jean
Kirshenbaum.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's automated teller machines, primed with extra cash, were
reported to be operating normally as well.
</P>
<P>
	   To highlight the smooth transition, Donna Tanoue, chairwoman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits at the nation's financial
institutions, showed up at 8 o'clock Saturday morning at one ATM a block from
the White House to withdraw a $20 bill for the benefit of waiting television
cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am here to demonstrate what we said all along -- that years of hard work
by the banking industry is paying off," she said. "We are having a solid
transition to the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
	   And if someone finds that one of the nation's 227,000 ATM machines is not
working, Tanoue's advice was not to worry. She said 1 percent of ATM's at any
one time are not working.
</P>
<P>
	   "If people encounter an ATM that is down, they should do what they normally
do -- go find another one," she advised. "Don't assume it's a Y2K glitch."
</P>
<P>
	   Tanoue said that FDIC bank examiners would continue visiting individual
banks and receiving reports throughout the weekend, but that so far her agency
and the other federal banking agencies were finding nothing but a trouble-free
changeover.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. banking industry, which spent an estimated $9 billion updating
computer systems so they would not misread 2000 as 1900, had to meet a target of
having its systems ready six months ago. Federal bank examiners aggressively
went after stragglers to ensure 100 percent compliance by December.
</P>
<P>
	   While there had been concerns that banks in other nations could experience
problems that might have an impact in the United States, officials said that as
of Saturday no serious problems had developed.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup, the nation's largest financial service company, reported Saturday
that its 450 branches in the United States and operations in 100 countries were
all proceeding without Y2K troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the advanced preparation left banking regulators with little to do
through the weekend except monitor the flow of business-as-usual status reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Reserve officials at the central bank's command center wore special
red Y2K T-shirts to commemorate the event, presenting one to Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who stopped by for an update on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   Red was also the color choice for the T-shirts worn by bank tellers at City
National Bank in West Virginia, proclaiming "We're not afraid of Y2K." The bank
elected to keep 10 branches open through the night.
</P>
<P>
	   While City National had emergency power generators and other backup
equipment standing by if serious problems developed, none of the contingency
planning were needed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We went through the night with no problems. Everything worked according to
plan," reported Jeff Legge, City National's Y2K information systems director.

<HEADLINE> Man Makes Threats at U.S. Border  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man trying to enter New York state from Canada Friday
night was turned back after inspectors suspected he was trying to enter the
United States illegally, U.S. authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alexandria Bay, N.Y., border crossing was closed more than three hours
beginning 9:30 p.m. EST Friday after a scanner and bomb-sniffing dog indicated
possible chemical residue in the man's vehicle, U.S. Customs Service officials
said. An explosives team found no bomb-making chemicals or materials.
</P>
<P>
	   The man, who officials would not identify, was then turned over to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and eventually to Canadian authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS originally reported the man made threatening statements that he
planned to cause an explosion.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Gilhooly, director of public affairs for the INS eastern region, later
said the original statement was in error. ``He was refused entry because he
didn't satisfy our inspectors that he was a legitimate visitor,'' Gilhooly said.
``He's an immigrant from Russia. It appeared to us he had been living in the
United States or intended to live in the United States. He doesn't have an
immigrant visa.''

<HEADLINE> Private Militia on Alert in Denver  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Members of a private Colorado militia say they spent New
Year's Eve on red alert, guns at the ready, in case civil authorities were
overwhelmed by Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Official Denver-area emergency teams reported no problems overnight, and law
enforcement officers said they had no plans to call on the group in any event.
But the self-proclaimed Colorado State Defense Force Reserve said it would have
been ready.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're a bunch of law-abiding citizens who care very much about our
country,'' said Paul Graham, a 32-year-old military surplus store owner and a
member of the group.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham and other members rented two hotels in western Jefferson County to
use as command posts Friday night. They brought guns, ammunition, a police
scanner and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to be carrying six magazines of 30 rounds each, and I have
absolutely zero intention of using them,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
	   The group held a strategy briefing Wednesday night. Graham outlined
emergency medical supplies in case of terrorist attack, secret rendezvous points
if communications were cut and radio codes for patrols on scouting missions.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham said members have trained for years in case the U.S. government
``does something stupid'' or a foreign nation were to attack U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the Canadians invade and start going door-to-door, we will go visit
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said the real purpose of Friday night's gathering was to be on call
in case civil authorities needed help.
</P>
<P>
	   Militia member Frederick Blume, a 42-year-old computer programmer from
Denver, explained the group's purpose this way: ``(The Constitution) says that
people are governed by their own consent. For our form of government to work, we
have to be participants ... not only on a political level.''

<HEADLINE> 'Millennium' on Banished Words List  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDRA R. MOSES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Please, no more millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   The term that seems to be on everyone's lips also is on the annual New
Year's list of misused, overused and generally useless words and phrases
compiled by Lake Superior State University.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3,400-student school compiles the list of words to be exiled from
submissions sent in from academia, advertising, business, journalism, the
military, politics and sports.
</P>
<P>
	   The school has been doing the list since 1976, when it was born during a New
Year's Eve party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's unbelievable. Every year I think it will lose its popularity, and
every year I'm wrong,'' said university spokesman Tom Pink. ``Some people watch
for things all year.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the school gets hundreds of contributions each year -- they never
keep a record -- and the list compilers look for humor and good reasons for
banishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hear the familiar `I'm sick of this,''' Pink said. ``We like to look
for reasons that are humorous and witty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Millennium was right up at the top of the latest list.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I wanted to be really grumpy I could point out that the millennium is
not a moment which occurs at the end of the year, but (is) a full thousand
years,'' said a submission from Elaine Gosling of London.
</P>
<P>
	   The acronym Y2K didn't make it -- but only because it already made the list
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's all good'' isn't so great, says Zachariah Love of Hollywood, Calif.
``If I hear my employees use it, they will be fired.''
</P>
<P>
	   Love isn't the first employer to take such a stand on language. Pink said a
judge in Arizona once posted the university's annual list on his office bulletin
board, and said everyone was forbidden to use the words and phrases on it.
</P>
<P>
	   The list follows trends, with upcoming elections spawning a slew of
nominations. This year, compilers cited ``at risk,'' ``for the children,'' and
``wake-up call'' among the political phrases to be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
	   In the language of sports, Ron Elliot of Leamington, Ontario, asked that
``came to play'' be eliminated. ```The Wings came to play.' What else would they
be doing?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other citations for banishment:
</P>
<P>
	   --''Know what I'm sayin?'' -- ``It's likely I don't,'' said Len Nelson of
Green Bay, Wis.
</P>
<P>
	   --''Thinking outside the box.'' -- ``Another overused phrase that
unimaginative people use when they want to sound creative,'' said Kevin Dunseath
of Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
	   --''E''-anything, as in ``e-trade.'' -- ``E-nough is e-nough,'' said Emma
Sams of Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Shuns the Millennium  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The millennium never arrived in communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The government of Fidel Castro officially shunned millennium events Friday
night and Saturday, arguing that the new century and the new millennium won't
start until one minute after midnight of Dec. 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, what began here at the start of 2000 was the ``Year of the 40th
Anniversary of the Decision of Fatherland or Death.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a country where every year gets a political and historical name, this
year remembers Castro's 1960 coining of the slogan used regularly during
speeches: ``Fatherland or death! We will overcome!''
</P>
<P>
	   The government's announcement last week that millennium events being held
around the world were one year premature apparently dampened enthusiasm for big
New Year's parties -- which are never that big here, anyhow.
</P>
<P>
	   No official events were scheduled, even though New Year's Day marked the
41st anniversary of the revolution that brought Castro to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditional holiday celebrations were low-key, mostly intimate family
dinners of roasted pork, black beans, yucca and green salad -- along with plenty
of rum.
</P>
<P>
	   Tourists celebrated the new year with special holiday meals and shows in the
plaza outside old Havana's towering cathedral, at the Tropicana nightclub and at
hotel restaurants and discos.
</P>
<P>
	   Swigging beer and swinging their hips to drum beats, practitioners of Cuba's
Santeria religion celebrated the arrival of 2000 with African rites and rhythms
that slaves brought to the Caribbean island centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
	   At Hamel Lane, a closed-off street converted into a Santeria cultural
Center, hundreds danced to rumba bands whose musicians pounded out rhythms on
squarish wooden drums and sang centuries-old odes to Cuban orishas, or saints.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside a bamboo hut populated by representations of Yemaya, Ochun and other
orishas, a woman dressed all in white lighted the first of 2,000 candles to burn
throughout the night in honor of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   Havana's streets were quiet, with the exception of honking horns at
midnight. Just a few nuzzling couples were found when the clock struck 12 on
Havana's famous Malecon seawall, often a gathering site for spontaneous
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Mostly, the three-day government holiday that began Friday was a respite for
Cubans increasingly wearied by daily demonstrations aimed at getting the United
States to return Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy rescued in November
off the coast of Florida. The boy's mother died during their attempt to reach
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government turned Elian over to his great-uncle in Miami, who says
he can provide him a better life off the communist island. Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, has demanded that the boy be returned to him in Cuba and
Castro's government has made the fight its own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In these heroic days, the revolution has once again shown its solidarity
and extraordinary capacity for mobilization,'' the communist government said in
a message transmitted on radio and television in the wee hours of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The fight to return Elian to his father in Cuba has become ``a symbol, a
dignified banner,'' and his return to the island is ``our goal,'' said the
message read on government-operated stations.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Glitch Blinds Pentagon Computer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. military spying system was blinded for three hours
at the start of the new year, the Pentagon said Saturday, in what an official
called the ``one significant problem'' caused by a Y2K computer failure.
</P>
<P>
	   A computer that processes satellite reconnaissance data stopped working and
service was partially restored within ``a few hours'' by a backup system, said
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are operating at less than our full peacetime level of activity
today,'' he told reporters at midday Saturday. ``But all of our high priority
needs -- both for the Department of Defense and other national customers -- are
fully being met.''
</P>
<P>
	   By midafternoon Saturday, the Defense Department had not yet returned to the
normal system.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre said the problem did not involve America's strategic early warning
defense systems. But, citing the sensitive nature of the intelligence system,
declined to say where the computer system was located or whether it was taking
photos or monitoring radio or other transmissions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The satellites were always under ... control,'' Hamre said. ``Our problem
was actually was here on the ground, in the processing station.''
</P>
<P>
	   Private defense analyst Helmut Sonnenfeldt said it was difficult to comment
on the incident because the Pentagon didn't say the kind of information being
collected or intercepted, whether information was irretrievably lost, of whether
there was any evidence anyone took advantage of the breakdown period ``to use
for whatever purpose.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't lose any sleep over it because I don't know what the satellites
were doing, ... and I think one would have heard about precautions being taken
if they thought there was something here that was fishy,'' said Sonnenfeldt of
the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, it was a sufficiently important system for them to have a
backup,'' even if the backup only partially works, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But if that's the only one (system failure), I think they're lucky
considering how much concern there was with this whole problem of Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre said the system failed after 7 p.m. EST Friday, or midnight GMT, when
Pentagon computers rolled into the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   Except for that problem, most of the rollover from 1999 to 2000 ``was
uneventful,'' Hamre told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had a number of small anomalies around the world, very small,'' Hamre
said. ``We did have a cash register that refused to process receipts in Okinawa.
So we're looking at that level of detail.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Communism Papers Drop on Cuba  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A pilot flew a small plane from Florida into Cuban airspace and
dropped anti-communism pamphlets on Havana, Customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Customs radar center in Long Beach, Calif., tracked the single-engine
plane once it left U.S. airspace after departing Tamiami Airport in Miami on
Saturday, said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His reason for going down was to drop leaflets, anti-communist leaflets in
multiple languages,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the man was flying the rented plane over Havana, the Cuban government
sent two MiG fighter jets to monitor his flight until he left Cuban airspace,
Sheehan said. The MiGs took no action, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The aircraft returned to Tamiami Airport about four hours after it left and
Customs officials detained the pilot for questioning. Sheehan identified him
only as a 51-year-old Asian.
</P>
<P>
	   He had not been charged with anything by Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a regulation requiring him to notify our agency prior to him
coming into the United States, which he did not do,'' Sheehan said.

<P>
	   On the first morning of 2000 it was so quiet at Louisville International
Airport in Kentucky that police officer Robin Cull sat down at the piano in the
rotunda and played herself some songs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was just serenading the lonely hallways,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A peace not unlike hers descended on planet Earth Saturday after the biggest
world party in history. The fireworks and singing and dancing were over, the
multimillion-strong crowds from Rome to Rio de Janeiro had scattered, and the
cleanup crews moved in.
</P>
<P>
	   London estimated its litter at four times the normal amount, 15 percent of
it empty champagne bottles. There were 35 tons of garbage to remove from the
streets around New York's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is wonderful and historic,'' said Stephen Freeze, 53, a postal
worker, as he filled a plastic bag with bright, sparkling confetti. ``I figure
we'll send some to friends in Arizona, and some to Tulsa, Okla. ...''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the worst mess I've ever seen -- and I've been cleaning up after
New Year's and after ticker tape parades for 15 years,'' said sanitation worker
John Hartmann.
</P>
<P>
	   Having gotten through midnight to find that ATM machines, subway trains,
airports and electricity were functioning normally, people argued about the huge
sums spent to fix the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they went overboard. Too much,'' said Johnnie Bennett, interviewed
at a Montgomery, Ala., pharmacy. ``They're always saying the state needs more
money. Then all of the money is spent on Y2K.'' Alabama state officials said
$120 million was spent on computer readiness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Better to be cautious than to be sorry in the end,'' said Bruce Stolts,
who works in a nearby electronics store.
</P>
<P>
	   Many more systems still await their Y2K test, starting Monday when the world
-- particularly the financial world -- goes back to work and reboots its
computers.
</P>
<P>
	   In Minnesota, the Duluth News Tribune summed up the rollover with a succinct
``Piece of Y2Kake.''
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times' headline said simply, ``1/1/00.'' And for Roman numerals
buffs, MCMXCIX became just plain MM.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting raged in Chechnya and in many other corners of the world, but the
214-year-old Times of London was able to open its Jan. 1 editorial with the
observation that ``This is the first century in the history of The Times which
Britain has been able to greet as a nation not at war.''
</P>
<P>
	   After two world wars and the fall of communism, the paper said, ``most
people believe another global conflict to be unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, it warned, traditional modes of warfare were giving way to new forms
of ethnic and religious conflict that would need new peacemaking tactics in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
	   The millennium helped put many Americans in a reflective mood.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside a supermarket in Conyers, Ga., Elva Martin, 73, thought of world
wars and the Depression. ``I remember the young men coming around begging for
food for their families,'' she said. ``It just makes me wish that now we are
starting a new century that all the killing would be over and we start opening
our hearts to one another.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her daughter, Timmie Bailey, a 44-year-old insurance adjuster, said: ``It
was just another day to me. I've got to go back to work on Monday. I do feel
like the baby boom generation is incredibly lucky. They haven't had to deal with
anything like other people in this century like war or Depression and we ought
to keep that in mind as we look ahead.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fred Miller, a retired chemist in Nashville, Tenn., felt upbeat. He said his
family had an outhouse and no telephone when he was born in 1934, and on New
Year's Day 2000 he was shopping for his first home computer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you consider what's been accomplished technologically in the last 50
years, it could be twice that in the next 50,'' he said. ``The sky's the
limit!''
</P>
<P>
	   Some looked for a religious dimension in the celebrations.	   Joseph W.
McQuaid, publisher of The Union Leader in New Hampshire, asked in a front-page
editorial: ``What is one to say about the end of a century, especially when it
signals, popularly if not technically, the start of a new millennium?
</P>
<P>
	   ``We might begin by saying God.''
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, ``As far as we have come technologically and materially, we
seem to have drifted remarkably from a belief in moral right and wrong. ...''
</P>
<P>
	   And then there were those who didn't get to share in the millennium bash,
like the 11million people of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The 41-year-old communist regime of Fidel Castro officially shunned
millennium events, taking the purist approach that the new century won't start
for another year.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, what began on the stroke of 2000 was the ``Year of the 40th
Anniversary of the Decision of Fatherland or Death.'' But some car horns honked
in Havana at midnight nonetheless.

<HEADLINE> Russia Forces Push Grozny Offensive  </HEADLINE>
   By MIGUEL GIL MORENO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- In the second week of a major drive to seize the
capital of rebel Chechnya, Russian forces on Saturday unleashed an exceptionally
fierce assault on Grozny, dropping scores of bombs on the city from low-flying
jets.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal forces claimed progress against the rebels, but apparently were
still far from capturing the center of Grozny. Rebel fighters in heavily
fortified positions have inflicted steady losses on Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Gen. Vadim Timchenko claimed 89 rebels, including several field
commanders, were killed in Grozny on Friday and Saturday, the Interfax news
agency reported. Timchenko said eight Russian servicemen were killed in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Smoke from blazing buildings covered parts of the Chechen capital after the
overnight barrage, in which waves of bombs were interspersed with hundreds of
rounds of shells fired by tanks in the hills at the city's edge.
</P>
<P>
	   The intensified effort to take the city came as acting President Vladimir
Putin visited Russian forces in Chechnya to praise them for the campaign to
crush separatist rebels. The visit coming on Putin's first full day in office
underlined his determination to win the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not simply about restoring honor and dignity to the country, no,''
Putin told the servicemen in Gudermes, a city east of the capital of Grozny that
Russian troops took several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is about more serious things. This is about how to bring about the
end of the breakup of Russia, that is your fundamental goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Civilians in Grozny who have lived through more than three months of air
attacks on the city said the overnight barrage was the worst they'd endured.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's never been anything like it was last night. It was simply a
nightmare,'' said a 65-year-old woman who gave her name only as Anonina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The planes were like snakes, streaming past, over and over,'' said Lyubov
Grigoryeva, 62, a pensioner. ``This is how we spent the New Year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Up to 40,000 mostly elderly and infirm civilians are trapped in Grozny.
Residents have been huddled for weeks in basements, too afraid to go outside or
risk the journey through the Russian bombardment to escape Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no sign that federal troops were making significant progress on
the ground, but the military claimed Friday to have broken through the rebels'
first line of defense and to have taken control of the Staropromyslovsky
neighborhood, about 2 miles from Grozny's center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon said Friday that Russia fired three Scud missiles into
Chechnya. The missiles were monitored as part of the U.S.-Russia joint
surveillance of any activity that might be related to the year 2000 computer
glitch, but U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said the launches were
not Y2K-related.
</P>
<P>
	   There had been no previous reports of Russia using such heavy weaponry in
Chechnya. There was no Russian comment on the report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of bombing and shelling the capital, the Russians launched an
operation on Dec. 25 to capture Grozny, the last major Chechen city under rebel
control and the war's key political prize. But Russian forces have been held up
by heavily mined roads and tough rebel resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Grozny is the only major town in Chechnya still held by the rebels after a
three-month Russian ground offensive backed by intense air and artillery
strikes.
</P>
<P>
	   The surprise resignation of President Boris Yeltsin on Friday and the
appointment of Putin as acting president left Russia's strategy in Chechnya
unchanged. Putin has championed the war and vigorously defended Russia against
Western criticism of the offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said Saturday that Russia was ready for talks ``anytime,'' but only
with Chechen representatives who meet Moscow's oft-repeated preconditions:
condemning terrorism, turning over criminal leaders and warlords, and freeing
Russians and others who have been kidnapped for ransom and are being held in
Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Soldier Killed in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Lebanon (AP) -- Muslim militants killed a soldier less than 24 hours
after kidnapping him and his colonel during an ambush in northeastern Lebanon,
security officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials said Lebanese army troops found the body of the kidnapped
soldier when they raided a two-story building in Dinniyah.
</P>
<P>
	   The building is believed to house a radio station run by the Jamaa
Al-Islamiya, a Muslim militant grouping that advocates the creation of an
Islamic state in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   The militants ambushed an army patrol in northern Lebanon on Friday night,
killing four soldiers and wounding three, the Lebanese army said. The lieutenant
colonel and the other soldier were kidnapped after the officer reported the
incident to his command and asked for reinforcement, the army said.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no word on the lieutenant colonel's whereabouts, according to the
security officials, who asked not to be named. They refused to identify either
of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Dinniyah, a lightly populated mountainous area east of the northern port
city of Tripoli, is known to be a haven for Jamaa Al-Islamiya. It was the scene
of clashes that started Friday afternoon between Islamic extremists and Lebanese
army troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The security officials said five civilians were wounded Saturday when
mortars hit a home in Assoun, a neighboring village, and that fighting killed
another soldier and wounded two others.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the trouble began, six soldiers have been killed and five wounded.
According to the security officials, at least two Jamaa Al-Islamiya militants
also have been killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Reports from Tripoli, 50 miles north of the capital, Beirut, said hundreds
of families living in nearby villages spent New Year's Eve and New Year's Day in
basements and bomb shelters, fearing fighting would escalate.

<HEADLINE> Students Return To Keep Old Promise  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN K. PAULSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- For decades, beginning in 1962, high school history teacher
Dick Jordan had told all of his students to meet on him on the steps of the
Denver Public Library on the first day of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   He also told them to bring a dollar, because he planned to be retired and
figured he would need the money to go Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, more than 100 former students showed up in front of the library
to honor a man they said taught them to think for themselves. And they brought
their dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   They came from Alaska, Texas, Los Angeles and New York. They came on
crutches. They brought their children and their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He inspired all of us to do what we thought was the right thing to do. If
that meant raising hell along the way, that too,'' said Judi Stein Stutman, 51,
who was a member of Jordan's first class at George Washington High.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, Jordan's students argued about the Vietnam War. They
discussed the assassination of President Kennedy. For former student Andrew
Hudson, now a spokesman for Denver Mayor Wellington Webb, the issues were
Reaganomics, integration, the Cold War and busing.
</P>
<P>
	   Hudson said Jordan was passionate about his work ``because he just knew that
knowledge was going to be important to you in the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Stutman said students took his teaching to heart. She became an advocate
for disabled students and teaches them to fight for their rights. Others became
urban planners, consultants and public officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't believe this, folks. I don't know how to thank you when you honor
me like this,'' Jordan told his former students, wearing several of their dollar
bills pinned to his shirt.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan, who retired five years ago, said he changed his mind about going to
Tahiti and will donate the money to a soup kitchen.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan was moved to tears when a man came up to him Saturday and said it was
his wife's dying wish that he attend the reunion in her place and help her keep
a promise she made more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the last things she asked him to do as she was dying from cancer
was to come down here. I don't know how to top that,'' Jordan told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Thank you for honoring me,'' he said. ``It's been a wonderful life.''

<HEADLINE> A Glorious Day for Rose Parade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A parade of floats, horses and bands proclaiming a
message of promise and advancement for the 21st century marched past half a
million cheering spectators lined up Saturday for the annual Tournament of Roses
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunshine intermittently bathed the 5 1/2-mile procession, which was watched
by an estimated television audience of 365 million around the globe.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowd-pleasers included a float with a working roller coaster and flowery
depictions of fire-breathing dragons, the Statue of Liberty, 12-foot butterflies
and a pair of real-life newlyweds aboard a float depicting an elegant chapel
garden.
</P>
<P>
	   Parade watchers also bid farewell to the Y2K bug. A giant, dead bug was laid
out before a computer on one float complete with funeral flowers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've watched it on TV but there's nothing like being part of the actual
parade,'' said Richard Markson of San Diego. ``One float just outdoes another.''
</P>
<P>
	   Roy E. Disney, vice chairman of The Walt Disney Co. and the nephew of the
late Walt Disney, was grand marshal of the ``Celebration 2000: Visions of the
Future'' procession.
</P>
<P>
	   The parade also featured 26 equestrian units and 25 marching bands,
including those from college football Rose Bowl contenders -- Big 10 champion
University of Wisconsin and the Pacific-10's Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
	   And there was a dose of old-fashioned tradition.
</P>
<P>
	   A Missouri couple -- Neil Neumeyer and Leslie Ogle of Kansas City --
exchanged wedding vows before climbing onto Florists' Transworld Delivery's
``Promises for Tomorrow'' float. Doves circled the float during the procession.
</P>
<P>
	   Brimming with tulips, narcissus, hyacinths, lilies and roses, the float
featured cascading floral arrangements along a fountain-lined aisle stairway.
</P>
<P>
	   For many paradegoers, the parade was a giant slumber party to usher in 2000.
Thousands of people began staking out prime curbside locations 24 hours before
the start of the 111th edition of the parade.
</P>
<P>
	   A surprisingly strong rainstorm New Year's Eve cleared out during the night,
allowing some sunshine to splash on the parade route against the backdrop of the
towering San Gabriel Mountains. It was 40 degrees beneath the palms when the
parade started.
</P>
<P>
	   Claudia Borrelli traveled from Hales Corners, Wis., where it was 32 degrees
and cloudy Saturday morning, to see the parade and football battle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We brought the weather with us because our guys are used to playing in the
cold, none of this hot California stuff,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Youths emerge from NYC bunker after a week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - What do you get when you put six young people in a Times
Square "bunker" and give them sticks, tape, tree branches and a board game?
<P>
	   A survival backpack, which emerged Saturday along with the six who spent a
week holed up - ready to repopulate the world if a Y2K apocalypse wiped out the
human race.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got survival training that will last us the rest of our lives," said a
bleary-eyed Maureen Kyle, 19, of Westlake, Ohio, as she emerged from the
MTV-sponsored stunt, which was broadcast 24 hours a day on the Web.
</P>
<P>
	   Three men and three women were selected by the cable music channel to stay
in its millennium shelter from Dec. 26 to New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   The underground get-together was set up hundreds of feet below street level
in The New York Times building, a space once used for printing presses.
</P>
<P>
	   The "bunker-nauts" lived in three tornado shelters that were brought in,
including a kitchen and showers. The bedrooms were divided among two men, two
women and a co-ed unit. "There was no romance, but those two got ribbed about
that a lot," said Kyle.
</P>
<P>
	   One morning, "I realized on the Internet that someone had watched me sleep
all night. That was a bit odd," said Kyle.
</P>
<P>
	   They lived on ready-to-eat meals supplied by the Army. Each morning,
military trainers arrived to lead a round of drill exercises that included
pushups and situps.
</P>
<P>
	   Then they moved on to survival training.
</P>
<P>
	   "They learned what to do if the Earth were destroyed," said Allie Eberhardt,
executive producer of the Bunker Project.
</P>
<P>
	   That included making the backpack, from what was available in the bunker; a
jacket and sleeping bag were made from cutting up and sewing blankets.
</P>
<P>
	   They also learned how to trap wild animals, fashioning a trap from a noose
tied to a log.
</P>
<P>
	   And they were taught how to eke water out of a plant, by placing leaves in a
plastic bag, putting a rock at the bottom and letting the water drip. Then, a
pen became a drinking tube.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't really expect anything to happen because of Y2K, though I was
surprised there was no terrorism," said Kyle, a Fordham University student from
whose father is Cleveland St. Ignatius football coach Chuck Kyle.
</P>
<P>
	   MTV advertised for the team and chose the six from 300 applicants.
</P>
<P>
	   Video of their daily activities - including sleeping - was broadcast live on
MTV's Internet site. But their only contact with the world was through e-mails
they received from viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   "When they emerge, in the event that the rest of the population has been
wiped out in a millennial apocalypse, they will serve the planet as modern-day
Adams and Eves," MTV had said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, on Saturday, as city workers swept New Year's trash off Times
Square, the six walked out of the nearby Times building on West 43rd Street into
their first sunshine in a week.
</P>
<P>
	   They took along lessons in survival - and lessons in life.
</P>
<P>
	   "We learned we can work together when we have to survive," said Michael
Michael, a singer-actor-dancer who brought his guitar into the bunker.
</P>
<P>
	   "Patience!" said Michael when asked what they had learned. "This was a
mini-world, with its conflicts."
</P>
<P>
	   They had a common goal, said the young man from Central Islip, on Long
Island, "and when you have to survive, you learn respect, to work like a team.
There's no 'I' in 'team."'
</P>
<P>
	   As for their primary goal - saving the human race from Y2K - added Kyle,
"I'm not surprised the world didn't end."

<HEADLINE> Woman Held in Beatle's Break-In  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) -- A woman arrested inside George Harrison's Maui estate
a week before the former Beatle was stabbed in London was being held on $5,000
bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Cristin Keleher is scheduled to be arraigned on Jan. 11 on charges of
first-degree burglary and fourth-degree theft.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Ms. Keleher had been stalking Harrison. Don Carroll, who
manages the estate, said she had approached him in October and said she wanted
to meet Harrison.
</P>
<P>
	   After she was arrested Dec. 23, Ms Keleher told police she had walked into
the home through an open sliding glass door.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She said she had cooked a frozen pizza, drank a root beer soda, she was
doing her laundry and she had made a long-distance call to her mother in New
Jersey,'' officer Jeffrey Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison was stabbed in the chest by an intruder in his mansion near London
early Thursday. He was treated for a collapsed right lung.
</P>
<P>
	   The mother of the man accused in the stabbing was quoted in the Liverpool
Echo newspaper as saying her son had a history of mental problems and ``had
recently become obsessed'' with The Beatles. Michael Abram, 33, was charged with
attempted murder.

overtime shifts and forecasts of Armageddon, the only thing clear in the new
millennium Saturday was that New Jersey woke up in a fog.
<P>
	   Not in the computers. On the roads.
</P>
<P>
	   Soupy fog on several major highways slowed predawn and morning traffic
Saturday, forcing some drivers onto the shoulder along the New Jersey Turnpike
in central New Jersey, but traffic was sparse and no major accidents were
reported by the turnpike authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials working overtime Saturday, the first full day to monitor systems
for evidence of the Y2K computer bug, which experts say would result from the
failure of computers to recognize the start of the year 2000, said the feared
pest had yet to sting.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest question mark was what time would we send people home," said
Skip Sindoni, a spokesman for Public Service Electric &AMP; Gas.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's largest utility reported no gas or electricity disruptions,
detecting only routine, minor outages caused by accidents. PSE&AMP;G's three
reactors at the Artificial Island nuclear power complex in Salem County returned
to full capacity Saturday without incident. They had been running at reduced
power as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've experienced no Y2K problems. It was a very special night," said
Valarie McGonigal, a spokeswoman of Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Scheil, technology chief for Delta Corporate Services Inc. of
Parsippany, said his firm screened computers at several major firms and
pharmaceutical manufacturers. "It looks as if people have done their work
properly. The systems that needed to be fixed were fixed," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wendy Rayner, chief of computer operations for the state government, said
her staff working through the night Friday confirmed all was clear in government
databases handling everything from tax records to welfare payments.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are all very fortunate really because we all came through it," she said.
"The databases are functioning without any disruption."
</P>
<P>
	   Rayner said the final tests will come Sunday as staff members in various
state agencies test computer applications, like cutting checks, updating records
and executing transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   State Police Lt. Al Peters in the Emergency Operations Center in Ewing, said
the staff was reduced to minimum levels by midday Saturday. He added the biggest
threat so far was boredom.
</P>
<P>
	   Peters said the emergency center would remain on duty round-the-clock until
Tuesday to monitor computer systems, utilities and transportation. "Monday is
the first day we would see some small effects, if at all," as businesses reopen
and commuters return to work, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   NJ Transit, one of the nation's busiest rail and bus operations, restarted
its trains at 12:10 a.m. Saturday after a midnight break. Everything ran
smoothly for the balance of the day, according to spokeswoman Penny Bassett
Hackett.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think in this case, when you're talking about services for people,
and people's well-being, that you could over-prepare," said Hackett. The agency
invested $4 million to scare off Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
	   In a two-year overhaul of its 911 emergency communications, Newark also did
a bug scan. "We're proud to say that Newark entered the year 2000 without any
glitches," Mayor Sharpe James said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman, on the job New Year's Eve, gave up tentative plans
for a news conference Saturday to address emergencies. "There is very little
concern," said her spokesman, Peter McDonough.
</P>
<P>
	   Rayner said the state's overworked computer experts regarded Y2K Eve to be a
joyous occasion because their precautionary work paid off.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it is quiet and uneventful, they are recognized and get their own
reward," Rayner said.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson also laid claim to what
would appear to be the uncontestable as the first New Jersey birth of the
millennium. A spokeswoman there said Felicia Hernandez of Paterson delivered her
son Yordy at one second after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   On the business side Saturday, George Kuchtyak, an assistant manager at The
Home Depot in West Windsor, said no one was returning any generators, kerosene
heaters or flashlights Saturday. And stock was plentiful.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been no run on anything," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   One shopper, Barbara Russell of Bordentown, said she had purchased enough
bottled water to line her back porch. "It was nothing. Like any other New Year's
Eve," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Joan Hylton of Hamilton said her family stocked up on bottled water, canned
food, candles, charcoal and lighter fluid to allay the fears of their
16-year-old son. "It's not a waste. It's stuff we can always use," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marie Catana, supervisor at Marrazzo's Thriftway in Robbinsville, said the
store was remarkably empty Saturday, and that a feared Y2K bread shortage did
not occur. "I think everybody stayed in and is sleeping long this morning,"
Catana said.

<HEADLINE> Schulz Says Farewell to 'Peanuts'  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA JORDAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Snoopy, perched on his doghouse in front of his
typewriter, looks over a farewell message from creator Charles Schulz in the
last new daily ``Peanuts'' strip, running in newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz, 77, who has written, drawn, colored and lettered every ``Peanuts''
strip for almost 50 years, decided to retire after being diagnosed with colon
cancer in November. His contract stipulates that no one else will ever draw the
comic strip.
</P>
<P>
	   The single-panel farewell strip is primarily a text message, over Schulz's
signature, with the Snoopy drawing in the lower right corner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Dear Friends,'' Schulz writes. ``I have been fortunate to draw Charlie
Brown and his friends for almost 50 years. It has been the fulfillment of my
childhood ambition. Unfortunately, I am no longer able to maintain the schedule
demanded by a daily comic strip, therefore I am announcing my retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been grateful over the years for the loyalty of our editors and the
wonderful support and love expressed to me by fans of the comic strip.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them...''
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz's beloved cast of characters appear in 2,600 newspapers, reaching an
estimated 355 million readers daily in 75 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   A final new Sunday strip by Schulz will run in newspapers on Feb. 13. After
that, United Feature Syndicate will publish ``Peanuts'' reprints.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz, who is focusing on his health and family at home in Santa Rosa,
Calif., never expected the support he's be given by readers, who have sent him
400 to 500 pieces of mail a day, his secretary, Edna Poehner, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He just drew pictures. It's overwhelming for him,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Four Men Fulfill Pact Made in 1934  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Four men in their 80s came together from different
parts of the country on New Year's Eve to drink champagne on a street corner,
fulfilling a boyhood vow they made back in 1934.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixty-six years ago, the four pals pledged to meet on New Year's Eve 1999 at
the spot where they had their one and only run-in with the law. They even put it
down on paper.
</P>
<P>
	   When the four men came together on the street corner at 7 p.m. with their
wives and several other friends, they shouted with glee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A friend for that long is a friend forever,'' said John Quast, 80, the
only one still living in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   When they were around 15 or 16, the four were taken downtown in a police
wagon after they constructed a barricade to stop drivers on Halloween. When the
drivers stopped, the boys put boxes behind the cars. Then they threw eggs at the
drivers when they got out of their cars.
</P>
<P>
	   The four friends were separated soon after their vow but kept in touch.
Quast hadn't seen two of his pals, Stanley Goodsill of Ridgeland, S.C., and
Dudley Warner of San Diego, since shortly after World War II. But Willard
Allstrom of Rye, N.Y., still visited occasionally.
</P>
<P>
	   When Goodsill married in 1951, his wife, Penny, marveled that he still kept
the contract in his bureau. ``In this family, we keep our promises, and this
seemed like a really important one,'' Mrs. Goodsill.
</P>
<P>
	   That all four friends were able to make it to their old hangout was amazing.
The odds that all four men would survive to 80 or beyond were less than 1.5
percent, said Allstrom, 81, a retired insurance actuary.
</P>
<P>
	   Quast is a retired dentist. Goodsill, 81, was an accountant. Warner, 81,
managed wineries.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past 10 years, the friends kept mentioning the pact, though Warner
wasn't eager to return to Minnesota when it was minus-30, Quast said. (He got
lucky -- temperatures were in the 30s.)
</P>
<P>
	   ``Finally we kept sort of nagging each other and it happened,'' Quast said
Saturday. ``We didn't think we'd live long enough to have the event, but when
you're 15 or 16 years old, that seems like 2000 years'' away.
</P>
<P>
	   After dinner at a fancy restaurant, they gathered to tell old stories. They
were so wrapped up reminiscing that they didn't notice when the new year
arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   ``About a quarter after 12, we realized that it was midnight, and we did
open champagne,'' Quast said.
</P>
<P>
	   The group realizes the gathering is unlikely to repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we'll see all four together ever again,'' Quast said.

<HEADLINE> Father Kills Three Kids, Wife, Self  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   READING, Pa. (AP) -- A machine-shop foreman shot and killed his wife and her
three children on Saturday, then called 911 to admit to the slayings and
committed suicide, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies of Henry Peffer, 46, and his wife, Kimberly, 27, were found in a
breakfast nook in their modest brick home, said coroner John Lampros.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Peffer's three children -- ages 5, 8 and 15 -- were found together in
an upstairs bedroom, Lampros said. Two were dead when police arrived. The
youngest died at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Police described the murder weapon as a revolver.
</P>
<P>
	   When Peffer called 911, he told operators that he could not take it any more
and had just shot his family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He admitted to it, and then we lost contact,'' said Sandra Haller, a
supervisor at the Berks County emergency communication center in Reading.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever drove Peffer to murder his family remained a mystery to his
relatives and friends on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was always very happy and we had talked recently,'' said his brother,
Jim Orrs. ``Nothing seemed to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the couple had married a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The kids played outside all the time and everything seemed just fine,''
said Barbara Hoffman, who lives across the street. ``They had a Christmas tree
and were a very nice couple, always very nice to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors identified the children as Tiffany Schaffer, Dustin Kline and
Jerod Kline.
</P>
<P>
	   Melanie Shuker, 10, a neighbor and classmate of Dustin's said the boy had
complained that his father was strict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said that his dad would really, really yell at him if he didn't clean
his room,'' she said. ``When he talked about it, he seemed really scared and I
thought that was weird.''
</P>
<P>
	   The owner of the Edwin H. Zacharias Machine Works Co. in Reading, where
Peffer had worked for about 20 years and where his father worked before him,
said Peffer was ``normally very even-tempered'' and showed no sign of emotional
problems at work.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwin H. Zacharias Jr. recalled how Peffer had patiently cared for his
former wife before she died of a brain tumor several years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Garden Family Restaurant in Reading where Mrs. Peffer worked as a
waitress, manager Paul Houvadas said there were no outward signs of trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She seemed happily married,'' Houvadas said. ``Just the other day, they
were in here laughing and talking and he took her home.''

<HEADLINE> Mummers Hold 100th Annual Parade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a century-old Philadelphia tradition, grown men
donned sequined fabric, feathered costumes, silky dresses and wigs to march down
city streets in the annual Mummers Parade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's the great thing about New Year's Eve in Philadelphia,'' said Josh
Maurer, 18. ``You can party all night long and the next morning you got the
Mummers to look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
	   The New Year's Day parade evolved from European winter holiday customs of
masquerading and visiting friends. In the 1800s, masked revelers who went
door-to-door eventually organized into clubs, and in 1901 the city started
sponsoring the parade.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, the Mummers' route was altered to bring out more crowds, and most
people watching endorsed the change.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think a lot more people are here,'' said Lapreda Hendrix of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   The parade capped off Philadelphia's celebration of the transition to 2000
with 24 hourly events. Early morning parade-goers were joined by Mayor Edward G.
Rendell, who completed his pledge to attend all 24 events by donning blonde
pigtails and an extra-large dress at the parade.

<HEADLINE> Some New Jersey banks open to allay customer fears but report no  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Fred Olson had nothing to fear when he checked his
bank account at a Fleet ATM in Newark's Penn Station on Saturday.
<P>
	   "Everything's all there," the New York City man said as he waited for a
train to take him to Woodbridge, where he manages the American Mattress and
Furniture Store.
</P>
<P>
	   Several banks around New Jersey were open New Year's Day to allay customers'
fears that they would not have access to their accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit Bank, which operates 493 branches in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and
Connecticut, had most of those facilities open Saturday. None of those branches
reported any Y2K problems or unusual withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're continuing our assessment, but so far everything is functioning
properly," said Jean Kirshenbaum, a spokeswoman for the Princeton-based bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's automated teller machines, primed with extra cash, were reported
to be operating normally.
</P>
<P>
	   The drive-thru windows at Commerce Bank's 93 branches in New Jersey also
were open Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was nothing out of the ordinary at our MAC machines and the traffic
at the drive-thrus were slow," said David Flaherty, a spokesman for Cherry
Hill-based Commerce Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The Trust Company of New Jersey sailed through the New Year as well,
spokesman Steve Eichorn said. The Jersey City-based bank's 60 branches were
closed Saturday for the holiday, but 16 supermarket branches will open Sunday,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gerald H. Lipkin, chairman and chief executive of Valley National Bank, said
his employees tested the bank's computer system Saturday and "everything is
working fine."
</P>
<P>
	   The Wayne-based bank operates 118 branches in New Jersey. About two dozen
supermarket branches will be open Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lipkin said he expects those who made large bank withdrawals in a Y2K panic
will probably not redeposit that money. "They'll probably just deposit their
paychecks next week and spend use the cash they have for groceries and other
things," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about three or four customers made withdrawals of more than $50,000 in
the weeks prior to the turn of the century, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew we and the other banks were going to be Y2K compliant," Lipkin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But precautions were necessary, Lipkin and other industry spokespeople said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there was such a thing as overkill," Kirshenbaum said, noting
the systems needed to be fixed and tested, then retested. "We didn't have a
choice."

<HEADLINE> Crews Re-Erect Transmission Tower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEND, Ore. (AP) -- Bonneville Power Administration crews have re-erected and
returned to service a power line transmission tower toppled by vandals, the BPA
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The tower supported lines that carry surplus electricity from the Pacific
Northwest to California. No loss of service occurred because a computer
instantly switched the load to other lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The tower, which came down at 8:53 p.m. Thursday, was back in service at
7:32 p.m. Friday, BPA spokesman Perry Gruber said.
</P>
<P>
	   The culprits brought down the 80-foot tower by pulling bolts from the guy
wires that held it in place.
</P>
<P>
	   An FBI spokesman said there is no known motive. Area residents said several
beer cans were found at the scene about 25 miles southeast of Bend.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI agent Gordon Compton said there was nothing to indicate the incident was
related to the arrival of the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Communism Papers Sent to Cuba  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A pilot flew a small plane from Florida into Cuban airspace and
dropped anti-communism pamphlets on Havana, Customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Customs radar center in Long Beach, Calif., tracked the single-engine
plane once it left U.S. airspace after departing Tamiami Airport in Miami on
Saturday, said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His reason for going down was to drop leaflets, anti-communist leaflets in
multiple languages,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the man was flying the rented plane over Havana, the Cuban government
sent two MiG fighter jets to monitor his flight until he left Cuban airspace,
Sheehan said. The MiGs took no action, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The aircraft returned to Tamiami Airport about four hours after it left and
Customs officials detained the pilot for questioning. Sheehan identified him
only as a 51-year-old Asian.
</P>
<P>
	   The green paper pamphlets found scattered in some Havana neighborhoods
called on Cubans to launch a general strike against the communist government and
to seize radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The pamphlets were signed: ``Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary
Anti-Communist Forces of the World,'' followed by an illegible signature.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate response from Cuba's communist government to the
incident and none of the witnesses who spoke with The Associated Press reported
seeing Cuban jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   No charges had been filed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a regulation requiring him to notify our agency prior to him
coming into the United States, which he did not do,'' Sheehan said.

Skip Sindoni, a spokesman for Public Service Electric &AMP; Gas. Concern had been
growing over the past year that many computer systems would fail to recognize
the start of Year 2000, thus crashing programs that depended on accurate dates.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's largest utility reported no gas or electricity disruptions,
detecting only routine, minor outages caused by accidents. PSE&AMP;G's three
reactors at the Artificial Island nuclear power complex in Salem County returned
to full capacity Saturday without incident. They had been running at reduced
power as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've experienced no Y2K problems. It was a very special night," said
Valarie McGonigal, a spokeswoman of Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Scheil, technology chief for Delta Corporate Services Inc. of
Parsippany, said his firm screened computers at several major firms and
pharmaceutical manufacturers. "It looks as if people have done their work
properly. The systems that needed to be fixed were fixed," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wendy Rayner, chief of computer operations for the state government, said
her staff working through the night Friday confirmed all was clear in government
databases handling everything from tax records to welfare payments.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are all very fortunate really because we all came through it," she said.
"The databases are functioning without any disruption."
</P>
<P>
	   Rayner said the final tests will come Sunday as staff members in various
state agencies run computer applications, like cutting checks, updating records
and executing transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   State Police Lt. Al Peters in the Emergency Operations Center in Ewing, said
the staff was reduced to minimum levels by midday Saturday. He added the biggest
threat so far was boredom.
</P>
<P>
	   Peters said the emergency center would remain on duty round-the-clock until
Tuesday to monitor computer systems, utilities and transportation. "Monday is
the first day we would see some small effects, if at all," as businesses reopen
and commuters return to work, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   NJ Transit, one of the nation's busiest rail and bus operations, restarted
its trains at 12:10 a.m. Saturday after a midnight break. Everything ran
smoothly for the balance of the day, according to spokeswoman Penny Bassett
Hackett.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think in this case, when you're talking about services for people,
and people's well-being, that you could over-prepare," said Hackett. The agency
invested $4 million to scare off Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
	   In a two-year overhaul of its 911 emergency communications, Newark also did
a bug scan. "We're proud to say that Newark entered the year 2000 without any
glitches," Mayor Sharpe James said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman, on the job New Year's Eve, gave up tentative plans
for a news conference Saturday to address emergencies. "There is very little
concern," said her spokesman, Peter McDonough.
</P>
<P>
	   Rayner said the state's overworked computer experts regarded Y2K Eve to be a
joyous occasion because their precautionary work paid off.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it is quiet and uneventful, they are recognized and get their own
reward," Rayner said.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson also laid claim to what
would appear to be the uncontestable as the first New Jersey birth of the
millennium. A spokeswoman there said Felicia Hernandez of Paterson delivered her
son Yordy at one second after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   On the business side Saturday, George Kuchtyak, an assistant manager at The
Home Depot in West Windsor, said no one was returning any generators, kerosene
heaters or flashlights Saturday. And stock was plentiful.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been no run on anything," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   One shopper, Barbara Russell of Bordentown, said she had purchased enough
bottled water to line her back porch. "It was nothing. Like any other New Year's
Eve," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Joan Hylton of Hamilton said her family stocked up on bottled water, canned
food, candles, charcoal and lighter fluid to allay the fears of their
16-year-old son. "It's not a waste. It's stuff we can always use," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marie Catana, supervisor at Marrazzo's Thriftway in Robbinsville, said the
store was remarkably empty Saturday, and that a feared Y2K bread shortage did
not occur. "I think everybody stayed in and is sleeping long this morning,"
Catana said.

<HEADLINE> Spitzer makes mark in freshman year as AG  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Eliot Spitzer can seem more corporate than crusader.
He favors dark suits and crisp white shirts. He speaks in careful tones and
peppers his comments with legalese.
<P>
	   Yet in his first year as New York's attorney general, the Manhattan Democrat
has taken on targets ranging from gunmakers to Midwest polluters to General
Electric. He has waded into charged political debates over abortion and civil
rights. And he has irked a few people, the New York City Police Department's
brass and Pataki administration officials among them.
</P>
<P>
	   His cautious rhetoric and straight-laced veneer aside, Spitzer has engaged
in some tough fights.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes it can be a reasoned, temperate move to walk into the heat of a
battle," he explained during a year-end interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer won the AG's job last November from one-term Republican incumbent
Dennis Vacco, culminating years of politicking for the 40-year-old Harvard Law
School graduate.
</P>
<P>
	   After losing a Democratic primary for attorney general in 1994, Spitzer
criss-crossed the state in an effort to ingratiate himself to local Democrats.
He did breakfasts in Binghamton, lunches in Buffalo and countless dinners in
between.
</P>
<P>
	   The work paid off.
</P>
<P>
	   Running again in 1998 with the aid of his family's real estate fortune,
Spitzer won the Democratic nomination and went on to barely squeak by Vacco in a
general election upset. Vacco is now an executive with Waste Management Inc.,
the nation's largest owner and operator of garbage dumps.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Vacco before him, Spitzer has taken advantage of the AG's loose job
description to expand the office's duties beyond its core function of
representing the state in lawsuits. But while Vacco played to a Republican
constituency by casting himself as the state's top crimebuster, Spitzer quickly
went in a somewhat different direction.
</P>
<P>
	   On his first Monday in office, he restored employment protections for gays
that had been lifted by Vacco. Other moves followed: a reproductive rights unit
was formed and the existing bureaus handling civil rights, the Internet and the
environment were beefed up.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer lined up a staff of attorneys rich in Ivy League credentials and
public law experience. Spitzer said he essentially spent his first six months in
office as a "salesman" trying to attract lawyers. "The most important
accomplishment of the year, bar none, was bringing in the right people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the most noticeable hallmark of the Spitzer's freshman year remains the
aggressive - and sometimes creative - ways he's taken on an array of causes.
</P>
<P>
	   A Public Integrity Unit that investigates corruption among public officials,
for instance, derives authority on state statutes dating to the 19th century
reign of Boss Tweed.
</P>
<P>
	   With the potential threat of a lawsuit, Spitzer enticed gunmakers to talk
about a "code of conduct" for marketing their products. And he prepared a
lawsuit against coal burning power plants in the Midwest upwind from New York -
thereby circumventing a reliance on federal environmental officials, who
eventually took on the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Most recently, Spitzer jumped headfirst into the long-running controversy
over whether General Electric should be forced to dredge polychlorinated
biphenyls - or PCBs - it dumped into the upper Hudson River decades ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's lawsuit ostensibly seeks a cleanup of the far smaller Champlain
Canal, which merges with the river in spots. But the narrow lawsuit has the
broader aim of putting more pressure on General Electric to clean up the river.
</P>
<P>
	   Add to those high-profile moves a laundry list of other actions: a report
claiming that minorities are much more likely to be stopped and frisked by New
York City Police than whites; an agreement with online trading houses to fund
consumer education efforts; buffer zone litigation for abortion clinics;
proposed boxing reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Such public advocacy by attorneys general has been the norm at least since
the tenure of Republican Louis Lefkowitz, the self-proclaimed "people's lawyer."
But political scientist Gerald Benjamin, a dean at the State University of New
York at New Paltz, said Spitzer is notable for being an advocate on so many
fronts.
</P>
<P>
	   James Moore, former president of the New York State Bar Association, noted
that along with the lawsuits, Spitzer has also showed signs of being temperate.
For instance, Spitzer opted to talk to gunmakers instead of proceeding directly
with a lawsuit as some municipalities have done.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's probably a restrained activist who recognizes there are limits to what
he can accomplish," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's first-year performance has thrilled some interest groups,
particularly environmental activists who had felt left out in the cold during
Vacco's tenure. With the GE and power plant actions, Spitzer has developed a
"green" reputation that rivals Republican Gov. George Pataki's.
</P>
<P>
	   Ironically, while the GE lawsuit burnished Spitzer's reputation with
environmentalists, it upset Pataki administration officials who said it could
hinder the implementation of any federally driven cleanup plan for the Hudson
River.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the incident has been the only public discord in the relationship
between the state's lawyer and the governor he represents. Spitzer says he has a
good relationship overall with Pataki. He continues to represent the governor in
court and to work with him on policy issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a decent guy, a very easy guy to deal with," Spitzer said. "I call
him. He calls back."
</P>
<P>
	   Some tension between the two men is natural. Spitzer is relatively young and
demonstratively ambitious. His name has been batted about as a possible
Democratic candidate for governor in 2002, although he insists he is not looking
beyond his current job. If the voters allow it, he said "I'm staying here as far
into the future as I can see."

<HEADLINE> Woman Held in Beatle's Break-In  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) -- A woman arrested inside George Harrison's Maui estate
a week before the former Beatle was stabbed in London was being held on $5,000
bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Cristin Keleher, 27, is scheduled to be arraigned on Jan. 11 on charges of
first-degree burglary and fourth-degree theft.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Ms. Keleher had been stalking Harrison. Don Carroll, who
manages the estate, said she had approached him in October and said she wanted
to meet Harrison.
</P>
<P>
	   After she was arrested Dec. 23, Ms Keleher told police she had walked into
the home through an open sliding glass door.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She said she had cooked a frozen pizza, drank a root beer soda, she was
doing her laundry and she had made a long-distance call to her mother in New
Jersey,'' officer Jeffrey Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison was stabbed in the chest by an intruder in his mansion near London
early Thursday. He was treated for a collapsed right lung.
</P>
<P>
	   The mother of the man accused in the stabbing was quoted in the Liverpool
Echo newspaper as saying her son had a history of mental problems and ``had
recently become obsessed'' with The Beatles. Michael Abram, 33, was charged with
attempted murder.

Y2K Glitch Blinds Pentagon Computer

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. military spying system was blinded for three hours
at the start of the new year, the Pentagon said today, in what an official
called the "one significant problem" caused by a Y2K computer failure. A
computer that processes satellite reconnaissance data stopped working and

<HEADLINE> No Major Problems With U.S. Nuclear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's nuclear power plants hummed into the new
millennium Saturday without interruption of electricity or safety compromises,
but some nagging glitches, though not safety-related, caught public attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of the plants experienced problems that compromised safety systems or
disrupted the performance of the plants,'' said Bob Jasinski, a spokesman for
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   No sector of the energy industry attracted greater scrutiny among federal
planners for the Y2K rollover as the country's 103 commercial reactors.
Ninety-nine of the reactors were operating as the new year began.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson made clear he was worried about the
performance of reactors in former Soviet states, especially those in Ukraine,
the site of the Chernobyl catastrophe in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   But the transition came without incident in Russia and Ukraine, and almost
error-free in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, officials said Saturday that Y2K-related glitches were
reported by at least seven of the American reactors overnight, all involving
computer systems used for support functions and not plant operations of safety
devices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were very minor glitches,'' said Carl Pateriello, the NRC's deputy
director for operations. ``Most of them were corrected by rebooting the
system.'' He said they reflected the low threshold the NRC is using in requiring
Y2K incidents to be reported.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the NRC:
</P>
<P>
	   --At the Palo Verde nuclear reactor in California, a clock controlling
noncritical data displays did not synchronize properly with global positioning
satellites at midnight. It was quickly reset.

	   --At the Arkansas nuclear plant near Russellville, Ark., a post-midnight
check found a problem with computers that automatically track movement in and
out of radiation-controlled areas of the plant. A spokesman said the system
quickly was shifted to manual and corrected by a software change.
</P>
<P>
	   --At four reactors at three plants -- Indian Point and Nine Mile Point, both
in New York, and Millstone in Connecticut -- computers tracking weather data
failed briefly. There was no impact on operation of the plants.
</P>
<P>
	   --A display failed to portray monthly trend data at the Pilgrim plant in
Massachusetts. The problem was corrected within 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal regulators and industry representatives said the fact that such
incidents would get as much attention reflects the smooth Y2K transition of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Y2K computer bug has been rendered harmless,'' Ralph Beedle, a senior
vice president at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry trade group,
proclaimed in a statement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 30 hours preceding the new year, two reactors unexpectedly shut
down for non-Y2K reasons. The Catawba reactor in South Carolina had a turbine
problem, and the Limerick reactor in Pennsylvania had a transformer malfunction,
officials said. The two D.C. Cook reactors in Michigan previously had been shut
down.
</P>
<P>
	   Another reactor, the Vogtle Unit 2 near Augusta, Ga., resumed operation on
Friday after having problems restarting. It had been shut down Dec. 27 to make
some repairs.

<HEADLINE> Report: GM To Reopen Design Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- General Motors Corp., the only major automaker without a
design center in southern California, will re-establish a center in Los Angeles,
it was reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   GM, which closed its advanced design center in Newbury Park for budget
reasons in 1996, has lost market share and been criticized for stodgy styling.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's largest automaker will open a center in the Los Angeles area
early this year, sources in the industry told the Los Angeles Times. They spoke
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   GM began searching for studio space in Orange and Los Angeles counties
several months ago but has since ruled out an Orange County location, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The current generation Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds were designed
at the Newbury Park design center before it was closed.
</P>
<P>
	   The consensus among industry analysts is that GM "is struggling because of a
dull product line," said David Healy of Burnham Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronald L. Zarrella, president of General Motors North America, and GM design
chief Wayne K. Cherry are expected to announce the company's new design center
plans on Wednesday at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
	   GM representatives refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   California is important for automotive designers "because of its incredible
population diversity," said industry consultant Chris Cedergren of Nextrend in
Thousand Oaks. "Any auto manufacturer that wants to have a good understanding of
what's happening in a variety of markets has to be here."
</P>
<P>
	   He added: "Southern California is a true melting pot where you can get full
understanding of the whole U.S. market in a fairly small region."
</P>
<P>
	   The major automakers all have design centers in southern California,
including Ford and its Volvo Cars unit; both the Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler
operating units of DaimlerChrysler; the Japanese Big 5 of Toyota, Nissan, Honda,
Mitsubishi and Mazda; and Volkswagen and Bayerische Motoren Werke of Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, a number of independent studios often work for major
automakers.

<HEADLINE> Banks Sail Into New Century  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's banks and savings and loans reported no
problems as the calendar flipped to a new century. But they had an army of
computer experts working at facilities around the country Saturday to make sure
that all the sophisticated financial accounting equipment kept working.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the effort at the nation's 10,300 financial institutions was done
behind the scenes by special teams rechecking their account reconciliation
procedures to verify that the rollover from 1999 to 2000 did not cause any mixup
in customers' deposits.
</P>
<P>
	   A handful of banks opened for business on New Year's Day just to allay
depositors' fears about whether they could access their accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit Bank opened more than 400 of its branches in New Jersey, Pennsylvania
and Connecticut as a confidence booster, but officials reported no unusual
worries or large withdrawals by customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal regulators reported that three years of efforts and $9 billion spent
by banks to make sure the nation's financial system was ready had paid off.
</P>
<P>
	   "On the first day of the Year 2000, the nation's banks, thrifts and credit
unions are conducting business as usual," five federal regulatory agencies said
in a joint statement Saturday. "No significant disruptions from the century date
change have been detected."
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve reported that its check-clearing operations, which
process 68 million checks on a typical day, were operating normally. Currency
supplies, which had been increased by $80 billion to meet unexpected demands
since October, were "more than adequate to meet demand," the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's automated teller machines, primed with extra cash, were
reported to be operating normally as well.
</P>
<P>
	   To highlight the smooth transition, Donna Tanoue, chairwoman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits at the nation's financial
institutions, showed up at 8 o'clock Saturday morning at one ATM a block from
the White House to withdraw a $20 bill for the benefit of waiting television
cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am here to demonstrate what we said all along -- that years of hard work
by the banking industry is paying off," she said. "We are having a solid
transition to the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
	   And if someone finds that one of the nation's 227,000 ATM machines is not
working, Tanoue's advice was not to worry. She said 1 percent of ATM's at any
one time are not working.
</P>
<P>
	   "If people encounter an ATM that is down, they should do what they normally
do -- go find another one," she advised. "Don't assume it's a Y2K glitch."
</P>
<P>
	   Tanoue said that FDIC bank examiners would continue visiting individual
banks and receiving reports throughout the weekend, but that so far her agency
and the other federal banking agencies were finding nothing but a trouble-free
changeover.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. banking industry, which spent an estimated $9 billion updating
computer systems so they would not misread 2000 as 1900, had to meet a target of
having its systems ready six months ago. Federal bank examiners aggressively
went after stragglers to ensure 100 percent compliance by December.
</P>
<P>
	   While there had been concerns that banks in other nations could experience
problems that might have an impact in the United States, officials said that as
of Saturday no serious problems had developed.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup, the nation's largest financial service company, reported Saturday
that its 450 branches in the United States and operations in 100 countries were
all proceeding without Y2K troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Reserve officials at the central bank's command center wore special
red Y2K T-shirts to commemorate the event, presenting one to Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who stopped by for an update on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   Red was also the color choice for the T-shirts worn by bank tellers at City
National Bank in West Virginia, proclaiming "We're not afraid of Y2K." The bank
elected to keep 10 branches open through the night.
</P>
<P>
	   "We went through the night with no problems. Everything worked according to
plan," reported Jeff Legge, City National's Y2K information systems director.

   NORTH SMITHFIELD, R.I. (AP) -- Keith Klockars posed with his Harley-Davidson.
Sarah Fagan, 7, wore a pink dress. Four children stood in front carrying
placards that read ``2000.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 350 of North Smithfield's 10,000 residents huddled together on a town
street Saturday for a snapshot of their first hours in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people who didn't show up are going to be so disappointed,'' yelled
North Smithfield photographer Christine Keene, standing suspended above the
crowd on a fire-truck ladder.
</P>
<P>
	   People began gathering around noon, drinking hot chocolate and eating
cookies the town provided. They signed a keepsake book. Some carried chimes to
join the sounding of the town bell. As the shutter snapped, some people yelled
``Cheese!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a nice, friendly town where people have gotten to know each other,''
said Sue Kiernan.
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband, Paul, was less enthusiastic. ``My wife dragged me out,'' he
groused.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Mandeville, 55, the fourth generation of his family to live in the
former mill town, wanted to show his community spirit before he began his New
Year's Day celebrating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After this, we're going home to have a martini,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers were disappointed that just a fraction of the town participated.
But the four women who formed the town's millennium committee said they were
glad to have a picture to post at the North Smithfield Heritage Association
office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had bigger plans,'' said Louise Van Howe, ``but we're only four little
old ladies.''

   WHITEFISH, Mont. (AP) -- Four naked women streaking through a Montana ski
resort town triggered a riot early Saturday. Fifteen people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Chief William LaBrie said the riot began about 15 minutes into New
Year's Day when the women ran nude down Central Avenue. Officers caught and
arrested three of them on indecent exposure charges.
</P>
<P>
	   But more than 400 people spilled out of the surrounding bars and began
pelting police with bottles, snowballs, rocks and fireworks, LaBrie said.
</P>
<P>
	   The police called in help from the sheriff's department, the Montana Highway
Patrol, the U.S. Border Patrol and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad
Police.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 men arrested were released from jail Saturday morning as they sobered
up, police said, and the three streakers were freed on $150 bail each. As for
the fourth streaker, police said they had a good description.

	   PHOENIX (AP) -- A teen-ager was struck in the head by a rifle bullet fired
into the air by someone celebrating the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors removed the slug from the base of Gabriel Vergara Jr.'s skull, about
an inch above his spine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I felt like a baseball hit my head, then I realized I was shot,'' the
14-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabriel was shot early Saturday as he hugged his aunt in the yard of his
home, where they were trying to watch the downtown fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabriel said he felt lucky to be alive and was praying for the shooter.
``Just tell God I forgive him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In one Phoenix neighborhood, gunfire could be heard steadily for about two
minutes after midnight. Three men were arrested for shooting in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   During a special session of the Legislature last month, lawmakers failed to
pass a bill that would have made such random gunfire a felony.
</P>
<P>
	   In Houston, a woman seven months pregnant was struck in the neck by a stray
bullet that had been fired into the air on New Year's Eve. Leticia Delarosa, 22,
was in good condition, and the fetus was fine, police said.

	   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A dispatch terminal at Colorado's Y2K emergency
operations center flashed the wrong date at midnight Friday, but it was not Jan.
1, 1900 -- it was Feb. 6, 1936.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we rolled over to 2000, the terminal rolled over to that date,'' said
Polly White, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Office of Emergency Management.
``Which is kind of weird, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
	   The rollover to the year 2000 had raised concerns that some computers would
treat Jan. 1, 1999 as Jan. 1, 1900 -- not the 37th day of 1936.
</P>
<P>
	   The strange date did not affect communications and was still showing on the
terminal when the center at Camp George West was closed down at 10 a.m. MST, Ms.
White said. It was the only glitch to report all night.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials called Motorola, which made the terminal, and the company said no
similar problems had been reported. Ms. White said she had no idea why the date
appeared.

	   PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. (AP) -- Groundhog Day 2000 nearly fell victim to a
computer glitch on a Web site devoted to the annual rodent ritual.
</P>
<P>
	   The Web site of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club indicated Saturday morning

His annual appearance is said to determine whether spring is imminent or will
arrive after six more weeks of winter.
</P>
<P>
	   Groundhog Day is Feb. 2, or 32 days away, and the site correctly reflected
that after about 10 hours.

   MIAMI (AP) -- More than 400 would-be migrants packed shoulder-to-shoulder on
a small wooden boat had to be persuaded by Coast Guard crews to abandon ship
after the boat ran aground early Saturday about a mile from Key Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
	   All 406 Haitians and Dominicans eventually climbed voluntarily aboard Coast
Guard cutters, said Petty Officer Scott Carr. He said the group may have been at
sea on the 60-foot vessel for as long as five days.
</P>
<P>
	   The boat ran aground at 2:30 a.m. about 1 1/2 miles from the Cape Florida
Lighthouse and near Stiltsville, a cluster of homes built on pilings in Biscayne
Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   With low tide approaching, Coast Guard officers feared the boat would
capsize. But when the first Coast Guard cutter approached the boat, many of the
people on board refused to leave, Carr said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coast Guard officers boarded the boat, handed out life jackets to the
passengers and tried to explain that the boat was not safe. They told the
passengers that regardless of what happened, they would not be allowed to enter
the United States, he said.

	   By 1 p.m., all of the boat's passengers had been moved to five waiting Coast
Guard cutters.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Brazil Prison Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Riot troops stormed a prison in southeastern Brazil
on Saturday, ending a 60-hour rebellion by hundreds of inmates who demanded to
be transferred to other prisons.
</P>
<P>
	   An official at the Presidente Bernardes Penitentiary, 340 miles northwest of
Sao Paulo, said police killed two of the uprising's leaders and freed three
guards held hostage since Wednesday night, when the rebellion began.
</P>
<P>
	   Four prisoners were wounded, said the official, who asked not to be
identified and could not give further details on the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agencia Estado news agency said the two rebellion leaders were
threatening to stab the hostages to death when they were shot by police.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sao Paulo state prison official Lourival Gomes was quoted by the news
agency as saying that the two leaders planned to execute several rival inmates
and then the hostages. During the uprising, one prisoner was stabbed to death by
fellow inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had no other option. We had to storm the prison,'' Gomes was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the rebellion leaders demanded that 50 inmates be transferred to
other prison facilities in Sao Paulo state and in the states of Matto Grosso and
Goias. It was unclear if there were any other demands.
</P>
<P>
	   Close to 800 inmates are held at the penitentiary, which was built to hold
538.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebellion began when seven men armed with rifles and machine guns tried
to force their way into the penitentiary in an attempt to rescue 11 inmates, who
before the attack had cut through the iron bars of their cells with hacksaws and
were waiting in the prison yard.
</P>
<P>
	   The assailants fled when guards opened fire, but the would-be escapees then
seized four guards hostage and were quickly joined by more than 400 other
inmates to begin the uprising. The prisoners later released one of the guards.

U.S. Airlines Back At Full Service
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Y2K computer bug behind them, U.S. airlines ratcheted
back towards full schedules today, bracing for a post-holiday rush of leisure
travelers and a return to the skies by business fliers. United Airlines, the
nation's largest carrier, predicted tomorrow would be like a normal busy end to
a holiday weekend, after the carrier had cut its 2,400-flight schedule by 34
percent on New Year's Eve and 14 percent on New Year's Day. American Airlines
and Delta Air Lines, the next-largest carriers, were expecting similar increases
in volume today.

Y2K Glitch Blinds Pentagon Computer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. military spying system was blinded for three hours
at the start of the new year, the Pentagon said today, in what an official
called the "one significant problem" caused by a Y2K computer failure. A
computer that processes satellite reconnaissance data stopped working and
service was partially restored within "a few hours" by a backup system, said
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre. Hamre said the problem did not involve
America's strategic early warning defense systems.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- In the second week of a major drive to seize the
capital of rebel Chechnya, Russian forces on Saturday unleashed an exceptionally
fierce assault on Grozny, dropping scores of bombs on the city from low-flying
jets. Federal forces claimed progress against the rebels, but apparently were
still far from capturing the center of Grozny. Rebel fighters in heavily
fortified positions have inflicted steady losses on Russian forces. Maj. Gen.
Vadim Timchenko claimed 89 rebels were killed in Grozny on Friday and Saturday.
Timchenko said eight Russian servicemen were killed in the same period.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's biggest retailer,
relaunched its online store on New Year's Day with an expanded selection of
clothes, books and appliances, and personalized options like e-mail reminders
about anniversaries and birthdays. Though Wal-Mart has had a Web site for
several years, the revised version is expected to help the company take away
business from other retailers. Foremost, Wal-Mart will be able to leverage its
tremendous size by advertising its site in its stores and shopping circulars.

remaining. Purdues' Drew Brees threw for 378 yards and tied an Outback record

<HEADLINE> Woman Arrested in Bank Standoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. (AP) -- A woman's bank robbery-turned-hostage standoff ended
early Saturday when a bank employee knocked the gun from the woman's hand. No
shots were fired and no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Theng Nicki Siriboury, 24, was charged Saturday in federal court in Kansas
City, Kan., with one count of attempted bank robbery and one count of
brandishing a firearm at the Bank of America branch in suburban Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had nothing to lose,'' the woman had said in a phone call to KMBC-TV
during the standoff. ``I lost it all, lost my job, lost my family, lost it
all.''
</P>
<P>
	   The robbery attempt turned into a hostage situation when police arrived at
the bank just as Siriboury was leaving, FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman initially took six bank employees hostages while five other people
hid elsewhere in the bank. She released four of the hostages during the
eight-hour standoff. The people five hiding inside were able to slip out through
other doors.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before she was disarmed, the woman told the television station she
would release the remaining two hostages, a man and a woman, if she were allowed
to talk to a friend named Sean.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's when it all ends,'' the woman said. ``I want to talk to Sean
face-to-face first before I talk to anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two spoke over a phone line set up at police headquarters, Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Siriboury was arrested by an FBI SWAT team shortly after 1 a.m. when one
hostage knocked the gun out of her hand and another grabbed the gun and ran,
officials said. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials initially believed two women were involved but later said there
was only one hostage-taker.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Communism Papers Sent to Cuba  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A pilot flew a small plane from Florida into Cuban airspace and
dropped anti-communism pamphlets on Havana, Customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Customs radar center in Long Beach, Calif., tracked the single-engine
plane once it left U.S. airspace after departing Tamiami Airport in Miami on
Saturday, said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His reason for going down was to drop leaflets, anti-communist leaflets in
multiple languages,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the man was flying the rented plane over Havana, the Cuban government
sent two MiG fighter jets to monitor his flight until he left Cuban airspace,
Sheehan said. The MiGs took no action, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The aircraft returned to Tamiami Airport about four hours after it left and
Customs officials detained the pilot for questioning.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheehan said no charges would immediately be filed against the pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are investigating to determine if any laws or regulations have been
violated,'' said Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheehan said the 51-year-old pilot is an American citizen who arrived from
Vietnam in 1984. The man was identified by Miami television station WSVN as Ly
Tong.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong, a self-proclaimed ``freedom fighter,'' told WSVN he wants the Cuban
people to revolt against Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing is to try to encourage the Cuban people to rise
up and overthrow the Havana pirate,'' Tong said. He added that he wants to make
similar flights over China and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anywhere there is no justice, no freedom, I will come there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The green paper pamphlets found scattered in some Havana neighborhoods
called on Cubans to launch a general strike against the communist government and
to seize radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The pamphlets were signed: ``Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary
Anti-Communist Forces of the World,'' followed by an illegible signature.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate response from Cuba's communist government to the
incident.

<HEADLINE> Father Kills Three Kids, Wife, Self  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   READING, Pa. (AP) -- A machine-shop foreman shot and killed his wife and her
three children on Saturday, then called 911 to admit to the slayings before
committing suicide, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies of Henry Peffer Jr., 46, and his wife, Kimberly, 27, were found
in a breakfast nook in their modest brick home, said coroner John Lampros.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Peffer's three children from previous marriages -- identified by
neighbors as Tiffany Schaeffer, 12, Dustin Kline, 7, and Jarad Kline, 6 -- were
found together in an upstairs bedroom, Lampros said. Two were dead when police
arrived. The youngest died at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Police described the murder weapon as a revolver.
</P>
<P>
	   When Peffer called 911, he told operators that he could not take it any more
and had just shot his family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He admitted to it, and then we lost contact,'' said Sandra Haller, a
supervisor at the Berks County emergency communication center in Reading.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever drove Peffer to murder his family remained a mystery to his
relatives and friends on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was always very happy and we had talked recently,'' said his brother,
Jim Orrs. ``Nothing seemed to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the couple had married a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The kids played outside all the time and everything seemed just fine,''
said Barbara Hoffman, who lives across the street. ``They had a Christmas tree
and were a very nice couple, always very nice to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
	   Melanie Shuker, 10, a neighbor and classmate of Dustin's said the boy had
complained that his father was strict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said that his dad would really, really yell at him if he didn't clean
his room,'' she said. ``When he talked about it, he seemed really scared and I
thought that was weird.''
</P>
<P>
	   The owner of the Edwin H. Zacharias Machine Works Co. in Reading, where
Peffer had worked for about 20 years and where his father worked before him,
said Peffer was ``normally very even-tempered'' and showed no sign of emotional
problems at work.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwin H. Zacharias Jr. recalled how Peffer had patiently cared for his
former wife before she died of a brain tumor several years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Garden Family Restaurant in Reading where Mrs. Peffer worked as a
waitress, manager Paul Houvadas said there were no outward signs of trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She seemed happily married,'' Houvadas said. ``Just the other day, they
were in here laughing and talking and he took her home.''

Y2K Rollover Passes Smoothly
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking little time to savor an initial triumph over the
Y2K computer bug, Americans set their sights on ensuring an uneventful start to
the work week. The government double-checked computers today while some banks
staged a rare holiday opening in a show of confidence. After an aggressive sweep
coast to coast, U.S. officials found only a handful of glitches in essential
services like electricity and communications. A few flags went up: Seven nuclear
power plants reported minor computer problems, and the Pentagon disclosed that a
reconnaissance satellite had been blinded for a few hours.

boat ran aground on a sandbar early today about a mile from Key Biscayne. All
406 Haitians and Dominicans eventually climbed voluntarily aboard Coast Guard

NY Times Corrects Century-Old Error

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Normally punctilious about correcting its own errors, The
New York Times used the new millennium to fess up to a mistake that had appeared
on its front page every day for more than a century. Today's Times is actually
issue No. 51,254 -- not No. 51,754. Using a spreadsheet computer program,
24-year-old news assistant Aaron Donovan ran the numbers back to issue No. 1 on
Sept. 18, 1851, and discovered they added up to 500 fewer than had been thought.
Donovan then found that on Feb. 6, 1898, someone added 1 to 14,499 and came up
with 15,000 rather than 14,500.

<HEADLINE> Baruk Lobbies Rabbi on Syria Peace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Hours before departing for peace talks with Syria,
Israel's prime minister on Sunday visited an influential rabbi in an attempt to
win his support for a land-for-peace deal with the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak called on Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of
the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, at the rabbi's Jerusalem home, as a mark of
deference. Shas is the second biggest party in the government coalition and the
third biggest in parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Any peace treaty with Syria will have to be approved in parliament and in a
national referendum. The support of Shas is essential in the parliamentary vote,
and the rabbi's influence could be decisive in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   Yosef himself is a political moderate and has spoken out in favor of giving
up land to Israel's Arab neighbors if this will lead to a genuine peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of Shas, most of whom are immigrants from Arab and other Islamic
countries, tend to be suspicious of Arab intentions and are wary of returning
the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, many of them have said they will vote in favor of a
land-for-peace agreement with Syria if the rabbi says it is right. Shas leaders
have said Barak will have to convince Yosef that Israel will receive adequate
security guarantees if it withdraws from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak was scheduled to leave for the United States later Sunday for peace
negotiations with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa. Barak briefed Yosef
on matters connected with his upcoming meetings with the Syrian diplomat and
with President Clinton, Barak's office said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, Shas Cabinet Minister Eli Ishai said Yosef has not yet
decided whether to support withdrawal from the Golan, which Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   Signaling the importance that Barak attaches to Shas, the prime minister
yielded to the religious party's financial demands last week, when Shas was
threatening to quit the government over the budget bill. The Barak government
agreed to bail out the financially strapped Shas school network and to allocate
more funds to ministries controlled by Shas ministers.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman has also visited Yosef at his home in the
past month in an attempt to enlist his support for a land-for-peace deal with
Syria.

<HEADLINE> Asbestos Stigma Worries Mont.  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN GALLAGHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIBBY, Mont. (AP) -- Bob and Carrie Dedricks' children are so worried about
the hidden threat of asbestos in and around their parents' house that they won't
allow the Dedricks' seven grandchildren to visit.
</P>
<P>
	   So the Dedricks invited the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to take
dirt from the garden, air and dust from the house and test them for asbestos.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's find out, let's find out,'' Dedrick told Montana Gov. Marc Racicot
when he came to the house to talk about the couple's fears.
</P>
<P>
	   Libby, tucked away in Montana's mountainous northwest corner, is a
blue-collar timber and mining town at heart, and it's taken some hard punches in
the past decades as those industries tumbled. But with the Cabinet Mountains
Wilderness out its back door and the Kootenai River hardly a fly-cast away, the
town has worked hard to become a vacation destination and a place for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, with its efforts starting to bear fruit, the town has been shaken by
reports that asbestos from an old vermiculite mine killed nearly 200 people,
sickened hundreds of others and may pose a continuing health threat. Town
boosters fear they are being knocked to their knees once again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of mixed emotions right now,'' said Linda Beaulieu,
executive director of the Libby Area Chamber of Commerce. ``There is much
compassion for these families that are ill, but a lot of people feel the facts
aren't on the table. Let's not condemn our entire town that has worked so hard
to get a place on the map.''
</P>
<P>
	   Business leaders complain there is a perception that the streets are coated
with asbestos from the W.R. Grace and Co. mine, which closed nearly 10 years
ago, and that sickness is everywhere in the town of 2,700 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Newspapers in Montana and Washington state reported the asbestos issue in
November, quoting medical authorities, survivors of asbestosis victims and
people now suffering the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports prompted a series of environmental tests that will continue at
least into next spring. State officials say that until complete test results are
in, they won't know the extent of the health risk, if any.
</P>
<P>
	   Racicot, 51, who lived in Libby for his first 18 years, promised that the
state and federal governments will answer the health concerns of Libby
residents, determine the extent of asbestos contamination and do something about
it. He also plans to get a chest X-ray.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing here is determining facts,'' he said. ``If there
is a public health problem or a problem with an individual family or house, they
have to get it exposed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Racicot also said he wants to know whether state health and environmental
officials, as some critics have alleged, knew of the danger in Libby and turned
a blind eye.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Michael Spence, the state's chief medical officer, estimated that 300
people in the Libby area have been diagnosed with asbestosis, but he disputed
news reports that put the number of asbestos-related deaths at almost 200. He
said the number is less than 100 statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   For Irene Sirey, statistics are less important than the safety of her
grandchildren. She recently bought a house and had started renovating it when
the asbestos concerns arose. Behind a door in a closet was a blanket of
insulation, just like the mineral suspected of being laced with asbestos. The
clumpy insulation was seeping from a wall socket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very concerned for my grandkids; I have them in the summer,'' said
Sirey, who plans to wait for results of EPA tests on samples taken from her home
before continuing with remodeling.
</P>
<P>
	   Libby is steeling itself against an image problem that could dampen business
recruitment and real estate prices in a town where $75,000 to $90,000 still buys
a three-bedroom house.
</P>
<P>
	   Irene Loveless of Loveless Realty said three out-of-state clients who
anticipated moving here changed their minds immediately after the news coverage.
They were worried about asbestos.	   ``What can we tell them, except that until
the tests are complete, we don't know if there's any danger?'' said Loveless, a
40-year resident.
</P>
<P>
	   Off the beaten path yet still positioned to catch some of the traffic
heading to and from Glacier National Park, Libby is prominent on the maps of
fishermen who come from around the country and abroad, drawn by the Kootenai
River's bull trout, westslope cutthroat trout and native rainbows. Kootenai
Angler, an outfitter, already has summer bookings and co-owner Tammy Blackburn
doesn't expect the asbestos issue to hurt business.
</P>
<P>
	   If Libby's image takes a hit, it will be short-term, said Gayla Benefield, a
leading supporter of the asbestos investigation. Her father was a former Grace
mine worker who died in 1974 of asbestos exposure, at age 62. Benefield said her
mother, also deceased, suffered secondary exposure from the asbestos dust that
her husband wore home from the mine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've got to weigh the possibility that asbestos contamination is an
ongoing situation, and weigh the cost of lives compared to tourist dollars,''
Benefield said. ``If there is a problem, let's find it and solve it.''
</P>
<P>
	   State tourism director Matthew Cohn said Montana has withstood a series of
image blows -- the Unabomber, the Freemen, the killing of bison wandering out of
Yellowstone National Park. Those controversies had no impact on tourism, he
said, and he doesn't anticipate a setback in Libby.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the outcome of the asbestos testing, Libby will not rise or fall
with industries such as tourism and retirement, said state Sen. Bill Crismore, a
Libby Republican. He still hopes for a comeback by mining, logging and wood
processing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would take forever to build a tourism industry that would support us as
we were supported by natural resources,'' Crismore said.

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A pilot flew a small plane from Florida into Cuban airspace and
dropped anti-communism pamphlets on Havana, Customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Customs radar center in Long Beach, Calif., tracked the single-engine
plane once it left U.S. airspace after departing Tamiami Airport in Miami on
Saturday, said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His reason for going down was to drop leaflets, anti-communist leaflets in
multiple languages,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the man was flying the rented plane over Havana, the Cuban government
sent two MiG fighter jets to monitor his flight until he left Cuban airspace,
Sheehan said. The MiGs took no action, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The aircraft returned to Tamiami Airport about four hours after it left and
Customs officials detained the pilot for questioning.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheehan said no charges would immediately be filed against the pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are investigating to determine if any laws or regulations have been
violated,'' said Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Customs officials identified the pilot as Ly Tong, a 51-year-old American
citizen who arrived from Vietnam in 1984. He lives in New Orleans and was
visiting friends in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong, a self-proclaimed ``freedom fighter,'' told Miami television station
WSVN he wants the Cuban people to revolt against Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing is to try to encourage the Cuban people to rise
up and overthrow the Havana pirate,'' Tong said. He added that he wants to make
similar flights over China and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anywhere there is no justice, no freedom, I will come there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The green paper pamphlets found scattered in some Havana neighborhoods
called on Cubans to launch a general strike against the communist government and
to seize radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The pamphlets were signed: ``Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary
Anti-Communist Forces of the World,'' followed by an illegible signature.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate response from Cuba's communist government to the
incident.

<HEADLINE> Barak Lobbies Rabbi on Syria Peace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Hours before departing for peace talks with Syria,
Israel's prime minister on Sunday visited an influential rabbi in an attempt to
win his support for a land-for-peace deal with the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak called on Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of
the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, at the rabbi's Jerusalem home, as a mark of
deference. Shas is the second biggest party in the government coalition and the
third biggest in parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Any peace treaty with Syria will have to be approved in parliament and in a
national referendum. The support of Shas is essential in the parliamentary vote,
and the rabbi's influence could be decisive in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   Yosef himself is a political moderate and has spoken out in favor of giving
up land to Israel's Arab neighbors if this will lead to a genuine peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of Shas, most of whom are immigrants from Arab and other Islamic
countries, tend to be suspicious of Arab intentions and are wary of returning
the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, many of them have said they will vote in favor of a
land-for-peace agreement with Syria if the rabbi says it is right. Shas leaders
have said Barak will have to convince Yosef that Israel will receive adequate
security guarantees if it withdraws from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak was scheduled to leave for the United States later Sunday for peace
negotiations with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa. Barak briefed Yosef
on matters connected with his upcoming meetings with the Syrian diplomat and
with President Clinton, Barak's office said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, Shas Cabinet Minister Eli Ishai said Yosef has not yet
decided whether to support withdrawal from the Golan, which Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   Signaling the importance that Barak attaches to Shas, the prime minister
yielded to the religious party's financial demands last week, when Shas was
threatening to quit the government over the budget bill. The Barak government
agreed to bail out the financially strapped Shas school network and to allocate
more funds to ministries controlled by Shas ministers.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman has also visited Yosef at his home in the
past month in an attempt to enlist his support for a land-for-peace deal with
Syria.

<HEADLINE> Murder-suicide by mother suspected in 4 deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MAHOPAC, N.Y. (AP) - A woman deliberately left a car running to poison
her husband and children with carbon monoxide, then shot them in their beds and
killed herself with a shotgun, police said Saturday.
<P>
	   The family Subaru was still idling in the garage when police found the
bodies, more than a day after the deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman, JoAnn Gelsomino, 47, left a suicide note but there was no clear
motive, said Detective Randy Tompkins of the Town of Carmel police force, which
covers the hamlet of Mahopac where the killings occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   "She was just in that frame of mind that she decided to end it and take her
husband and children with her," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary investigation by a coroner determined that although all four
family members suffered shotgun wounds, blood tests indicated that carbon
monoxide poisoning was the principal cause of death for the husband, Ralph
Gelsomino, 59, and the two grown children, Amanda, 26, and Anthony, 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on that information, police believe Mrs. Gelsomino started up the
Subaru early Thursday, while her family slept, and waited until they were at
least unconscious before making sure they were dead by shooting them.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they had just been sleeping, then the first shots would have awakened
the others, but they were all still in their beds," Tompkins said.
</P>
<P>
	   The garage is within the house, directly under the bedrooms, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tompkins would not divulge the wording of the suicide note, but he said it
helped the police reconstruct the killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were alerted Friday afternoon that Amanda Gelsomino had not shown up
for two days at her job at a veterinarian's office. When they went to the house,
in a hilly, wooded neighborhood, they found that each family member had been
shot at close range and the shotgun was near the mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Tompkins said the 50-year-old split-level house was in good repair, both
children had attended college and there were five cars at the house, so he
doubted any financial motive.
</P>
<P>
	   A neighbor, Lynn Ciancimino, said that until recently, Mrs. Gelsomino worked
two jobs: days at a Jefferson Valley bank and nights at a gas station. Her
husband was about to retire from his job with a lighting manufacturer in Mount
Vernon, the neighbor said, and the family had planned to leave town.
</P>
<P>
	   "She said, 'Now I'll finally have some weekends free,"' the neighbor said.

<HEADLINE> Man Plans To Live Year Online  </HEADLINE>
   By TROY GOODMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- In an effort to prove how wired the world has become, a
26-year-old former computer systems manager walked into an empty Dallas house on
Saturday with a laptop computer and said he doesn't plan to leave until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   His plan: live exclusively online, including ordering food, furniture and
clothes and hosting a 24-hour live video feed of his life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our vision is that new online shoppers will go to our site to learn how to
utilize e-commerce,'' said Mitch Maddox, who legally changed his name to
DotComGuy and set up a company, DotComGuy Inc., for the stunt.
</P>
<P>
	   After locking himself inside the rented house Saturday, he added: ``I'm
going to come out being a loon.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ``live'' part of the DotComGuy stunt involves 24-hour streaming video
from dozens of digital cameras set up throughout the house. One camera points at
the kitchen, several face the living room, and one even sits on a bathroom shelf
-- turned away from the toilet and bathtub.
</P>
<P>
	   The DotComGuy project, which sounds like a cross between the
enviro-colonization experiment Biosphere and the film ``EdTV,'' has a few ground
rules. Maddox can have visitors. He simply can't go farther than the back yard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We certainly don't recommend that people lock themselves away from the
world, but we will prove that it can be done,'' said Len Critcher, a friend of
Maddox's and president of DotComGuy Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Maddox's first monthly paycheck from the company will be $24, but it will
double every month as an incentive to stay in the house, Critcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Critcher helped line up sponsors to sustain Maddox through the year,
including Gateway, which donated the laptop, and Peapod.com, which agreed to
keep the house stocked with groceries.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas-based service911.com jumped on board when it realized its PC services
company could benefit from a little live, online exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going to have people say, 'Hey, DotComGuy, how do I install a brand
new modem or how do I get this or that Web site?''' said service911.com's Jeff
Lipschultz. ``And when he uses our site, that's how people will learn about
us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Similar experiments have been undertaken before -- ``Good Morning America''
housed two New Yorkers in an ``e-cave'' for a week last year with a
refrigerator, a $500 daily stipend, a computer and Internet access -- but Maddox
has vowed to live off e-commerce longer than anyone else has so far.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday afternoon, the Web site video showed Maddox sitting on the floor of
an empty room chatting online with visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his first buys online buys: shampoo, toilet paper, cleaning supplies
and carry-out food.

<HEADLINE> Mother Suspected in Murder-Suicide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAHOPAC, N.Y. (AP) -- A woman deliberately left a car running to poison her
husband and children with carbon monoxide, then shot them in their beds and
killed herself with a shotgun, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The family car was still idling in the garage when police found the bodies
Friday, more than a day after the deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   JoAnn Gelsomino, 47, left a suicide note, but there was no clear motive,
Town of Carmel Police Detective Randy Tompkins said Saturday. He wouldn't
divulge the contents of the note but said it helped police reconstruct the
killings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was just in that frame of mind that she decided to end it and take her
husband and children with her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary investigation by a coroner determined that although all four
family members suffered shotgun wounds, carbon monoxide poisoning was the
principal cause of death for the husband, Ralph Gelsomino, 59, and the two grown
children, Amanda, 26, and Anthony, 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on that information, police believe Mrs. Gelsomino started the car
early Thursday while her family slept, then waited until they were unconscious
before shooting them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they had just been sleeping, then the first shots would have awakened
the others, but they were all still in their beds,'' Tompkins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police checked the house Friday afternoon after the veterinarian's office
where Amanda Gelsomino worked reported that she had not reported for work for
two days and no one could reach her.

<HEADLINE> Nuremberg Lawyer Dies at Age 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Thomas Francis Lambert Jr., who prosecuted Nazi war criminals
as a trial lawyer for the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, died at
his Boston home Wednesday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   During the post-World War II Nuremberg trials, Lambert helped prepare the
case against the Nazi Party that accused it of being a criminal organization. He
also helped to prosecute Martin Bormann, one of Hitler's closest aides.
</P>
<P>
	   Bormann, tried in absentia, was found guilty and condemned to death. He was
never found, and a skeleton unearthed in Berlin in 1972 was determined with near
certainty to be his.
</P>
<P>
	   Lambert was asked to join the team of American prosecutors at the principal
Nuremberg Trial by Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, who led the team.
</P>
<P>
	   Lambert graduated from Oxford University, attended Yale Law School as a
Sterling Fellow, and, at age 26, became dean of Stetson University College of
Law in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   He also taught at Boston University School of Law for nine years and at
Suffolk University Law School in Boston for 27 years, until May.
</P>
<P>
	   He had a long association with the American Trial Lawyers Association, and
became editor of the group's law journal and other publications in 1955, serving
for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Lambert is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Branon Lambert; a brother, Owen
Lambert; and a sister, Margaret Teagle.

<HEADLINE> TV Networks Mix Y2K, News Coverage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A misty-eyed Peter Jennings signed off his nearly 24-hour
marathon on ABC at 4 a.m. Saturday, capping a day of television coverage that
was more about celebrations than actual news.
</P>
<P>
	   For all the preparation and worry about Y2K-related catastrophes, TV
networks spent the bulk of their time showing fireworks, confetti and hugs.
</P>
<P>
	   By Saturday, major broadcasters returned to traditional New Year's fare --
parades and footballs -- while the cable news networks were left to clean up:
CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC all showed pictures of street-sweepers in New
York's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
	   And already some of the second-guessing was beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   "Was this over-hyped?" asked Soledad O'Brien on MSNBC while interviewing an
airline safety expert.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennings had begun at 4:50 a.m. Friday anchoring ABC's all-day coverage, a
showcase for stars like Barbara Walters in Paris, Charles Gibson in London and
Cokie Roberts in Rome. The dearth of Y2K news made it occasionally slow-going.
</P>
<P>
	   His marathon was fodder for good-natured jokes on other networks. CBS's
David Letterman said he wanted to check how Jennings was doing, then the camera
switched to a picture of a dummy lying face-down on a desk, surrounded by empty
coffee cups.
</P>
<P>
	   When musician Kenny G complimented Jennings for his endurance at Hour 18,
Jennings replied, "We're standing up, that's the main thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Jennings ended his broadcast by touring the control room at ABC's Times
Square studio, thanking people by name and introducing a two-minute montage of
New Year's celebrations around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC, NBC and CBS reported a glitch-free evening. C-SPAN's screen twice went
blank earlier Friday while covering First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, but the
network said the problem wasn't Y2K-related.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the end, we could not have been more pleased," said ABC News spokeswoman
Eileen Murphy. "It was extraordinary."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC spent far more than its rivals to put together its millennium coverage.
It was not immediately known whether the investment paid off in viewership:
Nielsen Media Research ratings weren't available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS went the other extreme, and was largely missing in action. Other than a
regular edition of the "CBS Evening News," Dan Rather was glimpsed only in
30-second updates. CBS had planned to air mostly entertainment on New Year's
Eve, and a spokeswoman said it saw no reason to change its plans.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC struck a middle ground, with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric anchoring
coverage that began at 9 p.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The global wave of New Year's observances, beginning at 5 a.m. EST in the
South Pacific, made some announcers nearly giddy. Moments before 11 p.m. EST, a
Fox News Channel anchor announced deliriously, "It's about to be New Year's
somewhere just east of where we are!"
</P>
<P>
	   "They're in a party mood," Dick Clark said on ABC after his traditional
countdown from Times Square.
</P>
<P>
	   News networks reported some minor Y2K glitches on Saturday, but CNN's
Natalie Allen said that the world had "breathed a collective sigh of relief."
</P>
<P>
	   "Despite all the hype, the world looks pretty much the same today as it did
yesterday," said her colleague, Jonathan Mann.

<HEADLINE> No Major Problems With U.S. Nuclear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's nuclear power plants hummed into the new
millennium Saturday without interruption of electricity or safety compromises,
but some nagging glitches, though not safety-related, caught public attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of the plants experienced problems that compromised safety systems or
disrupted the performance of the plants,'' said Bob Jasinski, a spokesman for
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   No sector of the energy industry attracted greater scrutiny among federal
planners for the Y2K rollover as the country's 103 commercial reactors.
Ninety-nine of the reactors were operating as the new year began.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson made clear he was worried about the
performance of reactors in former Soviet states, especially those in Ukraine,
the site of the Chernobyl catastrophe in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   But the transition came without incident in Russia and Ukraine, and almost
error-free in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, officials said Saturday that Y2K-related glitches were
reported by at least seven of the American reactors overnight, all involving
computer systems used for support functions and not plant operations of safety
devices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were very minor glitches,'' said Carl Pateriello, the NRC's deputy
director for operations. ``Most of them were corrected by rebooting the
system.'' He said they reflected the low threshold the NRC is using in requiring
Y2K incidents to be reported.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the NRC:
</P>
<P>
	   --At the Palo Verde nuclear reactor in California, a clock controlling
noncritical data displays did not synchronize properly with global positioning
satellites at midnight. It was quickly reset.
</P>
<P>
	   --At the Arkansas nuclear plant near Russellville, Ark., a post-midnight
check found a problem with computers that automatically track movement in and
out of radiation-controlled areas of the plant. A spokesman said the system
quickly was shifted to manual and corrected by a software change.
</P>
<P>
	   --At four reactors at three plants -- Indian Point and Nine Mile Point, both
in New York, and Millstone in Connecticut -- computers tracking weather data
failed briefly. There was no impact on operation of the plants.
</P>
<P>
	   --A display failed to portray monthly trend data at the Pilgrim plant in
Massachusetts. The problem was corrected within 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal regulators and industry representatives said the fact that such
incidents would get as much attention reflects the smooth Y2K transition of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Y2K computer bug has been rendered harmless,'' Ralph Beedle, a senior
vice president at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry trade group,
proclaimed in a statement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 30 hours preceding the new year, two reactors unexpectedly shut
down for non-Y2K reasons. The Catawba reactor in South Carolina had a turbine
problem, and the Limerick reactor in Pennsylvania had a transformer malfunction,
officials said. The two D.C. Cook reactors in Michigan previously had been shut
down.
</P>
<P>
	   Although federal officials in Washington described the Catawba problem as
turbine-related, a spokeswoman for plant operator Duke Power said late Saturday
that the cause still had not been determined conclusively. Plant officials were
``investigating to determine if it is indeed a turbine-related problem,'' Guynn
Savage said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another reactor, the Vogtle Unit 2 near Augusta, Ga., resumed operation on
Friday after having problems restarting. It had been shut down Dec. 27 to make
some repairs.

Few Y2K Glitches Reported So Far
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The new millennium dawned this morning and the world's
computers hummed along as if it were just another day, the feared Y2K bug barely
noticeable. Although the Pentagon disclosed today that it was unable to process
information from a reconnaissance satellite system last night because of a Y2K
computer glitch on the ground. A French defense satellite system also lost the
ability to detect equipment failure after midnight, although it still was
operating. Only a few other sporadic glitches popped up, while experts warned
that it could take days, weeks or months before problems are discovered.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- After the biggest world party in history, the first day of
the year 2000 was a time for many cities to put everything back in order. Once
the fireworks and singing and dancing were over, and the multimillion-strong
crowds from Rome to Rio de Janeiro had scattered, cleanup crews moved in. London
estimated its litter at four times the normal amount, 15 percent of it empty
champagne bottles. There were 35 tons of garbage to remove from the streets
around New York's Times Square.

India, Pakistan Trade Accusations

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistani officials pledged Saturday to arrest
five Indian Airlines hijackers if they enter the country, but the officials
denied India's claim that the hijackers are already there. India said the
hijackers are from Pakistan and have quietly slipped back into their homeland.
Pakistan said it was on "high alert" to prevent the gang from entering its
territory. The hijackers fled the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Friday
after releasing 155 hostages who they had held on board a plane for eight days.
In return, the hijackers won the release of three Muslim militants jailed in
India.

Barak Lobbies Rabbi on Syria Peace

	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Hours before departing for peace talks with Syria,
Israel's prime minister on Sunday visited an influential rabbi in an attempt to
win his support for a land-for-peace deal with the Arab nation. Prime Minister
Ehud Barak met with Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party. Shas is the second biggest party in the government
coalition. Any peace treaty with Syria will have to be approved in parliament
and in a national referendum. The support of Shas is essential in the
parliamentary vote, and the rabbi's influence could be decisive in the
referendum.

today with a laptop computer and said he doesn't plan to leave until 2001. His
plan: live exclusively online, including ordering food, furniture and clothes
and hosting a 24-hour live video feed of his life. Mitch Maddox legally changed
his name to DotComGuy for the stunt. Len Critcher, a friend of Maddox's and
president of DotComGuy Inc. helped line up sponsors, including Gateway, which
donated the laptop, and Peapod.com, which agreed to keep the house stocked with
groceries.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Communism Papers Sent to Cuba  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A pilot flew a small plane from Florida into Cuban airspace and
dropped anti-communism pamphlets on Havana, Customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Customs radar center in Long Beach, Calif., tracked the single-engine
plane once it left U.S. airspace after departing Tamiami Airport in Miami on
Saturday, said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His reason for going down was to drop leaflets, anti-communist leaflets in
multiple languages,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the man was flying the rented plane over Havana, the Cuban government
sent two MiG fighter jets to monitor his flight until he left Cuban airspace,
Sheehan said. The MiGs took no action, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The aircraft returned to Tamiami Airport about four hours after it left and
Customs officials detained the pilot for questioning.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheehan said no charges would immediately be filed against the pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are investigating to determine if any laws or regulations have been
violated,'' said Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Customs officials identified the pilot as Ly Tong, a 51-year-old American
citizen who arrived from Vietnam in 1984. He lives in New Orleans and was
visiting friends in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong, a self-proclaimed ``freedom fighter,'' told Miami television station
WSVN he wants the Cuban people to revolt against Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing is to try to encourage the Cuban people to rise
up and overthrow the Havana pirate,'' Tong said. He added that he wants to make
similar flights over China and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anywhere there is no justice, no freedom, I will come there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The green paper pamphlets found scattered in some Havana neighborhoods
called on Cubans to launch a general strike against the communist government and
to seize radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The pamphlets were signed: ``Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary
Anti-Communist Forces of the World,'' followed by an illegible signature.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate response from Cuba's communist government to the
incident.

<HEADLINE> Father Kills Three Kids, Wife, Self  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   READING, Pa. (AP) -- A machine-shop foreman shot and killed his wife and her
three children on Saturday, then called 911 to admit to the slayings before
committing suicide, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies of Henry Peffer Jr., 47, and his wife, Kimberly, 27, were found
in a breakfast nook in their modest brick home, said coroner John Lampros.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Peffer's three children from previous marriages -- identified by
neighbors as Tiffany Schaeffer, 12, Dustin Kline, 7, and Jarad Kline, 6 -- were
found together in an upstairs bedroom, Lampros said. Two were dead when police
arrived. The youngest died at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Police described the murder weapon as a revolver.
</P>
<P>
	   When Peffer called 911, he told operators that he could not take it any more
and had just shot his family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He admitted to it, and then we lost contact,'' said Sandra Haller, a
supervisor at the Berks County emergency communication center in Reading.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever drove Peffer to murder his family remained a mystery to his
relatives and friends on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was always very happy and we had talked recently,'' said his brother,
Jim Orrs. ``Nothing seemed to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the couple had married a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The kids played outside all the time and everything seemed just fine,''
said Barbara Hoffman, who lives across the street. ``They had a Christmas tree
and were a very nice couple, always very nice to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
	   Melanie Shuker, 10, a neighbor and classmate of Dustin's said the boy had
complained that his father was strict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said that his dad would really, really yell at him if he didn't clean
his room,'' she said. ``When he talked about it, he seemed really scared and I
thought that was weird.''

<HEADLINE> Church Leaders To Meet For Cuba Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Two leaders of the National Council of Churches planned to meet
Monday with the father of a 6-year-old boy to support the effort to have the
child returned to Cuba from the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell and the Rev. Oscar Bolioli were to meet in
Havana and Cardenas with Juan Miguel Gonzalez. The council, which represents
some Protestant and Orthodox Christian denominations, contends that Gonzalez has
the sole right to claim his son.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just want to help the boy get back to his dad,'' council spokeswoman
Carol Fouke said. The group is working with the Cuban Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was discovered Thanksgiving Day, lashed to an inner tube off the
Florida coast after spending two days at sea. He was one of three survivors from
a boat that sank, killing his mother and stepfather.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been staying with relatives in Miami. They are refusing to return
him to Cuba, saying his mother wanted him to live in a free society and not
under communism.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle in Miami, said the United States is a
free country, so the council of churches can do what it pleases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they want to go to Cuba to bring Elian back, that is their problem, not
mine,'' he said Saturday. ``If they think this is right, let them do it. Why
don't they send their own kids to Cuba?''
</P>
<P>
	   The custody case has increased tension between the countries, with Cuban
President Fidel Castro and thousands of Cuban protesters demanding the boy's
return.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's relatives have filed a petition for political asylum on his behalf.
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has scheduled a Jan. 21 hearing
in the case.

<HEADLINE> Nuremberg Lawyer Dies at Age 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Thomas Francis Lambert Jr., who prosecuted Nazi war criminals
as a trial lawyer for the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, died at
his Boston home Wednesday after a long bout with Parkinson's Disease. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   During the post-World War II Nuremberg trials, Lambert helped prepare the
case against the Nazi Party that accused it of being a criminal organization. He
also helped to prosecute Martin Bormann, one of Hitler's closest aides.
</P>
<P>
	   Bormann, tried in absentia, was found guilty and condemned to death. He was
never found, and a skeleton unearthed in Berlin in 1972 was determined with near
certainty to be his.
</P>
<P>
	   Lambert was asked to join the team of American prosecutors at the principal
Nuremberg Trial by Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, who led the team.
</P>
<P>
	   Lambert was born in Detroit and graduated from Oxford University. He
attended Yale Law School as a Sterling Fellow, and, at age 26, became dean of
Stetson University College of Law in De Land, Fla. The college later moved to
St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Lambert also taught at Boston University School of Law for nine years and at
Suffolk University Law School in Boston for 27 years until May when he retired.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was truly one of the giants of the legal profession and a mentor and
inspiration to most of the country's great trial lawyers,'' Suffolk University
President David J. Sargent said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lambert had a long association with the American Trial Lawyers Association,
and spent 40 years overseeing the group's law journal and other publications.
</P>
<P>
	   He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Branon Lambert; a brother, Owen

<HEADLINE> Japan Emperor Greets New Year Crowd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Amid cheers and waving of flags, Emperor Akihito on Sunday
offered New Year's greetings to thousands of well-wishers at the imperial
palace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very happy to be able to celebrate the new year with you,'' Akihito
told the crowd, many waving the national flag. ``I pray for happiness for Japan
and the world at the beginning of the year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 17,000 people had gathered at the grounds of the sprawling palace in
central Tokyo as of midmorning to hear the greeting and catch a glimpse of the
royal family.
</P>
<P>
	   Shouts of ``Long live the emperor'' greeted Akihito, 66, as he stepped out
onto a palace balcony with his family.
</P>
<P>
	   The palace grounds are generally closed to the public, except on Jan. 2 and
the emperor's birthday on Dec. 23. On each occasion, Akihito and his family
generally appear several times to offer greetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Akihito, dressed in a gray silk tie and tails, was accompanied by his wife
Empress Michiko, who wore a flowing, pastel green dress.
</P>
<P>
	   Other family members, including sons Crown Prince Naruhito, Prince Akishino
and daughter Princess Sayako also waved to the crowd. Akishino's wife Princess
Kiko also appeared.
</P>
<P>
	   Absent was Naruhito's wife Princess Masako, who palace officials say is
recovering from surgery for a miscarriage several days ago. Naruhito is next in
line to succeed the Chrysthantheum Throne.

<HEADLINE> Haitian Migrants' Boat Runs Aground  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- More than 400 would-be migrants packed shoulder-to-shoulder on
a wooden boat had to be persuaded by Coast Guard crews to abandon ship after the
boat ran aground on a sandbar early Saturday about a mile from Key Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
	   All 406 Haitians and Dominicans eventually climbed voluntarily aboard Coast
Guard cutters, said Petty Officer Scott Carr. He said the group may have been at
sea on the 60-foot vessel for as long as five days.
</P>
<P>
	   The boat ran aground at 2:30 a.m. about 1 1/2 miles from the Cape Florida
Lighthouse and near Stiltsville, a cluster of homes built on pilings in Biscayne
Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   With low tide approaching, Coast Guard officers feared the boat would
capsize. But when the first Coast Guard cutter approached the boat, many of the
people on board refused to leave, Carr said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coast Guard officers boarded the boat, handed out life jackets to the
passengers and tried to explain that the boat was not safe. They told the
passengers that regardless of what happened, they would not be allowed to enter
the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   By 1 p.m., all of the boat's passengers had been moved to five waiting Coast
Guard cutters.
</P>
<P>
	   Two women on the boat -- one five-months pregnant and possibly injured from
an earlier fall, and the other suffering from fever and convulsions -- were
taken to a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The other passengers are expected to remain on the cutters until INS
officials make a decision about their future. Coast Guard officials said they
don't know where the boat originated or the circumstances of its voyage.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a Haiti-U.S. agreement, would-be immigrants are returned once they are
intercepted. Cuban immigrants, however, are generally allowed to stay in this
country if they reach land.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Coast Guard rescued or turned back 363 Haitians and 406
Dominicans trying to reach the United States.

<HEADLINE> Badgers Win Back to Back Rose Bowls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Fresh off a New Year's celebration, Wisconsin
residents had another reason to party Saturday: The Badgers became the first Big
Ten team to win back-to-back Rose Bowls by beating Stanford 17-9.
</P>
<P>
	   "I couldn't be prouder of my team, my school and my alma mater," said
33-year-old Eric Steelmack, a 1992 University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate from
Minneapolis, who celebrated by dancing a polka with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   Steelmack was among the rowdy fans who watched the game at the Regent Street
Retreat bar in Madison, where people sang the UW-Madison alumni song, "Varsity,"
and chanted "U-RAH-RAH Wisconsin."
</P>
<P>
	   No. 22 Stanford entered the game a 14-point underdog, but led 9-3 at
halftime, briefly unsettling Wisconsin fans who considered a loss by their
fourth-ranked Badgers next to impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expected a blowout, but it was a lot closer than I thought it would be,"
said 22-year-old Wisconsin senior Elizabeth Severo, before downing a celebratory
shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rose Bowl excitement gave Madison a party atmosphere for the second
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
	   Tracy and Geoff Smith were both wearing Wisconsin sweatshirts and sipping
red Killer Kool-Aid from a plastic football cup as they watched the game at the
Big Ten Pub in Madison.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted to be as close to Camp Randall as possible," said Geoff Smith,
who came to Madison from Appleton. "I think people this year are -- if not as
enthusiastic -- more enthusiastic. I think a lot of it has to do with the
millennium. It's the Rose Bowl 2000!"
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Van Caster, 39, of Milwaukee, was decked out in a red floppy hat; a
Badgers sweatshirt; red pants; a fake Badgers tattoo on his cheek; a rose and
Wisconsin pins attached to his hat; red shoe laces and red-and-white Mardi Gras
beads.
</P>
<P>
	   "We couldn't ride in his car without wearing something Badger," said his
friend Dawn Golla, 29, a student in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
	   Marilyn Drager watched the Rose Bowl with her husband at the Clubhouse
Sports Bar in Appleton. She said the couple has been following the Badgers since
their son graduated from UW-Madison in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Drager had a Bucky Badger stuffed animal on the table that played the
Wisconsin fight song whenever Wisconsin scored and they gave it a squeeze.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans said Ron Dayne's Heisman Trophy win made this year's season special.
Dayne, who set the major-college career rushing mark this season, became only
the second player to win back-to-back Rose Bowl MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish the Packers could draft him because he's a very solid runner and he
gives 100 percent every game, but he's not cocky about it," Geoff Smith said,
referring to Wisconsin's other football passion in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Najam, 20, a junior at UW-Madison, was grilling steak and bratwurst at
his house with friends in preparation for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's as big a deal this year as it was last year," Najam
said. "The big thing this year was Ron Dayne winning the Heisman."
</P>
<P>
	   "Absolutely not!" protested his friend Rob Kanack, a 23-year-old postal
worker. "I don't think it's less of a big deal. No way, dude! That's like saying
Green Bay going to the Super Bowl two years in a row isn't a big deal."

divisions that scarred the millennium just passed. "If the story of the 20th
century is the triumph of freedom, what will the story of the 21st century be?"
Clinton asked. "Let it be the triumph of freedom, wisely used, to bring peace to
a world in which we honor our differences and even more, our common humanity."
In a New Year's Day radio address he shared with first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, the president expressed gratitude that the world turned from the 20th

Pakistan said it was on "high alert" to prevent the gang from entering its

In return, the hijackers won the release of three Muslim militants jailed in

the kitchen, several face the living room, and one even sits on a bathroom shelf
-- turned away from the toilet and bathtub.
</P>
<P>
	   The DotComGuy project, which sounds like a cross between the
enviro-colonization experiment Biosphere and the film ``EdTV,'' has a few ground
rules. Maddox can have visitors. He simply can't go farther than the back yard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We certainly don't recommend that people lock themselves away from the
world, but we will prove that it can be done,'' said Len Critcher, a friend of
Maddox's and president of DotComGuy Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Maddox's first monthly paycheck from the company will be $24, but it will
double every month as an incentive to stay in the house, Critcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Critcher helped line up sponsors to sustain Maddox through the year,
including Gateway, which donated the laptop, and Peapod.com, which agreed to
keep the house stocked with groceries. The sponsors are listed on the project's
Web site, www.DotComGuy.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas-based service911.com jumped on board when it realized its PC services
company could benefit from a little live, online exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going to have people say, 'Hey, DotComGuy, how do I install a brand
new modem or how do I get this or that Web site?''' said service911.com's Jeff
Lipschultz. ``And when he uses our site, that's how people will learn about
us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Similar experiments have been undertaken before -- ``Good Morning America''
housed two New Yorkers in an ``e-cave'' for a week last year with a
refrigerator, a $500 daily stipend, a computer and Internet access -- but Maddox
has vowed to live off e-commerce longer than anyone else has so far.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday afternoon, the Web site video showed Maddox sitting on the floor of
an empty room chatting online with visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his first online buys: shampoo, toilet paper, cleaning supplies and
carry-out food.

<HEADLINE> Y2K more Dullsville than Doomsday in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Whew! The new year began with the lights on, ATMs
dispensing cash and dialtones humming. But people remained on guard in New York
state Saturday for latent Y2K computer glitches.
<P>
	   "It's like a baseball game, we're only in the third or fourth inning maybe,"
said Tony DeRosa, who lives near Rochester.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let's finish playing this game and see what happens."
</P>
<P>
	   A team of 150 state emergency workers continued to do just that Saturday,
monitoring power lines, hospitals and other vital services at the state's
underground Y2K command center in Albany. Reports continued to be good.
</P>
<P>
	   At 8 p.m. Saturday, officials closed down each of the 10 Y2K regional
command centers across the state, after all systems were determined to be
bug-free.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had planned to have them up as long as needed, but we felt we could go
ahead and shut them down," state Y2K project director Gary Davis said Saturday
night. "It's been quiet all day."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Saturday, Gov. George Pataki proudly told emergency workers that New
York - after a tremendous amount of effort - updated its computer systems for
the 21st Century and passed the Y2K test with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were hoping for the most expensive non-event in history. That would be
good news," Pataki said. "And it was a non-event."
</P>
<P>
	   There were scattered power outages - including a temporary power loss to 966
customers Saturday in Eden in Erie County. But Davis said those outages were
ordinary occurrences unrelated to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   The lone Y2K problem identified by the state was a minor disruption to a
computer system serving a small non-commerical bank. Davis said the bank's
customers would not be affected, because the problem would be corrected by the
start of business on Monday. He would not identify the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said he was confident the state's power grid would handle its next
benchmark test Monday morning, when many offices and factories power back up.
Regardless, the state's Y2K command center will remain fully activated through
Tuesday, when officials will decide if operations can be scaled back.
</P>
<P>
	   While state officials exulted in their initial success, others wondered if
maybe the Y2K wasn't quite the monster it was made out to be.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think a lot of it was the media, it scares you more than anything," said
Chris Ericson, a North Carolina resident shopping in Albany's Colonie Center
Mall with her family. "I think they got people overly worried about it."
</P>
<P>
	   DeRosa, who is married with two children, stocked up on MREs (Meals Ready to
Eat) and filled four 55-gallon drums with tap water.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll probably hold on to it for a month just to see what happens" he said.
"If nothing, I'll put it in the pool."
</P>
<P>
	   Davis said the state will be on heightened alert for Y2K problems for a
while. He noted that this is a leap year, and Feb. 29 is being mentioned as a
potential trouble date for computers.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Mills, a power engineer from Schenectady who has done Y2K consulting,
said computer glitches are expected to pop up for many months.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not over yet," he said.

<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ulf Dahlen's goal 7:27 into the second period lifted the
Washington Capitals into a 1-1 tie with the St. Louis Blues on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Dahlen sneaked behind Blues goalie Roman Turek, who had knocked aside Jeff
Toms' soft shot from the left side, and poked the puck in from the right post
for his fourth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   The tie gave Washington a two-game unbeaten streak (1-0-1) after an 0-3-1
skid. The Capitals improved to 11-4-1 in New Year's Day games.
</P>
<P>
	   Dahlen's goal came 51 seconds after Pierre Turgeon had given the Blues, who
had won seven of 10 on the road, a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Pronger sprung Turgeon on a breakaway, but his initial shot was
blocked by goaltender Olaf Kolzig. Turgeon collected the rebound and tucked it
under the crossbar at 6:36.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal, Turgeon's 16th of the season, extended his point-scoring streak to
14 games, second only this season to a 15-game streak by Pittsburgh's Jaromir
Jagr from Oct. 1-Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Turgeon's streak of 12 consecutive games with an assist, the
longest in the NHL this year, ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Kolzig withstood a five-shot barrage on a Blues' power play early in the
third period. Washington didn't record its first shot of the period until Calle
Johansson one-timed a faceoff feed from Adam Oates with 9:46 left in the game
and totaled only three shots for the final 20 minutes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington outshot the Blues 6-5 in the extra period, and Peter Bondra of
the Capitals had the best chance in overtime, failing to convert at the right
post with 24 seconds remaining.

    BOSTON (AP) -- Jason Allison scored his second goal of the game at 6:50 of
the third period Saturday night lifting the Boston Bruins to a 2-2 tie with the
New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
	   Allison missed the last three games with a wrist injury and is also seeking
a contract extension. He will decide next week whether to have surgery that
would force him to miss at least three months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins are 0-5-2 in their last seven, and have only two wins in the 16
games. The Devils are unbeaten in four.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Elias gave the Devils a 2-1 lead midway through the second, when he
slid the puck past Byron Dafoe. Elias has four goals in three games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Devils had the best opportunity in overtime, but Claude Lemieux was
robbed by Martin Brodeur with 30 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston erased a third-period lead for the third time this season against New
Jersey, despite the Devils 11-0-2 record when leading after two.
</P>
<P>
	   Allison tied the game 1-1 when he redirected a Kyle McLaren wrist shot
through Brodeur's legs at 15:45 of the first. Brodeur made 23 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   Anson Carter had two assists for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins didn't register a shot on goal until 12 minutes into the first
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Niedermayer gave the Devils a 1-0 lead 22 seconds into the game when he
knocked Dafoe down in the crease and backhanded a Bobby Holik rebound into the
net.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal was Niedermayer's 300th NHL point.
</P>
<P>
	   Dafoe made 31 saves for Boston, which has won only one of its last ten home
games.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston defenseman Ray Bourque became the fifth player in NHL history to play
in four decades.

<P>
    BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Eric Rasmussen, Maxim Afinogenov and Stu Barnes each
scored twice as the Buffalo Sabres routed the Toronto Maple Leafs 8-2 on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Wayne Primeau and Michael Peca added goals, Curtis Brown had four assists
for a career high in points, and Martin Biron made 17 saves as Buffalo outshot
Toronto 35-18.
</P>
<P>
	   Buffalo had its highest goal total since an 8-3 victory in Montreal in March
1993 and recorded its first New Year's Day win after a string of four losses and
one tie stretching to 1971.
</P>
<P>
	   Mats Sundin scored for the Northeast Division-leading Maple Leafs, who were
beaten by the Sabres in last season's Eastern Conference finals. The teams play
again Monday night in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the most goals allowed by the Maple Leafs this season, and the six
goals through two periods matched the most allowed by Curtis Joseph in a game in
his two years with Toronto. It also was the most goals allowed by the Leafs
since an 8-5 loss to San Jose last March.
</P>
<P>
	   The fans chanted "Cu-jo! Cu-jo! Cu-jo!" as Joseph struggled.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph went into the game with a 1.98 goals-against average and 92.8 save
percentage. He faced 25 shots and made 19 saves before coach Pat Quinn replaced
him with Glenn Healy to start the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Healy allowed two goals on 10 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Buffalo scored twice in a 1:06 span in the first period as the Sabres
rebounded from a 7-2 loss to Detroit on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Rasmussen scored on Buffalo's first shift just 48 seconds into the game with
a floating wrist shot from between the top of the circles. Primeau scored at
1:54 off Miroslav Satan's pass from behind the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Thomas backhanded a pass from behind the net to Sundin for the Leafs'
10th power-play goal in nine games.
</P>
<P>
	   Rasmussen scored his second goal with 3:12 left in the first period, tipping
a blast from Peca under Joseph's glove.
</P>
<P>
	   Buffalo started the second with another pair of quick goals, the first on a
one-timer by Peca at 57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Primeau jarred the puck loose with a fierce forecheck on defenseman Bryan
Berard behind the net and fed Afinogenov for an easy goal and a 5-1 lead at
1:53.
</P>
<P>
	   Afinogenov's 10th goal of the season with 1:06 left in the second moved him
into a tie for the rookie goal-scoring lead with the New York Rangers' Michael
York. Barnes added two third-period goals, the first at 2:38 and the second on a
power play at 6:00.
</P>
<P>
	   Primeau sustained injured his left thigh in the first period and did not
return. Buffalo defenseman Rhett Warrener left the game in the second because of
a strained hip muscle.
</P>
<P>
	   Buffalo's Rob Ray drew a 10-minute misconduct after Toronto's Tie Domi
pushed Ray's helmet down over his face, and Ray turned and smacked Domi in the
face with five minutes to play. Domi drew a 10-minute misconduct seconds later
when he punched Peca.

    ATLANTA (AP) -- Ron Francis, Sami Kapanen and Paul Ranheim each had a goal
and an assist Saturday night as the Carolina Hurricanes broke a four-game road
losing streak with a 4-2 win over the Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
	   Kapanen scored the game-winner 6:08 into the third period with a wrist shot
on the stick side of Atlanta goalie Scott Fankhouser. Standing just outside the
crease, Kapanen took a pass from Francis to score his team-high 15th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis, who increased his team-points lead to 33, gave the Hurricanes a 2-1
lead with his 10th goal. Francis scored 4:11 into the second by knocking in a
rebound of Kapanen's wraparound shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranheim forged a 1-1 tie at the 13:02 mark of the first with a shot from the
top of the left circle. He was also credited with an assist on Robert Kron's
shot from the top of the right circle when the Hurricanes went up 4-2 with 8:43
left to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hurricanes won for the second time since rallying from a two-goal
deficit in the first period to beat Atlanta 4-2 on Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta, which dropped to an league-worst 8-25-4, had only three shots on
Carolina goalie Arturs Irbe in the third. Irbe, who made 24 saves, raised his
record to 12-12-7.
</P>
<P>
	   Fankhouser, making his second career start, fell to 0-2-1 after stopping 25
shots. The Thrashers are 1-10-2 in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson Emerson put Atlanta up 1-0 only 35 seconds into the game with a shot

<HEADLINE> No.4 Wisconsin 17, No.22 Stanford 9  </HEADLINE>
    By ROB GLOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Another 200 yards for Ron Dayne, and another Rose
Bowl victory for Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayne had a touchdown and 154 yards in the second half as the No. 4
Wisconsin became the first Big Ten team to win consecutive Rose Bowls, defeating
Stanford 17-9 Saturday in the lowest-scoring Rose Bowl since 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayne, the Heisman Trophy winner, was held to 46 yards in the first half by
a Stanford defense that ranked fifth worst in the nation. But he broke loose for
a 64-yard gain on the second play after halftime and scored on a 4-yard run two
plays later.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a nice talk, a nice little calm talk at halftime, and everybody got
more motivated," Dayne deadpanned. "I think that really gave us momentum and we
just carried on. It would have been nice if we could have scored some more, so
we wouldn't have had to bite our nails at the end."
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin (10-2) held No. 22 Stanford to minus-5 yards on 27 rushes, a Rose
Bowl record. The Cardinal (8-4), playing in their first Rose Bowl in 28 years,
were held to 259 yards of total offense after averaging 467 per game this
season.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the lowest-scoring Rose Bowl since 1977, when Southern California
defeated Michigan 14-6.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think anyone thought it would be a defensive struggle, but it was,"
said Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez, who hobbled up and down the sideline with a
cane in his first game on the field since knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayne, who passed 7,000 career rushing yards in the game, joined Washington
quarterback Bob Schloredt and USC tailback Charles White as winner of
consecutive Rose Bowl MVP awards. Schloredt won in 1960-61 and White in 1979-80.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayne, who had 34 carries Saturday, reached 200 yards in three of the four
bowls game in which he played. He finished his college career with 200 yards or
more in four of his final five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooks Bollinger had a 1-yard TD on a quarterback sneak for Wisconsin and
Vitaly Pisetsky added a 31-yard field goal. Kerry Carter had a 1-yard scoring
run for Stanford, and Mike Biselli had a 28-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the game was listed as a sellout, the attendance of 93,731 was the
smallest Rose Bowl crowd since 1955 -- perhaps adding fuel to complaints the
Bowl Championship Series has diluted interest in other bowls. The BCS showdown
for No. 1 is in the Sugar Bowl this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Troy Walters, expected to miss the game after dislocating his right wrist in
practice Tuesday, caught three passes for 52 yards for Stanford. Walters, winner
of the Biletnikoff Award as the nation's top receiver this season, played with a
wrap on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "I went from a low to a high. Tuesday and Wednesday were the low points in
my life," Walter said. "The doctors told me I couldn't injure it any further. I
felt like I could do enough to help the team. But I couldn't carry the ball in
my right arm."
</P>
<P>
	   Defensive tackle Willie Howard, who was expected to miss the game with a
torn knee ligament, also played for the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stanford long snapper Jon Sande missed part of the game with an ankle
injury, and it was costly. Backup Anthony Gabriel had two bad snaps, leading to
a missed extra point and a blocked field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Alvarez, on the sideline after spending most of the season in the press box
while recovering from knee surgery, said the Badgers were rusty after not
playing since Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a long layoff after that last game, and it took us a little while to
get in a rhythm," he said. "Big 33 (Dayne) got lathered up a little bit and that
seemed to help a little."
</P>
<P>
	   Each team punted three times in the first quarter. But while Wisconsin
failed to pick up a first down in the period, Stanford ended the quarter with
four straight completions to set up Biselli's field goal early in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin finally got its offense going with a 71-yard drive that led to
Pisetsky's field goal with 9:19 left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   After an exchange of punts, Walters' 19-yard reception and a couple
Wisconsin penalties helped the Cardinal march 45 yards on a drive capped by
Carter's scoring run. Gabriel's high snap foiled the extra point, though,
leaving the score at 9-3.
</P>
<P>
	   On the second play after halftime, Dayne broke two tackles on his 64-yard
run up the middle to the Stanford 11. Two plays later, he bounced outside to
become the career Rose Bowl scoring leader with his fifth touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayne, who scored four times in Wisconsin's 38-31 Rose Bowl victory over
UCLA last year, also surpassed 7,000 career yards rushing on the play. He had an
NCAA-record 6,397 yards in the regular season, and finished his career with 728
yards in bowl games.
</P>
<P>
	   Bollinger, who has not lost since becoming Wisconsin's starting quarterback
eight games ago, struggled most of the afternoon -- going 7-for-14 for 105
yards. But he completed two key passes to backup tight end John Sigmund on a
fourth-quarter touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Sigmund made a juggling 7-yard catch on fourth-and-2 at the Stanford 32 with
8:48 left, then caught a 22-yarder to get to the Cardinal 3. Dayne was stopped
on two runs, but Bollinger scored on a sneak to make it 17-9.
</P>
<P>
	   The Badgers had a chance to widen the lead when Dayne ran for 33 yards on a
46-yard drive to the Stanford 17, but Pisetsky missed a 33-yard field goal to
give Stanford one more chance.
</P>
<P>
	   Husak, who was 17-of-34 for 258 yards, completed four straight passes as the
Cardinal reached the Wisconsin 41, but was sacked on fourth-and-12 to end the
comeback attempt.

controversy and ended with a return to national prominence, rode the legs of
Shaun Alexander to a 14-7 halftime lead over No. 8 Michigan in the Orange Bowl
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander scored on second-quarter runs of 5 and 6 yards after a first
period in which neither team had much success moving the ball, and Michigan's
most effective play was a run out of punt formation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Southeastern Conference player of the year broke a 32-yard run on
Alabama's first offensive play of the second quarter, then gained 15 yards off
left tackle after a penalty moved the Crimson Tide back to the Michigan 49.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyler Watts, who alternated at quarterback with Andrew Zow for Alabama, ran
for 11 and 16 yards on successive plays to set up the first TD by Alexander, who
carried five times for 54 yards in a seven-play, 76-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander scored again three minutes later, making it 14-0 after Zow threw
22 yards to Tim Bowens at the Michigan 9. The senior tailback finished the half
with 84 yards on 15 carries.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan, limited to 26 yards and one first down in the opening quarter, cut
its deficit to 14-7 on Tom Brady's 27-yard TD pass to David Terrell with 58
seconds remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama played without Outland Trophy winner Chris Samuels, the 291-pound
offensive tackle who was so important to the Crimson Tide running game during
their drive to the school's first SEC championship since 1992. That was also the
last time Alabama also won a national title.
</P>
<P>
	   Without him, the Crimson Tide gained only 35 yards in the opening quarter.
Michigan had even less success on offense, though, managing its only first down
until late in the second quarter on Ian Gold's 5-yard run on a fake punt play.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady was 12-of-15 passing for 77 yards, but Michigan only had three first
downs and had been outgained 156-96 at the half.

<HEADLINE> Stanford's Offense Underperforms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Stanford Cardinal reached the Rose Bowl for the
first time in 28 years thanks mainly to an explosive offense. They gave
Wisconsin all it could handle Saturday because of an unheralded defense.
</P>
<P>
	   When the defense helped provide the offense with one last opportunity, the
Cardinal couldn't come through.
</P>
<P>
	   "You go into this game and know if you score 18 points and that's enough to
win, you would take it," Stanford offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick said after
No. 4 Wisconsin beat the 22nd-ranked Cardinal 17-9. "I think right to the end we
felt if we could score, we'd make the 2-point conversion and still be playing."
</P>
<P>
	   It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the Cardinal's final four plays typified their offensive
performance Saturday -- one that wasn't close to what they accomplished in their
previous 11 games when they averaged 37.2 points.
</P>
<P>
	   After the defense held and Vitaly Pisetsky missed a 34-yard field goal with
2:19 remaining that would have given the Badgers an 11-point lead, the Cardinal
had new life.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford didn't have a first down in its previous three possessions, but
Todd Husak threw passes of 5 yards to DeRonnie Pitts and 20 and 11 yards to
Tafiti Uso to put the ball at the Wisconsin 44.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinal had their chance. But then, they unraveled.
</P>
<P>
	   Following an incompletion, Stanford committed two false starts. Husak was
then sacked for a 2-yard loss, making it third-and-22. After a 15-yard pass to
Pitts, Stanford was penalized for delay of game, making it fourth-and-12 from
the Badgers' 46. Husak lost his footing and fell down on his team's final play.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just didn't capitalize when we needed to," Pitts said. "We got into the
red zone and didn't score."
</P>
<P>
	   Of Wisconsin's defense, Pitts said, "They're all right. We shot ourselves in
the foot."
</P>
<P>
	   Diedrick was much more complimentary.
</P>
<P>
	   "They dominated the line of scrimmage, both in terms of the running game and
the protection," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin held Stanford to a net of minus 5 yards rushing -- a Rose Bowl
record. The previous standard was 0, by Illinois during a 45-9 loss to UCLA 16
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "You figure you've got to be able to run for a few yards," Diedrick said.
"If we were able to run the ball a bit, it would have opened things up in the
end."
</P>
<P>
	   Center Mike McLaughlin, acknowledged to be Stanford's best offensive
lineman, made his 46th consecutive start but came out after one play because of
the right knee he injured earlier in the week in practice.
</P>
<P>
	   "He does so many things for us, we really missed him," Diedrick said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's tough when I see other guys hurt play," McLaughlin said. "I wanted to
be with them. When you get in a game, your adrenaline starts to flow, you can do
some amazing things."
</P>
<P>
	   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew," McLaughlin said with a small smile. "My knee was just wobbly. We
appreciate being the first (Stanford) team to come here in a long time. We came
here to win, it just didn't turn out that way."
</P>
<P>
	   It didn't, but not because of the much-maligned Stanford defense that
entered the game ranked 110th in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted to control Ron Dayne the best we could," defensive coordinator
Kent Baer said of the Heisman Trophy winner. "I know he got his yards (200 on 34
carries), but we did a good job. We had a lot of three-and-outs."
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin converted only 4-of-15 third-down opportunities; Stanford was
worse, converting 3-of-14.
</P>
<P>
	   "The opportunities were there," said Husak, who was 17-of-34 for 258 yards.
"We didn't do the things we did all year. I'm not pleased with my performance. I
make about five plays, we win."
</P>
<P>
	   One play Husak didn't make came early in the third quarter with Wisconsin
leading 10-9. In a third-and-13 from the Stanford 46, he missed a wide-open
Pitts deep down the middle.
</P>
<P>
	   "That one's a touchdown," Husak said. "I think I felt more pressure than
there actually was."
</P>
<P>
	   Considering he was sacked four times and harassed on many other occasions,
that was understandable.

<HEADLINE> Badgers Thrive on Dayne's Dominance  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Ron Dayne never stopped running.
</P>
<P>
	   As he left a college football field for the final time in his incomparable
career, Dayne steadily plowed through the crowd, a slight grin on his face and
his MVP trophy cradled in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
	   The fans, teammates and photographers blocking his way had no more effect on
the Heisman Trophy winner than the Stanford defense, which started strong
Saturday but was finally worn down by Dayne's deliberate, effective performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The final result: a 17-9 victory for Wisconsin and a fitting cap to Dayne's
record-setting career.
</P>
<P>
	   He rushed for 154 of his 200 yards in the second half Saturday, breaking
down the Cardinal's inspired defensive front through perseverance and desire.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ron never gets down when he's not running well," offensive tackle Chris
McIntosh said. "He's probably the most determined guy I know."
</P>
<P>
	   For the third time, Dayne was named the MVP in a bowl game. The NCAA's
career rushing leader won his second Rose Bowl MVP award to go with his 1996
Copper Bowl MVP trophy. Dayne ran for 692 yards in those three bowl games.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've come to expect Ron Dayne to play well in games like this," coach
Barry Alvarez said. "It's going to be tough to lose him."
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, Dayne joined his teammates in a locker room celebration before
removing his Wisconsin jersey for the final time and facing the media. He tugged
and twisted his yellow tie, looking much less comfortable than he had in his
red-and-white uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayne said he realized that the final chapter of his career was closing, but
he didn't want to think about it immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just feels like I'm leaving home," Dayne said. "I left home for my
freshman year and came to Wisconsin, and now it feels like I'm leaving a second
home for someplace else."
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope it won't hit me when I'm out in front of everybody. I hope it'll
happen in front of my girl and my daughter."
</P>
<P>
	   Dayne gained 46 yards on 12 carries in a dismal first half for the Wisconsin
offense. Improbably, Stanford's injured defensive front was winning its battle
with the Badgers' vaunted offensive line, and quarterback Brooks Bollinger made
several freshman mistakes.
</P>
<P>
	   But after a spirited halftime motivational speech from Alvarez, the Badgers
finally made a sustained offensive drive to open the second half, and Dayne led
the way.
</P>
<P>
	   He made a 64-yard run that brought the Wisconsin crowd to its feet and
turned the game's momentum toward the Badgers. He scored two plays later on a
4-yard end run.
</P>
<P>
	   On his 64-yard rumble, Dayne became the first major college player to rush
for 7,000 career yards. His touchdown made him the Rose Bowl's leading career
scorer after he ran for 246 yards and four touchdowns against UCLA last season.
</P>
<P>
	   He asserted himself again in the fourth quarter, rushing for 66 yards on 14
carries. Finally, the Stanford defense tired and crumbled before him as he
carried the ball seven times over the final 6:16.
</P>
<P>
	   The final carry of his career was a 6-yard rush over the left side for one
final first down, which allowed the Badgers to run out the clock. As time
expired, Dayne removed his helmet and held it aloft as the Wisconsin crowd
roared.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't really envision it ending this way ... but it's great," Dayne
said. "The Rose Bowl is probably the best bowl, I think. I've been here twice,
and I've had so much fun."

<HEADLINE> No.4 Wisconsin 17, No.22 Stanford 9  </HEADLINE>
    By ROB GLOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Ron Dayne got going after a "nice ... little
halftime talk" and Wisconsin got its second straight Rose Bowl victory not long
afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heisman Trophy winner scored a touchdown and had 154 yards in the second
half as the No. 4 Badgers became the first Big Ten team to win back-to-back Rose
Bowls, overcame Stanford 17-9 Saturday in the lowest-scoring Rose Bowl since
1977.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayne was held to 46 yards in the first half by a Stanford defense that
ranked fifth worst in the nation. But he broke loose for a 64-yard gain on the
second play after halftime and scored on a 4-yard run two plays later.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a nice talk, a nice little calm talk at halftime, and everybody got
more motivated," Dayne said. "I think that really gave us momentum and we just
carried on. It would have been nice if we could have scored some more, so we
wouldn't have had to bite our nails at the end."
</P>
<P>
	   Dayne, who passed 7,000 career rushing yards in the game, joined Washington
quarterback Bob Schloredt and USC tailback Charles White as winner of
consecutive Rose Bowl MVP awards. Schloredt won in 1960-61, White in 1979-80.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin (10-2) held No. 22 Stanford to minus-5 yards on 27 rushes, a Rose
Bowl record. The Cardinal (8-4), playing in their first Rose Bowl in 28 years,
were held to 259 yards of total offense after averaging 467 per game this
season.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the lowest scoring Rose Bowl since 1977, when Southern California
defeated Michigan 14-6.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think anyone thought it would be a defensive struggle, but it was,"
said Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez, who hobbled up and down the sideline with a
cane in his first game on the field since knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a long layoff after that last game, and it took us a little while to
get in a rhythm," he said, noting the Badgers had not played since Nov. 13. "Big
33 (Dayne) got lathered up a little bit and that seemed to help a little."
</P>
<P>
	   Dayne, who had 34 carries for 200 yards Saturday, reached 200 yards in three
of the four bowls game in which he played. He finished his college career with
200 yards or more in four of his final five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooks Bollinger had a 1-yard TD on a quarterback sneak for Wisconsin and
Vitaly Pisetsky added a 31-yard field goal. Kerry Carter had a 1-yard scoring
run for Stanford, and Mike Biselli had a 28-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the game was listed as a sellout, the attendance of 93,731 was the
smallest Rose Bowl crowd since 1955 -- perhaps adding fuel to complaints the
Bowl Championship Series has diluted interest in other bowls. The BCS showdown
for No. 1 is in the Sugar Bowl this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Troy Walters, expected to miss the game after dislocating his right wrist in
practice Tuesday, caught three passes for 52 yards for Stanford. Walters, winner
of the Biletnikoff Award as the nation's top receiver this season, played with a
wrap on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "I went from a low to a high. Tuesday and Wednesday were the low points in
my life," Walter said. "The doctors told me I couldn't injure it any further. I
felt like I could do enough to help the team. But I couldn't carry the ball in
my right arm."
</P>
<P>
	   Defensive tackle Willie Howard, who was expected to miss the game with a
torn knee ligament, also played for the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stanford long snapper Jon Sande missed part of the game with an ankle
injury, and it was costly. Backup Anthony Gabriel had two bad snaps, leading to
a missed extra point and a blocked field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Each team punted three times in the first quarter. But while Wisconsin
failed to pick up a first down in the period, Stanford ended the quarter with
four straight completions to set up Biselli's field goal early in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin finally got its offense going with a 71-yard drive that led to
Pisetsky's field goal with 9:19 left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   After an exchange of punts, Walters' 19-yard reception and a couple of
Wisconsin penalties helped the Cardinal march 45 yards on a drive capped by
Carter's scoring run. Gabriel's high snap foiled the extra point, though,
leaving the score at 9-3.
</P>
<P>
	   On the second play after halftime, Dayne broke two tackles on his 64-yard
run up the middle to the Stanford 11. Two plays later, he bounced outside to
become the career Rose Bowl scoring leader with his fifth touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayne, who scored four times in Wisconsin's 38-31 Rose Bowl victory over
UCLA last year, also surpassed 7,000 career yards rushing on the play. He had an
NCAA-record 6,397 yards in the regular season, and finished his career with 728
yards in bowl games.
</P>
<P>
	   Bollinger, who has not lost since becoming Wisconsin's starting quarterback
eight games ago, struggled most of the afternoon -- going 7-for-14 for 105
yards. But he completed two key passes to backup tight end John Sigmund on a
fourth-quarter touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Sigmund made a juggling 7-yard catch on fourth-and-2 at the Stanford 32 with
8:48 left, then caught a 22-yarder to get to the Cardinal 3. Dayne was stopped
on two runs, but Bollinger scored on a sneak to make it 17-9.
</P>
<P>
	   The Badgers had a chance to widen the lead when Dayne ran for 33 yards on a
46-yard drive to the Stanford 17, but Pisetsky missed a 33-yard field goal to
give Stanford one more chance.
</P>
<P>
	   Husak, who was 17-of-34 for 258 yards, completed four straight passes as the
Cardinal reached the Wisconsin 41, but was sacked on fourth-and-12 to end the
comeback attempt.

<HEADLINE> Devils 2, Bruins 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- Jason Allison scored his second goal of the game at 6:50 of
the third period Saturday night, lifting the Boston Bruins to a 2-2 tie with the
New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
	   Allison missed the last three games with a wrist injury and is also seeking
a contract extension. He will decide next week whether to have surgery that
would force him to miss at least three months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins are 0-5-2 in their last seven, and have only two wins in 16
games. The Devils are unbeaten in four.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrik Elias gave the Devils a 2-1 lead midway through the second, when he
slid the puck past Byron Dafoe. Elias has four goals in three games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Devils had the best opportunity in overtime, but Claude Lemieux was
robbed by Dafoe with 30 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston erased a third-period lead for the third time this season against New
Jersey, despite the Devils' 11-0-2 record when leading after two.
</P>
<P>
	   Allison tied the game 1-1 when he redirected a Kyle McLaren wrist shot
through Martin Brodeur's legs at 15:45 of the first. Brodeur made 23 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   Anson Carter had two assists for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins didn't register a shot on goal until 12 minutes into the first
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Niedermayer gave the Devils a 1-0 lead 22 seconds into the game when
he knocked Dafoe down in the crease and backhanded a Bobby Holik rebound into
the net.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal was Niedermayer's 300th NHL point.
</P>
<P>
	   Dafoe made 31 saves for Boston, which has won only one of its last 10 home
games.

Anti-Communism Papers Dropped on Cuba
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A pilot flew a small plane from Florida into Cuban airspace
and dropped anti-communism pamphlets on Havana, Customs officials said. A
Customs radar center in Long Beach, Calif., tracked the single-engine plane once
it left U.S. airspace after departing Tamiami Airport in Miami on Saturday, said
Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan. "His reason for going down was to drop
leaflets, anti-communist leaflets in multiple languages," Sheehan said. While
the man was flying the rented plane over Havana, the Cuban government sent two
MiG fighter jets to monitor his flight until he left Cuban airspace, Sheehan
said. The MiGs took no action, he said.

apparently were still far from capturing the center of Grozny. The intensified
effort to take the Grozny came as acting President Vladimir Putin visited
Russian forces in Chechnya. The visit came on Putin's first full day in office

denied India's claim that the hijackers are already there. India said the
hijackers are from Pakistan and have quietly slipped back into their homeland.
Pakistan said it was on "high alert" to prevent the gang from entering its
territory. The hijackers fled the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Friday
after releasing 155 hostages who they had held on board a plane for eight days.
In return, the hijackers won the release of three Muslim militants jailed in

</P>

	   Phouvanpheng Nicki Siriboury, 23, was charged Saturday in federal court in
Kansas City, Kan., with one count of attempted bank robbery and one count of
brandishing a firearm at the Bank of America branch in suburban Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had nothing to lose,'' the woman had said in a phone call to KMBC-TV
during the standoff. ``I lost it all, lost my job, lost my family, lost it
all.''
</P>
<P>
	   The robbery attempt turned into a hostage situation when police arrived at
the bank just as Siriboury was leaving, FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman initially took six bank employees hostages while five other people
hid elsewhere in the bank. She released four of the hostages during the
eight-hour standoff. The people five hiding inside were able to slip out through
other doors.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before she was disarmed, the woman told the television station she
would release the remaining two hostages, a man and a woman, if she were allowed
to talk to a friend named Sean.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's when it all ends,'' the woman said. ``I want to talk to Sean
face-to-face first before I talk to anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two spoke over a phone line set up at police headquarters, Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
	   Siriboury was arrested by an FBI SWAT team shortly after 1 a.m. when one
hostage knocked the gun out of her hand and another grabbed the gun and ran,
officials said. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials initially believed two women were involved but later said there
was only one hostage-taker.

<HEADLINE> Stanford's Offense Underperforms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Offense got Stanford to the Rose Bowl for the first
time in 28 years. But it was the Cardinal's unheralded defense that almost won
the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "You go into this game and know if you score 18 points and that's enough to
win, you would take it," Stanford offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick said after
No. 4 Wisconsin beat the No. 22 Cardinal 17-9. "I think right to the end we felt
if we could score, we'd make the 2-point conversion and still be playing."
</P>
<P>
	   Didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinal's final four plays typified their offensive performance
Saturday -- one that wasn't close to what they accomplished in their previous 11
games when they averaged 37.2 points.
</P>
<P>
	   After the defense held and Vitaly Pisetsky missed a 34-yard field goal with
2:19 left that would have given the Badgers an 11-point lead, the Cardinal had
new life.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford didn't have a first down in its previous three possessions, but
Todd Husak threw passes of 5 yards to DeRonnie Pitts and 20 and 11 yards to
Tafiti Uso to put the ball at the Wisconsin 44.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinal had their chance. But then, things unraveled.
</P>
<P>
	   Following an incompletion, Stanford committed two false starts. Husak was
then sacked for a 2-yard loss, making it third-and-22. After a 15-yard pass to
Pitts, Stanford was penalized for delay of game, making it fourth-and-12 from
the Badgers 46. Husak lost his footing and fell down on his team's final play.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just didn't capitalize when we needed to," Pitts said. "We got into the
red zone and didn't score."
</P>
<P>
	   Of Wisconsin's defense, Pitts said, "They're all right. We shot ourselves in
the foot."
</P>
<P>
	   Diedrick was much more complimentary.
</P>
<P>
	   "They dominated the line of scrimmage, both in terms of the running game and
the protection," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin held Stanford to a net of minus-5 yards rushing -- a Rose Bowl
record. The previous mark was zero, by Illinois during a 45-9 loss to UCLA 16
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "You figure you've got to be able to run for a few yards," Diedrick said.
"If we were able to run the ball a bit, it would have opened things up in the
end."
</P>
<P>
	   Center Mike McLaughlin, acknowledged to be Stanford's best offensive
lineman, made his 46th consecutive start but came out after one play because of
the right knee he injured earlier in the week in practice.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's tough when I see other guys play hurt," McLaughlin said. "I wanted to
be with them. When you get in a game, your adrenaline starts to flow, you can do
some amazing things."
</P>
<P>
	   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew," McLaughlin said with a small smile. "My knee was just wobbly. We
appreciate being the first team to come here in a long time. We came here to
win, it just didn't turn out that way."
</P>
<P>
	   It didn't, but not because of the much-maligned Stanford defense that
entered the game ranked 110th in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted to control Ron Dayne the best we could," defensive coordinator
Kent Baer said. "I know he got his yards, but we did a good job. We had a lot of
three-and-outs."
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin converted only 4-of-15 third-down opportunities; Stanford was
worse, converting 3-of-14.
</P>
<P>
	   "The opportunities were there," said Husak, who was 17-of-34 for 258 yards.
"We didn't do the things we did all year. I'm not pleased with my performance. I
make about five plays, we win."

<HEADLINE> No. 21 Utah 73, Southern Utah 56  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Hanno Mottola had 20 points and 10 rebounds and Alex
Jensen scored 15 points on a career-high five 3-pointers as No. 21 Utah beat
Southern Utah 73-56 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was the ninth straight for the Utes (11-2) and their 45th in a
row at home, one shy of the nation's longest current streak held by Murray
State.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Monoco led the Thunderbirds (4-8) with 13 points while Tyson Hancock
and Frederick House each had 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The Utes held Southern Utah to 42.3 percent shooting (22-for-52) and
outrebounded the Thunderbirds 39-22.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah center Nate Althoff had 13 points and eight rebounds in 17 minutes in
his first game since spraining his left ankle Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Mottola has averaged 26 points in the four games since he returned from
preseason knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The Utes shot 51 percent for the game and turned the ball over 15 times.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah, which led by 10 points at halftime, took its largest lead at 72-54 on
a dunk by Jeff Johnsen with 1:23 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Mottola's jumper with 12:18 remaining stretched Utah's lead to 54-37. The
Thunderbirds got within 59-48 with 6:50 to play on a layup by House, but no
closer. Jensen hit his fourth 3-pointer at the 6:27 mark and Mottola made two
free throws 39 seconds later to make it 64-48. Jensen's last 3-pointer came with
3:26 and made it 67-52.
</P>
<P>
	   Monoco's 3-pointer with 9:46 left in the first half tied the game 14-14 and
the Utes then went on an 18-2 run with Mottola scoring six of the points.

Many Computer Systems See Monday As Y2K Test
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Although ATM machines, subway trains, airports and
electricity got through midnight functioning normally, many computer systems
still await their Y2K test, starting Monday when the world -- particularly the
financial world -- goes back to work and reboots its computers. The U.S. banking
industry, which spent an estimated $9 billion updating computer systems so they
would not misread 2000 as 1900, had to meet a target of having its systems ready
six months ago. Federal bank examiners aggressively went after stragglers to
ensure 100 percent compliance by December.

U.S. Airlines Back At Full Service

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Y2K computer bug behind them, U.S. airlines moved
towards full schedules Saturday, bracing for a post-holiday rush of leisure
travelers and a return to the skies by business fliers. United Airlines, the
nation's largest carrier, predicted Sunday would be like a normal busy end to a
holiday weekend, after the carrier had cut its 2,400-flight schedule by 34
percent on New Year's Eve and 14 percent on New Year's Day. United expected peak
volume on Tuesday, as the lingering holiday travelers and road warriors met at
the check-in counter.

Haitian Migrants' Boat Runs Aground
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- More than 400 would-be migrants packed shoulder-to-shoulder on
a wooden boat had to be persuaded by Coast Guard crews to abandon ship after the
boat ran aground on a sandbar early Saturday about a mile from Key Biscayne. All
406 Haitians and Dominicans eventually climbed voluntarily aboard Coast Guard
cutters, said Petty Officer Scott Carr. He said the group may have been at sea
on the 60-foot vessel for as long as five days. The boat ran aground at 2:30
a.m. about 1 1/2 miles from the Cape Florida Lighthouse. Under a Haiti-U.S.
agreement, would-be immigrants are returned once they are intercepted.

Russia Unleashes Fierce Assault on Grozny

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces on Saturday unleashed an exceptionally
fierce assault on the capital of Chechnya, dropping scores of bombs on the city
from low-flying jets. Federal forces claimed progress against the rebels, but
apparently were still far from capturing the center of Grozny. The intensified
effort to take the Grozny came as acting President Vladimir Putin visited
Russian forces in Chechnya. The visit came on Putin's first full day in office
and underlined his determination to win the war in Chechnya.

India, Pakistan Trade Accusations

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistani officials pledged Saturday to arrest
five Indian Airlines hijackers if they enter the country, but the officials
denied India's claim that the hijackers are already there. India said the
hijackers are from Pakistan and have quietly slipped back into their homeland.
Pakistan said it was on "high alert" to prevent the gang from entering its
territory. The hijackers fled the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Friday
after releasing 155 hostages who they had held on board a plane for eight days.
In return, the hijackers won the release of three Muslim militants jailed in
India.
