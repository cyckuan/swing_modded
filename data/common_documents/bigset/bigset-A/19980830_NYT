A RARE LOOK INSIDE THE LIFE OF A POLYGAMIST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO CITY, Ariz. _ It was 4:25 p.m. at Justin's house and
the welcome call ``Come to dinner!'' went out over the intercom.
From all over the 35,000-square-foot, 31-bedroom home the kids came
pouring into the cafeteria-size dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Boys in long-sleeve shirts and girls in long dresses ran and
hopped down a circular staircase from the two floors above. Infants
sucking on pacifiers sat contentedly on couches. Toddlers waddled
toward play balls in the corners of the big room.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, 45, sat and smiled amid the clang of silverware and
plates as many of his 10 wives and 28 children consumed the
contents of three casserole dishes of enchiladas.
</P>
<P>
   Justin is not his real name; he asked that he and his wives
remain anonymous in exchange for granting a rare glimpse of
polygamous life in this fiercely secretive community on the
Utah-Arizona state line.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lifestyle, he and his wives said, based on deeply held
beliefs about Earth and heaven and about the nature of man and
woman.
</P>
<P>
   It's one in which Justin's wives say they willingly give up
monogamy and privacy because they love living with their ``sister
wives'' and with many children growing up as brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   And it's also one, Justin conceded, in which he and his wives
must work harder than most families to cope with dizzying
scheduling problems and occasional jealousies. They even have to
deal with such arcane issues as making sure they are producing a
diversified gene pool.
</P>
<P>
   It is, Justin said, a ``boringly normal'' lifestyle, even as he
hints that there is room for five more wives to join the fold _ and
that he might need to add to the house's dozen washers and dryers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine with Liz, wife No. 4 of the millionaire financial
consultant who built the $3 million mansion for his polygamist
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me as long as I have my own room,'' said
Liz, an acerbic woman in her early 40s who speaks of her husband in
almost mystical tones.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Liz can't figure out why the fifth and sixth women who
married Justin flew the coop rather than stay and prepare
themselves for the highest part of the celestial kingdom _ the part
she believes is reserved for those in plural marriages.
</P>
<P>
   But Liz does have a theory: ``Number 6 was an only child and
found out she couldn't deal with this. And Number 5 could not
accept it when Number 6 became a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Mormon pioneers brought their polygamous beliefs to the West in
the mid-1800s. But the practice was outlawed in 1896, under
pressure from the federal government, as a condition of Utah's
receiving statehood. Today, the estimated 50,000 current
practitioners are facing tough times.
</P>
<P>
   A group of ex-polygamist wives has been lobbying the Utah
Legislature to crack down on the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, two members of Utah's prominent polygamist Kingston
family have been arrested on incest and child-abuse charges.
Published reports have linked residents of Colorado City and
neighboring Hildale, Utah, to extensive welfare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Many polygamists living in the sparsely populated Arizona Strip
north of the Grand Canyon, believe it's all part of a concerted
effort by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   They claim that the church, which went on record against plural
marriage in 1890, wants to drive polygamists further underground
before the world's press descends on Salt Lake City for the 2002
Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   So Justin said he wanted to clear up some popular misconceptions
about life inside the large, warehouse-like homes that were built
because of the inaccessibility of this area even in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   True, his lavish master bedroom may look fit for a queen, with
its Jacuzzi, fireplace and expensive hard-wood furniture. But
shortly after his two youngest wives, ages 24 and 26, stared
longingly at him in the dining room, Justin insisted that he's not
some testosterone-drenched madman bouncing from bed to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a specific need for one of them to get pregnant,
you accommodate that,'' Justin said diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also try to handle the other physical needs of the other
ladies. If you persist in neglecting someone, you're challenged by
all of them. Plus, the older ladies insist on having young children
in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   IT ISN'T ABOUT SEX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the plural-marriage lifestyle isn't about sex, said
Justin, himself raised in a polygamist household in Colorado City
with 32 siblings.
</P>
<P>
   It's about finding women who propagate a lifestyle, he said.
Women with skills such as sewing, cooking and gardening are much in
demand in the huge households.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Justin said, after one of Colorado City's oldest
patriarchs died a year ago, leaving behind nine wives, he was
approached by the community fathers about becoming husband to two
of them. He quickly agreed to bring in a 52-year-old and
45-year-old into the household.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he became their ``husband'' only in a
fundamentalist Mormon interpretation of the word. Polygamists
typically marry their first wife in the law, then shy away from any
paperwork concerning the others, although the women normally take
the man's last name.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the problem of diversifying the gene pool to
address a common problem in polygamist communities where
intermarriage is common. Six of Justin's wives, who have borne most
of his children, were raised in mainstream _ monogamous _ Mormon
homes in Utah and Idaho. &QL; 
THE PECKING ORDER &QL; 
In most polygamist households, the pecking order among wives is
determined by the order in which they were hitched. That often
presents problems, as a patriarch's sexual urges typically are
centered on the youngest, latest arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to get over the jealousy and the feelings of
being left out,'' Liz said. ``But you can't live monogamy here and
have celestial life (after death) on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to buy in totally to the religion to make this
work.''
</P>
<P>
   And Liz, who has eight children with Justin in their 18 years
together and is an executive in his business, is a true believer.
She snickered when asked whether she would consider an arrangement
in which she had numerous husbands.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the nature of woman,'' she said. ``If she finds a
good man, she will stay with him forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria, 52, quickly concurs. She came on board last year after
her polygamist husband of 36 years died. One of his nine wives, she
married when she was 15 and he was 56.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman doesn't have the capacity to take care of one man
and the needs he has,'' Gloria said. ``I wouldn't have it any other
way. I love living with my sister wives and I can't live without
all the children around.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them, a little 2-year-old boy, walked clumsily up to
Justin at dinner time, grabbed his leg and yelled, ``Dad!''
</P>
<P>
   Another child was playing with a wet, white washcloth, which
Justin took from him after the child swung it wildly and almost hit
some other children. He went crying to his mother, who told him to
go back to Justin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you playing with it,'' Justin said sternly.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' responded the child, who fell silent and wiped the tears
from his cheeks. &QL; 
NO CORPORAL PUNISHMENT &QL; 
Justin says there's no corporal punishment in the house, but there
is a liberal use of timeouts for children who act up. The 11 adults
reach a consensus on household issues and abide by it, he added,
since ``we can't have a dozen sets of rules here.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Justin said he does almost everything communally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We group kids by age and put them in rooms together,'' he
said. ``They are all brothers and sisters in this family, not half
brothers and half sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes a framed picture prominently displayed on the wall in
the room of another of his wives. A group of six small children
beam at the camera, dressed in their Sunday best. Each has a
different mother.
</P>
<P>
   Justin also has bought seven vehicles for family use as needed.
No child in this household should expect a new car at age 16, if
ever. A lot of thought also goes into trips to the toy store.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never bring back a single ball here,'' he said with the
look of a man who has felt his children's pain. ``It's always six
of this or that.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids have quite a playground within the walls of the 5-acre
estate. There's a tennis court and a basketball court with six
baskets. There's a large trampoline and a grassy area big enough
for a football field. The back yard even hosted the community's
Fourth of July fireworks celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Justin said he seldom does anything individually with his
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always take three or four out with me to pull weeds or to
go over to our ranch in Nevada,'' he said. ``I got the brilliant
idea once to take the family to Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be more than he bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up taking groups over there all summer,'' he
chuckled. &QL; 
UNUSUAL HOUSEHOLD &QL; 
Justin's household is unusual in this plural-marriage community in
one significant way: Unlike most polygamists, he is a wealthy man
who apparently makes enough money to support a comfortable
lifestyle for him and his large family.
</P>
<P>
   That lifestyle also is supplemented heavily by the women, all of
whom work outside the house. Half of his wives have executive
positions in his business interests, Justin said.
</P>
<P>
   A full third of his house, where he entertains guests, features
elevated ceilings, a formal dining and sitting room and fine
furniture. His office and master bedroom are also in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla, Justin's ninth wife, said she doesn't make it over to
that part of the house much. She also said she's still trying to
make amends with the rest of her mainstream LDS family after
deciding to become Justin's wife 4{ years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother gave me a secret code word to call him anytime I
want to leave,'' said Kayla, cradling her newborn child.
</P>
<P>
   She rolled her eyes in an ``as if'' look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll call,'' she said, a wide smile creasing her dimpled
cheek. Her sister wives at the table laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Liz deadpanned: ``We are all just a bunch of sniveling, whining
little boobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin just took it all in, a proud smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised with the beauties of this lifestyle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for monogamous men because they are tied up in
the whims of one woman.'' &QL;

FUNDAMENTALIST LEADERS TAKING EVEN MORE CONSERVATIVE STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO CITY, Ariz. _ Wayne LeBaron sat on the couch snuggling
with his new bride and he shook his head at the strangeness of it
all.
</P>
<P>
   LeBaron, who lives at the foot of a strawberry-colored cliff
near this remote polygamist town, knew something was stirring
within the ranks of the Old World _ the fundamentalist Mormons who
control the community.
</P>
<P>
   Then the packages started arriving _ sent to LeBaron's ranch for
safekeeping from the family of his wife, who was raised in Colorado
City,
</P>
<P>
   Some contained cassette tapes of popular music. Others had
jewelry. Still others held containers of makeup, mascara and
eyeliner.
</P>
<P>
   But all had one thing in common, he said: They are considered
contraband by the fundamentalist Mormon leadership that LeBaron
says has recently been reverting to an even more conservative
religious stance.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado City's mayor denies that, and says the town has never
been more open to the outside world. But others confirm that at
least a significant sector of the town is growing more restrictive
_ even as its population of plural-marriage families continues to
increase.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the 1980s, many predicted that modern America's
toys and temptations would swiftly erode the austere frontier
values of this isolated community. Today, however, attitudes seem
to be heading in the opposite direction. &QL; 
MODERN POSSESSIONS GO
</P>
<P>
   ``All the religious leaders have told the people to get rid of
their modern possessions,'' LeBaron said, ``and many are
obliging.''
</P>
<P>
   That directive from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints includes disposing of televisions, videocassette
recorders and satellite dishes, confirmed residents of Colorado
City. It also included disconnecting Internet connections available
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to put a TV repeater (relay tower) on a ridge here
above town,'' said Cyril Bradshaw, a longtime resident and retired
school administrator. ``But the powers that be fought it tooth and
nail.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the (Mohave) county put it in a high area 20 miles
south of town, but the reception is nil.''
</P>
<P>
   There also has been a crackdown on dress within the Colorado
City public schools, where control is so tight that athletic teams
aren't permitted to form and compete against schools in outside
towns.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, more and more Colorado City schoolgirls had taken to
wearing pants beneath their long, 19th century-style frontier
dresses, said Nathaniel LeBaron, Wayne's brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, boy, 95 percent of those pants have disappeared over
there in recent months,'' Nathaniel LeBaron said. ``There's a lot
of repression going on against the modern world.'' &QL; 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT FUTURE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cause may lie in uncertainty about the future within the
fundamentalist church, which runs the town through its so-called
United Effort Plan. The UEP owns virtually all land and buildings
in Colorado City and parcels them out to loyal church members.
</P>
<P>
   Rulon Jeffs, the church's 88-year-old patriarch and prophet,
reportedly has been ill in recent months. The scene harkens back to
the mid-1980s, when the terminal illness of former patriarch Leroy
Johnson led to a similar retrenchment and resulted in a split in
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Secessionist polygamists then bought land south of Colorado 389,
built a separate community called Centennial Park and formed a
second ward of the Fundamentalist LDS church.
</P>
<P>
   But it's in the First Ward where matters have taken a turn for
the bizarre, said Don Cox, a Colorado City polygamist who left the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk around town is that all the true believers in the
First Ward are preparing to gather at Berry Knoll (south of
town),'' Cox said, ``where they will ascend into heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado City Mayor Dan Barlow said last week that all the
talk of turning the clock back and planning for the rapture of
church members is nonsense. &QL; 
MORE SMALL INDUSTRIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barlow also said the town has never been more open to the
outside world, citing the construction of more than a dozen small
industries in Colorado City and neighboring Hildale, Utah. The
communities have a combined estimated population of about 6,000,
Barlow said, and have been growing at a 6 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, church members have opened a convenience store,
hotel and restaurant and a local bank, known as the Bank of
Ephraim, on the highway that skirts the edge of the towns.
</P>
<P>
   The area was settled by excommunicated Mormon polygamists in the
early 1900s. They selected a valley at the edge of the Canaan
wilderness area on the Utah-Arizona state line because of fertile
land on the banks of Short Creek. They also chose it because it
enabled them to jump across the state line to avoid law officers
from either state, both of which outlaw polygamy.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona did raid Short Creek in 1953; 23 townsmen were hauled
away and sentenced to a year's probation on conspiracy charges. But
the political fallout from breaking up families was later cited by
then-Gov. Howard Pyle as a big factor in ending his political
career. &QL; 
POLYGAMY POPULAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, it appears that polygamy has never been more popular in
the two communities. Dozens more huge, unfinished houses have
sprung up. Many young men have emulated their fathers and started
their own plural-marriage homes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hordes of children, the communities seem to place
little emphasis on summer youth-recreation programs. Boys in
long-sleeve Western shirts carry hoes around town, chopping down
weeds wherever they find them. Girls in long dresses play hopscotch
in yards and accompany their mothers to the Cooperative Mercantile
Store.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders _ at least, those who aren't quickly on their way out
of town _ are greeted with uncertain handshakes and icy stares.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow said it's a lifestyle that's never received the
appreciation it deserves from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd to make an issue of a man strengthening his home
with two mothers these days when we have a president like we do,''
Barlow said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox, who has two wives, 18 children and ``more than 40''
grandchildren, said he wouldn't do it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pounded into the boys' heads here that the more wives the
better,'' Cox said. ``I came here 42 years ago thinking that if
Brigham Young said it, it must be true. But it doesn't work because
there are too many internal tensions.'' &QL;

PIAZZA COULDN'T HAVE SAVED THIS SINKING SHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the batter's box to the upper deck, there was
plenty of emotion Friday night in Mike Piazza's return to Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There he was, the former Dodgers catcher putting up Hall of Fame
numbers for someone else. When Piazza homered in the sixth inning,
it was his fifth in eight games and 26th for the year. The fans
felt compelled to boo because that's what you do to the other team.
</P>
<P>
   After the 5-4 Mets victory, Piazza talked about the nervousness,
the crowd and the regret he has over the circumstances leading to
the May 15 trade that sent him to the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like going on a roller coaster,'' Piazza said of
his first game back. ``You're scared before you get on it. Once you
get on, you realize it really wasn't so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza turned down baseball's biggest contract extension, six
years for $85 million. His handlers called it an insult. Now, a
month from free agency, he is unlikely to get anything near that.
</P>
<P>
   While the fans wonder what might have been, the truth is, even
if Piazza stayed in Los Angeles, the Dodgers would still be going
nowhere this year.
</P>
<P>
   They still would be underachieving because of the rudderless
trinity of Piazza, Eric Karros and Todd Zeile. They're all
excellent players, but leadership has never been their thing. They
still would have lost Ramon Martinez and Jose Vizcaino for the
season to injuries and Eric Young for 34 games with a strained left
thigh.
</P>
<P>
   And they still would be buried under a mountain of guaranteed
contracts for next season that will make rebuilding difficult
unless the new owners at Fox don't mind pushing the payroll to $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers already have committed $53 million to 12 players for
1999. Bobby Bonilla even has acknowledged the Dodgers can't trade
him with two years and almost $12 million left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   So you're saying, ``Exactly. Bonilla and Gary Sheffield, two of
the guys the Dodgers got for Piazza, will make a combined $17
million next year. The Dodgers could have saved money giving Piazza
the $15 million over seven years he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would not have solved the team's most glaring needs. They
gambled that Martinez could return to be the No.1 starter after a
rotator cuff injury and got burned. This year he finally underwent
surgery when the right shoulder broke down again and they know he
won't be back until next June, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Martinez was compounded when Chan Ho Park
failed to step up this year as the No.1 pitcher. And they knew deep
down that fired manager Bill Russell was right, that Hideo Nomo was
done, but they were so tied to his marketing potential that they
were shackled with his fading fastball. They should thank Nomo for
forcing them to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   What that all means is the Dodgers need Kevin Brown, who hasn't
lost for San Diego since May. He is a free agent. He also could get
$9 million-$10 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that the Angels are interested in
Piazza. Brown makes a lot more sense if they are serious about more
than a division title and a first-round loss in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Brown still wouldn't address the leadership problems
that Boston's Mo Vaughn, another free agent, would solve. That's
$10 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up and the Dodgers are in trouble, with or without Mike
Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Clemens: Roger Clemens starts today for Toronto after
striking out 18 Kansas City Royals in his 3-0 victory last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He is 11-0 in 16 starts going back to his last loss May 29
against Cleveland _ matching the major-league high for consecutive
wins this season (San Diego's Brown) and franchise record for
consecutive wins (Clemens won his first 11 decisions with the Blue
Jays in 1997 and Dennis Lamp was 11-0 in 1985.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as close to unhittable as you can be,'' said the
Royals' Dean Palmer, who had one of the three singles. ``I don't
think he made a mistake the whole night.''
</P>
<P>
   As in his two 20-strikeout games, (vs. Mariners in '86, Tigers
in '96) he had no walks. He now has 209 strikeouts, four behind
league-leader Randy Johnson (213). He's also at 3,091 all-time,
just 26 short of Bob Gibson's 3,117 for 10th on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens clearly is making a case for an unprecedented fifth Cy
Young Award. Greg Maddux and Steve Carlton have four each.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 starts dating to July 5, he is 7-0 with a 1.04 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   All this after May 29, when he was 5-6 with a 3.50 era. Since
the July 31 trading deadline, when the Blue Jays talked about
moving Clemens to a contender, he is 3-0 in five starts with five
earned runs in 41 innings. Clemens is still uncertain about what he
wants to do next year, the third season in a four-year contract
worth $31.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another purge: The Twins traded former Dodger Mike Morgan to the
Chicago Cubs this past week, and more deals are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating loses of $10 million-$13 million this season,
Minnesota Twins management is hoping to trim the payroll from $27
million to at least $20 million. The expected retirement of Paul
Molitor ($4 million) will account for much of that.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the block is Bob Tewksbury, who on Wednesday made his
first start since July 14. Tewksbury is making $1.75 million this
season and will be a free agent. He too is not expected back in
1999 and the Twins will try to get something for him by Monday's
postseason trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   With Morgan gone, the Twins have options on two remaining
veterans for next season: catcher Terry Steinbach, who is scheduled
to make $2.3 million next year or be offered a club buyout of
$500,000; and Otis Nixon, who is scheduled to make $1.7 million.
There is no buyout on Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed Steinbach will be invited back and that the club
will not exercise its option on Nixon, who has played in only 90 of
the team's 130 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Victory at last: Cleveland's Dave Burba was 10-5 in 17 starts
before the All-Star break. In his first eight starts after the
break, he went 0-4 with a 5.13 ERA before finally beating Seattle
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried that I wouldn't get another win,'' Burba
said, who has been bothered by elbow problems in the second half.
``When you win 10 in the first half, you figure you're going to win
11 eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Burba and the Indians are talking about a contract extension,
but both sides have agreed to put off talks until the end of the
year. He has one year left on his contract and could demand a trade
at the end of the year. But he says that won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   News and notes: The Padres' Andy Ashby bailed Friday in his
third attempt to win No.17 and has lasted just 32/3 innings in each
of his past two starts. In those games he has allowed 16 runs and
19 hits.... Giants catchers have failed to throw out base stealers
in 20 of the past 22 attempts.... Devon White's 20 home runs for
Arizona are the most he has hit since he had 24 for the Angels in
1987.... Mark McGwire needs 30 walks in the final 28 games to break
Babe Ruth's record of 170 walks in 1923. He had two Friday against
Maddux, who came in with just 31 walks in 2112/3 innings.... The
Detroit Tigers have been outscored 121-57 in the first inning this
season.... The Orioles have dropped six straight and seven of eight
since opening the second half 30-7.... Finally, on the weekend of
the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., Sean
Burroughs, star of back-to-back winners for Long Beach six years
ago, has been offered $2.1 million by the Padres. It is believed to
be the biggest bonus offered a high school draftee this year.
Burroughs, the Padres' No.1 selection, has the option of attending
USC, which opens classes this week. If he begins classes at USC,
the Padres lose his rights. &QL;

PHILLIPS PICKS UP PIECES WITH METS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A few years ago in another league and another
city, a heckler was all over Tony Phillips, and the language got a
little too personal. When Phillips was pulled from the game, he put
on his street clothes, went into the stands and duked it out with
the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Of incidents like that were a reputation made for Phillips. He
fought with opponents. He bumped with umpires. He clashed with
managers. He was arrested in August 1997 for buying $30 worth of
rock cocaine from a police informant at an Anaheim motel, leading
to a 10-day suspension that helped to undo the Angels'
division-title drive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after half a season of unemployment, Phillips is back in
action with the New York Mets, desperate for a leadoff hitter who
could do to opponents what he has done to the Dodgers this weekend,
when he has reached base in eight of 11 plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   And in every National League city there's a heckler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crackhead!'' somebody will yell.
</P>
<P>
   To which Phillips has a withering response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoe fits,'' he said, unleashing a cackling laugh,
Saturday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In other words: It's true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened. So what can you say? `Yeah _ and ...?
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake. I admitted the mistake. And I go on.''
</P>
<P>
   From which we might conclude that Tony Phillips, now 39 years
old, has changed, has grown up, has learned to walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Or that he hasn't changed at all.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was a standup guy in his few months with the Angels,
the player most likely to face up to reporters' hard questions
after a defeat. It says something that so many people who know him
have rooted for his successful return.
</P>
<P>
   And he's a standup guy now, facing up to a hideous mistake,
completing a drug-diversion program that could lead to the
dismissal of cocaine charges, and setting out to prove himself to a
new team and a new league.
</P>
<P>
   Unsigned by the Angels, he turned down offers from four teams,
including the Mets, for $500,000 or less. He complained that clubs
were ``trying to get me for nothing'' and was taken to task by at
least one columnist. This columnist.
</P>
<P>
   I thought he should face facts: A baseball player with drugs on
his record is no longer worth the $1.8 million he made in '97.
Especially when he's older than some of the general managers he's
negotiating with.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips says now that money wasn't the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the way they approached me,'' he said. They
approached him like a time bomb, trouble waiting to happen. He was
insulted.
</P>
<P>
   And Phillips was in no hurry. He went home to Scottsdale, Ariz.,
enjoyed the spring with his wife and two daughters, and ``was
playing doubleheaders _ 18 (holes) in the morning and 18 holes
after lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Toronto Blue Jays said the right things, Phillips
lowered his price, and on July 17 they became his fifth
major-league team. He hit .348 in 12 games for the Blue Jays before
the Mets traded a minor-league pitcher to acquire him July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the one to judge him,'' said Mets GM Steve Phillips
(who was 18 when Tony Phillips broke into the majors with the
Oakland A's in '82). ``The legal system did.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the verdict is in on the Mets' decision. Outstanding
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine had used everybody from Brian McRae to
Luis Lopez as a leadoff hitter. Now it's Phillips and forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a true leadoff hitter. He doesn't have to get a hit to
make a difference,'' McRae said.
</P>
<P>
   Tell it to the Dodgers. Friday night, Phillips drew four
consecutive walks, one of them crucial to a three-run,
seventh-inning rally in a 10-inning game the Mets won 5-4.
Saturday, he already had a walk, a single and a double when he came
to the plate with two outs in the ninth and the Mets down a run.
</P>
<P>
   To a tired relief pitcher like Jeff Shaw, a little guy batting
in an exaggerated crouch is 175 pounds of sheer panic. Phillips
fouled off a fastball, then worked Shaw for a walk to keep the game
going.
</P>
<P>
   The next hitter, Edgardo Alfonzo, hit a two-strike home run to
win it 4-3. The Mets lead the NL wild-card race because of
Phillips, because of his high-decibel presence in a once-quiet
clubhouse and because of his knack for making something happen on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   He has reached base in 26 of the 29 games he has played for the
Mets. Only the late start will keep him from walking 100 times in a
season for the sixth time _ numbers you'd expect only from a guy of
Mark McGwire's dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to take a walk. That's the battle within the battle
for a leadoff hitter,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   If he has also learned to walk away from trouble, the Mets have
a winner at the top of the lineup. &QL;

METS STING SHAW WITH NINTH-INNING HOME RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a month to go, the Dodgers have nothing left
and neither does Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' part is predictable. They've been this way since
spring training. The Jeff Shaw part is alarming, but maybe it
shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's trail of blown saves continued Saturday afternoon when he
allowed a two-out, two-run, ninth-inning homer by Edgardo Alfonzo
which gave the New York Mets a 4-3 victory in front of 49,181 at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the lost velocity and poor location which has plagued him
through a stretch of five appearances and three blown saves in the
past six games actually goes back to earlier this season when he
was every bit as dominant as Trevor Hoffman or Robb Nen.
</P>
<P>
   You just couldn't see the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was acquired at the All-Star break from the Cincinnati
Reds, Shaw already had thrown 50 innings. That is almost a full
season for many closers.
</P>
<P>
   Couple that with 1042/3 and 942/3 innings the past two seasons
and it becomes clearer why Andres Galarraga, Andruw Jones and now
Alfonzo took him deep in the late innings in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, his ball didn't have nothing,'' said former Reds
teammate Lenny Harris, now with the Mets. ``He is not the same Jeff
Shaw I played with in Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw has been a standup guy throughout the meltdown, but he
refuses to blame anything but bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   However, when asked how much he pitched in Cincinnati, he said
quietly, ``A lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too late to slap Reds manager Jack McKeon or ask for Paul
Konerko back. Besides, Shaw doesn't escape blame.
</P>
<P>
   With the lowly Reds, there were few rewards other than saves.
Even when the back-to-back games started to mount during some
meaningless weekend in Pittsburgh, Shaw took the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Taking one for the team meant never taking a day off even if it
sounded self-centered on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very rare that I am not going to go out there if there
is a save to be had,'' said Shaw, who has 38 saves this year after
recording 43 in 1997. ``Even if my arm is dragging on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining all that to Brian Bohanon was worthless. He is still
wondering how one of baseball's top closers can blow his past two
starts.
</P>
<P>
   After outpitching 18-game winner Tom Glavine for seven innings
last Monday, Bohanon took on Al Leiter, the National League leader
in earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   For eight innings he battled, allowing 11 hits but just two
runs. He was at his best in the fourth when he pitched out of a
bases-loaded, no-out jam.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out Jermaine Allensworth, then began a double play
when Luis Lopez bounced back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the eighth, he walked Mike Piazza and Brian
McRae, but struck out Allensworth again and retired Lopez on a
grounder to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say, this is so frustrating, I am beyond
words,'' said Bohanon, who would like to take a few more victories
into next winter's free-agent market. ``I go into every game
thinking I am going to win. But things just aren't happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged he wasn't as sharp as he was in Atlanta. ``I
didn't have the good fastball and my location was off. But I
battled. You can always count on that. I can't blame Jeff Shaw, he
is one of the best closers in the game. It's a tough stretch for
him and the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers really needed to sweep the Mets to feel they belong
in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   They entered the series with a chance to win four straight for
the first time this season. Now they have dropped the first two of
a four-game series to New York, which is eight games ahead with 26
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw told manager Glenn Hoffman that he was fine even though he
pitched two innings in Friday night's 5-4 loss. That game was not a
save situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio Osuna said he had a sore arm so I wasn't going to use
him,'' Hoffman said. ``But Jeff knows himself better than most
pitchers. If he says he can go, I have to believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw came in leading 3-2 and retired the first two batters. Then
Tony Phillips walked for the sixth time in the series. On a 2-2
count, Shaw threw a fastball to Alfonzo, the one he doesn't have
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't throwing nearly as hard as he had earlier in the
season,'' Harris said. ``After the second pitch I could tell
something was different. I told the guys don't swing so hard.''

SHEFFIELD SPRAINS THUMB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield could miss the rest of the series with the New
York Mets after suffering a sprained left thumb batting in the
first inning of Dodgers' 4-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same thumb that forced Sheffield to miss all but 63
games during the 1995 season. He underwent surgery to repair a torn
ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Sheffield sprained the right thumb and
missed several games.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sheffield injured the thumb swinging the bat in the
first inning. He dropped the bat in obvious pain, but stayed in the
game until the fourth. Sheffield went 0 for 2 with one strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're calling it day-to-day, but we have to see how
it feels (today),'' manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``It's been a
trouble spot in the past, but we think this is minor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who hit a three-run homer Friday, was 4 for 16 on the
homestand with a homer and six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard time: The Dodgers' problems certainly haven't been
Trenidad Hubbard's fault.
</P>
<P>
   He has scored a run in the past six games, including a
first-inning homer Saturday. He has a hitting streak of seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, a part-time player his entire career, has been the
Dodgers' starting left fielder since the beginning of the
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I am, a role player, but that doesn't mean I have
to play like that,'' said Hubbard, who has hit safely in his past
19 starts (27 for 74, .364. ``It means coming to the park every day
thinking you are going to do something in the game. The game should
always be your focus, whether that means the first inning or the
ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Mets starter Al Leiter allowed three home runs
Saturday (Hubbard, Raul Mondesi and Bobby Bonilla, back-to-back in
the second). He had allowed only four homers over 1482/3 innings in
22 starts before Saturday.... Mondesi and Bonilla were the fifth
Dodgers duo this season to hit back-to-back homers. Sheffield and
Eric Karros did it last Sunday off Greg Maddux in Atlanta.... Tom
Prince started in place of Charles Johnson and threw out Jermaine
Allensworth attempting to steal second in the second inning. Prince
has thrown out 9 of 21 baserunners (43 percent) attempting to steal
on him this season.... The Dodgers are 3-3 in their past six games,
all decided by one run.... Scoring change: Karros was charged with
an error on his throw to the plate Friday night when Rey Ordonez's
fielder's choice scored Mike Piazza from third base for the winning
run in the 10th inning.... John Olerud was 1 for 18 against
left-hander Scott Radinsky before hitting a three-run homer that
tied Friday's game in the seventh.... Dodgers right-hander Ismael
Valdes will make his first start since July 27 on Tuesday against
Philadelphia. Valdes, sidelined with a strained left-side muscle,
threw in the bullpen before the game. Darren Dreifort, Tuesday's
scheduled starter, will move to Wednesday. Even though they have an
off-day Thursday, the Dodgers say they will use a six-man rotation.

IRWIN MAKES HIS MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD _ It will be the battle of the I's Sunday when the final
round of the $1 million BankBoston Senior Classic begins at the
lovely Nashawtuc CC.
</P>
<P>
   The first I is Hale Irwin, the closest thing to a sure thing on
the Senior Tour. Irwin marched through Concord like Sherman marched
through Georgia, fashioning a course record-tying 8-under-par 64
Saturday. His 11-under 133 total is good enough for a share of the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The second I is Joe Inman, who has been playing professional
golf for a quarter century but has only one PGA Tour victory in his
portfolio, the 1976 Kemper Open. Inman backed up his first-round 67
with a 66 to stake his claim on the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time he will be in the final pairing of a
PGA tournament in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to savor every minute of it,'' said Inman, who
earned a spot on the Senior Tour by finishing fifth at Qualifying
School last November. ``Am I going to be nervous? Sure. Yes, Hale
is the favorite. If I were a betting man, I'd put my money on him.
But Denver beat Green Bay and the Yankees don't have to win the
World Series. The best team doesn't have to win. I'm just tickled
to be in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are the only players on the Senior Tour with last names
that begin with I. At Tour stops, often their lockers are side by
side. Both wear glasses and more than a few times Inman has been
mistaken as Irwin by autograph seekers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no comparision in their games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no holes in his game,'' said Inman of his playing
partner. ``I don't think Hale is afraid of me. I'm just happy to be
in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin has to be considered the favorite Sunday. Consider his
finishes this year. He's played in 15 tournaments and has a top 10
finish in each of them. Five times he has won and five times he has
claimed second place.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Irwin has been dominant. He's been over par in only one
tournament _ the US Senior Open, where conditions are more rigorous
than your average Senior Tour stop. He has been under par in every
other tournament and is an aggregate 145-under through 15-plus
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin already has passed the $2 million mark this year
($2,101,750) and should have no problem topping his Senior Tour
record of $2,343,364.
</P>
<P>
   There is no truth to the rumor that Irwin didn't play his best
on Friday so that he could get an early tee time Saturday. Why
would he need an early finish? So he could make kickoff of last
night's Patriots game to see his nephew, Heath Irwin, play for New
England?
</P>
<P>
   As for the tournament, Irwin says it's still anyone's ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still is not my tournament. There's plenty of golfers that
can still win,'' he said. ``If I'm not aggressive (Sunday) somebody
else will be.''
</P>
<P>
   If both Irwin and Inman falter, lurking in the wings at one
stroke back is Al Geiberger (67), and at 136 is a fivesome that
includes Norwood's Allen Doyle (66), David Graham (68), Ed
Dougherty (69), Gibby Gilbert (69) and Frank Conner (71).
</P>
<P>
   First-round leader Bobby Stroble (73) along with Kurt Cox (66)
and Jay Sigel (69) are at 137.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin came within inches of setting the course record when his
30-foot birdie putt on the final hole seared the cup. He played the
front nine in 3-under 33, but it was chopsticks compared with the
Stradivarius back nine, a five-birdie masterpiece for 31. The back
nine was as friendly as his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Inman, who fashioned a 67 on Friday, came up with a birdie on
the 511-yard finishing hole for his piece of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was pleased with his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hit the ball better today. I got a lot of rust out of
my swing,'' said Irwin. He is referring to his two-week layoff and
he called his play ``uninspiring'' through the first nine holes of
the tournament, which he played in even par Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a better day. I needed a round like this,'' said Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his succes, Irwin said he is having problems with
distance control with his irons. ``I was continuously short on my
shots today.''
</P>
<P>
   But his putting certainly made up for any shortcomings. He
knocked in birdie putts of 12 feet on No. 3, 6 feet on No. 5, and
10 feet on No. 6 on the front nine. On the back side, he drained
birdie putts of 15 feet on No. 10, 12 feet on No. 13, 30 feet on
No. 15, 8 feet on No. 16 and 12 feet on No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``My play was a little more aggressive, especially my putting.
(Friday) I was wishing them in. Today I made a better effort with
the putts. The greens' speed is good, where the putts won't get
away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he hopes the tournament doesn't get away from him.

CREATINE: WHAT'S THE DOPE?  
 PERFORMANCE ENHANCER APPEARS SAFE FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN AND NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's Friday night at the Zuka Juice in north Phoenix,
and Larry McDermott is sipping his creatine-laced strawberry
smoothie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth the extra 49 cents,'' the 34-year-old bodybuilder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Valley, in Arizona State University's athletic
facilities, containers of powdered creatine sit for the closely
monitored use of its athletes.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Mercury prepares for its WNBA Championship Series
game against Houston, one of its stars, guard Michele Timms, has
acknowledged she has reaped the benefits of the
performance-enhancing supplement.
</P>
<P>
   The three are a testament to the widespread popularity of
creatine, which finds itself in the news again in light of Mark
McGwire's acknowledgement that he uses another popular
over-the-counter substance, androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable with distributing it because we know we
don't abuse it,'' ASU strength coach Rich Wenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike anabolic steroids, creatine is not a banned substance,
nor is it a drug. It is an amino acid found naturally in animal
proteins like meat and fish. In the body, it is found mostly in
muscles, where it plays a major role in energy production.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies on creatine have been positive. Athletes find it
provides energy and enhances their strength during training and
speed in conditioning. Some users report muscle strains, cramps or
dehydration, but overall, most believe the benefits outweigh the
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest argument against creatine is that there may be
long-term side effects, which have not been studied because the
supplement is relatively new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chances are it's going to be fine,'' said Margaret Pederson, a
Phoenix-based dietitian. ``But why use something when you don't
know 100 percent?''
</P>
<P>
   Creatine's popularity is high in the Valley and in the rest of
the country. Athletes at the high school, college and professional
levels use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen it,'' Greenway High School baseball Coach Ted Blake
said. ``Kids are looking for something, anything that is a quick
type of muscle enhancer where they don't have to work as hard. We
recommend kids don't take it. I tell my players, `You've not seen
the long-term effects.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, Coyotes and Cardinals don't provide creatine to their
athletes but are aware that some use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our official stance is no stance,'' Cardinals trainer John
Omohundro said. ``We don't advocate it. We don't ban it. It's sold
over the counter. We can't stop it. But it's buyer beware.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have it available, strength and conditioning
coach Jeff Forney said, ``but we don't push it one way or the
other. We give them all the information, then it's their choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Forney said three or four Diamondbacks use it.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State makes it available to its athletes, but its use
and distribution are closely monitored, Wenner said. Approximately
15 football players use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started taking it, I felt a little increase in
energy and felt a little stronger,'' ASU football center Grey
Ruegamer said. ``I could work out longer. But I think after a while
of taking it, your body gets used to it.'' &QL; 
Cheap, easy to get &QL; 
Creatine is available in pill, powder or liquid gel. It can be
purchased from a variety of sources: nutrition stores, the
Internet, fitness magazines and even juice bars like Zuka, which
offers it as a drink supplement for 49 cents a teaspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the country's most popular athletes are users: McGwire,
Baltimore Orioles outfielder Brady Anderson and Denver Broncos
tight end Shannon Sharpe, who is a spokesman for a company that
distributes it.
</P>
<P>
   Five pro teams _ the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bears, the New York
Giants, the Cincinnati Reds and the Tennessee Oilers _ told ``USA
Today'' recently that more than half their players use it.
</P>
<P>
   Business has been brisk, and sales of creatine are expected to
top $200 million this year. A monthly supply typically runs $30 to
$35.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural food substrate,'' Suns strength and
conditioning coach Robin Pound said. ``It's not a drug. It's in
your body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mix-up on creatine is that it supplies extra energy for
your body. It's not just lift weights, get huge. It helps you with
endurance. It gives you better stamina so you can work out longer
at higher intensities. Therefore, you get better results. It is
valid. The stuff does work.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound emphasized that creatine should be part of a good diet and
be taken within certain limits. &QL; 
Swimmer opposed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phil Whitten, 55, a master swimmer and editor of the
Arizona-based ``Swimming World,'' is a longtime crusader against
the performance-enhancing drugs used by the Chinese and the former
East Germans, and has devoted several lengthy stories to creatine.
Several years ago, he said, he tried it himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only thing it made me do was make me retain some
water and gain some weight,'' said Whitten, who trains about 90
minutes a day at the Phoenix Swim Club. ``Maybe it doesn't work for
older people, or maybe you have to train harder than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Swim Club Coach Pierre LaFontaine said he has not urged
any of his swimmers to use it. When he was a coach in Canada a few
years ago, LaFontaine said, his swimmers often used it on a
prescribed cycle of three weeks on, four months off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good thing,'' said LaFontaine, who in the late
1980s worked at the Phoenix Swim Club and coached Michele Smith,
the Irish Olympic medalist who recently was banned by the
International Olympic Committee for providing a drug test sample
that included a curious masking agent: whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my kids here are pretty young,'' he said. ``As we
approach the Olympics, we might go ahead with it, just for an edge.
I feel if we give it all now, we have nothing to progress from.'' &QL; 
`Be smart about it' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Creatine began to be used about two years ago in swimming, which
has been plagued by drug abuse at the world-class level for the
last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, creatine has been part of many athletes' diets
for several years. Timms, of Australia, said Australians have used
it since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used it before the (1996) Olympics, and we used it before
the World Championships, because when you have such a heavy
schedule, it helps you,'' Timms said.
</P>
<P>
   Australia Olympic officials provide guidelines for when and how
to use creatine, Timms said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, too, emphasized that those using it should be smart about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that you take certain dosages while you're
eating well, living a healthy lifestyle and not eating a lot of
garbage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine first gained attention during the '92 Olympics, when
British athletes acknowledged using it.
</P>
<P>
   It got some unwanted attention last year after speculation that
it was a factor in the deaths of three college wrestlers. But last
April, the Food and Drug Administration said creatine ``did not
appear to be a major factor'' in the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Frankie, a Washington High School health and physical
education teacher who also trains world-class and professional
athletes, has sought as much information as he can about creatine. &QL; 
Alternative to drugs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about it, it gives the athlete an alternative
way from illegal drugs,'' he said. ``I don't discourage creatine.
It's legal. It's out there, and they're doing research on it. Kids
using steroids, enhancement drugs, are not going to come forward,
so they're at risk all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take great amounts of anything, you'll be at risk. Any
time you do that, the body isn't producing at those levels. There
may be some consequences. I would caution any parent to pay
attention to what is going on and the amount that is being used. A
(popular) philosophy is if a little bit is good, then a whole lot
must be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a hell of an alternative to putting your head in the
sand and kids using steroids. This is not even close to a steroid,
not even in the same ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, ``no negative side effects have been
documented in scientific literature,'' the American College of
Sports Medicine said recently, adding that ``the verdict is still
out over longer periods of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a negative study was a report that came out
in the ``Lancet,'' a British medical journal, saying circumstantial
evidence linked creatine ``to the deterioration of kidney functions
in a 25-year-old man with a pre-existing renal problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the debate rages on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compete (in power lifting) drug free,'' Wenner said. ``So
when you're in your 30s, you know when you do something and it
works. I took the stuff and went, `Wow.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Blake said, ``I don't think it has a place in high school
athletics. I think any time they're taking something and don't know
the long-term effects, you're playing with a loaded gun.'' &QL;

FRESHMAN TAILBACK IMPRESSES IN SCRIMMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With 105 players rotating in and out _ starters and reserves,
true freshmen and redshirt freshmen, even walk-ons _ UCLA coach Bob
Toledo declined to evaluate specific players following Saturday's
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Except one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one person who stood out,'' Toledo said. ``Our
freshman tailback.''
</P>
<P>
   DeShaun Foster.
</P>
<P>
   A 205-pounder from Tustin, Foster figured he'd get a few
carries, but no more or less than veteran tailbacks Jermaine Lewis
and Keith Brown. Little did he know Toledo planned to test him
against the first-string defense, in live action, with 1,500 fans
scrutinizing his every step.
</P>
<P>
   Foster responded with 74 yards on nine carries and was more
impressive than Lewis (two carries, five yards) or Brown (five
carries, nine yards). He ran inside and outside, against the
first-string defense and the second string, and finished with five
double-digit gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get him with the first group and see what he can
do,'' Toledo said. ``He was a big focus for me. I wanted to test
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a good grade.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't based solely on yardage, either. A sore groin and turf
toe have limited his repetitions in practice, but Foster's greatest
obstacle is the offense itself _ recognizing audibles and
pass-protection schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The more he learns, the less he thinks. And the less he thinks,
the better he runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I'm running tentatively,'' he said. ``Today, I was
just running. I feel good about the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect him in the starting lineup against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the third (tailback),'' Toledo said. ``The other kids did
a good job and deserve to be first-team. They're both starters.
(Foster) is second-team.''
</P>
<P>
   Other notables: Reserve inside linebacker Ryan Nece has
impressed the coaches after an offseason switch from safety. With
Ramogi Huma injured (groin), Nece is starting alongside Tony White.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve cornerback Damian Allen had one interception Saturday
and could have had a second. ``I guess that's why he's not a
receiver,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Freddie Mitchell (two catches, 18 yards) has
established himself as the No.1 punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman cornerback Julius Williams played with Allen on the
second team, ahead of Ryan Roques.
</P>
<P>
   Roster update: Reserve place-kicker Zak Haselmo informed Toledo
on Saturday that he has quit the team and will enroll at a junior
college.
</P>
<P>
   Haselmo, a redshirt freshman, was not invited to training camp
so UCLA could use his roster spot to evaluate walk-ons. His
departure is noteworthy for two reasons: it leaves the Bruins with
one scholarship kicker, Chris Sailer, and it frees a valuable
scholarship for next year's recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   Walk-on Adam Griffith, a freshman from Gardnerville, Nev., is
the backup kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Get out of the kitchen: To prepare for the sweltering heat in
Pasadena, Houston and Miami, the Bruins are practicing at 11:30
a.m. every Tuesday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that if they think this is hot, they're sorely
mistaken,'' Toledo said Friday. ``The Rose Bowl will be at least 20
degrees hotter. It'll be miserable in Houston and even worse in
Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff against Texas is 12:30 p.m. The Houston game will be
played on the Cougars' home field, not the air-conditioned
Astrodome.

IDLED BUFORD BATTLES ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He admits he's in pain physically, but Damon Buford said that
pales in comparison to the anguish of sitting out games during the
stretch run. The Red Sox outfielder was placed on the disabled list
Friday with a rib injury, which originally occurred in Minnesota
last Saturday night when Buford struck out in the eighth inning. He
played Tuesday night and pinch ran Wednesday before the pain became
too unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it hurts,'' said Buford. ``It's nothing I've ever done
before so I don't really know. I just know that the first couple of
days it hurt to cough, or laugh, or sneeze, or do anything. It's
not as bad anymore so it's getting better every day. It's just
painful when I do certain things like rolling over in bed or
sneezing or laughing real hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old veteran, who hasn't committed an error this
season and has a career high nine home runs and has tied his career
high with 39 RBIs, is a key component in the Red Sox' success. Any
extended absence would put the club in a bind. But Buford believes
that when he's eligible to come off the DL, he will be ready to
return. Buford said what was strange is that he sustained the
injury last Saturday but it didn't affect him right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt fine the next day I played,'' he said. ``Then it got
worse as the night went on. I could feel it as the night went on
and then it hurt too bad to play anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been taking therapy, including ice, muscle stimulation
and, anti-inflammatories and said it has been hard to be on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in my whole career I've been on the DL and
it's been twice this year so I already can't play a whole month out
of the season,'' he said. ``That's real hard to deal with. That's
one thing I've always prided myself on is playing all the time or
at least always being available. It's hard to just not even be
available. There's nothing you can really do. At least it happened
on the baseball field and not doing anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford said he has a pretty substantial threshold of pain, but
this injury became unbearable quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel it getting better every day,'' he said. ``I'm
usually pretty good with pain. This is something that I won't rush
because it's too late for setbacks. I have to take my time. I can
ride the bike and lift weights. I can pretty much do everything.
It's just the adrenaline of the game and having to fire it real
quick (that could lead to problems if he came back too quickly).
Two weeks off will be good. It's encouraging to feel better. It's
encouraging to know that when I sneeze now, it's only a five on the
pain scale instead of a 10. And it's only been four days. Another
10 days it should be all right. I know that as long as I can't
sneeze, I can't swing a bat. That's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he's able to play again, Buford said he'll spend the time
when he's not rehabilitating cheering on the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great year,'' he said. ``We started winning in
spring training. You don't ever put too much stock in spring
training but we came out and started winning early in the year and
it's carried over the whole time. There hasn't been too much drama
around the clubhouse. When you win the whole time, it kind of makes
things easy.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he's found the Boston fans unique in that no matter
how well the team does, Red Sox fans are permanently pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' he said. ``I kind of
almost went through it, though, in Texas in 1996 and we were going
for our first pennant and they had never won it before. They had
been in the lead a couple of times. Then they'd say, `Texas always
fades when the heat comes.' We almost did lose it but we ended up
winning and it changed the attitude of the city regarding the
baseball team. It's more intense here. The negativity in Boston is
more intense. It's just interesting to see, to experience. As
players we have confidence. Even a guy like Jim Corsi, he's from
the area so he's grown up with it. Even Billy Broadbent (the Sox
video coordinator), he's waiting for the worst thing in the world
to happen. I think we just have to concentrate on getting to the
playoffs and then go round by round.''

TUNEUP LIKE TEXTBOOK FOR CARDS  
 SCORE IN FINAL MINUTE OVERCOMES RAIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Their last drive was textbook, even for the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals kept the ball for more than six minutes, scoring
in the final minute to win a game the same way they lost so many
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie running back Michael Pittman's third touchdown, a
4-yarder with 44 seconds left, gave the Cardinals a 21-14 victory
over the Oakland Raiders on Saturday before 31,858 fans at
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' first drive was even more impressive. Quarterback
Jake Plummer completed all eight of his passes for 61 yards,
running back Adrian Murrell ran for 26 yards and the Cardinals went
84 yards in 18 plays, a march that lasted 10 minutes and 40
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a clinic,'' Cardinals wide receiver Rob Moore
said. ``That's how you draw it up _ dink, dunk, take what they give
you and keep our defense off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was more impressed than the Cardinals' first-team
defenders, who, according to defensive tackle Eric Swann, didn't
break a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive starters played only two series, giving up only
one first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about this season,'' Swann said. ``I have a
little saying: `The Cardinals are going to be great in '98.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who finished the preseason with a 2-2 record,
will find out how good they are beginning next week when they open
the regular season in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still are a few pieces of the puzzle missing,'' Swann
said. ``Actually, there is a big piece of the puzzle missing. But I
have faith things are going to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to unsigned first-round draft pick Andre
Wadsworth, the defensive end from Florida State who was the third
pick overall.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the negotiations said the two sides had a
lengthy conversation Friday and expect to talk again this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closer,'' one source said. ``I think we're going to get
this done. ''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Cardinals didn't play any preseason game with
all of their top offensive skill people on the field at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Eric Metcalf missed two games. He returned
Saturday and started in place of Frank Sanders, who didn't make the
trip because of a back injury. Wide receiver Rob Moore and fullback
Larry Centers also missed a game each.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't keep Plummer from having a terrific preseason. He
completed 69 percent of his throws (46 of 66) for 491 yards and
four touchdowns. His passing rating was almost off the charts at
105.6.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope he can get started (in Dallas) the way he did the
last two weeks,'' offensive coordinator Marc Trestman said of
Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to anoint him yet, but he's going to get us out
of a lot of jams when we're struggling,'' Murrell said. ``He has so
much poise.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Plummer hit his first 11 passes against Seattle and
17 of the first 19.
</P>
<P>
   He said Saturday was the first time he had ever left a game
without an incompletion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go out there and go one more series,'' Plummer
said. ``But I think Coach (Vince) Tobin was pretty happy the way we
went out and put together 20 plays and a score. That is exactly
what this offense needs to do. When we do that, we know something
is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer was replaced by third-team quarterback Stoney Case, who
was sacked four times and lost two fumbles, one that the Raiders
turned into a score.
</P>
<P>
   But Case hung tough in the fourth quarter, even after a late hit
by defensive end Aundray Bruce knocked his left shoulder (his
non-throwing shoulder) out of place for one play. He returned and
led the Cardinals to a score, a 4-yard run by Pittman with 12:42
left in the fourth quarter that tied the score at 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly, but it was good at the same time,'' said Case,
who completed 15 of 25 passes for 158 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals got the ball a final time with 7 minutes left.
Case drove the Cardinals 58 yards in 14 plays, including nine runs
by Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough hoss,'' Case said of Pittman, who finished with
38 yards on 17 carries. &QL;

SOX STORM ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was no masquerade Saturday afternoon at Fenway Park. No
Yoda mask, no borrowed No. 41 jersey from a teammate twice his
size, no double takes from Mo Vaughn, and no pained looks from his
manager.
</P>
<P>
   That merry prankster, Pedro Martinez, came as himself Saturday,
and as usual there was no shortage of entertainment _ or
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a plastic brace to protect his left knee, and working
with a swiftness that suggested the belief that he could defeat not
only the Angels but the elements, Martinez withstood two rain
delays to beat Anaheim, 6-1, before 32,519 in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome, wasn't it?'' said shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, in
appreciation of the fact that the actual playing time Saturday was
just 2 hours 7 minutes, to go along with the 43-minute and
six-minute delays that interrupted action.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the rain delay,'' Garciaparra said, ``he got his second
wind. It was like he was ticked off at the rain and took it out on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez joined David Cone of the Yankees and Tom Glavine of the
Braves as the major leagues' only 18-game winners this season. He
allowed the Angels seven hits, all singles, six of which came in
the first three innings, struck out eight, and went to just four
three-ball counts. He walked just one.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has allowed one run or less in 16 of his 28
starts, reduced his league-leading earned run average to 2.67 and
raised his strikeout total to 208, one behind Roger Clemens and
five behind Randy Johnson, who now works in the other league.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was nasty and abusive out there,'' said Angels shortstop
Gary DiSarcina of the Billerica DiSarcinas. ``I've never seen him
throw so many breaking balls on the corners.''
</P>
<P>
   If Martinez needed a campaign manager for his second straight Cy
Young Award, he could do worse than DiSarcina, who struck out
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made me feel like a Little Leaguer out there,'' DiSarcina
said. ``We just have to move on. He was just incredible today. He's
probably the best pitcher I've seen since coming to the big
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin and Troy O'Leary each homered and doubled off
Black Jack McDowell as the Red Sox, facing a pitcher with a scarred
elbow for the second straight night, built a 6-1 lead through four
innings for Martinez, who gave up his only run on three singles in
the second but escaped further damage when Garret Anderson was
doubled off second on Matt Walbeck's shallow fly to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's got runners on base,'' said Darin Erstad, who had
one of the Angels' seven hits but failed to get the ball out of the
infield on his other three trips, ``it's turn out the lights.
Everything's a little sharper, a little harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The twilight drama then turned on whether the Sox would be able
to squeeze in the win before the rain gave the umpires other
thoughts. Play stopped for the first time in the middle of the
fourth inning, and pitching coach Joe Kerrigan acknowledged there
was some concern whether Martinez would resume pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the delay had gone more than an hour, we wouldn't have sent
him back out there,'' said Kerrigan, who not only had the usual
concerns about a pitcher's arm going tight during a long break, but
also fretted about Martinez's knee, which he injured last Sunday
when he stepped between the hole he made during his delivery and
that made by Twins pitcher Brad Radke. ``We got him a stretch, we
got him on the bike, then we went out and did some long toss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the second delay had been longer, we wouldn't have let him
go back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he was conscious of the knee while he pitched, but
it never became more than a minor irritant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the rain,'' he said. ``The rain feels good on my
body.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's win, coming after the Sox had absorbed back-to-back
losses to the A's and Angels, helped the team maintain its
eight-game advantage over the Texas Rangers in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he's out there, to stop the bad days,'' Valentin
said. ``That's when he's really tough, when you try to go after him
and you're losing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was asked if he'd given any thought of breaking out the
Yoda mask again, as he'd done Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' he said with a twinkle. ``That was Corsi.''

MERCURY CAN'T CLOSE DEAL  
 BLOWS 12-POINT LEAD; COMETS FORCE GAME 3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller said Game 2 of the WNBA
finals would be beyond war, more like Armageddon. And it seemed
like the end of the world afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Not just because Phoenix scored only seven points in the final
12:24, including overtime, to surrender a 12-point lead in dropping
Game 2, 74-69. Or even because the defending champion Houston
Comets (30-4) now have new life that the Mercury (22-13) will find
hard to extinguish in a decisive Game 3 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was Armageddon because of the toll exacted on both teams and
an emotionally wrought sellout of 16,285 at the Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Gillom, for the first time ever, hid in the training
room away from the media, literally sick to her stomach from a
3-for-15, eight-point performance that she felt let her team down.
Houston's Sheryl Swoopes had to cut an interview short and be
helped from the podium because of cramps in her calves and
hamstrings. The price of 21 points for the Mercury's Michele Timms
was scratches on the neck and a gouge under one of her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Coach Van Chancellor gave thanks for the two-day break
between Games 2 and 3, saying he was too spent to take the bench
any sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the furor, the most calm person was the least likely
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who picked up her second technical foul of the finals
and 13th of the season, was almost serene in her assessment, her
voice rising only at the suggestion of depression over one that got
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, did you not expect Houston to get back in this
game?'' she asked. ``C'mon, they're champions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets played that way when it was darkest, after trailing
for the final 12:50 of the first half and all of the second to the
brink of an embarrassing straight-game elimination.
</P>
<P>
   When Timms scored the last of her team-high points with 7:24
remaining, the Mercury had its largest lead, 62-50, and little
reason deep in the heart not to start the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But strange things began to happen after Gillom blocked a shot
by Janeth Arcain into the hands of Comets backup center Yolanda
Moore, who scored her only basket.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11 Arcain cooled off the 5-7 Timms, whose damage was
primarily against 5-5 Kim Perrot. And though the Mercury created
decent shots for Timms and the struggling Gillom, they wouldn't
fall and were not followed, allowing the Comets to run better than
they had all series.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper, the two-time league Most Valuable Player,
leading scorer and fourth-best free throw shooter, made only half
of her six tries from the free throw line in the final 6:24. But
those combined with a 7-foot hook, break layup after a Swoopes
block and three-pointer at 1:25 were 10 of Houston's points in a
16-2 run to a 66-64 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to step up,'' Cooper said. ``I'm the league MVP
and I have to play like the league MVP.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, behind for the first time since 13-12, stayed composed
despite the onslaught. Backup guard Kristi Harrower made a running
7-footer on the baseline for a tie, then Gillom rebounded a miss by
Tina Thompson with 31 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, Timms worked the clock to 10 and three passes
later had to force a three-pointer that bounced off the side of the
rim.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime was scoreless for 1:41 before Swoopes tipped away a
pass that started Cooper on a break layup. It was a lead the Comets
never lost.
</P>
<P>
   A short Gillom jumper made the score 70-69 halfway through
overtime, then Swoopes made a big-time 17-footer in heavy traffic
at 1:02. When Cooper was not whistled for landing on Timms off a
shot with under 30 seconds, Phoenix was out of chances and was
forced to win a rubber game, as in the best-of-three semifinals
against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran the offense and executed perfectly, ran time off the
clock, but we've got to get a rebound,'' said Timms, three points
shy of her WNBA scoring high. ``We just didn't crash the boards,
and that really hurt us in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did get 12 points up on them, and that's the way we're
going to look at it. As a positive thing rather than we got 12
points up and they came back and bit us in the bum.'' &QL;

JEFFERIES `THANKFUL' TO BE WITH ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gregg Jefferies joined the Angels on Saturday at Fenway
Park with 11 years of major-league experience, two All-Star Game
appearances and a .292 career lifetime batting average.
</P>
<P>
   But he also came with all the humility of a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in first place,'' said Jefferies, who started in left
field and batted leadoff Saturday. ``They don't need me. They got
to first place by themselves. I'm not going to come in here and
show them this or that. These guys are tremendous players. I'm very
thankful to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies, 31, was acquired Friday from the Phillies in exchange
for a player to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't pushing for it, but I heard rumblings the last four
days,'' Jefferies said of the trade. ``Obviously, I'm very excited.
I loved the guys in Philly, but they wanted to move in a different
direction. They're building with a youth movement, and that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies was highly touted when he reached the majors at age 20
with the Mets in 1987, but he didn't quite live up to the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first broke in in '87, I was supposed to be the next
Mickey Mantle,'' he said. ``I can't live up to that. You're talking
about one of the greatest players of all time. I've been in the
majors 11 years and I'm 31. I'm proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies' best season came in 1993 with the Cardinals when he
hit .342 (third in the NL) with 16 homers and 83 RBI in 142 games.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Jefferies on the roster, the Angels optioned
outfielder Reggie Williams to Double-A Midland. Williams will
rejoin the team Tuesday in Cleveland when rosters are expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro and Todd Greene also were affected by the
acquisition of Jefferies because they had been getting time in left
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (Greene, Palmeiro and Williams) this morning,''
manager Terry Collins said. ``I told them Gregg Jefferies can help
us. He's an outstanding offensive player. And you never know what's
going to happen. Someone could run into the center-field wall today
and you'll be our starting center fielder tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Taming the Monster: Fenway Park's Green Monster does not
intimidate center fielder Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to run over there and pay attention,'' Edmonds
said. ``It's not that big of a deal. You have to know right away
where it's going when the ball bounces off the wall and just go
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds said he likes Fenway better than Yankee Stadium and
Tiger Stadium _ two of the other old parks _ but it's not a good
hitter's park for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough place to hit for a lefty, it's 380 (feet) to
straight-away right field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Green Monster is added incentive for a
left-handed hitter to hit to the opposite field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could make you a better hitter,'' he said. ``But it's tough
to change your swing for one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds hurt: Edmonds had to leave the game after three innings
Saturday because his bruised ribs were bothering him. Edmonds, who
hurt his mid-section Aug. 21 crashing into the fence at Edison
Field and aggravated the condition Thursday crashing into the fence
at Yankee Stadium, went for precautionary X-rays after the game.
Results were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Comeback expert: Nobody was more upset with Troy Percival's
Friday night performance (one inning, three runs in 7-6 Angels win)
than Percival. But Percival has been through rough outings in the
past and managed to bounce back, which makes him able to thrive as
a closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Troy Percival could not handle nights like last night
...,'' Collins said. ``I'll tell you something, Troy Percival wants
the ball tonight so bad he can taste it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Darin Erstad has not hit a home run since July 10 at
Seattle off Mariners' Jamie Moyer.... The team that has scored
first has lost every game on the Angels' road trip.... Gary
DiSarcina moved past Bob Boone and into fifth place on the Angels'
all-time list for games played Saturday with 969.... Since Edmonds'
sixth-inning double Thursday in New York, the Angels have had 28
consecutive singles without an extra-base hit.... Wednesday's game
at Cleveland has been changed to a 4:35 p.m. PDT start to
accommodate ESPN.

CORKS SHOULD BE POPPING, BUT GOLDEN CHANCE MISSED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON - It should be over.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA champions should be flying home as heroes to a downtown
pep rally or parade.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Timms should be the first to hoist the trophy overhead,
after the heroic game she played.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Miller should be snapping her suspenders and saying it
ain't bragging if you do it. The coach had predicted months ago
they would _ remember? _ back when Miller identified the gender of
the league title, promising Phoenix fans the Mercury would ``bring
that bad boy home.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be over.
</P>
<P>
   As champs _ how good does that sound? _ they should be popping
corks.
</P>
<P>
   They had led by 12 points. Only 7{ minutes remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game'' _ and the title _ ``was ours,'' Mercury guard
Kristi Harrower said.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors in the orange uniforms had outworked and outplayed
the defending champion Houston Comets in Game 2 of this galactic
showdown. After a nine-point scoring run, the Mercury led, 62-50.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's star players, Cynthia Cooper _ the two-time league
Most Valuable Player _ and Sheryl Swoopes hadn't panicked, but you
could read the worry on their faces. The sellout crowd sensed it
was slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   In the huddle, during a timeout, Mercury players were wide-eyed.
Some glanced at the scoreboard to verify the score. Yes, it was
true. They almost could reach out and touch their dream. They were
``that'' close. They could ``taste'' it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mercury quit rebounding. Suddenly, the Comets began
running, and scoring _ six, eight, 10, 12, 13 points in a row. The
game grew as tight as the knot of Miller's necktie. Swoopes.
Cooper. Cooper. Cooper. Doesn't the woman know she should be tired?
She is 35 years old. The turnabout was startling, breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Mercury players sat in the chapel-like quiet
of their locker room, trying to digest what had just occurred. It
is the same locker room where the Suns had contemplated the end of
the 1994 season after losing to the Houston Rockets in Game 7 of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's game, Bryan Colangelo ran into Rockets owner
Les Alexander. As the two shook hands, Colangelo thought of the
disappointment he has experienced in this building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those (Rockets) series,'' Colangelo said, not to
Alexander, ``still make me ill.''
</P>
<P>
   After this one, a 74-69 overtime loss, Jennifer Gillom felt ill,
literally. Her teammates pasted on smiles for the cameras. They
reminded that the series isn't over, which is true. The Mercury has
another chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the players felt heartsick, and they should. They had
cornered the champs. They had them leaning against the ropes.
Unable to deliver the knockout punch, everything changed. Mercury
players needed no one to remind them they might not have another
opportunity as golden as this one.
</P>
<P>
   One can put two spins on this game, which was exciting and
entertaining from beginning to end. The Comets showed the heart of
a champion, corny as that phrase sounds. Or the Mercury blew a game
it ``should'' have won.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is what effect, if any, the loss will have on
the team's psyche. In this curious format, Game 3 won't be played
until Tuesday. If the series were ``Gone With the Wind,'' Scarlett
could have said Saturday, ``The day after the day after tomorrow is
another day.''
</P>
<P>
   How will the Mercury respond? Should the players be heartened,
or disheartened? If they are cut from the same competitive cloth as
Timms, who played 42 minutes and scored 21 points and guarded the
league MVP, this team will be OK.
</P>
<P>
   She is a resilient player, as tough in this league as they come.
After the game, Timms' cheek was nicked. She wore two long red
scratches on her throat like a necklace. ``I think we tried to
protect the lead, instead of trying to win the game,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   How about the scratches?
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical game,'' she said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Know how you cut your cheek?
</P>
<P>
   I liked her answer. ``Yeah, I was driving to the basket,'' Timms
said. ``I got to the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth it.'' &QL;

RED SOX BEAT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No task has been too tough for the Angels on their
current East Coast road swing. Not David Wells, not David Cone, not
... hold that thought.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Angels scored five runs and four runs in New York off
Cy Young Award candidates Wells and Cone, respectively, facing
Boston's Pedro Martinez was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got six hits off Martinez in the first three innings
Saturday, but Martinez regrouped after a 43-minute rain delay and
beat the Angels 6-1 before a sellout crowd of 32,519 at Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   The loss, coupled with Texas' win, reduced the Angels' AL West
lead to two games.
</P>
<P>
   There were two rain delays in the game, the first one coming in
the middle of the fourth inning and the second _ which lasted only
six minutes _ came in the middle of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   When the umpiring crew, led by crew chief Dave Phillips, called
the second one, the Angels were upset. They felt it had been
raining even harder during their at-bat in the top of the fifth,
but the umps let the game go on to guarantee it would become
official.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve infielder Craig Shipley, on the bench but on the
disabled list, was ejected by umpire Durwood Merrill when the
grounds crew was ordered to put the tarp on the field even though
the rain had let up a little.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumed after the second delay, the game zipped by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro pitched a great game, he's a good pitcher,'' Angels
designated hitter Tim Salmon said. ``If anything, the weather
helped him. The zone got bigger, it was a different game. I'm not
making any excuses, but it seemed that it wasn't a game that moved
along to our liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was throwing strikes and getting ahead, forcing you to
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (18-4) went eight innings, allowing only an RBI single
by Troy Glaus in the second inning and a total of seven hits. The
Angels had only one hit after the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know how somebody might come out of a rain delay,''
Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Pedro came out even better.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jack McDowell (3-3) not only didn't come out
better after the delay, he didn't come out at all. He gave up five
runs and six hits in three innings before the first delay, and was
replaced by Omar Olivares when the game resumed in the bottom of
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored two in the second and three more in the third
_ getting home runs from John Valentin and Troy O'Leary _ to take a
5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get ahead (in the count),'' McDowell said after his
first loss in three starts since returning from the disabled list.
``When I threw first-pitch strikes, I hung a couple. I didn't have
good command within the zone today.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell added that it was probably a good idea he didn't pitch
after the delay but did say he could do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been better after rain delays,'' he said. ``You
get loose, then you get a breather. It's a fallacy when guys talk
about it in the (TV) booth _ `He's going to stiffen up' _ you only
stiffen up if you're hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, nothing really seemed to matter with Martinez
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen Pedro throw more off-speed pitches than he did
today,'' said left fielder Gregg Jefferies, who went 1 for 4 in his
Angels debut. ``Obviously, it's working for him. But he's a
different pitcher than when he was in the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real good, there's no way to get around it,'' Collins
said. ``Early in the game we had a couple opportunities. You have
to really jump on the good ones because they do get better as the
game goes along.

HAARHUIS A SINGULAR SENSATION IN SEMIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE _ Paul Haarhuis has built his reputation on doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Haarhuis and his partner Jacco Eltingh have won 43 career
doubles titles, including seven this year, including Wimbledon and
the French Open. They are the only doubles team in the open era to
win all four Grand Slam crowns.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in singles that the unseeded Haarhuis made a
statement Saturday, defeating third-seeded Cedric Pioline, 7-5,
3-6, 6-3, in the semifinals of the MFS Pro Championships at
Longwood Cricket Club to reach his first singles final since losing
to Michael Chang at Indian Wells in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Haarhuis will play Chang, the No. 4 seed, who defeated qualifier
Sebastien Grosjean, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3, in last night's second
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   There were three service breaks in the third set; Chang two, the
last in the eighth game, to go ahead, 5-3. Chang served out,
knocking away two break points and winning on his first match point
when Grosjean hit a forehand long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good tennis, not an easy point to be had,'' said the
22d-ranked Chang, who hasn't won a tournament this year and has
been in three finals. ``Grosjean is a tough player, he's dangerous
the way he plays, especially with his serve. He doesn't look like
he generates much on it but he does. I felt I played good tennis,
although it was a tough match for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang has a 6-1 record vs. Haarhuis, someone he's hit with in
practice. ``Paul's not easy and he's had a real good week,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Haarhuis was ranked 19th in singles in 1995, 25th in 1996, and
then dropped to 71 when the 1997 season concluded. Now he's at 85
and his better days in singles have passed.
</P>
<P>
   Haarhuis has played only 11 tournaments this year. He gained a
wild card into the MFS Pro, mainly for doubles, which he and
Eltingh won last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some seasons you play less than other seasons,'' said the
32-year-old Dutchman, whose only singles title came in Jakarta in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play as much this year; my wife and I had a child in
February, and I didn't play the first six weeks and I didn't win
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then in March I got injured, basically for the first time
in a long time, and I couldn't play until the French Open. You lose
points and your form isn't as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Haarhuis broke Pioline at love in the eighth game of the third
set, as Pioline hit three shots wide, two on his backhand, and
Haarhuis socked a forehand winner up the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up with some good shots,'' said Haarhuis, ``and I
tried to stay aggressive and I came up with some good shots on the
first serve to save some break points. He returned well and I had
to make some aces.''
</P>
<P>
   Haarhuis had 12 aces, something he couldn't quite believe. Three
came in the final game of the match.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth game, Haarhuis held off two break points before
closing out the match on his second opportunity. He reached that
last point when Pioline's backhand volley found the net, and won
with a service winner to the backhand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a good match,'' Pioline said. ``He took all the
chances and it worked. He's got a good serve and he's trying to
come in all the time so you never know if he's going to come in and
go to the net. It's difficult to choose what shot you want to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good on the serve-and-volley with a very good backhand.
He knows how to play every shot so I tried to mix them up. I
basically went after his backhand.''
</P>
<P>
   Haarhuis won the first set when Pioline double faulted for a
break in the 12th game, just his second double fault of the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a couple of bad points, including on that double
fault,'' Pioline said, ``so I gave him the first set.''
</P>
<P>
   The match, lasting an hour and 55 minutes, was quite even.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good match from the start, with no easy games for him
and no easy games for me,'' Haarhuis said. ``It looked like we
matched each other well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioline won the second set, breaking Haarhuis in the ninth game
when he managed just one point on his serve.
</P>
<P>
   Haarhuis had to avoid Pioline's ability to open each side of the
court with his groundstrokes. ``He has a heavy forehand and a heavy
backhand and he can pull away the court,'' Haarhuis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to take the ball on the rise, especially on my
backhand side, and play fast so he'd be on his back foot trying to
hit those shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Haarhuis is looking for the $45,000 winner's check.

`LAWN' A GREAT PLACE TO BEE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - Desert landscaping is in vogue among those who place
the environment at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   Using native plants in a yard conserves water, invites wildlife
and is extremely attractive to those who have been in the desert
long enough to appreciate it. A well-kept grass lawn may be
beautiful in the eyes of some beholders, but it certainly isn't
native to the desert.
</P>
<P>
   I came to the desert in the 1970s, planted grass, saw the error
in my ways and converted. Well, compromised. There's some rock,
some flowering shrubs, cactuses and other low-water consumers. A
drip system maintains the shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, for a variety of reasons, the yard became wildlife
habitat. A little nightshade, some Mexican sandbur, some weeds I
can't identify _ about everything except Russian thistle.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors were so impressed that they entered my lawn in the
Worst of Phoenix Contest. I believe I'll win. The size of my weeds
(desert habitat) alone should do it.
</P>
<P>
   I knew I was harboring wildlife in this exotic paradise,
especially ants. But Saturday morning I discovered that there was
much more.
</P>
<P>
   I put off everything until it reaches epidemic proportions. In
my wisdom, I scheduled a house painter and lawn people at the same
time. At 5:45 a.m., people started showing up.
</P>
<P>
   The painter, who had started the day before, was preparing to
spray. The Hernandezes were working the lawn. That's when the
problem arose. Ramon pointed out the bees and hornets.
</P>
<P>
   They were everywhere in the desert habitat (weeds). You don't
expect to see honey bees and yellow jackets hanging out together.
Perhaps they were interbreeding. At least, they were socializing.
It was a big party, too.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, when we were examining the situation, the bees and
hornets got surly. Everyone headed for the hills. I went one way,
the lawn people another and the indignant painter another. He said
he'd sue if he got stung. I offered to buy him a bottle of whiskey.
That soothed his savage breast.
</P>
<P>
   I got great advice from a lady across the street, who was
preparing her investment property for new prospects. She said to
spray the area with a combination of soap and water. It keeps the
beasts from flying. It helped.
</P>
<P>
   But about that time, the painter told me to stay inside or
outside the house. He had to tape shut the doors and windows to
spray the place. I have been trapped inside, away from my desert
paradise. All of them wish me gone. I can hear from the inside that
the ants bit the lawn persons. The painter is threatening to paint
my windows.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps grass would be a better option. Who wants javelina in
their yards? Especially bees? &QL; 
Dove season begins &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dove season opens Tuesday. It lasts through the 15th of
September. In the southern part of the state, the shoot is in the
morning only. In the north, it's all day.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which area you're hunting, you need a Harvest
Information Stamp. It is an attempt to give the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service information on migrating birds. Game and Fish
offices offer them for free.
</P>
<P>
   This should be a great dove season. The Powers Butte Wildlife
Area south of Buckeye is packed with doves, and the juniors-only
hunt should be decent next Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Youth through age 15 are eligible. They will be given a special
place to shoot if they're drawn for a spot. An adult must accompany
them.
</P>
<P>

IN PRIME TIME, SWOOPES TAKES LEAD ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Sheryl Swoopes was channel surfing Saturday morning
and came across Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   Not in a Clean Shower commercial or with that bratty little girl
for Nike, but on ``Hang Time,'' an NBC teenage sitcom with the
non-Title IX premise of a boys basketball team with a female star.
The episode was about a lost rare coin and basketball campers lost
in a storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got to see a different side of Sheryl,'' Swoopes said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, on the same network, the nation saw the
basketball side of Swoopes, who transformed what appeared to be a
lost opportunity into a heart-pounding victory.
</P>
<P>
   Her 13 rebounds, bettering a pro career high of 11 set two days
earlier, and four points in overtime helped the Houston Comets
subdue the Mercury, 74-69, in Game 2 of the WNBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   The frontcourt trio of Swoopes, Tina Thompson and Monica Lamb
all reached double-figure scoring (38 points combined) to
supplement 27 from league scoring leader Cynthia Cooper. Cooper had
29 in Game 1, but her teammates combined for only 22 in a 54-51
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got down about 10 points (12), the only people who
believed we could come back were our fans and us,'' Swoopes said.
``We always believed we could win this game. It never crossed my
mind that we weren't going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Swoopes limped off the interview platform with help,
telling Cooper she in severe pain. The team physician, Jon Divine,
later explained, ``If you imagine what it feels like to wake up in
the middle of the night with a cramp, that is what happened up
here. Cramps are pretty painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes missed the first 19 games last season after giving birth
and made her WNBA debut against the Mercury, which now probably
wishes that she were a stay-at-home mom.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking off 3-for-14 shooting in Game 1 as if it never occurred,
Swoopes was 7 for 16 for 14 points, offsetting her six turnovers
with five assists. She also added two steals and a pair of blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Her sizzling 17-footer at 1:02 of overtime bumped the Comets
back ahead by three, allowing the defending champions to close the
door with defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They blew the lead because we started to play defense,''
Cooper said. ``During the timeout (before a free throw that put the
Mercury ahead by 12), we said, `Let's rebound the ball and get the
job done on defense, and everything else will fall in place.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When we walked onto the court, we were committed to that. We
didn't say, `Let's make a three-pointer or a great jump shot' like
Sheryl did. We got it done on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston managed a slim rebounding edge, 36-33, with most of the
boards from Swoopes and Thompson (12). That was in contrast to a
41-32 rebounding deficit in Game 1. The Comets shot 43.1 percent, a
considerable improvement from Thursday (32.3).
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes needed no aid in leaving the Compaq Center, unlike in
early July, when she was hospitalized because of to dehydration.
And unlike Aug. 4, when a stiff neck kept her out of the second
half against Utah. That was the same week that Cooper went public
with her complaints about lack of team play.
</P>
<P>
   Few think the Comets will continue to force the Cooper-Swoopes
marriage next season, but one game remains before a possible
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   If they win a second title, maybe they keep it together for the
kids (of Houston). Lose, stamp on irreconcilable difference and
flip a coin to decide whom to keep: Cooper at age 35 or Swoopes at
27. &QL;

HARROWER IMPRESSES COMETS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston Coach  &UR; Van Chancellor didn't even take a swipe
at
 &UR; Kristi Harrower's name in discussing what he expects from the
Mercury in the decisive Game 3 of the WNBA finals on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how (No.) 4 can play any better,'' Chancellor said
after his Comets escaped with a 74-69 overtime win Saturday to
force a tiebreaker. ``I don't want to slaughter her name.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrower, the 5-foot-4 backup to Mercury starting point guard
 &UR; Michele Timms, almost killed the Comets' title repeat aspirations
with a career-high 12 points. She and Timms, with 21, were the only
Phoenix players in double figures as center  &UR; Jennifer Gillom was
held under her regular season average for the third consecutive
game.
</P>
<P>
   With five points, including the second of her three-pointers,
Harrower led a 12-2 Mercury run that opened a 62-50 lead with 7:24
remaining. And her running 7-footer at the one-minute mark were the
final points before overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kim) Perrot ran at me, so I just took it to the key,'' said
Harrower, who had seven points in Game 1 and now has scored almost
as many points as Gillom (23-19) in the series. ``She nearly kicked
me out of bounds to start with. That's the way I have to shoot them
on a runner because they're just giants inside.'' &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
The second WNBA postseason tour will be to Brazil for three games.
Dates and players are yet to be announced, but a pre-tour camp will
begin Sept. 19 with practices divided between the 1999 expansion
cities, Orlando and Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star team that toured Europe last fall included Timms.
Chancellor, the two-time WNBA Coach of the Year, will direct the
Brazilian tour that includes a game against Polti, for whom the
Comets'  &UR; Janeth Arcain also plays.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA President &UR; Val Ackerman said the Minnesota franchise has
achieved its required 5,000 season ticket sales before a Tuesday
deadline. Earlier, Orlando passed that hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   A site for the first WNBA All-Star Game, to be held in mid-July
1999, has not been selected, but it will be a league city, Ackerman
said. Attendance leaders Washington, New York (where the league
office is located), Phoenix and Houston are the leading
candidates. &QL;

TILLMAN MAKES PRESENCE FELT AGAINST RAID ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Veteran wide receiver  &UR; Kenny Shedd of the Oakland
Raiders knew all about Cardinals rookie safety  &UR; Pat
Tillman's &UR; reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Tillman knocked him groggy on a crossing pattern early in
the fourth quarter Saturday, and Shedd learned firsthand in the
Cardinals' 21-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about this guy all week, that he's supposed to bring
the wood,'' Shedd said. ``He hit me pretty hard on that one, but I
wasn't going to let him stand over me as I was knocked out. I have
to admit I was a little fuzzy. He laid a good one on me. It was
solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third quarter, Tillman, a seventh-round pick from
Arizona State, had his first interception. He picked off a pass
from  &UR; Donald
 &UR; Hollas that was intended for fullback  &UR; Randy Jordan. &UR; Tillman
returned it nine yards to the Raiders 43 to set up the game-tying
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to do something that was worth all my (friends and
family) coming out,'' said Tillman, a native of San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman finished the preseason as the team's leading tackler
with 25, including a team-high nine against the Raiders. &QL; 
Playing with pain
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback  &UR; Stoney Case won't forget the late hit Raiders
defensive end  &UR; Aundray Bruce put on him in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce was called for roughing the passer, giving the Cardinals a
first down at the Raiders 17.
</P>
<P>
   But Case had to leave the game for a play because of an injury
he first thought was a dislocated left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't put it back in,'' Case said. ``Then, right when the
doctors got to me, I was able to maneuver and get it back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bruce) took four steps and pounded me. It was excessive. He
knew the ball was gone.'' &QL; 
Knockout punch
</P>
<P>
   Rookie running back  &UR; Michael Pittman not only scored three
touchdowns, he also made a crushing block on the Raiders'  &UR; John
Henry
 &UR; Mills on the opening kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so hyped,'' said Pittman, who attended Fresno State, 2{
hours south of Oakland. ``I didn't care if he was bigger than I
was, I just tried to put my helmet to his chest. He fell to the
ground, and I jumped on him. I blew him up.'' &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   After gaining only 28 yards on 23 carries a week ago, the
Cardinals rushed for 100 yards, twice as many as the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   When Cardinals linebacker  &UR; Jamir Miller had a sack early in the
second quarter, the Oakland native celebrated by doing a bump and
grind. ``That's just doing the thing,'' said Miller, who played two
series.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders backup defensive tackle  &UR; Chuck Osborne, &UR; out of Arizona,
had three sacks, two forced fumbles and seven tackles. &QL;

SERIES WIN OVER YANKEES SHOWS ANGELS' METTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the third time in four years the Anaheim Angels will enter
September in a strong position to reach the playoffs. The big
question in the land of Disney is whether this finally will be the
year the Angels return to the postseason, a place they haven't
visited since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The signs point to this year being different for the Angels,
whose clubs of 1995 and '96 are best remembered for fading down the
stretch. The current Angels, under the aggressive eye of Manager
 &UR; Terry Collins, are scrapping and playing with far more confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to make a statement or send a message,''
Collins said during the Yankees series. ``We're simply trying to
win a pennant. We should be loose. Nobody expects us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Victories in three of five games at Yankee Stadium last week
indicate these Angels are not about to bow to anyone. In fact, it
came very close to being a five-game sweep for Anaheim, which lost
the last game in 11 innings and the other in the bottom of the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how we feel about each other and what we are doing,''
shortstop  &UR; Gary DiSarcina said, ``and I think it's something to be
proud of the way we're playing these guys. I mean, it's a pressure
cooker. Every guy they send up there can do some damage. You can't
give them an extra out. You have to keep grinding, and the key is
not to be intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   This Anaheim club is a far cry from the one Angels President
 &UR; Tony
 &UR; Tavares categorized just two years ago as soft and too worried
about looking good at the beach. The Angels, who still have a
battle on their hands with second-place Texas, are giving the
appearance that they are not prepared to be compared to the '95 and
'96 clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can put it in our back pocket as a confidence booster if we
run into tough times,'' added DiSarcina, among the most underrated
shortstops in the game. ``I also don't think that in 1995 or '96
we'd have hung in against a team of this caliber. We were a little
too young then. We'd have been intimidated. Experience is an
important factor.'' &QL; 
One true blue man &QL; 
Former Los Angeles Dodger General Manager  &UR; Al Campanis, who passed
away a few weeks ago, probably was the most miscast person in
baseball in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   A true champion for the rights of minorities in baseball,
Campanis' hard work was basically forgotten because of several
misstatements made during an interview on Nightline with Ted Koppel
more than 10 years before his death.
</P>
<P>
   At his recent funeral in Southern California, the credo Campanis
lived by was printed on the back of his eulogy. It was titled
``Anyway.'' See Beyond the Boxscore for the full text. &QL; 
Downsizing the Unit &QL; 
There is growing frustration in Seattle, where the front office is
watching  &UR; Randy Johnson pitch the way he did in winning the Cy
Young Award in 1995. Johnson was 9-10 with a 4.33 ERA for the
Mariners before being traded to Houston on July 31. He has since
gone 5-1, with a 1.17 ERA for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to see that someone's performance can turn around
so abruptly as Randy has made his,'' Mariners assistant GM  &UR; Lee
Pelekoudas said. ``It makes you wish he had shown the same
intensity and drive when he was with us that he is showing now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read in spring training where Randy said, `What's the
incentive to work hard?' He was being paid $6 million to do a job
here. I would think that would help anyone's work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong belief is that Pelekoudas was not just speaking for
himself but Seattle's front office, as well. &QL; 
GM for LA? &QL; 
With Los Angeles seemingly in tent on hiring a real general manager
for the 1999 season, the top-shelf candidates include (in order)
 &UR; Jim Bowden of Cincinnati and &UR; Dave Dombrowski of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Those with an outside chance (not in order) include  &UR; Bob Watson,
formerly with the Yankees, Baltimore assistant  &UR; Kevin Malone,
Atlanta assistant  &UR; Dean Taylor and Mets assistant  &UR; Omar Minaya. One
possible dark horse is  &UR; Kevin Kennedy, who came up as a manager in
the Dodgers system.
</P>
<P>
   Current interim GM  &UR; Tommy Lasorda, who turns 71 Sept. 22, now
insists he does not want the demanding position. Several sources
indicate Lasorda is eyeing the post of club president, a much
cushier position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a job for a younger guy,'' Lasorda said. ``I really
enjoy it, but it's just too much. I'll be 71 next month. If I was
10 years younger, I would really love to have it.'' &QL; 
Sad but true &QL; 
A regrettable situation arose in Denver last week in which a local
member of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) was
seen taking an item out of Colorado outfielder  &UR; Dante Bichette's
locker.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rockies were on the field taking batting practice, a
time when the clubhouse is closed to all media, Denver Post
columnist  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Kiszla took a vial of Androstenedione, the suddenly controversial
nutritional supplement, out of Bichette's locker.
</P>
<P>
   Kiszla's punishment was having his BBWAA privileges revoked for
the remainder of the season, with a review for the 1999 season to
take place during the World Series. In a time when relations
between players and reporters are becoming more strained, it was
noteworthy to see the BBWAA's leadership take such swift and
effective action.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies will refuse to issue Kiszla credentials, basically
banning the columnist from Coors Field. Major League Baseball
executives were pleased to see the BBWAA police itself with such
authority. &QL;

 &QL; 
 &UR; The credo the late Al Campanis, longtime Dodgers executive, lived
 &UR; by:
</P>
<P>
   ``ANYWAY''
</P>
<P>
   People are unreasonable, illogical and self-centered. Love them
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior
motives. Do good anyway.

Succeed anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow. Do good
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable. Be honest and frank
anyway.
</P>

   People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs. Fight for some

</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; He's keeping his priorities consistent: Florida owner/blight  &UR; Wayne
Huizenga recently paid $7.5 million for a house on Nantucket
Island. His current roster of Marlins, a despicable farce that is
called the defending World Series champions, combined earn less
than that figure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Was the electric chair considered? When asked what he planned
to do with his outfielder's glove now that it has been mutually
decided the  &UR; Todd Hundley-as-outfielder experiment is officially
over, Hundley offered this: ``Burn it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Further proof of how the great home run chase of '98
 &UR; is affecting the season: For the first time since Three Rivers
Stadium opened in 1970, the Pittsburgh Pirates sold out consecutive
regular season games last weekend. The attraction?  &UR; Mark McGwire
was in town.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Kiko Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How could anyone pass on this one:  &UR; Kerry Would, the horse, won
and paid $5.80 at Chicago's Hawthorne Race Course two days before
 &UR; Kerry Wood, the pitcher, beat Cincinnati last week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Great Lines Dept. presents: From  &UR; John Lopez of the
``Houston Chronicle:'' ``The Astros have a 9{-game lead on the Cubs
with 31 games remaining. France has surrendered its flag on
less.'' &QL; EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget that  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr. could have been joining
McGwire this season as the only players with at least 50 home runs
in three consecutive seasons. Griffey, who hit 56 last year and is
on pace for 53 this season, finished with 49 in 1996. He hit a home
run on Sept. 6 that year that was wiped out because the game was
called before it went five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Let's also hope National League managers and coaches remember
Cincinnati second baseman  &UR; Bret Boone when it comes time to voting
for Gold Gloves. Boone is on pace to lead the league in fielding
percentage for the second straight season. Amazingly, he never has
won a Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's  &UR; Andruw Jones, at 21 years, 125 days, became the
youngest player ever to hit 20 home runs and steal 20 bases in the
same season. Houston's  &UR; Cesar Cedeno previously held the record at
21 years, 181 days in 1972. One note: Cedeno hit 20 homers and
stole 55 bases. Jones has 23 home runs and 20 steals.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Manager  &UR; Art Howe did his pre-game radio interview
Wednesday while sitting in the only red chair among the 33,871 at
Fenway Park's otherwise sea of green seats. It's the historic seat
deep in right field, the one where  &UR; Ted Williams blasted a
500-foot-plus home run in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's  &UR; Dmitri Young entered the weekend with 42 doubles,
nine behind the club franchise record and the major league record
for a switch-hitter, both held by  &UR; Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox are so jacked up over their young
prospects that they recently sought additional money to field an
instructional league program that will work in conjunction with the
Diamondbacks and Colorado in Tucson. &QL; THE RUMOR
MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With center field serving as a hole in their lineup, the
Colorado Rockies last week dispatched scout  &UR; Dan Gladden to
Minneapolis to watch potential free agent  &UR; Bernie Williams of the
New York Yankees. The Rockies also have an eye on  &UR; Brian Jordan of
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego basically has decided on a three-man rotation for the
playoffs. The three are  &UR; Kevin Brown,  &UR; Andy Ashby and
 &UR; Sterling Hitchock.  &UR; Joey Hamilton will replace Hitchock if the
Padres open the playoffs against right-handed-heavy Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling Los Angeles pitcher  &UR; Carlos Perez, acquired from
Montreal on July 31, may be asked to move to the bullpen. If so,
Perez said, in no uncertain terms, that he will ``retire or ask for
a trade. . . . Why are they talking stuff about me already? They
don't even know me.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado pitcher  &UR; John Thomson, who looked like a lock to win 15
after his first start in April, is tinkering with a change-up. If
mastered, it will only make Thomson a better pitcher in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Calgary Cannons in the Pacific Coast League
may keep  &UR; Jim Abbott from being called up to the White Sox sooner
than he expected. Calgary is close to clinching a playoff berth and
probably will need him to advance. &QL;

BREWERS HIT TING COACH RETURNS TO LIFE HE LOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When Milwaukee Brewers Manager Phil Garner called Jim
Lefebvre about a month ago, it had nothing to do with the pitching
machine Lefebvre sold to Garner last year for his son, Ty, now a
freshman baseball player at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers had just fired Lamar Johnson as their hitting coach,
and Garner wanted to know whether Lefebvre was interested in the
job. Lefebvre, who lives in Scottsdale, said he would think about
it, talk with his family, consider the options. In other words,
wait. But Lefebvre pretty much knew the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had started to realize that it gets inside your bones and
your blood, and it never really leaves,'' said Lefebvre, the new
Brewers hitting coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' was wearing the uniform again, being part of a team,
competing _ the only life he knew for more than 35 years as a
player, coach and major and minor league manager. Lefebvre, who
managed the Phoenix Triple-A team in 1985 and 1986 and went on to
manage Seattle and the Chicago Cubs from 1989 through 1993, last
experienced ``it'' in 1995, when he was Oakland's hitting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the intense, energetic Lefebvre, 56, was far removed
from the game. He calls himself an ambassador for Major League
Baseball International, but what he really does is missionary work,
teaching and preaching the gospel of baseball abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He worked on Firebirds broadcasts for two years. He sells
pitching machines. He co-founded Athletes for Youth, an anti-drug
organization, and helped start a unique facility in Scottsdale he
said provides high-performance, Olympic-type training for young
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Lefebvre said he valued the time spent with his wife, Ruth, and
four children (his oldest son, Ryan, is a Minnesota Twins
broadcaster). Being away from the game ``let the air clear,'' he
said. But he knew he would come back. All he needed was his
family's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said to go where your heart is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He followed his heart and his cheesehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being part of a ``team,'' representing a ``team,'' those are
the days I cherish,'' Lefebvre said in the visitors dugout at Bank
One Ballpark on Saturday. ``You miss the competitiveness. It never
really left. You try to block it out, but you miss those moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefebvre, who co-wrote a book, ``The Making of a Hitter,'' with
his father, is acutely sensitive to being a midseason replacement.
Johnson was popular with the players, some of whom believe he was
made a fall guy. But Garner wanted someone more forceful.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, he found him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely a hands-on guy,'' third baseman Jeff Cirillo
said of Lefebvre. `I like that intensity, that fired-up attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Garner said, ``I wanted a big name that had credibility and a
long track record of teaching. A guy that's aggressive. He fit the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to go from one extreme to the other. I thought Lamar
Johnson was a good hitting coach, but he had sort of a quiet
demeanor. Studious. More laid-back. Now I've gone the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefebvre likes to say he didn't leave but was ``on sabbatical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife asked me how I felt,'' he said, ``and I said after
three days, it was like I never missed a beat.'' &QL;

UMPIRES ARE DRUNK ON POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can hold grudges. You can play favorites. You can eat
yourself into the grave.
</P>
<P>
   You can squeeze a pitcher, invent your own strike zone, act like
a dictator presiding over a Third World country.
</P>
<P>
   You have no fear of punishment. You never worry about demotions.
You are appointed for life, a member of baseball's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   You are an umpire. And you are drunk on power.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mark McGwire argued a questionable called third
strike and was thrown out of the game. In the first inning. By a
rookie umpire who almost incited a riot, prompting fans to throw
debris on the field, halting the game for nearly 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Sam Holbrook, and if McGwire ends up with 60 home
runs when the season ends, he will go down in infamy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, rules are rules, and no one likes to see an umpire with a
face full of loogey. But McGwire is singularly responsible for the
rebirth of baseball, the man who triggered this delicious season of
swat. He is not known as a hothead, a man who hadn't been ejected
in more than a year. If ever a scenario screamed for a little
tolerance and common sense, this was it.
</P>
<P>
   More than 47,000 people were at Busch Stadium on Saturday.
Surely, a few were attending their only game of the season. They
came to see McGwire. They ended up with Holbrook. &QL; 
Most pressing issue &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As baseball tries to right the ship and ride a new wave of
popularity into the next millennium, plenty of issues are on the
agenda, from androstenedione to bench-clearing brawls to the
dysfunctional concept of revenue sharing. But nothing is more
pressing than reeling in the men in blue.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a blanket indictment because there are competent,
conscientious umpires who know their place in the game. But they
are a minority, and in a season already marred by an abundance of
bad calls, the problem is growing.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't think an umpire can influence the outcome of a
game, know this: A few years ago, a study was done on umpires who
worked behind the plate a minimum of 75 times over a three-year
period. In the American League, walk rates varied from 5.6 per game
to 8.11 depending on the umpire. Strikeouts per game ranged from
10.4 to 12.2. Runs scored varied from 7.8 to 9.8.
</P>
<P>
   That's too much subjectivity for any sport that wants to be
taken seriously. And it's too much ambiguity for any athlete to
swallow without an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the hypocrisy of umpires. Any commentary
regarding balls and strikes warrants an automatic ejection, a credo
that umpires rigorously enforce. And yet they blatantly ignore and
disrespect the strike zone as described in the same book of rules.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they have taken over the game. &QL; 
Sacred strike zone &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Bud Selig wants to make a lasting imprint on the
commissioner's office, he should start with umpire reform. Declare
the strike zone a sacred entity. Demand uniformity and consistency
from the home plate umpire. Appoint an independent office to judge
umpires on merit, along with the power to send blatant offenders to
the minor leagues. Require a certain fitness level because hustle
calls are part of the game, and there's no room for Jabba the Hutt.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is that somewhere along the line, baseball messed up. It
allowed union boss Richie Phillips, a well-coifed blowhard, to
carve an impenetrable niche for his men. It relinquished enough
power for the umpires union to grow strong and ornery, a lethal
combination.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a full-blown assault to regain control. But for the
sake of baseball, it's time for the umpires to get out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1997, after the Roberto Alomar spitting
incident, the umpires went public with their new strategy. They
said it was time to get tough. In a revealing statement released by
Jerry Crawford and Don Denkinger, they explained that ``tolerance
in baseball is leading to total anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   They were right. The problem is tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance toward umpires and their bloated sense of importance. &QL;

JELLS HOPES TO CATCH ROSTER SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Dietrich Jells left Foxboro Stadium Saturday night
confident he would get a good night's sleep. The Patriots'
third-year wide receiver had no idea whether his stellar effort in
New England's final exhibition game was enough to convince coaches
to look include him on the 53-man roster. He certainly has given
them something to think about.
</P>
<P>
   And he could not have done so at a better time. Entering last
night's contest against the Philadelphia Eagles with only one
catch, for 12 yards, Jells staged the team's best offensive showing
with two catches for 59 yards, both going for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a 50-yard post-pattern from third-string
quarterback Tom Tupa. ``I was tired at first, but (Tupa) called a
post, so I livened up real quick,'' he said. ``I knew I had an
opportunity to get the ball, so I said, `I have to get the ball.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both scores came after Jells fumbled on the second half kickoff
at the New England 6. He managed to recover his own fumble, but the
miscue left the Patriots deep in their territory, and they gave the
ball up three plays later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased (with Jells). He did a great job when he had his
opportunities and came through,'' said coach Pete Carroll. ``And I
liked that he bounced back after missing the kickoff. We obviously
put him back there to see what he could do there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether that was enough to earn Jells a roster spot,
Carroll said, ``I don't know. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Jells was claimed by the Patriots off waivers Aug. 21, 1996 from
the Kansas City Chiefs, the team that originally drafted him (sixth
round) that season. He entered this season's training camp with one
reception in each of the last two seasons. He had one start in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   And if getting opportunities the last two seasons has been
difficult, it was downright improbable this season. The Patriots _
a team with a relatively young receiving corps _ entered training
camp with 12 wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's effort, he said, was a matter of getting an
opportunity. He declined to speculate as to whether he thought
there would be more. ``I try not to worry about that,'' he said.
``Whatever is going to happen, happens. I can only control what I
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jells said he knew chances would come last night because the
roster was down. ``Before we had a lot of receivers,'' he said.
``They were giving different people a lot of looks. My mindset for
this game was to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the botched kickoff, Jells said the same scenario
occurred last season against Denver. ``I got my opportunity (on
the) kickoff, and I dropped the ball and it was the first one I did
all year. I said to myself that I can't squander these
opportunities. But I got other opportunities and I made the most of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jells said he would sleep well Saturday night because he was
bound for his hometown of Pittsburgh Sunday. He didn't even know
when the final roster would be trimmed. But he said he hopes to get
to the point where he isn't battling for a roster spot each season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come into every season fighting for my life, basically,'' he
said. ``Wherever I'm at, I just want an opportunity to contribute.
It's so hard being a fifth receiver. All your opportunities are on
special teams, unless someone gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole thing is to get in and make plays. Before I said I
wanted to start this year, and that was unrealistic. My goal now is
to start one game, and then go from there.''

EDWARDS STILL A MYSTERY IN BACKFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ If Darth Vader was coaching the New England
Patriots instead of Pete Carroll, he might assess No. 1 draft
choice Robert Edwards's performance Saturday night thusly:
</P>
<P>
   ``Impressive. Most impressive. But you are not a Jedi yet!''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the running back out of Georgia made his first
extended appearance of the summer count for something in the
Patriots' final exhibition game, a 24-7 win over the Philadelphia
Eagles, but how much he can be counted on remained an unanswered
question when the night's work was concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards did enough in the first half to make clear that he has
something his contemporaries in New England do not, which is
quickness into the hole, but he did not do enough to make clear
that he has what it takes to come out of those holes in the same
fashion or to make anyone forget the man who used to run through
those holes _ the gone but not quite forgotten Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards carried 15 times for 38 yards against a Philadelphia
defense that is, to be kind, something less than formidable. That
defense was 25th against the run a year ago and is no better this
season, yet in the first half, when the starting units were facing
off, it held the Patriots to a by-now-familiar 2.2 yards a carry
(18 rushes for 39 yards) and Edwards to 34 yards on 13 carries, a
2.6-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, Edwards's troublesome groin did not seem to
hamper him for the first time since mid-July. On one play, in fact,
he bolted loose for a 9-yard gain. He regularly got into the holes
faster than either Sedrick or Harold Shaw, his competition for the
starting halfback job.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, Edwards averaged 2.5 yards a carry for the game
and finished the summer averaging 2.8 (21 carries for 58 yards), in
keeping with the team's sad rushing performance throughout the
exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   In five exhibition games, the Patriots rushed for 501 yards on
176 carries, a per-rush average of 2.85 yards. That is nearly a
yard and a half per carry less than Martin produced a season ago,
when he was hurt most of the time and still finished with more than
1,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The offense has been saying that rushing average is less
important than the fact that they have been having fewer runs for
negative yardage than a year ago and have been, according to
lineman Max Lane, gaining the tough yards when they needed them.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, that was true on a third-and-1 at the Eagles 6
on the game's opening drive. Edwards gained 3 tough yards to set up
a touchdown pass from Drew Bledsoe to Troy Brown for a 7-0 lead.
Later in the first quarter, Edwards did the same on a third-and-2
situation, bursting through for 9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, in the second quarter Edwards failed on third and 2
at the Eagle 7, gaining but 1 yard, and then was stopped for no
gain trying to go wide after Carroll decided to go for it on fourth
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to learn at this level everybody is fast,'' Edwards
said. ``That situation called for a pound (it) run.''
</P>
<P>
   Added all together, what did Saturday night's performance tell
us about Edwards and New England's running game as the season
opener in Denver looms a week from Monday?
</P>
<P>
   It tells us that what Darth Vader would have said is true.
Robert Edwards is different from the backs with whom he's presently
sharing the position. He has more quickness, softer hands when
catching the ball out of the backfield, and what some coaches call
``shake,'' which is the ability to make an initial tackler miss
from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   But what we do not know is what we nervously want to know. We do
not know if he can run anything like Martin, because he hasn't yet.
But his chances have been limited by a sore groin, so who can say
he will or he won't? We do not even know if he can run well enough
often enough when the Patriots need the tough yardage that Lane
said they'd been getting all summer, because although he did it on
two occasions Saturday night, he also failed on two others. So
there you have it.
</P>
<P>
   With the season opener eight days away, then, what we know about
the Patriots running game in the post-Curtis Martin Era is what we
knew on July 19, the day training camp opened.
</P>
<P>
   We know the Patriots have a big, quick back from Georgia who was
taken with the 18th pick in the draft to replace the most
productive back in Patriots history.
</P>
<P>
   We know he is big, fast, and prone to injury, judging by his
track record both at Georgia and this summer.
</P>
<P>
   We know he gets into the hole in a hurry, as he did Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   We know he is different from his competitors for the job, which
is a polite way of saying he is better in some way that may be hard
to explain but which is undeniable once he has the ball in his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, there are things we don't know.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't know is if Edwards can come out of the majority of
those holes in as big a hurry as he went into them.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't know is whether his body will hold up.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't know is if he will gain yardage at the clip Martin
once did or at the clip Reggie ``One Yard'' Dupard once did.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't know, in the end, is if he is the man for the
difficult job he'll be handed at some point this season, which is
to replace a guy who averaged more than 1,200 yards rushing a
season the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, not even Robert Edwards knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware of it (the pressure of replacing Martin) but I'm not
feeling it,'' Edwards said. ``If I go into it and do the best I can
and perform up to my ability, I know I can help the team one way or
the other. No one's trying to be the star.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a noble stance, but it makes you wonder, because anyone
who is honest about New England's running game can say little more
than Edwards did Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the simple statistical fact is this: Teams that have
a 100-yard rusher win 70 percent of the time, while teams that have
a 300-yard passer win 35 percent of the time. What we know at the
moment is that the Pariots most assuredly have a 300-yard passer.
So, as is often the case in life, what we don't know worries us
more than what we do know.

CANTY NOW COZY ON CORNER

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ On the Eagles' first play of the game Saturday
night, running back Charlie Garner swept right end, gained some
yards, and then was met _ no, hammered _ by New England cornerback
Chris Canty. It was a new Canty, a physical Canty.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Philadelphia quarterback Bobby Hoying threw a
swing pass to Garner in the flat and once again Garner was met _
no, smashed _ by Canty, causing Garner to fumble. It was a new
Canty, a bruising, confident Canty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a routine play,'' said Canty, ``but it was also a
matter of being physical, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A modest Canty? Most certainly, a new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Garner coming across and our (defensive) line was
getting great pressure,'' said Canty, when pressed to say more
about the play that caused a turnover four plays into the game.
``Then I saw Hoying look out to Garner ... and I just reacted, kind
of before the ball was thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year.
</P>
<P>
   Garner caught Hoying's pass and ``I don't think he saw me until
it was too late,'' Canty went on. ``And I just tried to tag him
best I could.''
</P>
<P>
   All manner of questions abound about the New England running
game, the New England offense, the New England ability to score
points but, truly, there is only one major question on defense _
can Chris Canty play right cornerback in the National Football
League? If Canty can do the job, the Patriot defense may be
approaching the complete package.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Canty's rookie year, the cornerback was tentative,
unsure, soft, and had an attitude problem, finding the adjustment
from All-American at Kansas State to nickel back at New England
very difficult. And when the Patriots traded last year's right
corner, Jimmy Hitchcock, to Minnesota, Canty's name seldom came up
in the discussions about Hitchcock's replacement; it was either
first-round draft choice Tebucky Jones or veteran Steve Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Canty? Just a blitzer from the outside in the Patriots' nickel
and dime pass defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm focused more this year,'' said Canty, who for so long last
season seemed like an outsider on a Patriots defense that was tight
and close and intimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concentrating on details. I'm more everything.
Another thing is I'm getting more in sync with Willie (Clay),
Lawyer (Milloy), and Ty (Law). Those guys have been together for a
while and they know how each other plays, and I'm the new guy, but
I'm getting in sync now.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the physical play, though, it is the change in
Canty's attitude that is most evident. There has been a dramatic
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for me last year,'' said the cornerback. ``When
you come off from being an All-America and, basically, doing
whatever you want to do on the field, to being a part-timer, and
having a set role, it was kind of shocking. I think it takes a
tough guy to come and realize what his role is and I kind of got
that toward the end of the season and into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Canty doesn't say what he might have said last year _ ``bring on
Steve Israel and bring on Tebucky Jones, too'' _ and only says that
he welcomes the competition. The coaches will decide who plays
right cornerback for New England, said Canty, ``and hopefully it
will be my job. The coaches will decide and all I can do is go out
and play hard for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Words like that are as much a contrast from the 1997 Canty as
the two brutal hits he put on Garner. Indeed, it is a new Canty.

L.A. AREA SUFFERS LACK OF HIGH-TECH SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A few months ago, San Fernando High School social
studies teacher Marco Torres sent his students on what he knew
would be a likely wild-goose chase.
</P>
<P>
   The assignment was simple: Find a local computer store and buy a
3.5-inch computer diskette. He wasn't surprised that the students _
who live in suburban San Fernando and neighboring Pacoima _ came
back empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to go to Encino (an affluent suburb northwest of
downtown Los Angeles) or any other community, you won't have any
trouble finding this stuff,'' Torres said angrily.
</P>
<P>
   Torres' assignment for his students is a lesson in retailing
economics. The major consumer electronics retailers go where the
money is, or where it's perceived to be. But Torres is one of a
growing group of people in the northeast San Fernando Valley who
are trying to teach those same retailers that their community has
both the space to build large stores and the disposable income to
spend at them.
</P>
<P>
   These Northeast Valley advocates have jumped on this issue
because of the importance personal technology will be in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to expose our community to skills that are
important ... and unless we jump on this bandwagon, our community
will continue to decline,'' said Torres, who is also the education
technology consultant to the schools feeding into San Fernando
High. ``Once we do that, then businesses can say, Look at this
community. This is a hard-working community in touch with
technology. Let's tap into that.''
</P>
<P>
   The region's lack of consumer electronics retailers is
accentuated by the abundance of those same retailers in other parts
of the San Fernando Valley. ``We look for good, viable retail
centers,'' said Pam Colangelo, a spokeswoman for Brisbane,
Calif.-based The Good Guys ``That's what other retailers are
looking for as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the small independents are rare in the Northeast Valley.
One of the few is Fiesta Electronics and Furniture in San Fernando,
which does indeed sell computers _ but only a few, only by catalog
and only no-name brands, said owner Victor Ceballos.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't sell products like 3.5-inch diskettes. For that,
he sends customers to the few nearby general merchandise stores
that carry computers and computer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Sam's Club and Office Depot _ for the East Valley,
they're the ones that sell most of the computers and they have a
lot,'' he said. ``If someone wants to see them, we send them to
Office Depot.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the relative scarcity of consumer electronics stores in the
Northeast Valley? It's economics and, perhaps, land availability,
according to economists and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driven plain and simple by economics,'' said Richard
Giss, a partner with the trade retail services group at Deloitte &AMP;
Touche LLP. ``Consumer electronics is a typically big-ticket item
and you will see those stores located in areas convenient to
demographics that indicate that it has a population that can pay
those prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Hoffman, executive director of the Mid Valley Chamber of
Commerce said the East Valley was developed long before giant
electronics stores began looking for vacant lots upon which to
build.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this side of the Valley seems to have been built up
first,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers also may perceive that older urban areas are poor and
unsafe, and have little disposable income. That's a costly
miscalculation, said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of bucks to be made in areas like the Northeast
Valley if retailers take the time to learn those markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers _ especially national chain retailers _ don't quite
get what goes on in major urban areas,'' he said. ``They see areas
that most people would see as distressed and avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the savvy retailer, you can do well for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   One part of the Northeast Valley that's trying to change things
is the city of San Fernando, where the only big general
merchandisers are branches of J.C. Penney, Sam's Club and Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   According to Scott Schmidt, project manager for the Greater San
Fernando Chamber of Commerce, the area has a stable population of
about 300,000 people with a median annual household income in the
high $40,000 range _ just the kind of demographics that he said
should act like magnets to more retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some have inquired about opening stores in the city,
said Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   But available land is scattered, fragmented and configured in
such a way that makes them unsuitable for the chains, developers
and analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   So to attract more major retailers, the city is designing a
downtown specific plan that in part involves shifting San Fernando
Road to create four large lots that could accommodate big box
stores that would draw shoppers from in and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is actually looking at this as an opportunity to
redesign its downtown area and capture the consumers that we have
in the San Fernando area,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the San Fernando market study suggests that
electronics discounters may not be good targets for a downtown
revitalization project because of those retailers' ``bias for mall
and high-visibility (freeway) locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, obviously, disagrees that the area around his high
school wouldn't be a good location for a consumer electronics
store. He cites studies that show the northeast population has had
little exposure to personal technology and say it's a fertile field
for the right retailer.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year showed that only about 4 percent of the
school's approximately 4,600 students have computers at home _ and
most of them are either in the magnet program or have older
siblings in college.
</P>
<P>
   And the school has one of the worst computer-to-student ratios
in the state _ 1-to-118, he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, students and the community as a whole have fewer
opportunities to be exposed to a technology that is becoming an
increasingly important part of life, both at home and at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our school is a microcosm of our community _ this is a ...
working-class community that is not exposed to technology in the
way that white-collar communities are,'' Torres said. ``And because
of this lack of exposure, there is no interest in finding out the
importance of information technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our community, information technology is not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   What the area really needs, said Fiesta's Ceballos, is a store
that specializes in computers _ somewhere where customers can find
trained professionals who can answer any and every question they
have about computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone who specializes (in it) and we don't
have anyone like that,'' he said. ``You have to know what you're
doing _ that's another reason why we don't carry them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some changes afoot in the Northeast Valley, though.
For example, the commercial development at the old General Motors
site in Panorama City is expected to include an Office Max. And
Ceballos himself plans to start carrying computers and equipment in
his store in a month or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have someone install them in the home; they're
going to be trained and I think it's going to be better for the
people,'' Ceballos said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a simple trip to a major electronics retailer remains
a major headache for Northeast Valley residents.
</P>
<P>
   Caryn Young, for example, has had to travel out of her hometown
of Panorama City to purchase her family's dishwasher, video camera,
radio equipment, computer software and other electronics.
</P>
<P>
   She's not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do that type of shopping in Panorama City. There's
no way, there's nothing here,'' she said.

GALAXY STREAK SNAPPED
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ The Columbus franchise undoubtedly is built around
U.S. national team forward Brian McBride, but he has a sidekick who
very well may wrestle away the league's MVP award from the Galaxy's
Cobi Jones, the apparent front-runner after last week's eight-point
performance against New England.
</P>
<P>
   Stern John, an emerging 21-year-old from Trinidad &AMP; Tobago's
national team, scored his league-leading 18th and 19th goals of the
season to lead Columbus to a convincing 3-0 victory over the Galaxy
in front of 19,633 at the Rose Bowl Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended Los Angeles' winning streak at four games, and
gave the surging Crew its fifth victory in five games to clinch a
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, L.A. defeated Columbus 4-2, thanks to a
three-goal performance from Martin Machon. But in defense of
Columbus, the Crew was without U.S. national team members McBride,
Brian Maisonneuve, Thomas Dolley and goalkeeper Juergen Sommer.
</P>
<P>
   John, who broke McBride's single-season scoring marks set in
1996, is chasing Jones for the MLS point lead. He improved his
total to 41, putting himself only two points behind Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, which appeared to be rolling into the playoffs after
scoring 16 goals in its past four games, was shut out for the first
time since June 29, and for only the fourth time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with second-place Chicago getting only a point in a 3-2
shootout victory over Kansas City, Los Angeles needs any
combination of L.A. wins or Chicago losses equaling five standings
points (instead of seven before Saturday) in order to clinch its
second Western Conference regular-season title in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which had won its previous four games with Paul
Caligiuri and Joe Franchino as its outside backs, went to Greg
Vanney and Ezra Hendrickson, who have been regular starters most of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   It really didn't matter who started defensively, however. Los
Angeles couldn't find the net, despite outshooting Columbus 11-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew got on the board when midfielder Andy Williams
continued his consecutive-game assist streak, recording an assist
for a league-record sixth straight game. He had two first-half
feeds for Columbus, one with help from Galaxy defender Steve
Jolley, however.
</P>
<P>
   Williams moved along the right side in the 31st minute, looking
to feed McBride, who was marked closely by Jolley. Williams
attempted to float a pass over Jolley, but the quick-footed Galaxy
defender retreated in time, keeping himself in front of McBride
with plenty of time to clear the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of clearing the ball from danger, Jolley tried to bring
the ball down with his left foot. He mistimed the cross, allowing
the ball to bounce to his left in front of McBride, who only had
Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman to beat. Hartman came out to
challenge, but McBride took a high bounce and sent a delicate chip
over Hartman's head into an open net for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who didn't do much work for either point, sent a
simple crossing pass above the penalty arc for John in the closing
minutes of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   John calmly controlled the ball at the top of the box in the
44th minute, keeping himself clear of Galaxy defender Robin Fraser.
Neither Fraser nor Hartman expected what happened next _ a quick,
perfectly placed right-footed strike to the upper-right corner to
give John his 18th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   John sent the Galaxy fans home in the 79th minute, scoring on a
breakaway to beat Hartman.

A TALE OF TWO TEAMS, TWO DIRECTIONS

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ But first, a word about the opponent. Three,
actually: God help 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we've known that feeling around here, haven't we? I think
back to the Rod Rust season, when wretched execution performances
would be followed by reasonably indecipherable explanations
concerning the disaster we had just witnessed. We knew before the
season started what it was like to feel helpless, hapless, and
hopeless. Saturday night the Philadelphia Eagles showed as close to
nothng as a team could show, and only the dynamics of exhibition
football kept the score as close as 24-7. The Eagles were never,
not for one nanosecond, in this game.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone knows what the Eagles are in for this season, it is
Irving Fryar. ``I've gone through years when we were 1-15, 2-14,
right here in New England,'' he points out. ``It's been tough for
us. We haven't played well. We've made it tough on ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving is now a man of the cloth, so he'd appreciate your input
with the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   Now, then ...
</P>
<P>
   Your New England Patriots are neither helpless, hapless, nor
hopeless. They ought to be pretty good. Whoever wishes to take
credit for the grocery shopping has given the coach a
reasonably-stocked cupboard, so much so that Sunday is going to be
an agonizing one for coach Pete Carroll and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   For it is cut-down day. When the players reassemble for Monday's
practice, they will be doing so with eight fewer bodies than were
present for Saturday night's easy dispatch of the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the coaches are satisfied with the preseason,''
observes middle linebacker Ted Johnson, he of the new long-term
contract. ``There are going to be some difficult decisions for the
coaches. We are well-stocked at certain positions. We are going to
lose some good players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some tough decisions,'' confirms Mr. Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   The major area of concern, of course, is the same one everyone
had going into the final exhibition contest. If you think you're
already on some sort of sensory overload on the subject of the
running game, I've got bad news. You ain't heard nothin' yet. The
running game is likely to be Topics A, B, C, and perhaps everything
through X in the days leading up to next Monday night's season
opener against the World Champs in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Most other areas appear to be in good shape. Things might not
have looked too rosy after the first two exhibition games, but the
Patriots were lucky because the extra exhibition game created by
the Dallas game in Mexico City turned out to be a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really took five weeks to get it done this time,'' says
Carroll. ``I never would have wished for five (games) when it
started. Now I think we can be a real good team, and the best thing
is that we have a big upside. We're nowhere near as good as we can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   There shouldn't be any question about their mental preparedness.
When last seen in serious combat, you may recall, they were on the
losing end of a bitterly-fought 7-6 score in Pittsburgh. A loss
like that in a game like that kind of hangs around in your brain
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real sense of urgency in this camp,'' maintains
Johnson, who, at 25, is settling into a classic leadership role.
``That was a tough loss. With the exception of one play (the broken
play that turned into the Steeler touchdown), we feel we left it
all out there on the field that day. Now we have an offense that is
trying to establish an identity and a defense that wants to
continue where it left off. We've got a good defense, but we need
to play well right away. Historically, we start off a little slow
on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   It's truly amazing how the Patriots' image has been transformed.
From the eight-touchdown-passes-to-eight-different-receivers start
of last year the Patriots have evolved into a team where you
honestly think of its defense first and its offense second. By the
end of last season the Patriots had become one of the premier
defensive teams in football. The basic worries are all about the
offense, specifically concerns about what happens when the play
calls for something other than a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Through 82 regular season and playoff contests, Drew Bledsoe has
averaged 38 passing attempts a game. It is an article of faith that
this number must be reduced if he is to enjoy life in the NFL
without the benefit of wheelchairs and painkillers. The exhibition
season offered little evidence that the desired reduction in
passing plays will take place in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   However the offense shakes down, the defense should keep the
Patriots in most games until Drew finds a way to get the team into
the end zone. At any rate, we won't have to wait long to gauge the
state of the Patriots' universe. Denver is the ultimate New England
nemesis. Not to be negative, but the Patriots haven't beaten this
team since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the idea that we're opening with them,'' says Johnson.
``It will be good to test yourself against the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, let's get going. If these guys are going to wake up
hurting from a football game, it might as well be after a game that
counts.

PATRIOTS GAIN GROUND

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The goals for the final exhibition game were
simple: Come out of the contest healthy, let the so-called bubble
guys compete for the final few roster spots, and watch No. 1 draft
pick Robert Edwards show some fraction of the talent of Curtis
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   It's debatable whether all goals were accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who closed the exhibition schedule Saturday night
with their third straight victory, a 24-7 romp over the hapless
Philadelphia Eagles, will head to Denver for the Sept. 7 season
opener relatively healthy, although Marty Moore was carried off the
field (cracked rib; out 4-6 weeks) with just over two minutes to
play.
</P>
<P>
   And the coaches did gather more information on some bubble guys
for making their roster decisions by Sunday's 4 p.m. deadline.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, Edwards showed himself to be some fraction of Martin.
A small fraction. The rookie, who had been out the past three weeks
with a sore groin, had 15 carries for 38 yards _ not to take the
starting job away from Sedrick Shaw, who gained 47 yards on 13
carries with the second team.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll announced after the game that Shaw will start
against Denver, but ``we'll use him (Edwards) in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The bright spots in the win were Drew Bledsoe and the defense,
which held the Eagles to 159 net yards, only 56 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us five weeks to get it done this time,'' said
Carroll, referring to his team's expanded exhibition schedule. ``I
would never have wished for the five games when it started; as it
turned out, we needed them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big upside. We can see there is a whole lot of room
for improvement. We need to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a brief performance for Bledsoe, who played only the
first two series. But he was sharp, missing on only two of his
seven passes and tossing his first touchdown pass, a 3-yarder to
Troy Brown on the Patriots' first drive to make it 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   The first-team defense continued to assert itself as a strong
unit, stuffing the Eagles running game and causing huge problems
for quarterback Bobby Hoying, who had to throw under constant
pressure in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Other meaningful aspects of the win:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Dietrich Jells, the forgotten man of the receiving corps, had
a strong game, catching two second-half touchdown passes, one a
50-yard connection with third-stringer Tom Tupa, the other a
9-yarder from Scott Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   Jells, fighting for a spot on the team, made some other big
plays on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   He recovered a fumble on an Eagle punt return with 1:06
remaining in the third quarter at the Philadelphia 27-yard line.
That set up the short Patriots scoring drive that culminated with
Zolak hitting Jells from 9 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Jells downed a punt at the Eagles' 5.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; The Patriots' second team mounted an 82-yard drive under the
direction of Tupa in the third quarter. The drive featured the
longest run of the exhibition season _ a 19-yarder by Sedrick Shaw
against the Eagles' second team. With that play, Shaw made up for a
fumble on the previous series, a mistake that didn't please
Patriots coaches.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Veteran Mike Jones was credited with one sack and played well
with the second team. Whether his performance won him a job remains
to be seen, for offsetting that showing was a fine effort by
second-year defensive lineman Brandon Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; The game also marked the return of Tebucky Jones, the
Patriots' second first-round pick, who got plenty of reps in the
second half. He did nothing notable, positive or negative.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots defense set the tone for the night on the second
play of the Eagles' first possession when, on a screen pass to
Charlie Garner, who had just gained 10 yards on the first play from
scrimmage, right corner Chris Canty popped the ball loose and it
was recovered by Willie Clay at the Philadelphia 41-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' first-team offense, which looked a little
different with Edwards starting at running back and Troy Brown
starting over Shawn Jefferson at wide receiver, ran off an 11-play
drive that consumed 5:29 and culminated with the 3-yard scoring
pass, on which Brown was spotted by Bledsoe at the last possible
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, it was Edwards and more Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   On the Patriots' first series, the rookie carried six times for
12 yards. His return to the lineup started with a 3-yard loss on
first and 10 from the 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first play I took a pretty good pounding, but then I
settled in and thought I did pretty well,'' said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards then caught a 5-yard pass from Bledsoe and ran tough
thereafter, including a 5-yard burst up the middle on second and 6
from the 12.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, meanwhile, was clicking from the outset. He went to
Terry Glenn for passes of 8 and 14 yards during his brief
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards ran even better on the second series, showing more
confidence with twisting moves and cutbacks. He ran for 4, 6, and 9
yards as the Patriots made a first down, but then Bledsoe couldn't
find anyone open on a third-and-4 and the Patriots were forced to
punt.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Edwards was later stopped cold on fourth and 1
from the 6-yard line midway through the second quarter, ending a
34-yard drive. The Patriots seemed to purposely give the ball to
Edwards in tough yardage situations, also handing it to him on
third and 3 for a long yard the play before he was stopped on
fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That situation (fourth and 1) called for me to pound the
football,'' said Edwards. ``I should have taken it under and got
the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   The prettiest play of the half was Zolak's long ball to Glenn,
which went for 50 yards to the Eagles 15. Zolak thus had done what
Bledsoe could not through five exhibition games _ hit Glenn deep.
That led to Phil Dawson's 27-yard field goal with 11:13 remaining
in the half. It was Dawson's third straight field goal since being
signed before last week's game.
</P>
<P>
   It was 10-0, and the Patriots were on their way.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
At this rate, Randy Johnson may never lose a start at the
Astrodome.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Better yet, opposing teams may never score a run.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pitched his third shutout at home and struck out a
season-high 16 on Friday night as the Astros pulled out a scrappy
2-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates before a crowd of 40,709.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 27 (scoreless innings at home) in a row,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   But who's counting?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, acquired from the Seattle Mariners on July 31, set a
club single-game record for strikeouts by a lefthander and recorded
the most strikeouts by an Astros pitcher since Nolan Ryan fanned 16
Giants on Sept. 9, 1987. Johnson fell two K's shy of the
club-record 18 set by Don Wilson in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   There was one primary word Johnson's teammates used in
describing his latest performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``He was totally
dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Unit needed an intensity-filled performance Friday as he
and Pittsburgh righthander Francisco Cordova matched scoreless
frames for the first five innings. Brad Ausmus broke the gridlock,
beating a throw to home plate on the first of two fielder's-choice
RBI grounders by Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   In three Astrodome starts, Johnson (5-1) has allowed no runs, 17
hits and three walks while striking out 37. He had 10 strikeouts
through five innings against the Pirates and capped off the
impressive display by striking out the side to end the game.
Johnson scattered seven hits and did not allow a walk while
throwing 133 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cordova is a heck of a pitcher,'' said Johnson, whose
major-league totals this season include 274 strikeouts and five
shutouts. ``He kept their team in the game the whole time and just
made it tougher for me. I have no leeway to make a bad pitch. I
have to stay focused the whole game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh is a very disciplined, scrappy team. Those are the
teams that make me work extremely hard, because they're in the game
the whole time and make you throw a lot of pitches. It doesn't give
me any room for error.''
</P>
<P>
   In snapping the Pirates' nine-game winning streak, the Astros
won for the 16th time in their last 21 games and remained 10 games
ahead of second-place Chicago in the National League Central. They
also matched last year's victory total of 84 and established a
franchise record for wins in August with 19.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come easy, however, as Cordova (12-11) continued to be
an Astros nemesis, scattering four hits and one run over seven
innings. In 11 career appearances against the Astros, Cordova is
3-2 with a 2.69 ERA. He pitched 5 scoreless innings Friday before
Ausmus doubled to lead off the sixth inning, advanced on a balk and
scored on Biggio's grounder, beating second baseman Kevin
Polcovich's throw to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Ausmus' sixth-inning hit, the Astros managed just a
single by Moises Alou in the second and Dave Clark's two-out double
in the fourth off Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus and Biggio repeated their sixth-inning scoring play with
an almost identical one with one out in the eighth. Ausmus reached
base to begin the inning on a bunt to the third-base side that
reliever Mike Williams couldn't handle. One batter later, Ausmus
took second on a third-strike wild pitch from Williams to Johnson
and advanced to third on a throwing error by Pittsburgh catcher
Jason Kendall. Biggio drove in the run with a grounder to shortstop
as Ausmus once again beat the play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Pirates,'' Dierker said. ``This is the way we
remember them last year. It's hard to score against them. They're
tough. Cordova still has us mystified.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Johnson had the Pirates guessing as he seemingly
gained strength as the game progressed. His 16 strikeouts eclipsed
Mike Cuellar's previous club mark of 15 by a lefthander _ set
against St. Louis in 1966 _ and marked Johnson's 98th career
double-digit strikeout game, moving him past Sandy Koufax into
second place on the all-time list. Nolan Ryan holds the record at
215.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his velocity back,'' Ausmus said. ``He's probably
thrown as many or more pitches than anyone in baseball this year.
When you're a strikeout pitcher, you have to throw a few extra
pitches. Maybe (Thursday's day off) helped him out. It showed on
the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates' biggest scoring threat came in the eighth when they
put runners at first and third. Adrian Brown singled with one out,
and Kendall singled to right field, with Brown advancing to third
on an error by Clark. Johnson ended the threat by getting Kevin
Young to pop out to first baseman Jeff Bagwell in foul territory.
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros clinging to a one-run lead, Johnson knew it was
far from over. During their nine-game winning streak, the Pirates
had scored 72 runs and were batting .336 as a club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize I have to be focused the whole game,'' Johnson said.
``With a one-run game, the tying run is coming up every inning. It
made me stay focused. It's easy to go out there flat late in the
game. The next thing you know, a couple of guys get on base, a bad
pitch here and there, and it could have been a different ballgame.
Of all the games I've pitched for the Astros, I really felt the
most comfortable than any other I've pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   After three straight home shutouts, who can tell?

If you've got game, who needs rapport?
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising scene of the day had nothing to do with the
Comets' 12-point comeback in the last seven minutes of the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a twisting, double-pumping scoop drive through traffic
by Cynthia Cooper. It wasn't a pull-up, 15-foot, BB-shot,
line-drive, clutch jumper by Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't another of the tireless dozen rebounds pulled in by
the thoroughly professional Tina Thompson, one of the handful of
critical hustle plays down the stretch by Janeth Arcain or anything
that happened in front of the 16,285 screamers who nearly
overloaded the micro processors and caused a meltdown at the
Laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The photo op of the afternoon came midway through the postgame
news conference, held on a makeshift stage in a back hallway, when
Swoopes was suddenly overcome by cramps in her leg and needed
assistance. Up popped Cooper from the next chair to provide her
body for support.
</P>
<P>
   How symbolic of the Comets' first two years of existence. Cooper
_ this time quite literally _ carries the burden on her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic, because it was one of the few times all day when the
pair of stars works in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   So the ``she-peat'' is alive.
</P>
<P>
   Comets find themselves
</P>
<P>
   At least until Tuesday night, when Swoopes and Cooper can resume
the race to beat the Phoenix Mercury or each other into submission
first.
</P>
<P>
   This one ended up with tingling good feelings all around and a
1-1 tie in the WNBA finals because the Mercury plummeted faster
than in a Norwegian January, and the Comets did what they do better
than any other club in the toddling league _ battled right down to
the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Michele Timms dropped in a free throw to give Phoenix
a 62-50 lead with 7:24 left in regulation, Team Turmoil appeared
finally ready to burst like the seams in a fat man's pants.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Comets lack in overall harmony, they more than
compensate for in individual ability. Which either says something
ugly about the quality of talent in the league or speaks volumes
about their scouting department.
</P>
<P>
   For in a matter of just minutes, the team that had been kept on
its heels for more than three-fourths of the game was running
around and past its opponent as if the Mercury were playing with
its shoes in concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jennifer Gillom, who suffered through 3-for-15 shooting,
never could get untracked for Phoenix. Timms, who poured in 21
points, had her faucet turned off, and all of the second-chance
tries on offensive rebounds that had allowed the Mercury to keep
the upper hand dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was Cooper (27 points) making end-to-end dashes
to convert on the fast break. There was Swoopes (14 points, 13
rebounds, five assists) coming off screens to gather in passes and
hit that jumper that is straighter than a laser beam. There were
the Comets, streaking across the sky again in the fashion that
built that gaudy 29-3 record before they were shut down in Phoenix
two nights earlier.
</P>
<P>
   No lack of atmosphere
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you wonder how good they truly could be if
Cooper and Swoopes ever got it through their heads to play this
game together rather than continue to engage in their schoolgirl
antics of ``who gets to be Michael Jordan,'' which is partly why
the Comets fell 12 behind.
</P>
<P>
   Case No. 1: Late in the first half, Cooper jacks up a wild
25-foot heave of a 3-pointer that misses everything while Swoopes
stands wide-open on the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Case No. 2: Early in the second half on a break, Swoopes does
not wait for Cooper to fill the lane for a pass and does a 360-spin
move, slamming into defender Kristi Harrower and resulting in a
lost opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   You could lock Bill Clinton and Ken Starr in a gym and see more
assists and smiles. And still this team wins. To the delight of the
happy, howling fans.
</P>
<P>
   Quibble with the basketball, if you must. But I've got news for
you. Val Ackerman's WNBA product is more fun, more entertaining,
more alive than David Stern's game. Maybe that's because real
people can afford to attend. Real people who aren't afraid to sweat
and yell their throats raw. Consider it a challenge to all the
corporate freeloaders and the River Oaks crowd whenever the NBA
lockout ends next Christmas. To paraphrase John Lennon: Just rattle
your jewelry, and let us know you're out there.
</P>
<P>
   This was one more comeback, one more chapter in their growing
legend, one more bid for the ``she-peat.''
</P>
<P>
   They keep doing it their way. So Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl
Swoopes live to fight another day.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

   &UR; ROUND ROCK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Michelle Huneven. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This lively tale focuses on two men, both recovering alcoholics,
living at a halfway house in rural California, and the woman
violinist with whom they both become involved. Their struggle
implies that spiritual healing requires facing past truths and then
getting on with life, one day at a time. Last year in the Book
Review, Valerie Sayers called this an ``immensely likable first
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW WE LIVE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Sherwin B. Nuland. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   Using the voice of both teacher and storyteller, a surgeon
attempts the daunting task of explaining how the human body works
and what happens when something goes wrong. His account, originally
published in hardcover as  &UR; THE WISDOM OF THE BODY &LR; , is full of
``fascinating tales of surgical pitched battle'' told ''in forceful
and terse prose,'' F. Gonzalez-Crussi wrote here in 1997. In the
dreamlike  &UR; JUDITH'S PAVILION: THE HAUNTING MEMORIES OF A
NEUROSURGEON &LR; , by Marc Flitter (Warner, $12), a physician recalls
his many successes and failures, and the struggles of the patients
whose lives have transformed him. The writing ``is as elegant and
delicate as his surgery,'' Abraham Verghese said here last year.
```Judith's Pavilion' lingers with the reader long after the book
is over.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONCE A DANCER ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Allegra Kent. St. Martin's, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The renowned ballerina, who flourished under the wing of George
Balanchine, surveys her eccentric life and career and tells how she
managed to cap off each success with a compensating failure. Last
year our reviewer, Joan Acocella, found much of this memoir to be
``witty, fast-paced, full of deft omissions, wonderful
catchings-up.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIVING AFTER MIDNIGHT: A NOVELLA AND STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Lee K. Abbott. Ohio State University, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The characters who populate this collection of short fiction
tend to be ordinary Americans who share a hot-wired pop-culture
awareness and a fascination with the magic and mysteries of
language. ``The quality of these stories is uniformly high,''
George Garrett wrote here in 1991. ``The level of excellence is
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A COUNTRY OF STRANGERS: BLACKS AND WHITES IN AMERICA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David K. Shipler. Vintage, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The author, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and former
correspondent for The New York Times, talks to a lot of black and
white Americans and discovers an uneasy racial divide in which each
side knows precious little about the other. The result is an
``engaged and engaging'' book that ``provides something that
statistics alone will not: the rich fabric of the everyday workings
of race in this nation,'' K. Anthony Appiah said here in 1997. A
former federal judge examines the interaction between racial
injustice and the law dating to Colonial times in  &UR; SHADES OF
FREEDOM: RACIAL POLITICS AND PRESUMPTIONS OF THE AMERICAN LEGAL
PROCESS &LR; , by A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. (Oxford University, $15.95),
finding that the legal system perpetuates the notion of inferiority
even today. This ``is a carefully researched and impressively
documented book,'' Yale Kamisar wrote in these pages in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ABOUT YVONNE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Donna Masini. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   A professor at New York University who suspects her husband is
having an affair is gradually driven to the edge of insanity by her
jealous fantasies. Last year in the Book Review, Maggie Garb called
this a ``haunting novel of sexual obsession'' and a fresh critique
of contemporary Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEGGAR AND THE PROFESSOR: A SIXTEENTH-CENTURY FAMILY SAGA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie. University of Chicago, $15.
</P>
<P>
   By drawing on the correspondence and memoirs of three
generations of an upwardly mobile Swiss family in the 16th century,
this kaleidoscopic history adds color and texture to our
understanding of the Renaissance and Reformation. The author is
``an erudite and elegant chronicler of early modern times,'' Eugen
Weber said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OFF MINOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By John Harvey. Owl/Holt, $11.
</P>
<P>
   In this moody British police procedural, Inspector Charlie
Resnick tracks down a child rapist and killer in the grubby
industrial city of Nottingham. Harvey reveals ``the devastating
impact of murder on everyone it touches,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote
here in 1992. ``No one escapes the glare of the author's insights
or the warmth of his compassion for the pathetic frailties of human
nature.'' An earlier mystery featuring the jazz-loving Inspector
Resnick,  &UR; CUTTING EDGE &LR;  ($11), revolves around a baffling series of
surgical mutilations of staff members at a teaching hospital in the
Midlands. ``Harvey creates characters of astonishing psychological
diversity,'' Stasio said in these pages in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOD OF IMPERTINENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Sten Nadolny. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of this comic fable is Hermes, the Greek god of
thieves, who is freed after 2,000 years chained to a volcano and
sent on a mission to the brave new world of french fries, golf and
channel surfing. His adventures make for whimsical ``post-modernist
beach reading,'' Bill Christophersen wrote here in 1997.

   DIANA-MEMORIAL _ PARIS _ Parisians and tourists have been
invited to join a candle-lit procession to the Pont de lAlma to
commemorate the first anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess
of Wales. A ceremony will be held at 12:26 a.m. (local time) today,
to mark the moment when Dianas limousine hit the 13th pillar of an
underpass on a right bank expressway. Her companion, Dodi Fayed,
and the driver, Henri Paul, also died. The ceremony is being
organized by a private association, Paris Odysee, after the royal
family informed the British embassy and Paris city council that
expressions of grief should be limited to personal reflection.

   RUSSIA-CRISIS MOSCOW Confronted by the country's economic
turmoil and with no one clearly in charge, the Kremlin and leaders
of the Communist-led parliament forged a political truce Sunday
designed to allow a new government to begin coping with the crisis.
The agreement would smooth the way for the Duma on Monday to
confirm Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister before the arrival
Tuesday of President Clinton for a summit with President Boris
Yeltsin. The compromise seeks to end a week of uncertainty over who
is running Russia as the ruble plummets in value and consumer
prices rise. The document, reached during frantic weekend
negotiations, would force Yeltsin to relinquish some of his
extensive powers. But it does not go as far as Communists had
sought. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   DDN-COX-ISSUELESS_ DAYTON, Ohio _ When Republican candidate for
governor Bob Taft unveiled a major initiative to help financially
strapped families make ends meet, the event didn't make the late
evening news in the state capitol. A burning hay field, a store
running out of lottery tickets and a three-day-old report about
vandals hitting a suburban school did. Likewise, when Democrat Lee
Fisher released a health care proposal that will be a centerpiece
of his campaign, it did not initially make the airwaves _ and only
one major newspaper ran the story on page one the next day. In 10
weeks, Ohioans will choose their next governor. The winner will
face a daunting list of challenges _ school funding, electric
utility deregulation, HMO reform, prison overcrowding, privatizing
public services and tax reform. But for most voters, perhaps the
only contact they will have with the candidates will be through the
million of dollars in paid TV advertising that will flood the
airwaves during the final weeks leading to Nov. 3. (Miller, Dayton

proliferate. For the record, you won't go blind from using
sunscreen. (Hill, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   ELDERHOSTEL (Kotzbebue, Alaska) _ Martha Rowe, three weeks shy
of her 77th birthday, found herself heading out of Kotzebue on a
beat-up yellow bus with a taped-together steering wheel, cracked
windshield and seats that slid around with every bump and curve in
the unpaved road. Her destination was a primitive fish camp on a
narrow strip of gravel beach between the tundra and the Chukchi
Sea, on the outskirts of Kotzebue, 26 miles above the Arctic
Circle, closer to Russia than Anchorage. ``I wanted an adventure,''
said Ms. Rowe, a retired clinical director of physical therapy at
the University of Florida in Gainesville. So did her fellow

Elderhostel, the nonprofit organization whose educational trips

ROCKET EXPLOSION SETS BACK U.S. AEROSPACE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a Delta 3 rocket made by Boeing Co. exploded shortly after
takeoff last Wednesday night from Cape Canaveral, Fla., it was a
setback not only for Boeing, but also for Hughes Electronics, which
made the advanced communications satellite on board, and for
Panamsat Corp., which intended to use the satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The accident also appeared to slow the pace of the U.S.
aerospace industry in its race to become the dominant global player
in the fast-growing market for commercial satellite launchings.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the explosion, which occurred less than 90 seconds
after liftoff, remained undetermined over the weekend as
investigators from Boeing and Hughes arrived at Cape Canaveral from
California, where both companies' space operations are based.
Boeing executives said it could take months for the investigation
to yield definitive conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The launching was to begin the maiden voyage for the Delta 3,
the latest member of a family of rockets that have been in use
since the 1960s. It is unclear whether the Delta 3's novelty will
compound the difficulty of finding the cause of the accident. But
it is clear that the accident comes at a particularly unfortunate
moment for Boeing and for the U.S. aerospace business.
</P>
<P>
   That is because U.S. companies are still adapting to a
commercial space market that was changed radically by the
Challenger space shuttle disaster in 1986, the downsizing of the
American military after the Cold War and the burgeoning demand for
satellite-based electronic entertainment and communications
services around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are just beginning to come back now,'' said
Frederick Landman, chief executive of Panamsat, one of the world's
leading private satellite operators, referring to the U.S.
launching business. ``They will eventually get there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There'' is in a position to seriously challenge Arianespace,
the European space agency, for leadership in commercial satellite
launching.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial satellite business has three main types of
companies: builders, launchers and operators. Hughes, a unit of
General Motors Corp., is the world's biggest builder of
geostationary commercial satellites _ the type of spacecraft that
orbit above a fixed point on the earth's surface and are the
primary form of communications satellite in use today.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' biggest domestic competitor is Space Systems/Loral,
while Europe's largest makers of commercial satellites include
Aerospatiale and Matra Marconi. Among other American builders, TRW
and Lockheed Martin are best known for military satellites,
although Lockheed Martin in particular is making a push into the
commercial market.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. companies dominate the making of commercial
satellites, with as much as 70 percent of the market, they have not
fared as well in the market for putting satellites into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. commercial launching sales grew from $295 million in 1993
to $940 million in 1997, according to the Aerospace Industries
Association, a trade group in Washington. But that is less than
half of the worldwide market of $2.6 billion, where Arianespace is
the biggest force. In fact, Panamsat, which is based in Greenwich,
Conn., and is controlled by Hughes, plans to use Arianespace for a
launching in French Guiana next month.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin is also one of the two main U.S. satellite
launching companies, along with Boeing. The Delta 3 was intended to
compete against Lockheed Martin's Atlas rocket in carrying bigger
commercial payloads into geostationary orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. launchers must also compete against commercial
launching companies in China, Japan, Russia and Ukraine, though
many of the main Russian launching operations have formed joint
ventures with American companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the commercial satellite food chain are private
companies that actually operate satellites and sell and use their
services, such as Panamsat, and government satellite agencies like
Intelsat.
</P>
<P>
   According to Landman of Panamsat, who spends much of his time
shopping and negotiating for deals with satellite builders and
launchers, the relative weakness of American companies in launching
commercial satellites has its roots in the early 1980s, when NASA's
space shuttle was touted as the new way to get commercial payloads
off the earth.
</P>
<P>
   As the space shuttle proved itself, American launching companies
focused almost exclusively on the military market. But after the
Challenger explosion, the Reagan administration severely cut back
on the shuttle's use for commercial purposes, arguing that it was
not worth risking lives for tasks that could be performed by
expendable rockets. The American companies, as a result, were not
as prepared as European companies, 36 of which had founded
Arianespace in 1980 with the idea of primarily serving the
commercial market.
</P>
<P>
   Changing focus from military to commercial applications, of
course, has become imperative for American aerospace companies of
all sorts. Last year, for the first time, the commercial space
business in the United States was larger than the market for
military aircraft _ $30.6 billion versus $30.5 billion _ according
to the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The new sense of competitive urgency extends to satellite
operators as well as satellite makers. Some companies test a new
rocket with a dummy payload to make sure that it works correctly.
But Boeing opted to use a live payload, the Galaxy X satellite made
by Hughes, in the launching of the Delta 3 last week. And Panamsat
was ready to be the extraterrestrial guinea pig, because it wants
to encourage the development of new rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's entire $225 million mission was insured. Last fall,
Panamsat opened a policy worth more than $3 billion with an
insurance group led by Space Machine Advisors, based in Greenwich,
Conn. Referring to a Space Machine Advisors executive who was at
the attempted launching last week, a Panamsat spokesman said, ``He
was the one with the real pale look on his face.''

PUTTING THE `M' BACK IN MTV 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a year ago, Judy McGrath, the president of MTV, sat in her
funky office 25 floors above Times Square, wondering about changes
she felt percolating among America's 12- to 34-year-olds, the
audience that hr network serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our business, there's nothing worse than missing a
moment,'' she said. ``And I sensed some moments changing out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV's researchers sensed it, too, and from the voluminous data
they piled on Ms. McGrath's desk, one sentence jumped out at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone had said, `I would rather give up food than give up
music,''' Ms. McGrath recalled. ``It struck me that I hadn't seen
something like that for a long while. Hip-hop had been, undeniably,
a big, tribal rallying thing, but now I felt like all music was
coming back onto the cultural radar screen in a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, MTV has made something of a comeback on that
cultural radar screen, too. After a few years of attention for
programs like ``Real World'' (a video verite show following
young-adult roommates thrown together for a year), the cartoon
``Beavis and Butt-head'' and the dating show ``Singled Out,''
starring Jenny McCarthy, MTV seemed to have strayed too far from
music.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. McGrath began steering it back, and the results are
starting to show. Since January, MTV has seen its Nielsen ratings
rise with its primary audience. In the second quarter, those
ratings were 22 percent higher than in the corresponding quarter of
1997. For the third quarter to date, they are up 21 percent, to
0.57 from 0.49 (each full rating point equals 610,980 viewers).
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, the
media research and consulting firm in Carmel, Calif., said he had
projected an increase in MTV's net revenue of $522 million this
year, up from $473 million in 1997, and a gain in its cash flow to
$231 million from $223 million. Laura Walker, an analyst with First
Boston, forecast even higher revenue and cash flow growth, to $570
million and $280 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Hatch, a media analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, said
MTV's advertising growth this year would be ``in the 20 percent
range, which is on the high end even for cable networks.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV's advertising growth is strong each year because the network
delivers a heavy concentration of teen-age and young-adult viewers
that is available almost nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   MTV has more competitors than ever. The emergence of Time
Warner's WB, a broadcast network dedicated to the 12- to
34-year-old group, has nibbled at MTV's audience. Although VH1 has
seen its audience grow older (its median age now is 30.5 years), it
sometimes draws MTV fans. And the continuing popularity of music by
young black artists _ hip-hop, rhythm and blues, and rap _ has made
Black Entertainment Television, or BET, a bit more of a rival.
</P>
<P>
   All of which led MTV to become ``more music-centric,'' said Tom
Freston, the president of MTV Networks, a unit of Viacom that
includes MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite and TV Land.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The re-focusing began last summer, when Ms. McGrath hired Brian
Graden, who had helped discover the scandalously irreverent cartoon
``South Park'' for Comedy Central, as director of development. She
asked him to generate pilots for music-based shows. ``We started
reminding everyone we had to treasure the `M' in MTV,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By December, she had promoted Graden from director of
development to executive vice president in charge of all
programming. In January, they began shifting the schedule so that
music, not lifestyle shows or comedy, dominated prime time.
</P>
<P>
   By then they had also given the go-ahead to a half-dozen new
shows, which began appearing in April. In ``Artist Cut,'' a
performer describes the creation of a video or song. In ``Say
What?'' printed lyrics are overlaid on a video. ``Fanatic'' takes a
fan to meet and interview a musician or group he or she idolizes.
And ``BIOrhythm'' gives a biographical sketch of a musician without
narration, using the artist's music and the music that influenced
him, intercut with interview snippets, video footage and printed
captions.
</P>
<P>
   In formulating these programs, Graden said, the idea was ``to
imagine new and expressive ways you could present music on
television,'' aside from stringing videos together or presenting
Top 20 countdown shows.
</P>
<P>
   The new shows also serve to promote artists, which can only help
MTV's relationships with the music industry. ``Our primary
relationship is with the audience, but next in importance is with
the managers, record companies and artists,'' Ms. McGrath said,
adding that they often misunderstand MTV's focus. ``I get these
calls saying things like, `I hear MTV only wants black-and-white
videos now,' or something like that, and it's so frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   To improve music-industry relations and bolster the
music-centric strategy, Ms. McGrath two weeks ago hired Tom
Calderone as head of music programming and talent relationships. He
had been a consultant to radio stations, advising them on what
music to play, primarily in the alternative-rock genre.
</P>
<P>
   Rock genres have been in something of a creative lull for
several years, eclipsed by hip-hop, rhythm and blues, and rap.
Indeed, MTV has a show called ``Jams Countdown,'' featuring
viewers' favorite rhythm and blues and hip-hop songs, as well as
``Total Request,'' a countdown show for all types of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't say, `Let's go after those genres,' instead of
others,'' Graden said. ``It's just that the mainstream embraced
those genres. We're in a very rhythmic time.''

 Can Football Revive CBS?

Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)(lh) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget all those quarterbacks surrounded by 300-pound charging
linemen: When the National Football League season starts this
Sunday, the real pressure will be on the executives who call the
plays at CBS. And they don't get to wear helmets.
</P>
<P>
   The contract that CBS signed in January to bring the NFL back
after a four-year absence from the network is surely the most
scrutinized deal in recent television history: an eight-year, $4
billion commitment for a package of American Football Conference
games. At $500 million a year, the deal is more than a 100 percent
increase over the $217 million a year that NBC had been paying for
the same package.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives have characterized the deal as a strategic coup
that they hope will be the linchpin to a resurgence in profits for
television's once-dominant network, which has recently posted
annual losses of $50 million to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, critics of CBS _ mainly executives at NBC, now
out of NFL television _ call the deal financially irresponsible and
predict that CBS will begin losing $100 million to $150 million a
year on football alone.
</P>
<P>
   The football broadcasts come at a critical time for the network
and for Mel Karmazin, the president who owns 1.1 percent of CBS's
stock and who was the driving force behind the deal. Only last
Thursday, CBS announced a reorganization that included cost-cutting
measures calculated to save $180 million. Among the moves announced
were layoffs of 200 to 300 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Cost-cutting measures have been announced at both NBC and ABC
this summer; but given the questions surrounding the size of the
football deal, the moves at CBS were seen in some quarters as
preparations for Hurricane Pigskin.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives forcefully denied that the cost-cutting was
related to the football deal, just as they have forcefully
asserted, in the face of contentions that they overpaid for NFL
games out of desperation, that their contract is sound and that the
deal will, in the words of Karmazin, ``make a dollar'' for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   One week before the first slate of Sunday afternoon games, Sean
McManus, the president of CBS Sports, is not backing away from that
rosy analysis of the deal. ``We're right on target,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers that give him confidence, McManus said, come from
increased advertising sales at both the network and CBS-owned
stations, revenue generated from an exchange of commercial time
with CBS affiliates, reduced costs for advertising in other media
to promote CBS shows and anticipated benefits to CBS's prime-time
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The latter was among the biggest reasons CBS thought it had to
reacquire the NFL. Without it, the network had almost no
programming that attracted young male viewers. ``Over the last few
years, young men had really left us,'' said Leslie Moonves, the
president of CBS Television. ``At the least, football will get some
of that blood flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those still skeptical about CBS's positive numbers is Dick
Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, who said, ``CBS is practicing
a form of mathematics with which none of my professors was familiar
_ because they didn't have enough beads in their abacus.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC is the network most familiar with CBS's football package
because it owned it for 33 years. That relationship ended in
January when NBC declined to match CBS's bid. Ebersol said NBC did
not think the package could be worth more than $300 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolzien, a neutral observer as a media analyst for Sanford
C. Bernstein, pointed out that NBC had a special incentive for
disparaging the CBS deal: ``NBC said no way would they spend that
much, so they're trying to prove the rightness of their vision.
Still, this is a tough go for CBS. I'm projecting they'll lose $50
million on football this year.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be significant, because CBS's payments to the NFL
will rise over the length of the contract. The network is actually
paying the least amount this season, an estimated $350 million. The
later payments will be especially huge, but CBS is counting on
advertising revenue to increase over time.
</P>
<P>
   McManus said, ``The true value to CBS is not going to be felt
for four or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, there is reason to be optimistic about
this season. CBS is getting better prices for commercial time
during the AFC games than NBC did, he said. Advertising industry
publications have estimated that CBS is getting about a 10 percent
increase, a figure NBC questions. McManus declined to comment on
the figure, but CBS's private estimates are that it will do even
better than that, an executive close to CBS said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One reason CBS may be doing better with ad sales, McManus said,
is that the AFC teams are finally perceived to be fully competitive
with those in the NFC, whose games are broadcast by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   CBS estimated that NBC sold ads in its package for about 15
percent less than Fox did, a disparity that CBS regarded as unfair.
But Ebersol pointed out that advertisers prefer to be in games that
reach the country's 10 biggest cities. The NFC has eight teams in
those cities; the AFC has three.
</P>
<P>
   What might help CBS in selling the games is simply that they are
new to it. When NBC pried the National Basketball Association games
away from CBS starting in 1990 for $600 million, the bid was
labeled dangerously high. But NBC, which extended the deal in 1993
for $750 million and again last year for $1.75 billion through
2002, found aggressive new ways to sell the games and made a huge
profit. CBS says it is doing the same thing with football this
year.
</P>
<P>
   McManus pointed to $45 million in new business that CBS has
attracted from Nasdaq, Southwest Airlines and other companies. But
Ebersol said that $25 million to $30 million in new business was
typical every year.
</P>
<P>
   McManus said he was also counting on about $40 million in a deal
the network made with affiliates to exchange commercial time in
other parts of the CBS schedule. Then there is about $25 million
that CBS is counting on saving from money it has been spending in
other media to promote its programs, which it now thinks it can do
during games.
</P>
<P>
   Some competing network executives question whether CBS can
really count on the $40 million in cash from its complicated deal
with its affiliates. And the questions about CBS come from more
quarters than just NBC. ABC and Fox were not happy either when CBS
started off the NFL negotiations with its pre-emptive bid for the
AFC. In effect, the NFL used CBS's urgency to set the price for
every package.
</P>
<P>
   One senior executive from a competing NFL network said CBS's
approach was amateurish. ``They didn't have to go in that high,''
the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   But CBS was fighting for nothing less than survival, at least in
terms of perception. ``The perception when CBS lost football was
that it was a second-class network,'' Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   Always encumbered by being the network with the oldest audience
_ in a business where advertisers pay premiums to reach younger
adults _ CBS has been disastrously deficient in reaching younger
men. Just adding the young men from NBC's AFC audience last year
would improve CBS's reach among men by 60 percent to 90 percent,
CBS says its research estimates.
</P>
<P>
   McManus said CBS carefully calculated the value of the NFL
before it made its huge bid. Crucial was the benefit to the
stations CBS owns, seven of which are in cities with AFC teams.
Those stations are adding many tie-in programs to the football
games _ coaches' shows for example. If the stations gain in local
market share, that will help justify the price, McManus said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if CBS gains younger male viewers for its prime-time
shows, the football deal will help pay for itself. David Poltrack,
the executive vice president of CBS Research said, ``As little as a
10 percent increase in male viewers, spread around prime time,
could generate a substantial profit increase.''
</P>
<P>
   If that success came because CBS had a breakout hit show, the
increase in advertising revenue could make up a large bit of the
football price all by itself, though CBS has not had a hit with
young male viewers in years. CBS is hoping that by promoting its
shows during the football games, viewers will at least start to
sample CBS shows.
</P>
<P>
   But the promotional value of sports has always been one of
television's biggest imponderables. CBS had the Winter Olympics
last year, yet no show the network promoted during that event
developed into a hit. And Sunday football presents some special
problems for CBS's program promotions.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are questions about the duration of any promotion's
effect. Can a Sunday football game really be used to promote, say,
CBS's new martial arts show, ``Martial Law,'' on Saturday nights,
six days after the last tackle is made?
</P>
<P>
   Promotions during Sunday football are most effective for shows
on Sunday nights. But Sunday is already CBS's best night. Its top
show, ``60 Minutes,'' is almost certain to be helped by direct
lead-ins from football. But how many football fans can be delivered
to ``Touched by an Angel'' and CBS's Sunday movie, which mainly
appeal to women?
</P>
<P>
   CBS does have some Monday shows with male stars, including
``Cosby,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and the new ``Benben'' show.
But all those shows will run against ``Monday Night Football'' on
ABC, which presumably would be a stronger draw to fans who watch
football on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Poltrack questioned that, citing statistics that showed that
only 30 percent of the younger men watching the AFC on Sunday tuned
in to ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that while promotional effect diminishes as days
pass, viewers could be at least made aware of shows. Thus, if a
younger man sees a promotion for ``Martial Law'' on Sunday and
happens to be scanning channels the next Saturday, he might find
the show and remember he had seen the commercial for it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in terms of the profit and loss this season,
CBS executives say they think they did the right thing to get back
into business with the NFL, because network television is becoming
more and more dependent on one-of-a-kind event programming. They
pointed to the deal Fox signed with the NFL four years ago, which
was then ridiculed as recklessly overpriced at $395 million a year.
But, even though Fox eventually took a $350 million write-off on
losses related to football, the NFL deal by every other assessment
was a huge success, helping to put Fox on the map as a network.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Carey, the chairman of Fox Television, said in a speech in
June that NBC's decision to pass on the NFL deal ``will go down as
one of the defining moments of recent network history,'' one, he
said, that NBC is likely to regret.
</P>
<P>
   With the NBA, the Olympics and other sports events still in
their grip, NBC executives are convinced that their network can
survive easily without football. The question, as Ebersol and other
NBC executives see it, is whether CBS can survive with it.

 &HT;    POLITICAL CRISIS DEEPENS AS COMMUNISTS VOW TO OPPOSE
CHERNOMYRDIN
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin and the opposition-led
parliament were headed for a political showdown Monday after the
Communist Party said it would vote against the nomination of Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise announcement Sunday night came only hours after the
Kremlin and parliamentary leaders had forged a tentative
power-sharing agreement to form a new government and begin coping
with Russia's deep financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic political turmoil increased the chances President
Clinton will arrive Tuesday for a two-day summit with Yeltsin with
no permanent Russian government in place.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative deal reached Sunday would have meant an
unprecedented surrender of some powers by the imperious Yeltsin to
the parliament. But it appeared to unravel, leaving Russia where it
began the day, on the verge of economic collapse and with no one
clearly in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party would
vote Monday against the confirmation of Chernomyrdin, who served as
prime minister from 1992 until being sacked by Yeltsin last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chernomyrdin is an accomplice with Yeltsin in the destruction
of the past five years'' of Russia's economy, Zyuganov said in an
interview on Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists, with 138 seats in the 450-member Duma,
parliament's lower house, also announced they would vote en bloc
against the power-sharing deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma's third largest bloc, the 51-seat Liberal Democratic
Party led by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, also announced
its opposition to Chernomyrdin and to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-seat Yabloko bloc in parliament, which advocates
Western-style reforms, also announced it would oppose Chernomyrdin
and the agreement. Its leader, Grigory Yavlinsky, said it suspected
the power-sharing deal would be scrapped by the Kremlin after
Chernomyrdin's confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the three blocs control enough seats to defeat
Chernomyrdin. But he could still win enough votes for confirmation
Monday, especially if the vote is taken by secret ballot, which
would make party discipline hard to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma were to fail three times to approve Yeltsin's
nominee for prime minister, the president must under Russia's
constitution dissolve the Duma and call new elections, which aren't
scheduled to take place until late 1999. Then, Yeltsin also can
install Chernomyrdin as prime minister without the approval of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In his TV appearance, Zyuganov said that he was willing to
continue negotiations with the Kremlin. That suggested the
Communist leader's outspoken antagonism is a bargaining tactic as
parliament seeks more power.
</P>
<P>
   The political machinations over the weekend overshadowed
Russia's economic crisis. Outward signs of public anxiety subsided
as banks and financial markets were closed.
</P>
<P>
   But polls show there is widespread public skepticism that
Russia's current political leaders can pull the country out of its
troubled times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nice scenario, the coalition, all factions agreeing to
cooperate to solve Russia's problems. But look at the factions and
the differing views of the people involved. Even if an arrangement
is agreed upon, how quickly will it be able to implement (economic)
solutions? How soon before one faction or another gets angry and
breaks off?'' said Sergei Markov, director of Institute for
Political Studies, a Moscow research center.
</P>
<P>
   After a party caucus late Sunday, Zyuganov said the Communist
bloc in parliament was unwilling to accept an agreement that
offered no assurances that Yeltsin or Chernomyrdin would adhere to
the power-sharing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the document is not guaranteeing anybody anything,''
Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists and other hard-line factions in the Duma are
seeking to obtain seats in the cabinet for at least several of
their members and gain a meaningful role in formulating government
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-page agreement drafted after frantic weekend
talks, Yeltsin would retain control of the security forces with the
right to fill three key posts _ the ministries of defense, foreign
affairs and internal security. In exchange, he would agree for the
first time to seek Duma approval of most other cabinet
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Yeltsin would agree not to dissolve the Duma, and
parliamentary leaders would refrain from taking a no-confidence
vote on the prime minister's government.
</P>
<P>
   While falling short of what they had sought, the document seemed
to represent a breakthrough for the opposition, stymied for years
by the broad constitutional powers possessed by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was scheduled to meet Monday with Chernomyrdin to
discuss the weekend negotiations with parliament leaders. The
Kremlin said Yeltsin would probably make his views known on the
political negotiations after that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview taped Friday but not aired in full
until Sunday, Yeltsin said it was premature to change the 1993
constitution, which gave him sweeping, almost dictatorial, powers.
</P>
<P>
   But he advocated a constitutional commission representing all
political factions to consider amendments. Yeltsin said such a
commission ``would need much time,'' perhaps as long as a year, to
complete its work.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yeltsin fired Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and his team
of economic reformers on Aug. 23 and reinstated Chernomyrdin to the
job, speculation has been rampant that Yeltsin would either resign
or become a figurehead president, handing over most
responsibilities to Chernomyrdin, 60.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, 67 and ailing, said in the television interview that he
would not quit and that it would be ``impossible'' to remove him
from office before his term ends in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said Sunday his confirmation as prime minister was
critical to Russia's ability to prevent an economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ruble, which has fallen in value as much as 50
percent in street trading over the past two weeks, ``is hanging on
a thin thread.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has appointed three respected reformers _ cabinet
members Boris Fyodorov and Mikhail Zadornov and Central Bank
Chairman Sergei Dubinin _ to a commission charged with forming an
anti-crisis plan.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said: ``Time must not be lost. ...A country should
not live without a government for a single day. Instead we keep on
talking for weeks.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cool air with low humidity will spread across the Great Lakes
into the interior Northeast as a cold front moves gradually off the
Northeast Coast. A broken area of showers will linger near the
front in New England, especially over the mountain of New Hampshire
and Maine. Otherwise, a mixture of sunshine and puffy clouds will
prevail across the region.
</P>
<P>
   High surf will lash parts of the Southeast Coast as Hurricane
Danielle begins to curve out to sea 250 miles miles east of the
Georgia coast. Most of the Southeast will be hot and humid. A few
strong thunderstorms will form during the afternoon from the
interior Gulf Coast states to the southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   A sprawling low-pressure zone centered over the southern Gulf of
Mexico will be surrounded by bands of heavy thundershowers. A few
of the bands may brush the Texas and Louisiana coasts as well as
parts of southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of thundershowers will move through the southern
Missouri Valley near a front separating hot conditions over the
southern Plains from cooler air to the north. Another front marking
the leading edge of an autumnal air mass will promote a few showers
from the Dakotas to northern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually hot weather will persist in many areas west of the
Rockies. Near record heat is expected in parts of the interior
Northwest. Offshore winds will send hot air toward the normally
cooler coastal areas from Oregon to southern California. Farther
east, scattered afternoon thunderstorms will form over the central
and southern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: When Summer Ends
</P>
<P>
   Near record heat will occur in many areas west of the Rockies
this week. Yet, among the official keepers of climatological
records, summer in the northern hemisphere will end Monday, the
last day of the three warmest months of the year. For many, the
traditional end of summer will come a week from Monday on Labor
Day. But the beginning and end of a season is an astronomical
event, not a meteorological one. Astronomers, sticklers for
precision, will declare an end to summer at 1:37 a.m. EDT on Sept.
23, when the direct rays of the noontime sun shift into the
southern hemisphere.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER TESTS LAW ON ENCRYPTION CODE  
 WEB COMPANY RIDES INITIAL-OFFERING WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Booher was hardly surprised last month when two agents
from the Department of Commerce knocked on his door in Silicon
Valley and handed him a federal subpoena. In fact, he had been
expecting it ever since he first made his data-encryption program
available on the Internet in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department is investigating whether Booher's
software, which is called Secure Office and is intended to protect
the privacy of computer files by scrambling the data, violates U.S.
export law. The rules require Americans who distribute encryption
software internationally to obtain an export license; making
software available on the Internet is considered international
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Booher acknowledges that few people have downloaded the software
from his Web site at www.filesafety.com. But a big number of users
was not his real goal.
</P>
<P>
   Booher, a software engineer at Phase Metrics Corp. in Fremont,
Calif., who wrote the encryption program in his spare time, said he
posted the program to challenge the export rules.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption has been a hotly debated issue in Washington lately,
with the Commerce Department, the FBI and other agencies arguing
that powerful data-scrambling programs put high-technology
espionage tools in the hands of criminals, spies and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But Booher is among the software developers who contend that
their right to write encryption code is protected by the First
Amendment and that the technology is already easily available
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not whether this stuff is going to exist,''
Booher said, ``but who will develop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Monika Wasiewicz, the Commerce Department agent in charge of the
case, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Booher was supposed to testify to a federal grand jury in San
Jose, Calif., last week, but the session was canceled because too
few jurors showed up. Booher's testimony is supposed to be
rescheduled for this week.

   WEB Company Rides Initial-Offering Wave
</P>
<P>
   For any curious observer of the business world who sits before
Mark Cuban, president of Broadcast.com in Dallas, the most pressing
question is not the state of media on the Internet or the future
direction of his company, which transmits audio and video
programming over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The question is probably: What was going through his mind on
July 16 as he watched the stock price of his company shoot from $18
to $74 before settling at $62.75, the best first day for an initial
public offering in history?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, this is really, really cool,'' he remembers
thinking as he sat in the New York offices of Nasdaq and watched
the numbers ticking higher and higher. By the end of that first
day, the company's valuation exceeded $1 billion, and his personal
net worth _ on paper, at least _ rose to $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been married, but I guess that feeling I had that
day was similar to what a groom would feel at the altar,'' Cuban
said. ``I've never been the No. 1 draft pick for the NFL or NBA,
either. Actually, that's probably even closer to the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, 40, was making the rounds in Manhattan last week with his
business partner, Todd Wagner, 38, after the so-called quiet period
when principals in newly public companies are not permitted to
publicly discuss the stock.
</P>
<P>
   It was an interesting week to be touring Wall Street. By the end
of last week's widespread market carnage, shares of Broadcast.com
were trading at $44.375, down $6.625 on Friday alone. That was
still well above the company's offering price but off more than 29
percent from its first-day close.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he remained inspired by his vision of the mythic
``94-year-old lady'' who may have bought shares at $74. ``I want to
make her look like a financial genius,'' he said.

IN NFL AD WAR, SPONSORS PLAYING TOUGH DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if the National Football League season that begins in six
days offers fans one close, hard-fought clash after another, it
will be difficult to match the intense, high-stakes preseason
skirmishing between the networks showing the games and the
advertisers sponsoring them.
</P>
<P>
   The huge increases in fees being paid by four networks for
rights to the telecasts of pro football for the next eight seasons
spurred them at first to consider selling commercial time at rates
25 to 30 percent higher for 1998-99 than for 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   But when executives at the agencies handling media chores for
marketers countered that _ to paraphrase the assertion made by
George Foreman in Meineke muffler commercials _ they weren't going
to pay a lot for this season, the increases the networks asked for
were held to much lower levels, an estimated 8 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may have casually mentioned, `Oh, the advertisers
will pay for it,''' said Steve Grubbs, executive vice president for
national broadcast buying at the BBDO New York unit of Omnicom
Group, ``but that's one thing you don't say.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he added, ``the costs are nowhere near what was
projected before negotiations began.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, always healthy give and take, and not a
small amount of posturing, in the annual negotiations between
networks and advertisers. The networks' hands are strengthened by
the fact that football remains the mainstay for marketers seeking
to reach male consumers in the important fall and Christmas
shopping seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain degree, we're a business of no surprises,'' said
Jon Mandel, co-managing director and chief negotiating officer at
Mediacom, the media services unit of Grey Advertising in New York.
``And football is still one of the best programs on television
because you know what you're going to get: the ratings it delivers,
the demographics it delivers, which are hard to replicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Another selling point for the networks is the power of live
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important element to me when I buy an ad in any
medium is the attention and involvement of the audience,'' said
Gene DeWitt, chairman of DeWitt Media Inc., a leading media buyer
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still jump up and down and shout at the screen while
watching football,'' he said. ``That's good.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, marketers must perceive that they are
getting value for the hundreds of millions of dollars they spend
with the networks that own the rights, which are now the ABC and
ESPN units of Walt Disney Co.; CBS, owned by CBS Corp., and the Fox
Broadcasting Co. division of News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is a big, important vehicle for advertisers as long
as pricing stays within reason,'' said John Muszynski, senior vice
president and executive director for the national television buying
group at Starcom Media Services, a unit of the Leo Burnett Co. in
Chicago. ``Otherwise, they're going to re-evaluate whether the NFL
is still something they need.''
</P>
<P>
   The most fervent opposition to paying significantly more for
commercials during the 1998-99 season came from Detroit automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even without that, prices were unlikely to rise steeply
because ``the national broadcast network marketplace has been soft
in general,'' said Larry Blasius, senior vice president and
director for national broadcast at TN Media, a unit of True North
Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And a policy change by the NFL, requiring the networks to end
segments known as ``enhancements'' _ brief sponsored moments like
scoreboards and replays _ may have discouraged smaller advertisers,
Blasius said.
</P>
<P>
   One agency executive, however, said he was pleased with the
elimination of the enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the telecasts `cleaner' for viewers and therefore
more valuable to those advertisers remaining with football,'' said
Peter Chrisanthopoulos, president for broadcast and programming-USA
at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, a unit of WPP Group PLC in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is the pre-eminent sport on television,'' he said,
``garnering the largest ratings and reaching the largest number of
men. With reasonable prices advertisers feel comfortable with, not
in proportion to the increases in the rights fees, they continued
with the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, commercial time on pro football games for September and
October is, to use an expression of the TV advertising marketplace,
very well sold.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Mandel of Mediacom put it, chuckling: ``The market is
softer than the networks planned. But we'll turn on our TVs and
there it will be _ advertising.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That will be particularly true on Jan. 31, when Fox is to
broadcast Super Bowl XXXIII. Marketers have already bought about 70
percent of available time during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, the Super Bowl is sold out in the
first half and maybe in the first three quarters,'' said Grubbs of
BBDO New York, who added that he has bought spots for ``the usual
suspects'' like the Pepsi-Cola Co. unit of Pepsico Inc. and Visa
USA, as well as ``some other people I can't talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Time on Super Sunday is being marked up much more steeply than
spots during regular-season games as a result of what Grubbs called
``the `Seinfeld' effect'' _ that is, the eye-popping rates,
averaging $1.5 million to $1.7 million, for each 30-second
commercial during the ``Seinfeld'' finale in May.
</P>
<P>
   Some advertisers are paying an estimated average of $1.6 million
for each 30-second spot in Super Bowl XXXIII, up 23 percent from
the average cost of $1.3 million for each such spot in Super Bowl
XXXII.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I don't know if you should believe everything you
read,'' said Muszynski of Starcom, referring to those reported
average prices, ``the Super Bowl is still an incredibly powerful
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Blasius of TN Media noted, Super Sunday has increasingly
become ``a platform for advertisers to showcase their new and best
creative work.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the networks can bring back one enhancement for regular
season games: a ``commercial showcase'' for Super Bowl-style spots
_ priced at Super Bowl rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the world of television news, the impending doom
of deadline can be measured by the number of reporters in
overpriced suits scurrying about the newsroom like billiard balls
without a pocket.
</P>
<P>
   At a quarter-to-five, the newsroom at Fox 5/WNYW-TV is at a
muted frenzy. A self-important junior reporter with padded
shoulders gripes to someone of little influence that his stories
never make the first segment. Another reporter, in a pink skirt,
voices her displeasure, in language that would make a longshoreman
blush, at a script she has not written and says is not up to her
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Above the din, seemingly unaware, Mike Sheehan, the hard-boiled
crime reporter, sits at his terminal, waiting for the one
illuminating line to pop onto his screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's a sicko,'' he says in a voice more Jimmy Breslin
than Tom Brokaw. ``How do you sexually assault a 5-year-old?''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan, 50, is not your typical television reporter. ``I ain't
the most handsome horse in the stable,'' he says. He looks funny on
camera, like a normal guy with his graying hair and aging face, the
Irish jowls and a thick New York tenor.
</P>
<P>
   Off-camera, his dialogue is so salty it could cure fish. He
claims it is that tongue, that certain New York sensibility, the 25
years on the streets as an undercover officer and then as a
homicide detective, that has at least gotten him close to the big
time.
</P>
<P>
   He may be underestimating himself. He is in the big time, one of
the most recognizable crime reporters in New York, and it is
precisely his sleuthing skills that got his face on television in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit that the Damon Runyon thing works for me,'' he said
over a beer at Phoenix Park Pub on East 67th Street after filing
his report on the child abuser. ``A little Dashiell Hammett works
on New York news. People like that, the cop-speak. Words like
nabbed, nailed and collared. I'm one of the only true `born and
bred never left town' New Yorkers on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is much more than the tough-guy image that makes someone
like Mike Sheehan a bona fide reporter. It is his extensive
contacts within law-enforcement circles and his ability to
reconstruct a crime. Crime is still the bread and butter of tabloid
and local television news. But crime is down and the Giuliani
administration is stingy in doling out information. In a sense,
this plays to Sheehan's strengths. Detectives call him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought detectives do exactly what reporters do,''
said Robert Daley, a former foreign correspondent for The New York
Times, who served as the deputy commissioner of public information
for the New York Police Department in 1971 under Mayor John
Lindsay. ``They both go out and talk to people and find out what
the hell is going on. The difference is, a reporter is stopped at
the police line.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan says that with fewer sensational crimes, storytelling
becomes even more crucial. ``It's a dog and pony show,'' he said.
``Child molesters. Floaters. Missing people. There's not a whole
lot of bodies out there these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to stretch, to dance, what they call
filling air. What I'm able to bring to the viewer in a situation
like that is a rundown of what detectives are doing behind the
tape.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, there are a few others like him. The New York Daily
News has a police reporter, John Marzulli, a former officer.
WNBC/Channel 4 recently hired Scott Weinberger, who is being billed
as a former police officer from Florida, although NBC officials,
asked last week, would not say what city in Florida. The New Yorker
magazine recently hired a mole within the NYPD, a man who writes
under the pseudonym Marcus Laffey. The assistant to Laffey's agent
demanded a list of questions before he would get in touch with his
boss about getting in touch with his client.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sheehan is from the old school. No handlers. No agents.
Shoot from the hip. Last Monday, Sheehan awoke at 6:30 a.m. at his
home in TriBeCa, put on the kettle and tuned his radio to 1010
WINS-AM Radio. He turned on the television, flipped through the
morning talk shows, read the papers, checked his two pagers. He
dressed himself in tasseled loafers, a blue Oxford shirt, orange
tie and put his gold detective's shield _ badge No. 421 _ in his
pocket. He kissed his wife and lumbered off to work.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the same routine since he joined Fox six years ago.
It wasn't a bad transition for the man who as a detective worked
the John Lennon case, helped crack the Preppy Murder (the Robert
Chambers case) and the Central Park Jogger case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made me an offer, so what was I going to do? Turn it down
and kick myself in the head for the rest of my life?'' he asked
himself after a third beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part was convincing some of the past pinheads and
pencil-necked geeks'' _ journalists with college credentials but
little street knowledge _ ``that I wasn't some dumb slob, but a
trained investigator who knows the streets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The son of an Irish immigrant from County Cork, Sheehan grew up
in Yorkville on 97th Street and Madison Avenue, graduated from
Manhattan College and began his police career as a student
infiltrator at Columbia University in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he was the first journalist to report the arrest
of John Royster, who was charged with the beating of a woman in
Central Park, and the case of two teen-agers charged with
disemboweling a businessman in Central Park. And he has had a
number of exclusives on the case of Irene Silverman, the missing
Manhattan widow.
</P>
<P>
   The secret is an eye for detail and an ear of compassion, say
others who have made the same transition. ``Everybody would like to
have a cop like Sheehan,'' said Chris Borgen, now retired and the
first New York detective to appear on New York television, as a
reporter for WCBS/Channel 2 in 1966. ``I found that people are more
likely to talk to a cop whom they've seen on the streets and on
television.''

   DIANA-MEMORIAL _ PARIS _ Parisians and tourists have been
invited to join a candle-lit procession to the Pont de lAlma to
commemorate the first anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess
of Wales. A ceremony will be held at 12:26 a.m. (local time) today,
to mark the moment when Dianas limousine hit the 13th pillar of an
underpass on a right bank expressway. Her companion, Dodi Fayed,
and the driver, Henri Paul, also died. The ceremony is being
organized by a private association, Paris Odysee, after the royal
family informed the British embassy and Paris city council that
expressions of grief should be limited to personal reflection.

   RUSSIA-CRISIS MOSCOW Confronted by the country's economic
turmoil and with no one clearly in charge, the Kremlin and leaders
of the Communist-led parliament forged a political truce Sunday
designed to allow a new government to begin coping with the crisis.
The agreement would smooth the way for the Duma on Monday to
confirm Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister before the arrival
Tuesday of President Clinton for a summit with President Boris
Yeltsin. The compromise seeks to end a week of uncertainty over who
is running Russia as the ruble plummets in value and consumer
prices rise. The document, reached during frantic weekend
negotiations, would force Yeltsin to relinquish some of his
extensive powers. But it does not go as far as Communists had
sought. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   DDN-COX-ISSUELESS_ DAYTON, Ohio _ When Republican candidate for
governor Bob Taft unveiled a major initiative to help financially
strapped families make ends meet, the event didn't make the late
evening news in the state capitol. A burning hay field, a store
running out of lottery tickets and a three-day-old report about
vandals hitting a suburban school did. Likewise, when Democrat Lee
Fisher released a health care proposal that will be a centerpiece
of his campaign, it did not initially make the airwaves _ and only
one major newspaper ran the story on page one the next day. In 10
weeks, Ohioans will choose their next governor. The winner will
face a daunting list of challenges _ school funding, electric
utility deregulation, HMO reform, prison overcrowding, privatizing
public services and tax reform. But for most voters, perhaps the
only contact they will have with the candidates will be through the
million of dollars in paid TV advertising that will flood the
airwaves during the final weeks leading to Nov. 3. (Miller, Dayton
Daily News)

PATENTS: INTERNET SEARCH SYSTEM; BRA FOR WOMEN AFTER HEART SURGERY;
DETECTING FAKE VIDEOTAPES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ind., Conn.)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searching the Internet is inevitably an exercise in information
overload.
</P>
<P>
   Type a single word and you are likely to get thousands of hits,
only a handful of which are pertinent to your actual field of
interest. Adding an extra search term can often make things worse _
instead of narrowing your search, you can end up with even more
hits.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you could pose a question to the search engine in
plain English, in the same way that you might pose a question to
the research librarian at your local library? And what if the
search engine could understand the question, and respond to it
precisely, just as an all-knowing librarian would be able to reach
for the right book on the reference shelf?
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Dahlgren, a computational linguist, and her colleague,
Edward Stabler, contend that they have built exactly such a search
engine, which they recently patented.
</P>
<P>
   The system, dubbed Inquizit, is based on natural-language
searching, which means that it retrieves and stores information in
much the way that people talk.
</P>
<P>
   The system is built in part on a set of principles Ms. Dahlgren
laid out in her 1988 book, ``Naive Semantics for Natural Language
Understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We model the way people interpret the meanings of a word _
through context,'' Ms. Dahlgren said. ``We search on meaning by
using grammar and structure and semantics. Every word has
associated with it a set of beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Ms. Dahlgren said, a query such as ``What kinds of wood
are bats made of?'' would probably yield documents having to do
with baseball bats and hickory.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a query using identical key words with vastly
different meanings _ ``Do bats live in the woods?'' for example _
would yield documents about species of bats that live in trees.
</P>
<P>
   But don't other search engines, like Ask Jeeves
(www.askjeeves.com), already rely on natural-language retrieval?
Ms. Dahlgren says no.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these pseudo-natural-language searches, you write the
sentence and they throw away the little words and then do a
standard Boolean search, possibly with some statistics thrown in,''
she said. ``But they are essentially all pattern matchers. Since
they don't actually figure out what the query means, they end up
with enormous over-retrieval.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit to the askjeeves.com site, the query
``What kinds of wood are bats made of?'' turned up 10 sites,
including three devoted to the actor James Woods, two that sold
golfing equipment, and encyclopedia entries on ``bat,'' ``bats''
and ``wood.''
</P>
<P>
   The query ``Do bats live in the woods?'' turned up six hits,
including a site selling softball and baseball equipment, a site
that features major-league batting-average records, and a link to
the Death Clock site, ``the Internet's friendly reminder that life
is slipping away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dahlgren acknowledged that others, like Microsoft, are
trying to develop true natural-language programs. But she said the
difference between her approach and that of Microsoft was that she
and Stabler had hand-built their vast linguistic dictionary _ an
undertaking that took nearly 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is trying to write dictionaries automatically by
searching machine-coded dictionaries,'' she said. ``We actually
built the dictionary by hand, as opposed to throwing a machine at
the problem so we wouldn't have to sit down and write up all these
linguistic rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft declined to comment on Inquizit's technology and on
Ms. Dahlgren's assessment of its own approach.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Inquizit has been financed by an Army research grant,
private investors and ``sweat equity,'' according to Ms. Dahlgren.
So if Inquizit has discovered the Holy Grail of search engines, why
hasn't it been gobbled up yet by a Microsoft or Yahoo?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to companies whose names you would recognize,''
said Taylor Hawke, director of marketing for Inquizit. He said that
the company planned to license its technology but that it was
considering setting up its own Internet search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Inquizit, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., received
patent No. 5,794,050.
</P>
<P>
   Bra for Women After Heart Surgery
</P>
<P>
   Mary Whisman had open-heart surgery a few years ago, as did her
daughter and her daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that women have this terrible problem that men
don't have,'' Mrs. Whisman said. ``Store-bought brassieres push
terribly on the place where they put the wire in after they open up
your sternum.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Whisman has patented a brassiere for postoperative
open-heart-surgery patients.
</P>
<P>
   Its main feature is a roll of soft padding that sits underneath
the breasts, and keeps the bra from pressing directly against the
sternum area. The bra, which opens in front, holds each breast in a
separate cup and features wide, padded straps, according to Mrs.
Whisman.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whisman, who lives in North Vernon, Ind., said she hoped to
license patent No. 5,782,670.
</P>
<P>
   System to Detect Fake Videotapes
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a way to verify whether those videotapes of alien
spaceships are authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Harlan Brothers, of Branford, Conn., has patented a video-camera
encryption system that uses Global Positioning System satellite
receivers to encode videotape with the time and place it was taken.
The tape is then played back on special equipment that decodes and
displays information about the time and place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of UFOs, you would be able to know whether the
tape was doctored in any way,'' Brothers said. ``Of course, that
doesn't stop anyone from staging an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Brothers, who is seeking to license patent No. 5,799,083, said
the technology had more pedestrian applications, such as
documentation for insurance purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231.

`ECOLOGY OF FEAR': MORE FOLLY THAN DISASTER IN PARADISE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the oldest cliche about Los Angeles is the near perfection of
its weather _ 219 consecutive days without measurable precipitation
last year _ the second oldest is that Southern California's
paradise is periodically destroyed by undeserved disasters _
natural, social and literary _ like last winter's devastating El
Nino, which toppled rainfall records around the state.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ecology of Fear: Los Angeles and the Imagination of
Disaster,'' Mike Davis has the temerity to argue not only that
Southern California has always been a place where extremes of
earth, wind and fire make notions like ``average rainfall'' a mere
abstraction, but that the modern, man-made monstrosity of Los
Angeles ``has deliberately put itself in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For generations, market-driven urbanization has transgressed
environmental common sense,'' Davis writes in his opening chapter.
``Historic wildfire corridors have been turned into view-lot
suburbs, wetland liquefaction zones into marinas, and flood plains
into industrial districts and housing tracts. Monolithic public
works have been substituted for regional planning and a responsible
land ethic. As a result, Southern California has reaped flood, fire
and earthquake tragedies that were as avoidable, as unnatural, as
the beating of Rodney King and the ensuing explosion in the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not a novel conceit for Davis, whose earlier book on Los
Angeles, ``City of Quartz'' (1991), established him as a quirky,
cranky and occasionally infuriating force to be reckoned with in
the all-too-limited literature of the nation's second-largest city.
A onetime meat cutter and long-distance truck driver, Davis has
taught urban theory at the Southern California Institute of
Architecture and recently won a MacArthur Fellowship. He sees Los
Angeles through Marx-colored glasses, and the thread that runs
through his work is the cruel and perpetual folly of the ruling
elites.
</P>
<P>
   But if Davis takes a darkling view of the California dream,
there is nothing dim or dull about his book. His great strengths
are a vigorous prose style (Southern California is ``Walden Pond on
LSD''), a provocative thesis (most thinking about Los Angeles
``simultaneously imposes false expectations on the environment and
then explains the inevitable disappointments as proof of a malign
and hostile nature'') and a dizzying catalog of delicious, and
sometimes frightening, facts. (The heat from the fires of the 1992
riot was so intense that a government satellite could detect it
from space.)
</P>
<P>
   In a series of loosely connected, longish essays, Davis
chronicles Southern California's fall from Edenic grace through
rapacious overdevelopment and the ceaseless marketing of myths,
like its ``climatic exceptionalism,'' that were no more than that
to begin with. His restless curiosity covers everything from the
region's little-noticed experience with tornadoes (he says Los
Angeles is the American metropolis that has suffered most from
tornado damage in its urban core) to the inevitable clash with
mountain lions, coyotes and other fauna caused by the city's steady
encroachment into rural canyons. (Los Angeles has ``the longest
wild edge'' of any major nontropical city, he writes.)
</P>
<P>
   But what really animates the book is the author's sense of
outrage at the social inequities ever present in the fallen
paradise. He boils at the city fathers' failure to set aside
adequate public parkland for the growing metropolis as private
owners gobbled up beachfront, canyon and ranch, and he notes that
by 1928, ``barely half an inch of publicly owned beach frontage was
left for each citizen of Los Angeles County,'' a reality that any
proletarian beachcomber knows too well today.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is never more persuasive than in a chapter called ``The
Case for Letting Malibu Burn.'' With dead-eyed precision, he
distills the bitter irony wrought by years of deliberate fire
suppression in the canyons above the Pacific: Multimillion-dollar
movie-star homes are protected, but so is dead brush, which becomes
thicker and makes the inevitable periodic conflagrations even
worse. He juxtaposes this account with a chronicle of the city's
apparent inability to prevent fires in the fleabag hotels that are
the housing of last resort for impoverished immigrants downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a prodigiously researched chapter on the genre of
disaster films and fiction in which Los Angeles is happily
destroyed becomes more than just a giddy survey of pop culture and
instead explores how often racial minorities have been both
scapegoated and targeted for such destruction, from Japanese
immigrants at the turn of the century to the black and Hispanic
underclass of today.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At times, Davis' unceasing focus on the defects of his hometown
dystopia becomes overwhelming, and a happily transplanted reader is
tempted to throw down the book and head for the beach, or tell him
to. Despite his own pronounced gift for original phrase making, he
also has an annoying habit of expropriating the piquant
observations of others in quotation marks without attribution in
the text, though the book has meticulous footnotes and a thorough
index.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Davis remains a foursquare pessimist about the
region, an understandable position since current estimates project
that California's population will grow by 18 million people, an
entire New York state, by the year 2025, and much of the state's
land mass is uninhabitable desert and mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In the concluding chapter, tantalizingly titled ``Beyond `Blade
Runner,''' he portrays the painful decline of once-middle-class
suburbs and the growing ``gulag'' of the state's prison population,
but never really proposes any solutions of his own. In Davis'
account, the world ends in fire, and the next time is now. Summing
up the orbiting satellite's view of the Rodney King riot's
``thermal anomalies,'' Davis concludes, ``Seen from space, the city
that once hallucinated itself as an endless future without natural
limits or social constraints now dazzles observers with the eerie
beauty of an erupting volcano.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lon Otremba has a rare advantage among top executives
in New York City's Silicon Alley high-technology industry: a track
record as an executive who took an Internet company from ground
zero to a respectable public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the original management team of the online publisher
Cnet, Otremba is now the chief operating officer of Iname, a
start-up that offers permanent and personalized e-mail accounts. In
an industry that has very little history and thus a dearth of
experienced, successful executives, he is already on Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of experienced managers in technology industries is
especially acute in New York. Unlike Silicon Valley, Northern
California's hotbed of high-technology start-ups, or Dallas, the
hub of the telecommunications industry, Silicon Alley has only a
handful of executives who have actually built a company from the
ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an ongoing problem to attract senior
management and build a board,'' said Michael Flannery, president of
the New York-based executive search firm Redwood Partners. Although
successful initial public offerings by a handful of Silicon Alley
companies have made the industry more attractive to experienced
executives and have thus eased the problem a bit, more recent
start-ups are still struggling to find and lure top managers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the tiny pool of second-generation entrepreneurs,
recruiters must turn to the corporate world, he said, and gamble
that an executive hailing from an established corporation can drive
a start-up to success.
</P>
<P>
   Flannery, who also manages a small venture capital fund and is
in need of managers for his own portfolio of companies, says there
is no sure formula for determining who can make the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough call,'' he said of finding the right executive.
``I really put them through the drill. I take them down the road,
painting a picture of what it's like to run a start-up; making
payroll; constantly raising capital; building a model. I watch
their facial expressions. Sometimes, after I'm finished they say,
`You're right, Mike. I don't want to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The executive candidate is gambling, too. When Otremba joined
Cnet in 1993, for example, he was leaving a comfortable position as
publisher of PC Magazine, a Ziff-Davis publication.
</P>
<P>
   In his job at Ziff-Davis, he could see the Internet coming, so
when Cnet's founders, Halsey Minor and Shelby Bonnie, approached
him with their idea for a company that would produce television and
Internet programming about computers, he understood the potential.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with his proven track record in traditional publishing,
his high marketability and a wife and two children to consider,
Otremba, who was then 36, had a lot of options. In addition, the
job would require him to commute weekly to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no doubt the idea was a good one,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``Still, I had to do a lot of soul-searching to decide
if it was the right time to join a start-up. Finally, I realized I
wouldn't be starving if the whole thing imploded.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside was an equity stake in Cnet and the opportunity to
create a corporate culture and be part of a technology revolution.
On the other hand, he had to create the company from scratch and
sacrifice many amenities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big deal for me when I could arrange for car service
to the airport, when I got my corporate credit card and could hire
an assistant,'' he said of the growth of Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   Otremba stayed with Cnet three years, until he was fully vested,
helping take the company from 10 employees to 600. Then he was
ready to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``People read the registration statement, so they knew exactly
when my vesting was up,'' he said. ``I started getting calls
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Otremba was commuting weekly from New York to San
Francisco, so when he ran into the founders of the New York-based
Iname, he was ready to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was available for a second run while it was still early'' in
the development of the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting firms have recognized the challenge and are setting
up special efforts to find executives for new-media start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Among those specializing in Silicon Alley companies is Cara
Erickson, a partner at the search firm of Accord Group/Johnson,
Smith &AMP; Knisley who has placed executives for companies like
Chicago-based Classified Ventures and Microsoft Corp. She is now
seeking a chief executive for the online financial news service
TheStreet.com, whose founder, James Cramer, already runs a hedge
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation is often not the issue, Ms. Erickson said, because
the industry has matured enough that many start-ups, particularly
those with solid venture backing, can compete with the high-end
salaries of the established corporate world and are not deterred by
the price tag for seasoned executives.
</P>
<P>
   But finding the right executive can take time. Ms. Erickson says
she looks for problem solvers who fit into the management team
puzzle _ that is, a chief executive, chief financial officer and
chief operating officer who complement each other in skills and
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to find one person with all the elements
necessary to help build a company,'' she said. ``You have to look
at the management team as a whole. If you have a CEO who has never
taken a company public, then you need to have a CFO who has.''
</P>
<P>
   Start-ups often find themselves in a chicken-and-egg quandary.
Without good management they cannot find financing, but without
financing, they cannot afford good executives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Lisa Church, who turned down the opportunity to
run a start-up to take a lower-level job at a more established
company.
</P>
<P>
   Like Otremba, Ms. Church found herself in New York City with a
unique resume that included helping to build a technology company
from the ground up. As vice president of marketing and new-business
development for Advent Software of San Francisco, she was
responsible for building the company's East Coast presence.
</P>
<P>
   She joined Advent, which specializes in portfolio management
software, in 1985 when the company had six employees and sales in
tens of thousands of dollars. When she left last year, the company
employed more than 300, and revenues were approaching $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that it was time to move on, Ms. Church took stock of
her opportunities while observing and, eventually, participating in
the evolution of Silicon Alley. She spoke seriously with several
Alley companies and came close to joining a New York software firm
as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But she turned down that opportunity to join Decalog, a
Boston-based, Israeli-backed software company, as vice president of
North American sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lure of the new-media business is that it's a new
technology and a new industry,'' Ms. Church said. ``It's fun and
exciting, but there are the financial realities of life. I've got a
family and a mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she said, she took the Decalog job because it
promised to be equally exciting, but more stable. ``The company's
just more established,'' she said, adding that she still hopes to
work with a start-up in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists face similar decisions in finding the right
company, said Ed Sim, senior vice president of the venture-capital
firm Dawntreader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight of the 10 companies we speak to need management,'' Sim
said. ``Part of the deal has to be we can either bring in a new CEO
or COO to complement the founder. We get resumes in every day, so
the tricky part is to identify the right person.''
</P>
<P>
   What his group can offer potential executives is ``the wealth
factor'' and a long-term relationship with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them that if the company doesn't work out for market
reasons, we'll drop them in another one of our companies,'' Sim
said. ``So then it's a portfolio risk versus a single company.''
</P>
<P>
   Among an executive's biggest fears when contemplating joining a
start-up, he said, is failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, a company might fail through no fault of the CEO,''
he said. ``We mitigate their fear by pointing out that every
company is developing an Internet strategy, so their experience
will be invaluable, that it's still early, and people like wounds
and scars.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some executives who emerged from start-ups are intrigued
but ultimately put off by culture shock when stepping into the
world of Silicon Alley start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Peter Kestenbaum recently resigned as director of
North American field marketing for Sun Microsystems after 13 years
with the company. Having joined Sun a year before the company went
public, he was already familiar with the grueling hours and
guerrilla tactics of start-up life. And having witnessed the birth
of Silicon Alley, he decided that the time was perfect to try some
start-up companies on for size.
</P>
<P>
   His first experience was less than perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was in shorts and sandals,'' he said. ``There was no
receptionist, so I just wandered to the back looking for the person
I was there to meet. But the clincher came when I went to use the
bathroom. There I was, standing in my $1,000 suit, and the urinals
were filthy. It was like a gas station. I thought, `I can't do
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kestenbaum has decided to look for a position with a more
established company.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest part of finding the right executive is
finding someone with a passion for the product, not just the money.
</P>
<P>
   Otremba agrees: ``When you join a start-up it's like joining a
family. All the stock options in the world don't amount to anything
if the business doesn't interest you. There has to be a passion.''

   RUSSIA-RDP (Moscow) _ With great fanfare, Kremlin aides and
Russian lawmakers announce a new accord that would ease the bitter
standoff over power-sharing between President Boris Yeltsin and the
Communist-dominated parliament. But within a few hours, the much
celebrated breakthrough, intended to pave the way for Viktor
Chernomyrdin's approval as prime minister, broke down, as leading
political leaders squabbled petulantly on national television. By
Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ASSESS (Moscow) _ News analysis: Judging by how the grand
and improbable alliance between Russia's westernized leadership and
its Communist critics exploded _ on television, spectacularly, in a
crossfire of accusations and threats _ one might think these people
hadn't a clue about what to do with their country. One would almost
be right. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-FLOOD (Xinzhen, China) _ On the plight of flood victims in
north China. In this far-north region known for early winters of
thick ice and bitter cold, the flood waters that now cover
thousands of villages will not recede for more than a month. So
huge numbers of refugees will face the winter's daily subzero
temperatures without a permanent home. By Elisabeth Rosenthal. With
map, sidebar CHINA-ARMY. 1,700 words.

   (Will move in ``w'' news file.)

<P>
   CLINTON-DEMS (Washington) _ In the two weeks since President
Clinton acknowledged his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the
tension and uncertainty within the Democratic Party have not
diminished but have intensified as its candidates gear up for the
general election campaign. By Richard L. Berke. 1,400 words.

   NORTHWEST-DAKOTA (Grand Forks, N.D.) _ Almost everything in
Grand Forks, North Dakota's third-largest city, depends in some way
on Northwest Airlines. Northwest delivers the mail here. It brings
medical supplies for the hospital, flowers for the florists, even
goldfish for the pet stores. No other passenger airline flies in or
out. For the rest of this spread-out, wide-open state, this single
airline has become an umbilical cord. By Pam Belluck. With
NORTHWEST-STRIKE.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-ASSESS (New York) _ News analysis: What the stock market
is trying to say about the economy. The sharp selloff in stocks has
led a growing number of people on Wall Street to wonder whether the
stock market, often a leading economic indicator, is forecasting a
recession in the United States. By Ed Wyatt. 1,400 words.

 &HT;    Finally, a royal TV treatment (Grade: A-)
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a brief interview midway through NBC's classy new tribute to
the late Princess of Wales, a waiter at a midscale London
restaurant recalls serving dinner to Diana and her young sons,
Princes William and Harry. After he recited the specials that
weren't on the menu, Harry asked, ``Did we get to hear about those
because we're special?''
</P>
<P>
   To which Harry's mum replied, ``You're going to get a special
smack in a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   You hear that little anecdote, so grounded and appealingly
resonant to every parent, and think: Where was that woman a year
ago in all the grief-drenched media coverage, the breathless
beatification and obsession with scandal and driver Henri Paul's
blood alcohol level and the paparazzi and Goodbye Already,
England's Rose?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the coverage a year ago was done on the fly, while this
special _ simply titled ``Diana'' (8 tonight on NBC) _ has been
lovingly crafted over several months. Actor-director Richard
Attenborough, Diana's long-time confidant and adviser, narrates and
produced the tribute with miniseries mogul Robert Halmi
(``Scarlett,'' ``Gulliver's Travels''). With its respectful
approach and avoidance of scandal, it could have been gushy and
gooey, but instead it's cleareyed and clearheaded.
</P>
<P>
   There are interviews with intimates who spoke out little or not
at all at the time of her death, including Diana's childhood nanny
and boarding school headmistress (who recalls teenage Diana's utter
lack of interest in fashion and preference for trousers and a
``tatty pullover'' or, as we'd say, old sweater).
</P>
<P>
   It's details like that, filtered through insiders' insights,
that help bring Diana to life as a real human being, not some cheap
icon fulfilling some mass need. (The big-name interviews with
Hillary Rodham Clinton and others don't add as much understanding
as Diana's acupuncturist and the like.) Add to that an abundance of
seldom seen photos and footage that somehow missed being in
everyone else's tribute package, and you have TV's one don't-miss
Diana anniversary special.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   XINZHEN, China _ Sparrows still weave through the sky and the
scent of flowers fills the air, but Sun Dianfeng and the other
flood refugees now living in the cramped dusty classrooms of this
village's elementary school are consumed with worry about the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Next to a rag-tag collection of beds and mattresses, 16 families
from the nearby village of Xinkaikou stacked the supplies they
moved here before the churning Songhua River dissolved their
fragile mud-brick homes: some quilts, a winter coat, a television
set, a pile of red peppers. In the school's dirt playground, Sun's
four milk cows competed for space with the other villagers' pigs,
chickens and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Since the flood evacuees arrived two weeks ago, local officials
have given them instant noodles and health workers have shown them
how to purify the now-contaminated water. But their looming problem
is one that no official can readily solve: In this far-north region
known for early winters of thick ice and bitter cold, the flood
waters that now cover thousands of villages will not recede for
more than a month. So huge numbers of refugees will face the
winter's daily subzero temperatures without a permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dare to think about how we'll cope with winter,'' said
Sun, a thin man shaking his head as if to rid himself of a bad
dream. ``I won't have time to rebuild my home before the frost.
And, anyway, I have no savings at all.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last Tuesday, Ma Shujie, vice governor of
Heilongjiang province, where this village is situated, said that as
many as half a million people might have to spend the winter in
100,000 heavy tents provided by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will insure that no one freezes to death,'' Ms. Ma said.
</P>
<P>
   The floods that have raged through central and northeast China
for the last month have destroyed billions of dollars of crops and
more than 8 million homes. Large dikes, maintained by the
government and reinforced by the Army, have kept urban areas out of
harm's way. But the smaller dikes that protect tiny villages like
Xinkaikou have been breached in many places, leaving millions of
mostly poor Chinese farmers with no crops to sell and nowhere to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Calamitous floods are a frequent occurrence in central China's
Yangtze basin, but rare here in China's far northeast, where
residents and local governments alike were unprepared for a flood
the likes of which had not been seen for over 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although more land has been flooded in the vast Yangtze basin,
Heilongjiang faces a huge and particularly difficult relief effort
because its typical mud-brick homes are easily destroyed by water
and the first frost is only a month away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are located in a frigid area, so we must give disaster
relief soon,'' Ms. Ma said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice governor said that her hope was that one third of the
province's 2 million flood refugees could move in with relatives
and another third would have a chance in the next two months to
rebuild, with government help.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the rest, we have no choice but to provide them with
tents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four weeks in Heilongjiang, 74,000 villages have
been hit by floodwaters, 820,000 homes have collapsed and 750,000
have been badly damaged, Ms. Ma said. As of last Tuesday, as many
as 500,000 people were living outdoors, mostly in remote areas, she
said. One quarter of the land in the province has had its crops
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials seem overwhelmed by the task facing them. In
Songbei township, which encompasses Xinkaikou village, one quarter
of the 20,000 residents have been left homeless by the floods and
2,500 acres, mostly fish farms and corn or soy bean fields, were
submerged when four small dikes broke two weeks ago. Like
Xinkaikou, many of the hardest-hit villages are on broad flood
plains that lie between the river's edge and large government-built
dikes several miles inland. Their protection consisted of makeshift
dikes they constructed and maintained themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its needs, Songbei, across the river from Harbin, the
provincial capital, has received only a bit more than $4,000 worth
of aid from the government relief agency, mostly in the form of
instant noodles and bottled water, said Chang Kexin, 29, the deputy
township head of Songbei. He serves as commander in chief of the
local flood control and resettlement effort.
</P>
<P>
   Chang said that the 4,000 people from Songbei who were evacuated
just before the river destroyed their homes are now all staying
with relatives or friends, or in school buildings. All have basic
shelter, food and medical care. But many will have to move once
school classes resume on Tuesday, and Chang said that relief
shipments of food have been slow in arriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city and provincial leaders are very concerned, but they
were not well prepared,'' Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   Chang said he expected that 300 villagers from Songbei would
spend the winter in tents, and health workers were preparing for
the time in October when the waters recede and remnants of villages
re-emerge, in conditions ripe for epidemic diseases like cholera
and plague. Sewage systems have washed out into the river and onto
the farmland, wells are contaminated and the wet conditions, he
said, will increase the concentration of rats.
</P>
<P>
   Timely evacuations meant that relatively few people died
nationwide _ 3,004, according to the latest government statistics.
But for the farmers in these counties, the past two weeks have been
a nightmare and the future remains unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   In Minzhu township, just downstream from Harbin, Yang Wei, 17,
and her cousin Wang Lishan, 18, listlessly fished on Thursday from
the top of some submerged farm buildings _ a pigsty and a storage
shed _ now islands in a muddy brown river. A makeshift bridge of
planks led from the dry elevated road, over the flood water, to the
rooftops. Old shoes, bottles and clothes dotted the muddy ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yang, wearing jeans and with cropped hair, pointed to the
spot across this vast expanse of water where only two weeks before
her family had grown vegetables. Between the tops of weeping
willows, she pointed out the partly collapsed house in Qianwukesong
village that had been her home.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago, the Qianwukesong village head told Ms. Yang
and her parents to leave. They moved their 20 piglets to a
relative's house on higher ground. But the family had not completed
the move when the fast-rising river forced its way up a nearby
tributary, flooding out 2,000 families in five villages. The water
moved in so swiftly that Ms. Yang's family only had time to grab
their television, some bedding and grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our village is normally far away from the Songhua,'' said Ms
Yang. ``We never expected this.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Yang, her parents and her cousin are living with the
relatives _ eight people in a two-room house. They say it is too
crowded to stay there but they will not be able to repair their
house before winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we'll do this year,'' said Ms. Yang. ``We
have only our summer clothes and no money. All our hope hangs on
the pigs. Lots of people have moved to relatives farther away and
they don't want to return here.''

 XINZHEN, China: return here.' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In all, 20,000 people in Minzhu were ordered to evacuate, said
Xing Zhi'an, a township Communist Party official. But he said it
was hard to keep track of those whose homes had been destroyed
since many had gone to relatives near and far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be one small village of 20 families,'' he
recalled. ``We can't find the village or the families now.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing atop the county's main dike along the Songhua, built of
packed earth in 1939 to withstand a ``50-year'' flood, he was proud
that it had not been breached.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there were many leaks,'' he said, ``And the risk is not
over yet. The dikes are weakened since the flood has lasted so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   All along the river, water was seeping though weak spots in
waterlogged government-built dikes that were never intended to
withstand such pressure, leaving roads flooded out and fields and
courtyards far behind the still-intact dikes looking like soupy
marshes.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing compared with the devastation on the flood plains.
At Xinkaikou, for example, the only protection had been a small
village dike at the river's edge. On Aug. 14, with the river
rising, local officials told the people that their dike could give
way and urged them to move.
</P>
<P>
   Meng Xiangmin immediately stored her refrigerator, her clothes,
and even the liquor and cigarettes for her small village store at a
relative's house and moved with her husband and daughter to the
elementary school, one of four in the area being used to shelter
flood victims. On Aug. 16, Sun Dianfeng packed up his cows, some
quilts and his most valuable possession _ a black-and-white TV set
_ and walked them a mile to the safe side of the big dike.
</P>
<P>
   That night, the smaller dikes yielded to the raging brown
waters, which collapsed the two thatch-roofed buildings that had
been home to Sun and his family and ruined the corn and soy beans
that he had been about to harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the river, whose width here has expanded from one mile
to four, lapped at the big state dike. The water has stopped
rising, but it will take more than a month for it to fall back to
safe levels. And the only traces of what had been the village of
Xinkaikou are three tin rooftops visible in the distant water.

 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although child prodigies may seem to be a
characteristic phenomenon of contemporary musical life, they are in
fact nothing new; they have simply received increasing attention
with the growth of worldwide communications media in recent
decades. And although great scrutiny has fallen on the
psychological perils of prodigyhood and the difficulties of
parlaying an early start into a mature career _ problems that have
potentially worsened because of that very media attention _ those
pitfalls are by no means inevitable or insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Joshua Bell, the superb American violinist, who
began performing widely in his teens but, despite the boyish
demeanor he retains at 30, has long since established himself as a
mature artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view, there really wasn't any kind of
transition to make,'' Bell said recently in his Manhattan
apartment. ``I never started to play 100 concerts a season until
much later, and I had worked my way up, each season playing a
little more. I didn't win an international competition that
suddenly, overnight, I had this kind of `career,' which can be
daunting for a lot of young people. I didn't feel pressure from my
parents, my teacher or anybody, and I always loved to play.''
</P>
<P>
   So with smooth sailing behind, there was promise of only the
same ahead. In a bit of fine-tuning some six years ago, Bell
replaced his first Stradivarius, an odd, problematic instrument,
with a better one, and everything seemed to be in place for an
untroubled mature career.
</P>
<P>
   But now Bell is caught up in a flurry of activity unusual for a
concert violinist, and some are sure to wonder whether a midlife
crisis has set in, at a prodigiously early age, to be sure. He
recently switched record companies from Decca/London (leaving by
his own choice, he said, unlike so many other artists the label has
dropped) to Sony Classical.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony connection, like many another Sony alliances these
days, was made through film, specifically ``The Red Violin,'' a new
movie directed by Francois Girard, which is to open the Venice Film
Festival on Thursday and the Toronto International Film Festival a
week later. For this eventful tale of a fictional violin carried
through three centuries and three continents, Girard recruited his
friend Bell as artistic consultant, violinist on the soundtrack and
even body double.
</P>
<P>
   Sony came to be involved, as did composer John Corigliano, whose
proven ability to compose effectively in the styles of past
centuries seemed tailor-made for the project. One thing that
emerged was a substantial work for violin and orchestra, ``Red
Violin Chaconne,'' which Bell has performed in concert and recorded
for Sony.
</P>
<P>
   The connection thus established, Sony swept Bell into another
project, a Gershwin program that it had been developing with the
composer and conductor John Williams. What, you may well ask, did
Gershwin write for violin? Nothing of real solo substance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here is ``Gershwin Fantasy,'' a Sony contribution to the
flood of new recordings celebrating the 100th anniversary of the
composer's birth next month, consisting of arrangements: a fantasy
on ``Porgy and Bess'' by Alexander Courage, a film composer, and
reworkings of Gershwin songs by William David Brohn and Jonathan
Tunick, Broadway composers, all with orchestra, and a modest
expansion of the Three Piano Preludes by violin virtuoso Jascha
Heifetz, a friend of Gershwin's. And Monday evening, Bell is to
perform the fantasy at Tanglewood, in Lenox, Mass., with the Boston
Pops led by Williams, who conducts the London Symphony and plays
piano on the recording.
</P>
<P>
   So has Bell, in classical-music lingo, gone commercial?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with record companies' wanting to make a
profit,'' he said. ``But that's not what this is about. My
so-called crossover projects are actually very interesting to me
musically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film was very exciting for me to do. I love the idea of
music for movies. It was definitely a departure, but it was also
musically very interesting to be involved with the composer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The composer evidently also found the relationship interesting.
``I came away with a terrific feeling about his commitment and his
integrity,'' said Corigliano, who is as thoroughly established in
the purely classical realm as in film scoring. In fact, he added,
although he had never been tempted to write a violin concerto and
had turned down offers to do so before working with Bell, he now
plans to add two or three movements to ``Red Violin Chaconne'' to
make a full concerto.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Gershwin project, Bell's explanation was just as
simple and straightforward: ``That was also very exciting for me.
I've always loved Gershwin, and I've always felt that there was
never enough Gershwin to play, for violinists.'' The affection
shows in the recording, and in Bell's hands, the violin seldom
sounds out of place in this earthy material: no mean feat.
</P>
<P>
   The project was largely a brainchild of Williams. ``I had
conducted Sarasate's `Carmen Fantasy' for violin and orchestra so
often with the Boston Pops,'' he said, ``and I always wished there
was a comparable piece based on an American opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, if any violinist is to lay claim to the
quintessentially American Gershwin, the Indiana-born Bell would
have to be a prime candidate. Prodigy or not, he has never quite
fitted the American stereotype of the violinist as being slightly
exotic in manner if not in origin. Didn't all those past masters
come from St. Petersburg or Odessa or somewhere in the Baltics?
Aren't all the rising stars of Asian descent? Can a Briton or an
American succeed today without the gimmicky weirdness of Nigel
Kennedy or Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg?
</P>
<P>
   Bell has been dogged by a counterstereotype of his own: the
all-American boy. And that is hard to get around it, even now that
he has become a full-fledged international artist of the first
rank. He lives unostentatiously with his girlfriend of six years a
few blocks south of the Empire State Building, which dominates the
view from their windows. He chose the area, like the earlier one he
lived in, farther downtown, partly to avoid the music crowd. He
plays tennis or golf whenever he can.
</P>
<P>
   His handlers try to spice up his image a bit, pointing out that
he likes to hop to Atlantic City, N.J., for bouts of gambling. And
genuine temperament is obvious in his performances. Yet he comes
across in conversation as basically just a really nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what needs revising is not so much the image of Bell as
the popular image of Indiana, tied as it is to auto racing and
basketball. As it happens, Bell could hardly have been born in a
more propitious spot in 1967 than Bloomington, the home of Indiana
University, with its vast and excellent school of music. Indeed,
those so inclined might see the hand of fate at work. Bell's
parents had just moved there, his father having accepted a position
in the university's psychology department.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents loved music, but they moved there not even knowing
that there was a music school,'' Bell said. ``They stumbled on it,
really. So I grew up in a nice environment, going to concerts,
going to a normal school, playing sports. As a kid, it was a good
place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But this kid also took up the violin at 5, and fate, if such it
was, had seen to that eventuality as well, when Josef Gingold
resigned as concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra in 1960 to
teach at Indiana University. Gingold, who was born in Brest-Litovsk
in 1909, when that Belarussian city was part of Russia, and died in
1995, was a brilliant, kindly and beloved teacher. He was also
active in nurturing a larger violin culture in Indiana, which
eventually included the prestigious International Violin
Competition of Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Bell had no need of that competition. In 1980, at 12, he started
studying with Gingold. At 14, he won the Seventeen Magazine/General
Motors Competition and made his orchestral debut with Riccardo Muti
and the Philadelphia Orchestra. While already involved in courses
at the university, he finished high school in three years. His
career simply took on a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gingold was not involved in careers at all,'' Bell said. ``In
fact, he had no idea of the ins and outs of what goes on today to
make a solo career. But he was just such an inspiration. The joy of
music and of the violin that he felt and exuded was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bell moved to New York nine years ago, he worked with
Gingold less often. ``He became like a grandfather to me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell speaks about himself and his career with reticence, in
short, halting sentences. On the subject of the violin, he spins
out long, flowing paragraphs as though they were melody itself.
</P>
<P>
   He plays a 1732 Stradivarius named the ``Tom Taylor,'' for a
19th-century owner in England. ``The later Strads, like this one,
have a touch of the lower, deeper Guarneri quality, which I like,''
he said, ``though they have to compromise a bit on some of the
sweet quality of the earlier ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell bought the instrument to replace his starter Strad, an
eccentrically shaped (rounded, guitarlike) and intractable
instrument, which was called various things, he said, among them
the ``Thalidomide.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever others may think of his activities of the moment, he
admits to no change in his priorities. His contract with Sony, he
said, also allows for more standard classical fare.
</P>
<P>
   He has already recorded a concerto written for him by Nicholas
Maw, which, like ``Red Violin Chaconne,'' awaits release. Next year
he is to record the concertos of Sibelius and Goldmark, and chamber
music projects are being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recording, frankly, is not my favorite thing to do, and I'm
never particularly happy with the results,'' Bell said. ``It's the
way records are done, it's the permanence, it's a lot of things.
You do it over and over again. I like just shooting for it in a
performance. I really love the performance atmosphere, the risk
taking.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the risks Bell takes these days is to perform his own
cadenzas, or solo flourishes, in concertos, though he tends to
prepare them thoroughly beforehand rather than simply improvise.
``I really enjoy writing, and someday my dream would be to write a
piece of music,'' he said. ``So far, I've just fooled around at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he is thinking of replacing the cadenza that
fits so integrally into Mendelssohn's revered E minor Concerto with
one of his own. The cadenza, he suggests, is not the strongest part
of the piece, which, on the whole, he reveres as much as the next
fiddler. He realizes, of course, that he might well be
``crucified,'' in his word, by the critics for such iconoclasm, as
he may be for his present ``commercial'' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``With reviews, it's just like with everything else in life,''
he said. ``As long as you're honest, you can't go wrong. That way
you never have to cover your tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Lincoln, another all-American boy, could hardly have
said it better.

DIANA: DOCUMENTARIES ONE YEAR AFTER HER DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Program listings are at end of review. Time and channels are

(ll) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On MTV, Diana, Princess of Wales, is seen as a pawn in a chess
game who makes some clever moves and attains the status of a queen.
On NBC's documentary ``Diana,'' Richard Attenborough all but
canonizes her. On the History Channel, she is called ``unbalanced''
and ``manipulative.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the Sunday edition of ``Today,'' Jodi Applegate sat
outside Kensington Palace, Diana's last home, and posed a hesitant
yet central question. ``Do you feel comfortable saying things you
couldn't say a year ago?'' she asked Tom Corby, a royal biographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not a saint, and she died very sadly, during an affair
with a playboy,'' Corby said of the princess, though only after
carefully noting that Diana was a wonderful mother and had made a
lasting contribution with her campaign against land mines.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, exactly a year after her death, the glut of Diana
specials and news reports continues. It began over the weekend and
includes at least eight programs, full-length documentaries and
segments of newsmagazines to be shown on Monday and Tuesday. And
though there is an unrelenting sameness to most of them, a few
realistic human variations are sneaking into the mawkish, one-note
tale of St. Diana. The first anniversary of her death has brought,
if not a backlash, at least a swing of the pendulum away from the
heavens toward a more earthly reading of her character.
</P>
<P>
   Her public life, of course, began as a fairy tale; every program
offers that stock reminder while replaying scenes of the royal
wedding. And in the end, hers will always be a genuinely
heartbreaking story. It is the middle of the tale that is
undergoing a subtle alteration.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the start and finish played out primarily on screen,
with Diana's wedding and funeral two of the world's most watched
television events, now the first-anniversary coverage becomes one
communal public biography created largely on television. This
televised fairy tale taps into important qualities of storytelling:
the comfort of familiar images; the need to keep stories alive by
altering them to suit the moment.
</P>
<P>
   This anniversary moment carries an aura of strained attention
rather than spontaneous interest, as the Diana story competes with
hotter reports about the Lewinsky scandal and international
terrorism. However muted the public remembrances (even in England),
the television coverage has been cranked up anyway. All three of
Monday's network morning news programs are scheduled to include
live reports from London.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC program ``Good Morning America'' sent its anchor, Lisa
McRee, there. MSNBC's flood of coverage, heavily promoted under the
rubric ``Diana: The First Anniversary,'' includes five different
Diana-theme hours of ``Time and Again,'' its series of clips from
the NBC News archive, and an elaborate Diana section Web site
(www.msnbc.com) that includes a video tour of the Diana museum on
her family estate.
</P>
<P>
   On every program, certain required images repeat themselves with
the consistency of ``Once upon a time ...'': Diana sitting alone in
front of the Taj Mahal; Diana dressed in the protective face mask
while working to ban land mines; the security tape of Diana and
Dodi Fayed, their backs to the camera, leaving the Ritz Hotel just
before the accident that killed them.
</P>
<P>
   With this overload of reports, themes heralded as new quickly
become commonplace: the impact of Diana's death on the the royal
family (a warmer Prince Charles); the future of her son Prince
William (rarely mentioned without being compared to Leonardo
DiCaprio); how Diana manipulated the press (a drastic change from
the cry that the paparazzi killed her, which immediately followed
the accident).
</P>
<P>
   Even reports about the continuing investigation into the car
crash has come down to: Who let the drunken Henri Paul drive? The
most elaborate report on the investigation is on Monday's ``48
Hours,'' which details the way Fayed's father, Mohammed, is now
blaming the bodyguards, and how they are blaming him.
</P>
<P>
   In this scramble for something new, the worst program may be the
most prominent and hyped, NBC's hagiographic ``Diana,'' with
Attenborough as on-screen narrator. This overblown tribute includes
interviews with Diana's former nanny, with the American who hired
Diana as her children's nanny, and with the former headmistress of
Diana's school. We learn that as a schoolgirl Diana won a tiny
trophy for ``helpfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   As we watch a Diana commemorative doll being painted by hand,
Attenborough says: ``There are as many ways of mourning our lost
princess as there are mourners to grieve. What is shoddy and
incongruous to one is appropriate and tasteful to another.'' His
saccharine tone glosses over the rank commercialism that so many
news reports have considered in recent days. A year after Diana's
death, such blind reverence seems unrealistic and dated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diana'' does offer the irresistible, unavoidable gift of
hindsight that now colors every bit of old film. Shown in a joint
television interview while they were engaged, Diana and Charles are
asked whether they are in love. ``Of course,'' the 19-year-old
Diana exclaims, sounding vaguely insulted at such a preposterous
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever `in love' means,'' Charles adds coolly, as bells and
whistles go off in every viewer's head.
</P>
<P>
   Because we know the outline of the Diana story so well, it seems
ready made for ``Biorhythm,'' the MTV biography series that has no
narrative voice, only images, film clips and music. Words on-screen
offer a skeletal narrative, which is all Diana really needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biorhythm'' begins with a quotation from the princess: ``My
life is a chess game. The chess theme is carried through in legends
on-screen, as Diana gains popularity and power even while losing
her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   This program has the wit and irreverence to show Camilla
Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles' longtime mistress, riding her horse
toward the screen while the theme from ``The Good, the Bad and the
Ugly'' plays in the background. Does anyone need to be reminded
that Diana nicknamed Mrs. Parker-Bowles ``the Rottweiler'' and
blamed her for the collapse of the royal marriage?
</P>
<P>
   Along with ``Biorhythm,'' ``As It Happened: When Diana Died,''
by the History Channel, is the best of the specials. It is the
smartest and most balanced, though at times it is downright cranky.
Produced in England, it offers a reminder that there has always
been a pro-Charles, anti-Diana contingent there, rarely heard from
in the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, says of the bad days
of the royal marriage, ``For Prince Charles it was a horror because
he's never had to deal with anyone as emotionally unbalanced as
Diana.''
</P>
<P>
   Where most specials go into raptures at Diana's public displays
of emotion, here historian David Cannadine says acidly, ``At the
end of the day you cannot hug your way through history.'' Of
course, as Corby did on ``Today,'' all are careful to note Diana's
good qualities. (Corby, also seen on the History Channel, was once
a press spokesman for Buckingham Palace, which Diana came to
consider enemy turf.)
</P>
<P>
   And in a strange but valuable paradox, this documentary takes a
critical view of last year's media frenzy, even while engaging in
this year's version. Ian Hislip, the editor of Private Eye
magazine, puts it bluntly. ``The media had pretty much thrown its
brains out the window,'' he says, and agreed to go along with the
``mass hysteria'' of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   At times this program goes too far the other way, failing to
grasp that the excesses of a year ago mirrored what happens in real
life: You don't speak ill of the dead when the coffin is before
your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as an antidote to simplistic sainthood, taking a more human
view of Diana's frailties as well as her strengths makes sense. It
was, after all, her ability to seem human as well as royal that
most people embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biorhythm'' ends with a slow-motion image of Diana, a sad
frown gradually turning to a sly, triumphant, enigmatic smile. An
image that, iconic and mysterious, says a great deal about this
moment, as Diana's legend continues to evolve.

FLOOD RELIEF OFFERS BELEAGUERED CHINESE ARMY SHOT AT REDEMPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-FLOODS)

<P>
   HARBIN, China _ It had been a bad year for the People's
Liberation Army. First, it faced accusations in the United States
that it was involved in a plot to direct contributions to the
Democratic Party in exchange for easier access to American
satellite technology. Then, in July, President Jiang Zemin
subjected the army to an unprecedented public scolding, charging it
with smuggling and ordering its generals to sell off their many
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the floods, offering the promise of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of thousands of soldiers as the backbone of the
nation's defense, this summer's record breaking floods have
provided the scandal-prone PLA with both a challenging battle _ and
a golden opportunity for image burnishing.
</P>
<P>
   At Harbin's river-front Stalin Park, 3,000 soldiers have spent
the last two weeks shoring up a mile-long stretch along the Songhua
River, including a crucial but tenuous section of dike that
protects this major industrial city in China's far northeast. A few
hundred feet away, citizens have been gathering at the park gates
to watch the dike-building effort, conducted in full public view
with an almost theatrical flare.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers sing songs about courage as they march across the
wide plaza to the river. Their green fatigues, bright orange life
jackets and brilliant red flags stand out against the white wall of
sandbags reinforcing the dike.
</P>
<P>
   Every night, all over China, television news shows feature
images of heroic soldiers _ evacuating children, hefting sandbags
onto a crumbling dike, forming a human chain chest-deep in the
water to hold a river at bay.
</P>
<P>
   This week many newspapers carried features on Guo Jiancheng, a
young officer who gave his life vest to a soldier who could not
swim, and was himself then swept away.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 278,000 soldiers fighting floods along the Yangtze
River in central China _ the biggest mobilization of military
personnel in that area since the Communists took power in 1949 _
and another 100,000 in the northeast, mostly along the Songhua and
Nen rivers here in Heilongjiang province. It is a return to the
grassroots for an organization that in recent years has seemed less
a military fighting force and more a big business.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers have been living in the park since Aug. 16, when
their first risky task was to build up the original dike, which was
on the verge of being submerged, with sandbags. They finished the
job in the nick of time: On Aug. 23 the river rose more than seven
feet above flood level, and since then the original dike has been
entirely under water.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers also built two back-up dikes several feet inland
from the original structure.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with water levels holding steady, the river's swift
murky waters frequently squeeze through. Col. Yu Zhongsheng said
his soldiers had plugged 50 to 70 leaks since they arrived. The
swollen river was exerting so much pressure on these man-made
walls, he said, that water inevitably seeped through.
</P>
<P>
   A large pump pulled water back into the river from a muddy pool
between the first and second dikes. Women in white coats used
plastic jugs to scoop up water that has strayed inside the dikes
and returned it to the river.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic effort has not been lost on the people of Harbin,
where life in the city has remained fairly normal throughout the
floods. After work, many stop by the barricade at the park's main
entrance to take in the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, we are very grateful to the soldiers because we know
how exhausted they must be by now,'' said Han Xue, a 24-year-old
shop assistant who had paused at the barricade with her girlfriend
during an evening stroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some thing have recently hurt the image of the PLA and this
has definitely improved it,'' said Sun Jian, a college student.
``In peacetime they have nothing to do. Now they've had a chance to
show their true colors.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Behind the barricade, Colonel Yu and his troops had settled in,
transforming the park into a mini-military camp with tents for
sleeping, eating, clinics, communications stations and even
entertainment. They expected to be camped here for another few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have praised the army on television and
military leaders have publicly sung the troops' praises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officers have played a commanding role and set examples for
their subordinates on the front line,'' said Gen. Ma Qukuan this
week in Beijing. ``They have displayed the revolutionary spirit of
fearing neither hardship nor death.''
</P>
<P>
   And, at least here in Harbin, which has been saved by the
soldiers, the desired message has been absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, this is a People's Army and this is their job,''
said Li Xin, a college student. ``On the other, it reminds us that
only a small part of the army is involved in corruption.''

   NEW YORK _ Once upon a time, when only a handful of visionaries
owned television sets, people relied on their radios, which
furnished them with entertainment like ``The Adventures of Sam
Spade'' and ``Murder at Midnight.'' A chance to return to those
days and their live sound effects, original music and inventive
commercials arises Tuesday night, when previews of ``W-WOW! Radio''
begin off-Broadway at the Martin R. Kaufman Theater, 534 W. 42nd
St.
</P>
<P>
   The show, a presentation of the Cranston and Spade Theater
Company, consists of two 1946 radio episodes: ``The Blood Money
Caper,'' from the ``Sam Spade'' series, and ``The Man Who Was
Death,'' from ``Murder at Midnight.'' Information: (212) 279-4200.

exhibition of paintings, drawings, sculptures, collages and prints
by Picasso. Beginning on Sunday and continuing through Jan. 4,
1999, ``Picasso: Masterworks From the Museum of Modern Art'' draws
on the holdings of that museum, which has one of the world's most
comprehensive Picasso collections. Nevertheless, only about 15 of
the more than 90 works in Los Angeles are regularly on view in New
York. Information: (323) 857-6000.

<P>
   Joshua Bell has done much to create a link between the violin
and the state of Indiana in the minds of music lovers. But no one
has done more along those lines than Bell's mentor at Indiana
University, Josef Gingold, who died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Among Gingold's many achievements, he was a founder of the
quadrennial International Violin Competition of Indianapolis, and
he served on the jury of its first four contests, from 1982 through
1994. The next competition runs from Sept. 11 to Sept. 27 and
includes 51 contestants from 19 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the cachet of a big name in its title, this event has
not achieved a profile in the popular imagination comparable to
that of, say, the Van Cliburn Competition. Yet in the violin world,
it holds a status comparable to the Cliburn's in the piano world,
and on average it has at least as good a track record in terms of
the quality and subsequent careers of its winners. They are Mihaela
Martin (1982), Kyoko Takezawa (1986), Pavel Berman (1990) and
Juliette Kang (1994).
</P>
<P>
   This year the winner will get a new gold medal dedicated to
Gingold and bearing his likeness, which was unveiled at a memorial
concert for him in 1995. ``The names of Josef Gingold and
Indianapolis will thus be linked together for all time,'' Thomas
Beczkiewicz, the competition's founding director, said then.

ALBRIGHT IN BOSNIA URGES MORE RECONCILIATION EFFORTS

<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright slept Sunday night in this city's refurbished Holiday Inn,
its shell-cratered walls now repaired, right beside what was once
Snipers' Alley. Her overnight stay was meant to be a dramatic
symbol, U.S. officials said, of the distance Bosnia has come since
Washington intervened to end the vicious war in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Albright's long day in Bosnia and neighboring
Croatia was devoted to pressing divided peoples _ Serbian, Croatian
and Muslim _ to make the still-artificial and bitterly divided
Bosnia closer to the multiethnic democracy envisioned in the Dayton
Accords.
</P>
<P>
   With international attention now concentrated on the fighting in
nearby Kosovo, U.S. officials are deeply concerned about Bosnia's
next big test _ full-scale elections in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 12 and 13, Bosnians will vote for the three joint
presidents of their country, as well as the presidents and
parliaments of its two constituent parts, the Bosnian Serb Republic
and the federation between the Croats and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The number of U.S. troops patrolling Bosnia has gone up from
6,900 to 8,500 with rotations carefully staggered for this election
season, Pentagon officials said, to prevent any new violence.
</P>
<P>
   Most important to U.S. officials will be the contests among the
Bosnian Serbs. Washington wants these elections to confirm the
political decline of hard-line Serbs who still support Radovan
Karadzic, who has been indicted on war-crimes charges, and to
ratify the pro-Dayton line of the woman who broke with Karadzic
after he anointed her as the Bosnian Serb president, Biljana
Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Plavsic is a committed Serbian nationalist, but in the last
18 months she has worked to get the benefits of compliance with
Dayton _ $100 million of U.S. aid this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   In the east Bosnian, Serb-held town of Bijeljina on Sunday,
Albright openly campaigned for Mrs. Plavsic and her ally, the
Bosnian Serb prime minister, Milorad Dodik, who face strong
opposition from Karadzic's party. U.S. officials also openly
support Zivko Radisic, a Plavsic ally running against Karadzic's
right-hand man, Momcilo Krajisnik, for the Serbian seat on the
three-man joint Bosnian presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, opening an electrical substation rebuilt with U.S. aid
money, pointed to it as a benefit of working with the West to carry
out the Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be very proud _ it's a great message to run on,''
Albright told Mrs. Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Plavsic praised the substation, but seemed less
enthusiastic about the Albright embrace in the elections,
observing, ``The other side, they blame us for too much
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   In her news conference there, and in a speech Sunday night to
mostly Croatian minorities who have returned home to Sarajevo after
fleeing the war, Albright was explicit about how U.S. aid would be
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian Serbs began to get aid only after Mrs. Plavsic and
her allies grudgingly embraced Dayton a year ago. They knew,
Albright said, ``that Dayton means jobs, reconstruction and a
normal life _ in other words, Dayton pays.''
</P>
<P>
   The elections, she said, offered a ``clear, consequential
choice'' between those who support Dayton and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   All Bosnians should vote to tell the world the future they want,
Albright said. But she added, ``Whatever the outcome of the vote,
we will provide assistance only to those communities that help
implement Dayton, by welcoming refugees, by making joint
institutions work, by upholding justice and the rule of law.''
</P>

<P>
   Albright acknowledged that the problems of Bosnia were rife,
lasting and disturbing. ``Bosnia's peace is not yet
self-sustaining,'' she said. ``A reversal of progress in Bosnia is
still possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright and her officials said that all three groups _ Serbian,
Croatian and Muslim _ were too slow to accept the return of
refugees, and that some Western countries, like Germany, were
pressing too hard for refugees to return before their villages were
willing or ready to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   The war uprooted more than half Bosnia's population, and nearly
1.7 million people still live elsewhere, unable or unwilling to
return home. About 450,000 have come back, but many to areas where
they are part of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian Serb republic has taken back only about 2,200
Muslims and Croats since the war ended. The Croatian authorities
have failed to protect returnees, and the Muslims have done
relatively little to allow refugees to return to what was once a
vibrantly multiethnic Sarajevo, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Serbs in particular have labored hard to protect
indicted war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Albright
clashed openly with President Franjo Tudjman over his reluctance to
accept the fact that the Bosnian Croats live in another country,
and over his repression of independent media at home.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman rejected her charges, saying that ``the main problem in
the cooperation between the United States and Croatia is the
problem of Bosnia,'' and that he had a constitutional obligation
``to take care of Croats outside the Republic of Croatia.''
</P>
<P>
   He also insisted that the state-controlled television, which
journalists meeting Albright described as being in the complete
control of his office, merely reflected the political balance of
the elected Parliament. The legislature is dominated by Tudjman's
party. Albright urged the journalists to work with the weak
Croatian opposition for democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   Croatian state television has intervened in the Bosnian
elections by attacking the incumbent Croatian member of the joint
Bosnian presidency, Kresimir Zubak. He has broken with the Bosnian
affiliate of Tudjman's party.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the situation in Kosovo, where President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia is using harsh measures to try to end a
civil war, Albright renewed a warning of possible retaliatory air
strikes by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will meet the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, on
Monday in Sarajevo to discuss NATO plans. She clearly intends to
remind Milosevic that the West is serious about demanding a halt to
the burning of villages and creation of refugees, especially with
winter approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy of watching the people expelled from their homes
and the various killings are not something the United States and
its European allies can tolerate much longer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NATO is divided about using force over Kosovo and
opposes the independence that most of Kosovo's majority ethnic
Albanians would prefer. Some of the alliance's member nations say
they want a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force
before NATO uses it. Thus Western threats of force so far have
proved hollow.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Serbia _ The six front windows of Rade Smigic's
hillside home in the village of Leucina open out on a bucolic
panorama that starts with pear trees in the yard and then broadens
to a valley with the family's fields and the homes of the ethnic
Albanians with whom they had shared a simple rural life for as long
as anyone can remember.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows who settled in the village in northern Kosovo's
mountains first: the large Smigic family, ethnic Serbs with eight
houses, or the ethnic Albanians who have about 90 households.
People throw up their hands at the question and say it was
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have lived together for a thousand years more, there
were no problems between Albanian and Serb in our village,'' said
Halim Dervishi, an elder of the local ethnic Albanians. ``They took
water from my well for their fields. We had the same life.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fondness with which the Smigic family is remembered,
its homes have been torched. What is left of Rade Smigic's home is
the framing around the front windows, piles of ashes and the family
photographs that someone has meticulously torn into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The only explanation from ethnic Albanian villagers is that the
people who did it came from somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   After a wave of kidnappings and terror, which foreign diplomats
and human rights workers say is part of the strategy of ethnic
Albanian rebels, the Smigics and nearly every ethnic Serbian family
that lived in areas controlled by the rebels have fled or
disappeared. More than 80 Serb civilians are missing and human
rights workers believe that they have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Serbs in urban areas speak of a spreading terror that is
driving many of the relatively tiny number of Serbs in the province
of Kosovo to leave. Government officials, facing an exodus that
undermines their right to rule a province where Serbs are an ever
smaller minority, acknowledge that they cannot stop the kidnappings
and are suppressing information about how many Serbs are fleeing to
avoid panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of people who slip away daily is, who knows _
dozens, more?'' said an official, who asked not to be identified
for fear of government retribution. ``We are not tracking them
because we don't want to have figures that are dangerous to have.
But I believe that by now the official estimate that Serbs make up
10 percent of Kosovo is probably wrong by about half.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that she had sent her children to live with relatives
in another part of Yugoslavia _ now consisting of Serbia and
Montenegro _ to be sure that they would not be kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   The police in Pristina say they have no clues to the whereabouts
of the missing. Two ethnic Albanians whom the police say they
arrested weeks ago claim to have been members of rebel squads that
killed some kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   One man, whose videotaped interrogation was made available to
The New York Times on Sunday, gave accounts that did not make sense
and which police officials say they cannot corroborate. The other
man said he took part in the killing of 10 people, but the police
have not located the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   By official estimates, there are about 200,000 Serbs living in
Kosovo. Serbs, many of them brought in from outside Kosovo, control
the government and security forces. Most ethnic Albanians, who make
up almost all the rest of the population, want to form an
independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dotted around the territory dominated by ethnic Albanian rebels
are dozens of villages and small towns where a few erbs lived until
the kidnappings started in April, weeks after a police crackdown on
rebel forces swelled ethnic Albanians' support for armed revolt.
According to witnesses, uniformed rebels began abducting Serbs on
rural roads or from isolated farms.
</P>
<P>
   That caused such alarm that most Serbs in rebel areas left,
human rights workers say. Some elderly Serbs stayed because they
thought that they would be safe. But gradually, even the elderly
have been abducted or fled, according to the rights workers, who
asked to remain anonymous out of fear of becoming targets for
abduction themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel attack on the city of Orahovac in mid-July was
accompanied by the abduction of more than 50 people, although 36
were subsequently released to the Red Cross. Two employees of a
Serbian radio station are thought to have been kidnapped when they
strayed into rebel territory two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Leucina, all but the four eldest members of the Smigic family
had fled by June. Dostana Smigic went back to persuade them to
leave, but was abducted near the village and is still missing. Then
men in rebel uniforms came for the four old people, according to
Kristiva Smigic, 70, who said she ran away just as the men arrived.
Her three other relatives have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Kristiva Smigic and most of the rest of the family have now
moved to Kragujevac, some 200 miles away in central Yugoslavia,
where Rade Smigic, 38, blames the rebels, not the ethnic Albanians
he grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my village, and I like my Albanian neighbors,'' he
said. ``When they worked their fields, they would call us to help
them, and when we worked our fields, they would help us. I wonder
why the armed Albanians, the terrorists, wanted to stop that
relationship.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo is about who will rule a place Serbs consider
their cultural heartland, but which they have been leaving for
decades. Serbs used to run from Kosovo to industrial cities like
Kragujevac for economic reasons. Ethnic Albanians flush with money
earned in Germany or Switzerland paid enormous sums in hard
currency for Serbian land or homes. And life in Kosovo got harder
for Serbs _ even after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
stripped Kosovo's Albanians of administrative autonomy in 1989,
imposing repressive police rule in the name of protecting Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Each Serbian departure diminished by a tiny bit the government's
claim, and the legend with which all Serbs were raised, that Kosovo
would always be Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   Today, few Serbs in Serbia proper would heed the call to rush to
defend Kosovo. Belgrade's independent newspapers have cited letters
from army conscripts describing their despair at being forced to
fight the Kosovo rebels, and some policemen have been dismissed for
refusing the tough and dangerous assignment in Kosovo. Parents have
protested in Belgrade about their sons' being conscripted for
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs who flee the province also face hardship. There are
few jobs anywhere in Yugoslavia's broken economy. And the Serbs
hide from the government in the cities where they are taking
shelter, for fear of being discovered and sent back, according to
Vesna Pajevic, deputy chairwoman of the city council of Kragujevac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, certainly they must hide,'' she said. ``If the regime, you
know, the government of Slobodan Milosevic, decides that too many
are leaving, it would round them up like cattle and send them back
to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   She and most of the city council in Kragujevac belong to
political parties that oppose Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men could also be conscripted for the army or the
police,'' she said. ``In Kragujevac, for instance, the soldiers
don't want to go to Kosovo to fight. For what? There are almost no
Serbs left there now.''

HISTORIC HOTELS HOLD SOME DEAR LEGENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you are shopping for a late-summer vacation hotel, these
suggestions are offered:
</P>
<P>
   The Luma Hotel looks out on the Gulf of Naples in the Italian
community of Amalfi. Among those who have enjoyed the view were
Richard Wagner, Mussolini, Otto Von Bismarck and Henrik Ibsen.
Wagner based one of his operas on this locale. Ibsen wrote ``A
Doll's House'' in the Luma, when he wasn't ringing room service for
another helping of pasta e fagioli.
</P>
<P>
   Even measured against these historic hotels, you have to be
impressed by the Menger Hotel in San Antonio, Texas. Teddy
Roosevelt, Babe Ruth, Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, Lillie
Langtry, Sarah Bernhardt, Oscar Wilde and O. Henry are among those
who signed the guest register.
</P>
<P>
   Before the days of air conditioning, windows of the Menger were
thrown wide in hopes of catching a breeze during the Texas summers.
Half an hour before lunch or dinner, all the waiters and busboys
would form a line at one end of the dining room. Then, waving fans,
they would advance slowly across the room, hoping to chase most of
the flies out the window. As they advanced, they would all sing or
hum the same chant. And the hungry guests were alerted that
suppertime was near.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Hotel at Estes Park in Colorado holds a lingering
fascination for two reasons. The original owner, who also created a
steam-powered automobile, drove one up the long, steep flight of
stairs into the hotel, to prove that the Stanley Steamer wouldn't
explode when the driver leaned on the throttle. ``The Shining'' was
filmed in the vacant, echoing corridors of the Stanley Hotel.
Author Stephen King was also inspired to write the book because of
the topiary ``animals'' that inhabit the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   We've stayed at the Algonquin in Manhattan and listened for the
literary ghosts of Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, Edna Ferber and
Alexander Woollcott.
</P>
<P>
   And what did historic people eat in historic hotels? We can only
assume they ate the blue-plate specials that were often variations
on roast pork or chicken casseroles. The chef at the Menger Hotel
might have served:
</P>
<P>
   Shoo-fly Pork
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 boneless pork tenderloins (about 4 pounds total)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup plus 2 tablespoons dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup plus 1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of powdered clove
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, put through press
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon powdered ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 jar (10 ounces) currant jelly
</P>
<P>
   Plunk pork tenders into oven dish or pan. Rub with dry mustard
and thyme. Moosh together one-half cup sherry, one-half cup soy
sauce, the cloves, garlic and ginger. Slosh this over the meat and
let everything vegetate for a few hours, turning the tenders
occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Pour off the marinade, but reserve. Return pork to the same pan
and shove into a 325-degree oven for an hour, basting occasionally
with the marinade.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the pork into medallions and serve with a sauce
constructed from jelly simmered in a pan for 2 minutes with 1
tablespoon of soy and 2 tablespoons of sherry.
</P>
<P>
   Serves six to eight. The guests in my hotel like these pork
tenders with oven-browned potatoes. Peel the spuds, cut each into
three or four sections, cover with olive oil, sprinkle with garlic
salt and pepper and roast in the same oven for about 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vittoria Hotel in Sorrento they might have served:
</P>
<P>
   Caruso Casserole
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces medium egg noodles
</P>
<P>
   2 whole chicken breasts (four pieces)
</P>
<P>
   2 chicken bouillon cubes
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup plus 2 tablespoons canola oil (or melted butter)
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup plus 2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1 can (1.5 cups) evaporated low-fat milk (or half and half)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sherry
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon celery salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon marjoram flakes
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon season salt (or Beau Monde seasoning)
</P>
<P>
   16-ounce jar or can sliced mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup slivered almonds, toasted
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fresh minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup shredded cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   Simmer (do not boil) the chicken breasts in water to cover just
until a slight bit of pink still shows when you make a slice
through the middle. If you boil the bejabbers out of the bird you
are going to have tough, stringy chicken and Enrico will not be
amused.
</P>
<P>
   Cool chicken, remove skin if it had any, and cut the meat into
bite-size pieces. Pour 2 cups of the chicken water into a measuring
jar and add the bouillon.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the noodles in boiling salted water, drain, rinse under hot
water and reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large, heavy saucepan. Stir in the flour and
when you have a smooth paste stir-cook another minute or so, then
gradually add the chicken broth and the milk or cream. Also add the
sherry, salt, celery salt, marjoram flakes and season salt.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens. Add to the
pot the cooked noodles, chicken, mushrooms, almonds and parsley.
Moosh everything around then dump into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish
that has been lightly oiled.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the dish with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.
Remove foil, scatter cheese over the top of the casserole and bake
another 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serves four operatic tenors or six sopranos.

PALESTINIAN FIRING SQUAD EXECUTES TWO BROTHERS IN THE GAZA STRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ A Palestinian firing squad carried out
the first executions under Palestinian self-rule Sunday, shooting
two brothers convicted of killing two brothers from another family
three days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though the killings were essentially a fight between two
families, the accused men were members of security organizations
and had apparently used their official weapons in the shootings.
That roused a storm of protest throughout the Gaza Strip among
Palestinians fed up with the members of security forces who strut
around with pistols and Kalashnikov assault rifles, often firing in
the air or using the weapons to threaten civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Both victims were popular leaders in the Fatah movement of
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and members of a huge
family, the al-Khalidis, further fanning the anger. Portraits of
the victims, memorializing them as ``faithful martyrs,'' were
posted on walls. Protests over the weekend paralyzed Deir al Balah
in central Gaza, home of the al-Khalidi brothers. Fatah called for
a strike throughout Gaza on Monday if the killers were not
executed.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, head of the Palestinian Authority, was faced with the
prospect of a serious rebellion in his own movement, a rebellion
against his security services and a potentially violent feud. He
ordered a swift military trial and approved the executions of the
brothers, Raed and Mohammed Abu-Sultan. A third brother, Faris, was
also sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life in
prison, apparently to maintain the balance of two executions for
two victims.
</P>
<P>
   Two Palestinian human-rights groups, B'Tselem and the
Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, issued news releases
that condemned the executions and called for the abolition of
capital punishment by the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Abu Zaid, a Fatah official from Deir-al-Balah who
witnessed the trial and executions, said 120 people gathered in the
police headquarters here to see the executions. They included
authority officials, elected members of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, Fatah officials and relatives of the slain brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The condemned men were taken out shackled, handcuffed and
blindfolded and were granted their last wish for a drink of water
before reciting final Muslim prayers, Abu Zaid said. Ten masked
uniformed police officers lined up, five for each condemned man,
and shot them at 2:45 p.m. Witnesses shouted, ``God is great!''
and, ``Long live justice!''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later in the Fatah headquarters in Deir-al-Balah, Abu Zaid
sat surrounded by friends and colleagues, all in a state of
excitement and shock over the chain of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian people are in general fed up with all these
people carrying guns,'' he said. ``We want to stop this. At
weddings, at wakes, they always pull out their guns and shoot in
the air, they threaten people. And now they shot our best Fatah
activists.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the summary trial and quick execution violated
legal norms and civil rights was beyond the concern of the men. To
them the Palestinian Authority had exercised justice that would
have otherwise been left in the hands of the al-Khalidi clan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will there be more executions?'' a middle-age man asked.
``This is up to President Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
   The others gave consenting nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want more executions,'' the man said. ``We want to
give the lesson to stop the killings and the easy use of arms.''
</P>
<P>
   As night fell relatives of the slain brothers, Mohammed, 30, and
Majdi, 32, gathered at a dusty lot to receive condolences. The
older brother of the slain men, Bassam al-Khalidi, said he had
issued strict instructions to his relatives, including 2,000 young
al-Khalidi men, that there was to be no more bloodshed.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A senior official of the United Nations office in Gaza and
fluent in English, al-Khalidi said he and his slain brothers were
not even part of the dispute and had gone only to talk with cousins
who said they had been threatened in a quarrel over a woman. After
the brothers had spent time with the cousins, he said, the Abu
Sultan brothers appeared and started firing on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that when I saw those men executed I was
satisfied,'' al-Khalidi said. ``I never dreamed in my life that I
would feel like this. When they ordered fire, I turned away and
cried for my brothers. I guess justice was done, although actually
there is no justice. My brothers were innocent, and they are
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 Palestinians have been sentenced to death by the
Palestinian Authority in the four years since it first took power
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Arafat has not allowed any other
executions to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   That the first executions he ordered were over the misuse of
firearms by his security forces is certain to be noted by the
Israeli government, which has repeatedly contended that the
Palestinian police have been issued personal weapons far in excess
of the 7,000 allowed for Gaza in the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
   There is also mounting anger among Palestinian civilians over
the proliferation of security forces, of which Arafat has created
at least 12.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Abu Sultan was a member of military intelligence. Raed
was a bodyguard to a general, and Faris was a political guidance
officer with a security force.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the police and security forces, however, have largely
served as a means of absorbing the huge numbers of unemployed young
men. Most members are not issued arms.

HOW PRESIDENTIAL SCANDALS HAVE INFLUENCED THE MARKET THROUGH
HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: As analysts roam far and wide in their efforts to
explain the stock market's recent swoon, Yale Hirsch's Smart Money
newsletter has distinguished itself by providing a historical
analysis of market reactions to presidential scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The only conclusion to be drawn from this research going back to
the Ulysses S. Grant administration is that major White House
scandals are always bad news for stock investors.
</P>
<P>
   The cause-and-effect relationship is debatable, of course, but
the month between the Dow Jones industrial average's record close
on July 17 and President Clinton's grand jury testimony was a rocky
experience for the stock market. Interestingly enough, the market
rallied on the day the president testified. The Dow turned in its
fourth-best gain of the year and followed that with another strong
showing the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, it has been a wild roller-coaster ride for
Wall Street. And if the past is prologue, stock market players
should brace for continued bouts of heavy weather until the latest
presidential problem is resolved. As Casey Stengel was wont to say,
you can look it up.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't come all wrapped up in a neat little package in some
cases, but the advent of scandal and stock market sinking spells
are in close enough proximity to challenge your belief in
coincidences.
</P>
<P>
   After the Reagan administration's Iran-Contra scandal broke in
late 1986, it was less than a year before the resounding crash that
climaxed a brief but brutal bear market that cost the Dow Jones
industrial average more than one-third of its value from August to
October of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   From the time of the Nixon-era Watergate scandal marked by the
``Saturday Night Massacre'' in October 1973, the Dow lost 40
percent during an ensuing 12-month bear debacle. The oil-embargo
crisis was obviously a contributing factor, but some historians
contend President Nixon's weakened position made OPEC hard-liners
more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   From Watergate you have to go back a half-century to find
another incidence with enough taint to be blamed as a stock market
depressant. The Teapot Dome scandal broke during the Calvin
Coolidge presidency but was a creature of the Warren G. Harding
administration. Its market consequences, though, were relatively
modest compared with the experiences of the Nixon and Reagan eras.
President Harding died in August 1923, but it wasn't until six
months later that revelations of Cabinet-level corruption in 1922
surfaced. Over the next three months, the market lost 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before that bit of unpleasantness you have to go back 50 more
years to the Grant regime, which saw four Cabinet officers involved
in scandal. The major market gauge back then was the Cowles index,
which declined more than 20 percent from February to November 1876.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the (independent counsel Kenneth) Starr report likely due
in September, the market is highly unlikely to turn bullish,''
Smart Money advised subscribers in its September issue. ``Let's
face it, if it weren't for the top 100 largest capitalization
companies, everyone would be acknowledging that we're in a bear
market. Shall we speak louder? BEAR MARKET!''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead toward next year, Hirsch said it would depend on
Asia and Russia finding miracle cures for their economic ailments
and President Clinton's ability to weather his storm. If all turns
out well, he said, the current experience will be limited to
correction status.
</P>
<P>
   If worse comes to worst, however, things could get ugly.

   WASHINGTON _ lode, struck gold.
</P>
<P>
   He called for Clinton's resignation. A few weeks later, he
compared the president to a ``sexual predator.'' Slowly, a kind of
political critical mass began to form and Ashcroft came to be in
demand.
</P>
<P>
   He pretty much has had the field to himself. Most of his
colleagues remain cautious, either because they think events should
just unfold without their help or because they are uncertain about
the public's mood on what course Clinton _ and Congress _ should
follow.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Ashcroft's outspokenness about Clinton _ from
the heart, but carefully choreographed for maximum effect _ has, so
far at least, given his presidential hopes momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You define your objectives and you've got to understand the
process,'' Merritt said. ``What are the levers and the leverage
points in the system? What are the things that tell me that this
guy could be a national player?
</P>
<P>
   ``Or, more important, what stuff will the press cover?''

 Write your resume in the right language  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Have you ever received an e-mail message that was a
bunch of symbols and scrambled letters? If so, you've seen what
could happen to your e-mailed resume if it's not formatted to be
read by your potential employer's system.
</P>
<P>
   When I get messages in MIME format, for example, I see screens
upon screens full of squares, capital A's and other characters. If
it were your resume, I couldn't read it.
</P>
<P>
   Some hirers say they continue to prefer resumes printed on
paper, but many organizations are accepting, if not expecting,
e-mailed resumes and job applications.
</P>
<P>
   If you use e-mail or send your resume as an attachment to an
e-mail, be sure what you send is computer-friendly to your intended
recipient. Call the organization's human resource office or, in a
smaller company, your potential boss, and ask what computer
language, word processor or both you should use.
</P>
<P>
   Many large companies use scanning technology to screen resumes.
If their scanner can't read your message, your application won't be
channeled to human eyes. And, even if human eyes are the first to
see your e-mail or attachment, it's worthless if it's unreadable.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of hiring executives this summer by OfficeTeam, a
staffing service, found that two-thirds had no preference as to
what resume format applicants used. (Their choices were mail, fax,
e-mail and ``in person.'')
</P>
<P>
   Some of those surveyed said they wanted a hard copy to follow an
e-mailed or faxed resume. Your choice of paper, layout and typeface
can boost your professional appearance, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Another point: When you use both e-mail and hard copy, you may
need two slightly different resumes. Italics, boldfaces,
underlining and other desktop publishing features that look great
on paper may not be read well in e-mail.

LEWINSKY SCANDAL IS PUBLIC RELATIONS WINDFALL FOR JOHN ASHCROFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Within minutes of President Clinton's remarkable
televised admission about his sexual affair, Sen. John Ashcroft was
on two television networks _ a third also wanted him _ ripping the
speech apart.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, as he barnstormed the country raising money for
his undeclared presidential campaign, he showed up again, this time
on three network political talk shows, to bash the president some
more.
</P>
<P>
   In the seesaw world of Washington politics, the bane of
Clinton's presidency has become a public relations bonanza for
Ashcroft's presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to give an honest point of view that I think needs
expression,'' Ashcroft said. ``To the extent that producers of
these shows feel like they want to have that view aired, they call
me. And if they call, I answer.''
</P>
<P>
   And he does, frequently.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Ashcroft's so telegenic. He often looks as if his
starched white collar is buttoned just a bit too tight. But the
White House sex scandal has turned the once-little-known Missouri
Republican into a card-carrying member of the capital's chattering
class.
</P>
<P>
   And he seems to be everywhere lately. Talk radio. The Sunday
morning television talk show circuit. The 24-hour cable networks.
He's joined a rotating cast of pundits, pollsters and
ex-prosecutors to weigh in as the conservative counterpoint on
Clinton's problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington parlance, Ashcroft, the minister's son who rides
motorcycles, writes and sings gospel music, and scathingly
criticizes the president, has the ``buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is `buzz?''' said Mark Merritt, communications director
for Lamar Alexander's 1996 presidential campaign. ``An almost
imperceptible momentum that culminates when a significant number of
people seem to `coincidentally' come to the same conclusion at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion in Ashcroft's case, Merritt said, is that ``he is
trying to establish that he is able to lead the conservative
movement, that he is willing publicly to take them where they want
to go and not straddle the fence on the key issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Carin Pratt, executive producer of CBS News' Sunday
morning show, ``Face the Nation,'' said: ``He says some pretty
strong things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not clear yet whether Ashcroft's sudden celebrity
reaches beyond Washington's political salons.
</P>
<P>
   He won a presidential straw poll in South Carolina in May. But
earlier this month he barely registered a blip in an Iowa survey of
whom likely Republican voters would support for their party's
presidential nomination. He was at the bottom, separated from the
leader, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, by a dozen other possible
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And that's after several trips to Iowa in the past year, along
with New Hampshire, South Carolina and other key presidential
primary states.
</P>
<P>
   But Terry Jeffrey, who managed Pat Buchanan's 1996 presidential
campaign, said early surveys should not be taken too seriously
because the presidential field still is unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the road, said Jeffrey, editor of /{Human Events,/}
a national conservative weekly, ``It will be easier to drive his
name recognition higher in Iowa and New Hampshire, where people are
conscious of the fact that we are heading into an election cycle,
than it will be in places where people are not as politically
aware.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Ashcroft's profile outside Washington remains low,
his pocketbook is brimming. A year's worth of traveling _ just
about every weekend and every congressional recess _ has swollen
his Spirit of America leadership PAC by more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   He will need about $20 million in his campaign account by Jan.
1, 2000, if he intends to become a serious candidate for the White
House, most knowledgeable observers agree. Ashcroft said last week
that he probably would decide by the end of the year whether he
will run.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he has spent the past 12 months trying to solidify
his natural base among the Republican Party's social conservative
wing. He was among the first prominent Republicans to call for
Clinton's resignation if the allegations about his romantic
involvement with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern,
proved to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Which they did, and now talk of resignation is treated as a
serious possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashcroft said it first, back in February. It got him a
flurry of attention in the media and a round of applause from the
conservative groups he has been wooing for presidential support. It
also triggered a steady climb to higher political visibility. And
for a generally unknown senator with dreams of the Oval Office, it
was the kind of publicity not easily bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewinsky provided the first major opportunity for John to step
up on the national stage on a consistent basis, and he took that
opportunity,'' said Keith Appell, an Ashcroft media adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after satisfying his socially conservative supporters, he
has made a move to broaden his appeal with a national economic
plan. And Iowa is where he is making his first move, with a
two-week blitz of feel-good television ads touting his ideas. The
centerpiece is a tax cut, through a restructuring of the tax code,
and a spending cut of more than $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft first broached the subject in January in a Washington
news conference. His plan then, more vague on some details, got
notices in the business and political media, and a few paragraphs
in newspapers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But less than two weeks later, Lewinsky's name became a
household word. And not long after that, Ashcroft, who has mined
the moral center of his party for support like a prospector in
search of the mother lode, struck gold. MORE

CLINTON'S PROBLEMS AFFECTING DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mo., Ore., Texas, Ala., N.C., S.C., Colo., Ariz.)  (See also CLINTON-STARR) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the two weeks since President Clinton
acknowledged his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the tension and
uncertainty within the Democratic Party have not diminished but
have in fact intensified as its candidates gear up for the general
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Clinton's disclosure is beginning to undermine the
drive to put forth a full-throated Democratic agenda, according to
Democratic candidates and strategists, who say there is a growing
consensus that the party has all but forfeited its prospect for
closing the 11-seat gap and winning back control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of these Democrats fear that the party could even
suffer a net loss of well over a dozen seats, making any climb back
into the majority a very arduous effort _ and one that could take
years.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Roxanne Qualls of Cincinnati, a Democrat in a tight
contest for the House, expressed frustration that as she tries to
discuss Social Security, health care and education, the press and
the Republicans want only to bring up Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not helpful to me and it's not helpful to the voters
because the issues aren't focused on,'' Ms. Qualls said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic candidates around the country are putting
distance between themselves and Clinton, leaving party leaders in
the uncomfortable position of backing candidates who do not want
their party's president to travel to their states or districts. In
this crucial start of the fall campaign season, when it is
especially important that the party display a united front,
Clinton's disclosure has exacerbated tensions between the president
and party stalwarts like Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House
minority leader, who last week forcefully condemned Clinton for
``reprehensible'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The president himself was described by several people who have
had conversations with him in recent days as dejected and worried
that the matter could take a toll on the outcome in November and
his influence on Capitol Hill. Clinton has talked with senior
Democratic lawmakers, aides said, seeking to reassure them about
the elections and his own ability to function.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's as much worried about November as he is
about his job _ it's all wrapped in together,'' said one adviser
who spoke several times to the president last week. ``You do not
want this to snowball and get out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defensive and unsettled posture of many Democrats,
party leaders put on a brave face in public. They insist that
fund-raising is holding steady, and they cling to polls showing
that Clinton's job approval ratings remained strong. Another sign
bringing them hope is that several contenders said the Lewinsky
matter had not come up in their races; even some Republicans said
it was too soon to tell whether it would emerge as a pivotal issue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats around the country said they were far more
dispirited than when the Lewinsky matter surfaced in late January,
when many in the party rallied around Clinton and went on the
attack against Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The swirl of publicity over Ms. Lewinsky has left the
administration on the defensive, with White House officials
insisting that no Democratic candidates had asked Clinton to stay
out of their states.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said that state parties in Ohio, New York and
Rhode Island, expecting that some candidates might cancel visits by
Clinton, called the White House last week and said that they would
like the president to be the featured guest at their fund-raising
events.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Democrats said they had never before experienced a
time when many of their party's candidates were scolding the
president, and openly weighing whether they would want him to
campaign for them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would want Clinton to campaign on his behalf,
David Wu, a lawyer locked in a House race in Portland, Ore.,
hesitated and said: ``It's clearly a tough one. The future's really
hard to see, and I think it will turn very closely on what's in a
Starr report.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed further about a trip by Clinton, Wu said, ``I'd ask him,
`Who's paying the transportation costs?''' He would agree to a
visit, he said, if Clinton emphasized only issues and ``if we could
cut enough of a deal'' so Wu's campaign would not have to pay too
much.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Rep. Charles Stenholm, a conservative Democrat, late
last week began broadcasting a television commercial that
criticizes Clinton. After a narrator cites Clinton's veto of
defense projects for the district, Stenholm says: ``I've always
believed in doing what is right for the people of the 17th
District, regardless of what the president says, or what the
leaders of my own party are saying. And that will never change.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing, the narrator says: ``Charlie Stenholm. Our values.
Our Congressman.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most Republican candidates until now let Clinton's
troubles speak for themselves, there are signs of an increasing
willingness to take on the president directly.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gil Aust, a Republican running for the House in
Alabama, began broadcasting a commercial urging Clinton to resign.
As slow motion excerpts from Clinton's address to the nation about
Ms. Lewinsky appear on the screen, the announcer intones: ``The
headlines tell the story. President Clinton lying to the American
people.'' The commercial does not even mention Aust's opponent,
Rep. Robert Cramer.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Page, a Republican seeking a House seat in North Carolina,
began running a commercial about the Lewinsky matter several days
ago. And the South Carolina Republican Party has created a series
of radio advertisements about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said he understood why some
candidates did not want to be seen with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates just aren't comfortable appearing with the
president at this point,'' Frost said. ``It's natural that
politicians are always nervous about what's going to happen in an
election.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to put the best face on the Democrats' predicament,
Steve Grossman, the party's national chairman, said: ``The events
of the last couple weeks clearly have the propensity to shift our
focus away from the grassroots organization and voter turnout
programs that we would like to be doing every day, to another set
of issues.'' But Grossman said he did not see ``any tangible
evidence in all the fund-raising results I've seen'' that the
Lewinsky matter was dampening contributions to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Alan Secrest, a Democratic pollster, said he was seeing
evidence of ``an ebbing in Clinton's personal appeal,'' especially
among women under 50, a crucial voting bloc. ``Many Democrats have
reached the point of exhaustion in defending the president,''
Secrest said. ``Very few of my clients are rushing to the ramparts
to defend him.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of the Democratic Party's most successful fund-raisers
said that he feared a drop in contributions. The donors who were
coming forward now, he said, were the ones the party could always
rely upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're not going to get now is the fence sitters who
would be very active if they thought we had a chance of winning the
House back,'' the fund-raiser said. ``In the fall campaign you want
a crusade going. But we've lost a tremendous amount of momentum _
and incentive for people to open up their wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky matter has also stirred tensions among Democratic
leaders. Clinton, for one, was described by associates as furious
at Gephardt's comments to reporters early last week that he did not
rule out the possibility that the president could be impeached.
After speaking with Democrats who were concerned about the
sharpness of his remarks, Gephardt toned down his comments.
</P>
<P>
   Though some Democrats argued that Gephardt's remarks were useful
in pre-empting criticism that party leaders were motivated only by
partisan calculations, others said they were concerned that his
comments allowed Democratic candidates to distance themselves from
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the Democratic
Party, said candidates who do not want to be associated with
Clinton were ``playing the margins,'' meaning they fear it could
cost them a few critical percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But several Democratic candidates said they hoped that voters
could separate Clinton's troubles from their own campaigns. Steve
Owens, a lawyer who is seeking a House seat from Arizona, said he
called the White House last week and asked for the president to
visit his district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be honored to have him in,'' he said. ``And I'd be right
there with him.''

   WASHINGTON _ Administration officials warily monitored the
maneuvering to form a new government in Moscow Sunday, disturbed by
possible signs of backsliding on Russia's commitment to tough
economic reform but reluctant to render a verdict until new
personnel and policies are in place.
</P>
<P>
   Officials avoided definitive comment in advance of President
Clinton's arrival in Moscow on Tuesday, for fear of appearing to
take sides in what promises to be a delicate negotiation among
various factions in Moscow over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   The official administration line on Sunday was that the Russians
themselves will have to sort out the approach they take to finding
an exit from the economic and political morass Moscow now faces.
Until then, the Clinton administration will make clear its own
policy preferences but will not attempt to broker a truce among
competing Russian power centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see how it all plays out,'' Lawrence Summers,
the deputy treasury secretary said on the CBS news program ``Face
the Nation.'' ``What is crucial is not words at this point but
actions the Russians are able to take at what is a critical
juncture for them and their management of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that Washington is discounting much of what it is
hearing from Moscow as political posturing in the midst of an
effort to create a governing coalition. Engaged in the competition
for power are those loyal to President Boris Yeltsin, the business
oligarchy, the resurgent Communists, regional power brokers and
advocates of broad economic reform measures endorsed by the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will give our opinion of the course they choose, but we are
not going to do it before we have a government in place and have a
chance to sort out what the real policies are,'' the official said.
He said that the United States does not know yet whether Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the acting prime minister, will be confirmed by the
Russian Parliament by the time Clinton arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Until Chernomyrdin is confirmed, the official added, the
administration would not comment except to signal what policies it
would find objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Undesirable actions would include efforts to bail out failing
banks, granting additional credits to state-run enterprises,
flooding the market with newly printed rubles and ``other actions
that could clearly have inflationary effects,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration would welcome, he said, programs that allow
market forces to work, even if the short-term impact is painful,
and new measures to insure an economy that functions under the rule
of law rather than Kremlin fiat.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to see what the terms are, what kind of
economic plan Russia actually carries through on the ground,'' said
Summers, who will travel to Moscow for the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior administration official, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that he hoped Clinton's arrival this
week would put pressure on Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin to stick to the
difficult path of reform rather than accept compromises as the
price of remaining in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of back and forth,'' the official
said. ``But what we really don't know is where Chernomyrdin's heart
is. It's really do or die now. Does he understand he can't go back
to the old ways?''
</P>
<P>
   But until the direction Moscow takes becomes clear, he added,
Clinton and his senior advisers are going to ``try to avoid getting
sucked into everyday speculation'' about who is in power and what
they might do.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who is leaving his post as the
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, described the compromise
deal being negotiated in Moscow as a ``very favorable
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Richardson said the
United States was prepared to to continue and even expand its
financial aid to Russia, if the government proceeds with reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to do more,'' Richardson said. ``As long as
there's economic reform, we're going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who returned to Washington Sunday from his vacation on
Martha's Vineyard, participated in several conference calls with
senior staff aides and his national security team, White House
officials said.

AIRLINE STRIKE TRIES THE PATIENCE OF NORTH DAKOTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NORTHWEST-STRIKE, moving in `f' category) 
(lb) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   GRAND FORKS, N.D. _ People here figure they can handle almost
anything.
</P>
<P>
   After the thundering flood waters that last year forced the
evacuation of the entire city _ all 50,000 people _ what could faze
them? But the pilots' strike that has grounded Northwest Airlines
since Saturday morning is already trying people's patience.
</P>
<P>
   It marooned Joe Larson in Minneapolis and made him miss his
grand-nephew's wedding. It is causing Ron Boonstra to bow out of
his fertilizer company's annual training session in Peoria, Ill. It
may keep out-of-state students from the first week of classes at
the University of North Dakota. And it threatens to put the kibosh
on one of Grand Forks' biggest events this year: the national
women's amateur slow-pitch softball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything in Grand Forks, North Dakota's third-largest
city, depends in some way on Northwest Airlines. Northwest delivers
the mail here. It brings medical supplies for the hospital, flowers
for the florists, even goldfish for the pet stores. No other
passenger airline flies in or out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll affect just about every one of us,'' said the Grand
Forks mayor, Pat Owens. ``People don't usually come here unless
they fly. Now we're land-locked.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of this spread-out, wide-open state, where the
prairie rolls on forever and the rural roads are like miles of
string threading tiny towns like beads, this single airline has
become an umbilical cord. The only other commercial carrier that
flies in and out is United Airlines, and it runs only a smattering
of commuter flights, no more than 30 seats, from three cities _
Fargo, Bismarck and Minot.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, afraid of a Northwest strike, Gary Ness, the
executive director of the state Aeronautics Commission, sent a
letter to 20 airlines, begging them to route a few planes North
Dakota's way. He got no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ness predicts that the economic cost of the strike will be
about $365,000 a day statewide _ and that's only counting the cost
to travel-related industries like travel agents, hotels and
car-rental companies. No negotiations were planned Sunday between
the pilots and Northwest's officials.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't measure the cost, for example, to the North American
Bison Cooperative, which each day flies about $10,000 worth of
buffalo on Northwest to New York and Boston, where butchers turn it
into steaks and buffalo burgers. ``I imagine we'll have to give up
on most of it,'' said Dennis Sexhus, the chief executive officer,
who says the Northwest shipments represent about 5 percent of his
bison business.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't account for the frustration of people like Bill
Antongiovanni, a salesman of nuts, bolts and screws, who was
supposed to be taking his 4-year-old granddaughter, Taylor, to stay
with him in Bakersfield, Calif., while her parents in Fargo
prepared for the birth of a new baby. After hours on the phone,
Antongiovanni, 56, booked the only flight he could, out of
Billings, Mont., a 10-hour drive away.
</P>
<P>
   But for North Dakota, the potential cost is almost more painful
than the actual loss. It's not only the North Dakotans who want to
fly elsewhere, but can't. It's the people who won't come.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people come to North Dakota to begin with. With 2.9
million visitors a year, it has the fewest of any state, said Bob
Martinson, the director of the North Dakota Tourism Department. The
outlet malls in Freeport, Maine, home of L.L. Bean, get more
visitor traffic in a year than all of North Dakota does.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those national weather guys can destroy us in a
30-second piece _ `Snowstorm in North Dakota' _ as though we're the
only state that has winter,'' Martinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has been trying to promote tourism any way it can,
aware that drivers don't tend to stumble upon North Dakota on their
way to somewhere else. It has jumped on the Lewis-and-Clark
bicentennial bandwagon, hoping to lure visitors to see where the
explorers spent a long winter in 1804-1805. It is playing up its
Wild West image and American Indian heritage, especially in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the strike may have already dealt a setback to the state. A
group of European travel writers are supposed to fly in on
Wednesday for a state tour. ``If we miss that window, we lose the
whole winter publication time,'' Martinson said. ``They won't be
coming back until the spring.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some towns try to draw visitors (and free labor) to
potato-picking festivals. And then there is Norwegian tourism in a
state where every third resident has a Norwegian ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   There is a huge Norwegian festival in Minot in October. And
Grand Forks has been wooing groups of Norwegians to visit Red River
Valley farms where ``they are just amazed at the 6 feet of black
soil,'' said Char Brekke, the manager of Brekke Tours in Grand
Forks. ``They enjoy going to the cemetery and seeing all these
Norwegian names on the tombstones,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Forks is also capitalizing on a wave of flood tourism.
City tourism staff hop aboard tour buses and show people where the
water was.
</P>
<P>
   There is a flood exhibit at the museum, and a new restaurant,
the Red River Cafe, has built a brick wall inside its dining room
that is the height of the water during the flood. The idea, said
James Tsismanakis, the executive director of the Convention and
Visitors Bureau, is that ``you're sitting there and in a sense
you're under water.''
</P>
<P>
   Without people flying into Grand Forks, these and other economic
generators could languish. Steve Johnson, the executive director of
the Grand Forks Regional Airport Authority, figures that without
Northwest's four jets and three small flights run by its commuter
arm, Mesaba, each day, the city will lose at least $50,000 a month
in airport fees. And hotels like the C'mon Inn are already getting
a few cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond tourism, people here worry that the strike will bring
the loss of a kind of cross-country pollination _ people coming to
the state and North Dakotans venturing out for all sorts of
global-village reasons. The mail can be trucked in. Businesses can
send and receive items by Federal Express. But when the nearest
jets fly into Winnipeg, Manitoba (a two-and-a-half-hour drive) or
Minneapolis (five hours), that puts a damper on things.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest is ``not just the economic lifeline _ it's the social
and cultural lifeline also,'' said Hal Gershman, who runs a chain
of liquor stores called Happy Harry's Bottle Shops, and is active
in civics and culture in Grand Forks.
</P>
<P>
   Gershman, whose daughter, a student at New York University,
caught the last plane east on Thursday night, is supposed to fly
Northwest to New York himself next week for a meeting of the Wine
and Spirits Guild of America.
</P>
<P>
   Gershman is concerned that the strike may thwart several
upcoming Grand Forks cultural events: an exhibit by a New York
painter, a reading of a play scheduled for Broadway, and the debut
of a children's show traveling from Washington. Already, he said,
the strike has canceled a visit by a philanthropic foundation that
was expected to give generously to the city's science center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing can set a project back for a long time,''
Gershman said. ``There's probably 80 of these things in town right
now, important business meetings, churches bringing in speakers,
lawyers coming in to look at a merger. And how many people have put
projects on hold?''
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger fear is that once the strike is over, Northwest
will be forced to cut back some of its routes and will sacrifice _
what else? _ North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that we continue to be served by Northwest, a
national airline, and not be downgraded to a regional airline,''
Gershman said. ``You fall off the screen on certain things when you
do not have a national airline serving your city. I think that's a
major economic, social and cultural threat to all of North Dakota.
Are you a destination, or are you not?''

DESPITE `DIANA FATIGUE,' BRITONS HONOR THE PRINCESS

   ALTHORP, England _ Glenice and Gordon Phillips were not able to
get entrance tickets but drove 30 miles all the same Sunday to this
verdant, walled estate just to place a small bouquet of white
flowers outside the wrought iron gates at the family seat of Diana,
Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still miss her,'' said Phillips, the 49-year-old owner of a
car repair shop, as he arrived at Althorp House, for more than four
centuries the home of the Spencer family, to which Diana was born.
Her body was returned here after the car crash in Paris that killed
her one year ago Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a year in which the British monarchy _ shaken to its
roots by the public outpouring of grief for Diana _ has sought with
characteristic caution to redefine itself. But it has also been a
year in which Diana's memory has begun to shed some of the saintly
adulation inspired by her death.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for the anniversary seemed muted, reflecting what
some newspapers have called ``Diana fatigue'' even as they, like
most television stations, have filled columns and air time with
memorials to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it shocked everybody that so many people joined in
the mourning, but we are typically British: We pull back,''
Phillips said, as other Diana admirers who had been able to
purchase the scarce $16 entrance tickets to Althorp House made
their way along a long driveway toward an artificial lake called
the Oval, where she lies buried on a leafy island. ``And that's our
interest today _ to show that we have not forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Fox, 47, who had driven five hours from Dorset on the
south coast to Althorp, 70 miles north of London, agreed that many
Britons had retreated some way from last year's readiness ``to be
emotional, to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our natural instinct is to be reserved, but we need people to
care,'' she said. ``We are not out there giving and loving
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring the nation's debate, though, Ronald Stanton, a
52-year-old taxi-driver from nearby Northampton awaiting his
passenger, an Italian journalist, said enough is enough.``People
should let it go now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillipses and others were among thousands who sought Sunday
to commemorate Diana's memory as the formal anniversary of her
death approached.
</P>
<P>
   At Kensington Palace, Diana's one-time London home, hundreds of
people brought flowers, evoking the enormous floral tributes of one
year ago, though foreign tourists appeared to outnumber the
Britons.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, moreover, was the last day that Althorp House, with its
museum to Diana and memorabilia, was open to public visits this
year. The $16 entrance fee has drawn accusations that Earl Spencer,
Diana's brother and the jealous custodian of her memory, is
profiting from her tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But estate officials said they were expecting a full 2,500
visitors _ the maximum permitted each day since the estate and
exhibit opened their doors to paying visitors on July 1, which
would have been Diana's 37th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   At Westminster Abbey, where Elton John sang and Earl Spencer
inveighed against the press and the monarchy at Diana's funeral
service on Sept. 6, 1997, only the briefest of prayers mentioned
Diana by name Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth and the visiting prime minister, Tony Blair,
were among dignitaries at Sunday prayers at Crathie Church, near
Balmoral Castle _ the royal retreat in Scotland where Queen
Elizabeth often vacations and where, one year ago, she remained
secluded following Diana's death as Britons clamored for her to
mourn with them. In an echo of last year's royal reticence, the
anniversary was mentioned only obliquely at Crathie Church Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear our prayers for those grieving the loss of a loved one,
in circumstances known to the world but only experienced by a
few,'' said the Rev. Robert Sloan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of that few, though, virtually every intimate player in the
Diana saga _ part national tragedy, part soap opera _ has been
reforged in the year since her death.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Spencer, the hurt and angry crusader whose voice from
Westminster captured a nation's rage and hurt, soon showed a
different side. He became embroiled in a messy divorce in South
Africa that cast him in a far less heroic light.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has assiduously tried to
reshape his image. Once cast in villain's garb as Diana's distant,
faithless former husband, he has sought to show himself as the
caring single parent of the royal princes _ William, 16, and Harry,
13. They accompanied him to the church service Sunday near Balmoral
Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of William and Harry that people feel for him,''
said Lesley Alabaster, 36, a police officer who came with her
family to Althorp Sunday. ``He has been seen to be more
accessible,'' she added, reflecting on Prince Charles' improved
popularity ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Charles has even ventured to break a taboo that _ at the
time of Diana's death _ seemed likely to be permanent. He has
introduced his elder son to his longtime companion, Camilla
Parker-Bowles, who has yet, however, to achieve broad public
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camilla, Princess of Wales _ Never,'' said one message left
with the flowers outside Kensington Palace Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The queen has, in a more limited way, displayed a slight
loosening of her dour and distant manner in response to the clamor
for a caring royal visage following the death of ``the people's
princess,'' as Blair dubbed Diana after her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The queen has got a long way to go,'' Mrs. Alabaster said.
``She's not the people's queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Glenice Phillips put it, Britain's royal family ``has
just got to get its act together if it wants the backing of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In apparent recognition of such sentiments, Buckingham Palace
recently appointed a highly paid communications director, Simon
Lewis, to mold the royal image. Ben Pimlott, a royal biographer,
wrote in Sunday's Sunday Times newspaper that, arguably, ``the
Windsors have got it right for the moment. However, if the monarchy
wishes to stay in business, not for years, but for generations, it
will have to think beyond the appointment of a communications
director.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Diana's own image _ and what seemed like a cult of
admiration reinforced by over 7,000 web sites chronicling
conspiracy theories about her death _ has begun to emerge from
near-saintliness, at least in the eyes of some religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Coggan, a former archbishop of Canterbury, stirred protest
this month by calling Diana a ``false goddess'' with ``pretty loose
morals.''
</P>
<P>
   At her family's ancestral home, though, there was still the
sense of loss among those who had come to remember, many of them
people who had booked tickets as soon as they were first advertised
last January because they wanted to be here on this particular day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just a wonderful person like we would all like to
be,'' said Barbara Gill, 51, who described herself as a housewife
from Northampton.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the hand-written cards with the lilies and daisies
and carnations outside Althorp's walls offered its own explanation
of Diana's early death. ``God must have run out of angels,'' it
said.

 &HT;    Despite setbacks, 49ers look to contend for another championship
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ The free agent defensive end the San
Francisco 49ers lured here with a $4 million-a-year contract still
walks with a pronounced limp and his offseason knee surgery will
keep him sidelined until mid-October. The offensive tackle who cost
them a second-round pick in next year's draft was injured, lost his
starting job, suffered an emotional meltdown, went AWOL and is
suspended for three weeks. The running attack is one sprained ankle
away from disaster, the kicking game is a huge question mark and
Jerry Rice's first appearance won't come until Sunday's
regular-season opener.
</P>
<P>
   So pencil in the Niners to win their 13th NFC West title in 16
years and to extend their league record for consecutive seasons
with 10 or more victories to 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite whatever has gone wrong, we've got things going in the
right direction,'' said linebacker Lee Woodall just before San
Francisco broke camp. ''One of the things we've become pretty good
at around here is dealing with adversity. Plus we still have a lot
of talent . . . enough to win the division and contend for the
Super Bowl again.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodall figures to be half-right, at least, in the prediction
department.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of quality in the NFC West, where the 49ers had
the only winning record in '97 and captured the title by a whopping
six games, San Francisco could again wrap up the crown before
December and should win 10-12 games simply by showing up every week
at the appointed time and place.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is rated as the NFL's second-easiest and the Niners
face an NFL-low four playoff clubs from last season. Just six
opponents were plus-.500 in '97 and while the 49ers have slid
closer to the pack in the NFC West, none of their division
opponents are prepared yet to seriously challenge their
superiority. It's hard to imagine, even some of the team's veterans
conceded, the Niners going worse than 6-2 in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Such a cakewalk, however, hardly assures that coach Steve
Mariucci's team will make a strong showing in the playoffs. San
Francisco hasn't been to the Super Bowl since the '94 season and,
because of a glaring lack of depth, that streak likely will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Offseason additions like middle linebacker Winfred Tubbs,
cornerback Antonio Langham and tight end Irv Smith stopped the
graying of the San Francisco roster but still might not be enough
to keep the first hint of silver from Mariucci's dark hair.
</P>
<P>
   ''The drop-off (from the starters) is fairly precipitous,''
Mariucci allowed in preseason. ''Our second-line people haven't
played well. Like a lot of teams, we're going to hold our breath at
some positions.''
</P>
<P>
   A dire lack of able-bodied veterans on his offensive and
defensive lines actually could send Mariucci into hyperventilation.
Former Green Bay defensive end Gabe Wilkins and onetime Denver
offensive tackle Jamie Brown were high-profile acquisitions who
have yet to set foot on the field. There is no proven backup to
tailback Garrison Hearst and tackles Derrick Deese and Dave Fiore
are dubious.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers will rely on a defense that annually rates among the
NFL's premier run-stop units, an offense that will feature more
three-wide receiver alignments and the brand of confidence that
comes from having ruled the NFC West roost for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until somebody in the division can prove it on the field,''
said wide receiver Terrell Owens, ''we're still the team to beat.''

 &HT;    Classic kicks off with FSU, A&AMP;M
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When Florida State takes the field
tonight at Giants Stadium, you'll forgive Chris Weinke if he takes
an extra moment to enjoy the spotlight. After all, it took him
eight years to get here.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-year hiatus from the sport and one year as a backup,
college football's oldest sophomore (26) will finally get a chance
to show if he's still got it when No. 2 Florida State meets No. 14
Texas A&AMP;M in the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to say exactly what I'm going to be feeling,'' said
Weinke, who hasn't started a game at quarterback since his senior
year in high school in 1989. ''I know I'll be nervous. Anyone who
says they are not going to be nervous for a game of this magnitude
is going to be lying. I don't know how I'm going to react. For the
most part I'm a clam guy but this is something I've been waiting
eight years for.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, a native of St. Paul, Minn., was considered the nation's
best high school quarterback in 1989. He signed with Florida State
but decided to try baseball when the Blue Jays gave him a $375,000
bonus. After six years of bouncing around the organization, Weinke
decided to give football another try. Florida State coach Bobby
Bowden, as promised, had a scholarship waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State has not started a sophomore quarterback since
1986, but Weinke is no ordinary sophomore, said Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know everything about him except how he'll play in the
game,'' said Bowden, who begins his 23rd season at FSU. ''He's got
all the tools and the biggest thing is his maturity. I would be
surprised if he doesn't do well but we have to remember that our
last three or four quarterbacks all really struggled in their first
few games.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Florida State's quarterbacks have had a tough
time finding their comfort level in their first year as the
starter. The Seminole offense places significant demands, both
mentally and physically, on the position. Weinke says he wants to
break this pattern and will do it with preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been watching film all spring and summer trying to
anticipate everything they'll throw at me,'' said Weinke, who threw
only 13 passes as a true freshman last season. ''But you always
know there will be surprises. The question is how I will handle
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke is making his debut against one of the nation's better
secondaries as the Aggies held their opponents to just 150.3 yards
passing per game last season. He has also been nursing a sore toe
and a sore shoulder over the past two weeks. Neither, he said, will
affect his play.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State has not lost a season-opener since 1989, when
Southern Miss and Brett Favre knocked off the Seminoles 30-26. In
fact, Bowden is 19-3 in opening day games as the Seminoles coach.
The Aggies, who were 9-4 last season, present enough problems to
make this game very close, said Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a dangerous game for us because we're nowhere near
were we need to be,'' said Bowden. ''But if we might as well find
out now if we've got what it takes to be a championship team. If we
don't, we'll find out Monday night.''
</P>
<P>
   KICKOFF CLASSIC: FLORIDA STATE VS. TEXAS A&AMP;M
</P>
<P>
   When/where: 8 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   TV: ABC (Keith Jackson, Bob Griese, Lynn Swan)
</P>
<P>
   1997 records: Florida State 11-1; Texas A&AMP;M 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   1998 rankings: Texas A&AMP;M is No. 14 in the Associated Press
writer's poll and No. 15 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches poll;
Florida State is No. 2 in both polls.
</P>
<P>
   Series: Florida State leads 3-0. The last meeting was a 10-2 win
over the Aggies in the 1992 Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Bobby Bowden is 208-51-4 in 22 seasons at Florida
State, 281-83-4 overall; R.C. Slocum is 83-25-2 in 10 seasons at
Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Players to watch (1997 stats): Florida State _ QB Chris Weinke;
RB Travis Minor (112 carries, 664 yards); WR Peter Warrick (53
catches, 884 yards); LB Lamont Green (85 tackles). Texas A&AMP;M _ QB
Branndon Stewart (111/196, 1,429 yards, 10 TD); RB Dante Hall (973
yards rushing); LB Dat Nguyen (130 tackles).
</P>
<P>
   Game notes: Florida State has won eight straight season openers
and the Seminoles are 19-3 on opening day under Bowden....The last
time Florida State opened the season in the Kickoff Classic (1993),
it went on to win the national championship....Texas A&AMP;M is again
favored to win the Big 12's Southern Division. The Aggies return
eight starters on offense and six on defense....As a kick returner,
Texas A&AMP;M's Dante Hall has averaged 9.4 yards per touch....After
struggling early in the 1997 season, Stewart threw for 901 yards in
his last five games....The strenghth of the Texas A&AMP;M defense is a
secondary that allowed only 150.3 yards passing per game.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Texas A&AMP;M is a quality opponent but it can't match
Florida State's overall speed and superior talent. This one could
be close for a half but the Seminoles will wear the Aggies down in
the fourth quarter. Florida State 42, Texas A&AMP;M 17.

 &HT;    Managed care blocking some treatments
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Helen Meeks of Gainesville, Ga. has wrestled with
depression off and on since she was an adolescent. Now she's
confronting another adversary: managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks, through Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, has a
managed care plan known as a point-of-service plan. It allows
members to get some benefits for using a health provider not in the
network.
</P>
<P>
   But in Meeks' policy, there's an exception: mental health.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks' therapist, a licensed clinical social worker, isn't in
the network, and the insurance won't pay a dime for those visits,
unlike those for general medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unfair,'' says Meeks, an educator. ``I don't think
they'd single out diabetics or people with cardiovascular
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   So Meeks pays $65 a week out-of-pocket because the therapist
``has made a real difference,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For years, such gaps have routinely separated the benefits for
physical health and mental health. Some company plans, in fact,
don't cover mental health care at all. Many others place rigid
conditions on care.
</P>
<P>
   For employers, managed care's restrictions have delivered
savings on their mental health bills. They also have delivered
drastic changes in services for emotional and addiction problems _
a benefits revolution that experts say has a greater impact than
that for physical health care.
</P>
<P>
   Patients have to jump through more procedural hoops to get
treatment. And that has led to widespread complaints about managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Sammons of Murrayville knows the hassles.
</P>
<P>
   Sammons first had to battle her HMO to keep seeing the same
psychiatrist. Then, in July, her Blue Cross plan moved her to a
generic medicine instead of the brand-name drug she had been taking
for her attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   But she suffered major side effects, including a swollen,
ulcerous tongue. Sammons, a sales rep, is still trying to return to
her brand-name drug.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross Vice President Charlie Harman says that while generic
drugs are often the first option for HMO patients, the plan does
consider appeals for the brand-name drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making me run through a whole lot of hoops,'' says
Sammons.
</P>
<P>
   A national study shows that while more workers had mental health
coverage in 1995 than in 1991, employers put more limits on those
services. Restrictions included capping the number of outpatient
visits, as well as requiring a higher co-payment.
</P>
<P>
   This disparity infuriates patients and their advocates, who have
rallied to enact several anti-discrimination laws. In fact,
lobbying work by the Georgia Psychological Association and the
Mental Health Association of Georgia pushed state Insurance
Commissioner John Oxendine to issue a directive for POS plans to
cover out-of-network care. Meeks plans to discuss that directive
with her insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross' Harman says the company is in compliance with state
law, that a POS plan doesn't have to cover nonnetwork mental health
therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, ``parity'' proposals have passed in dozens of states
and nationally. Congress in 1996 required benefits plans to have
equal dollar spending limits for mental and physical health care.
</P>
<P>
   And Minnesota enacted a full parity law for the insurance
policies it regulates. Despite yelps from insurers and employer
groups about the cost, health premiums increased by about 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, legislation passed this year requires that coverage
for mental health and substance abuse, if offered by an employer,
be the same in some areas as for physical health _ including annual
out-of-pocket limits and deductibles and restrictions on the number
of therapy visits or hospital days. The law applies only to
companies with regular health insurance _ those that don't
self-insure their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of Americans with job-based insurance belong to
self-insured plans, which are exempt from states' regulation under
a federal law known as ERISA. Only Congress can lift that exemption
for employers with self-insured plans.
</P>
<P>
   Real-life examples of parity, such as in Minnesota, show that
equalizing benefits won't balloon costs, says Ron Bachman of the
consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that this is going to bankrupt all small employers is
pretty hard to believe,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for substance abuse coverage are pushing for national
legislation barring insurance plans from imposing stricter limits
on addiction treatment than for other medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers raise the argument on higher premiums and insist that
alcohol and drug-abuse treatment often doesn't work. But Dr. Robert
Morse, a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., says,
``Treatment works for many people. We need the opportunity to be
able to continue treatment (for alcohol and drug abuse) like we
would with any other disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation's backers say the premium increase would be
negligible, about $1 a month on average.
</P>
<P>
   While the parity debate simmers, some consumers would welcome
any coverage _ even with uneven benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Hoffman works for a real estate company in metro Atlanta
that doesn't have a group insurance plan. She has tried to get a
policy on her own, but has faced a barrier since telling agents she
takes depression medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find anyone to insure me because I take
anti-depres-sants,'' says Hoffman, who buys the medication
out-of-pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mental health is extremely important to me,'' Hoffman says.
``It's flabbergasting they won't insure me.''

 &HT;    Malaise, lack of coverage attributing to political messages
being lost
 &HT;    By Tim Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ When Republican candidate for governor Bob Taft
unveiled a major initiative to help financially strapped families
make ends meet, the event didn't make the late evening news in the
state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   A burning hay field, a store running out of lottery tickets and
a follow-up report on vandals hitting a suburban school did.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when Democrat Lee Fisher released a health care
proposal that will be a centerpiece of his campaign, it did not
initially make the airwaves, and only one major newspaper ran the
story on page one.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 weeks, Ohioans will choose their next governor. The winner
will face a daunting list of challenges _ school funding, electric
utility de-regulation, HMO reform, prison overcrowding, privatizing
public services and tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   Each issue in some way touches the lives of Ohioans. But for
most voters, perhaps the only contact they will have with the
candidates and their positions will be through the million of
dollars in paid TV advertising that will flood the airwaves during
the final weeks leading to Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers and professionals say many factors affecting
the political climate _ from a cynical public, to a sound economy,
to a change in the way politicians go about their business and the
media covers it _ combine to make the campaign seem virtually
issueless.
</P>
<P>
   It's not always been that way.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the last hotly contested campaign for an open
governor's seat _ the 1990 race between Republican George Voinovich
and Democrat Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. _ voters and the media had
been inundated with information. One single issue book put forth by
Voinovich, detailing his proposals for economic development and job
creation, stacks higher than all of the material presented so far
by Taft and Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current attitude seems to be 'don't get too many people
angry' _ and constantly check the polls,'' said Herb Asher,
professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University.
``It's an odd election when managed health care _ admittedly an
important issue but one that the republic will survive _ becomes
the only flash point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When times are good, people do not feel a need to get
something out of government,'' added Jim Tilling, a leading
Republican strategist. ``Health care is getting some attention
because it is something people deal with almost every day. But
there is less fear about other major life issues, such as a job
loss, than there has been in other elections.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a good economy making things seem quiet.
</P>
<P>
   When Democrat Richard F. Celeste and Republican Clarence J.
Brown squared off in an open governor's race in 1982, seven
commercial television stations had Statehouse bureaus. Today, only
one remains, Dayton's WHIO-TV (Channel 7), along with Ohio Public
Television. Even the major commercial TV stations in Columbus,
which used to have separate Statehouse and government bureaus, have
dropped those offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we want to admit it or not, a lot of attention to a
campaign, and it's more so early in a race, can be driven by the
presence or lack thereof of TV,'' said Robert Richman, former
campaign manager for Fisher. ``If people see it on TV, even if it's
just a snippet, they think 'this is important' or they learn
something _ sometimes something so simple as the fact that there is
a a big election this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting for even those ``snippets'' can be intense and there is
elation with even modest victories. When Taft announced his
proposal for a ``Kids' Card'' that would allow parents of young
children to receive discounts at participating retail stores, he
stood outside a children's store surrounded by toys and diapers.
</P>
<P>
   One Columbus TV crew filmed the event. It failed to make the
late evening or late night news, but a brief report did air on the
station's 5 p.m. newscast.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women roll right into that show from Oprah, so we
were pretty pleased about that,'' said Brett Buerck, Taft's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just campaign events that are being treated
differently, according to veteran government officials and
observers. Mike Dawson, Gov. Voinovich's press secretary, has a
keen sense of the public mood but he was even taken aback recently
after releasing a one-page letter from Voinovich to federal
officials urging that tax dollars not pay for Viagra prescriptions
except for medical necessities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone rang off the hook,'' he said. ``Just about every TV
station in the state called.''
</P>
<P>
   None called a week later when Voinovich issued a detailed
position paper on managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   Pete O'Grady, a Statehouse lobbyist and former chairman of the
Ohio Democratic Party, said it's incorrect to blame public apathy
and media indifference for the lack of fire in a campaign. While
there are differences between Taft and Fisher, their positions on
several key issues _ including school funding and health care
reform _ are similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a major campaign where one candidate says
something and the other says 'me, too,' '' O'Grady said.
</P>
<P>
   At a July press conference where Fisher and his lieutenant
governor running mate Michael Coleman made strong comments in favor
of the death penalty, one campaign volunteer in the room whispered,
``Where are the Democrats?''
</P>
<P>
   O'Grady said Democrats ``realized that taking positions out of
the mainstream was costing them elections. Remember, this is about
winning. (President) Clinton showed that the Democrats could win
the presidency by moving to the center and that's where we are
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weaver, a Republican political consultant working in Ohio
and other states, said Clinton has also ``increased the cynicism
factor. His conduct has sparked such intense partisan fighting that
people are turned off. That generally results in disinterest in
other issues and lower voter turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said people tend to vote when they are ``angry about
something,'' but they are more disappointed with Clinton personally
than angry about policy. ``I think the current mood helps
incumbents, but it does not increase turnout,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, noted that even in states that made special
efforts to increase turnout in the spring primary, fewer people
voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we have is not procedural but motivational,'' he
said. ``There is not quick fix for what ails the American political
system.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will we see in the remaining 10 weeks of a major
campaign, where voters will also be picking a successor to U.S.
Sen. John Glenn, who is retiring after 24 years?
</P>
<P>
   The two leading candidates for governor say it's incorrect to
label the electorate disengaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early,'' Fisher said. ``But everywhere I go people
come up to me and have important issues on their minds. The debate
will pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft admits he's been at times disheartened by the lack of
attention paid to some of his initiatives, but said, ``Voters will
tune in when they are ready and they will have the information
there to absorb and make a sound choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of that information will have been distributed in small
chunks and TV ``sound bites,'' rather than as complete packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates have learned that voters tend to go with someone
they trust, someone they feel good about,'' said Democratic
political consultant Gerald Austin. ``Talking directly about an
arcane government policy doesn't get you there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so far both major gubernatorial campaigns have tried to
portray their candidate as pro-family, responsible leaders with the
experience to take over state government. Both have hired TV
consultants who have done hard-hitting TV ads in the past, and both
candidates in previous elections have run such spots, but for now
it's a kinder, gentler campaign while each focuses on raising money
and trying to enthuse their party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may get hard-hitting at the end,'' said consultant Richman,
``but what this election is all about is convincing voters that
when a crisis arises, or a major policy decision has to be made,
which candidate is going to do what's best for your family. That's
it.''

 &HT;    Commentary: One year later, England still embraces its 'Rose,'
but not as tightly
 &HT;    By Colin Campbell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England _ The protracted first anniversary of the
Princess of Wales's death is just about over, and her country seems
to be getting back to normal again. A year ago _ around the time of
Diana's funeral _ the British turnout and the soul-searching grew
so massive that even I, a visiting American who arrived caring very
little about the royals or their soap opera, found myself
thunderstruck and wondering excitedly what it all meant. At the
very least, a media orgy of unprecedented grossness was going on.
Beyond that, the winds of social history seemed to be blowing in
directions that were simultaneously democratic, sentimental,
Mediterranean, anti-royal, pro-youth, pro-women, modern, cultic _
in a word, un-English, or at least contrary to the picture most of
us have of this country.
</P>
<P>
   I've been back in England for several days now, feasting on the
endless daily papers and reading so many clever pundits who've been
opining on Diana that I think I'll scream if I have to read another
word about her. But one thing is as clear as the lovely late-summer
skies: Britain's pre-Diana mentality has reasserted itself.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the tabloid press is as hysterical and Dianaphilic as
ever _ and as phony in the way it pretends to speak for everyone.
But the more thoughtful media have been quite balanced and
exploratory.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Gallup poll showed that only 6 percent of the British
public planned to mourn for Diana, though majorities still admire
her and want to see a hospital renamed in her honor. Nearly half
consider the Diana thing overblown.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't say her memory has subsided into that of your
garden-variety dead beautiful superstar, but plainly rational
discourse has reasserted itself. It is now common and permissable
(as skeptics felt it was not, a year ago, in the time of the
``grief police'') to ignore Diana, to focus on other stars and news
and tragedies, to express dissent, cynicism, etc. A national auto
safety group has even complained that a ``Go Slow for Diana'' plan
(in which her fans will drive at a snail's pace today) may cause
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Much else around here also strikes me as having reverted to the
muddling, male-run middle way. Prince Charles, deep in the doghouse
last fall, has made a bit of a comeback, while his chilly mother,
Queen Elizabeth, has taken pains to appear more caring and with-it
(her Rolls recently slid up to a McDonald's). The royals have hired
hipper p.r. people, and the pendulum
</P>
<P>
   has swung _ though I'm sure the Windsors still impress even many
monarchists as disappointingly mouldy.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair, for his part, who seemed so in tune
with last year's anguish and hopes (he dubbed Diana ``the people's
princess'' and linked her seamlessly with his ``New Labor'' image
for a ``New Britain''), has gone all quiet and tactful. People like
Blair now imply it's best to be reserved again for ``the boys,''
Charles' and Diana's popular sons.

 &HT;    Commentary: One year later, England still embraces its 'Rose,'
but not as tightly
 &HT;    By Colin Campbell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England _ The protracted first anniversary of the
Princess of Wales's death is just about over, and her country seems
to be getting back to normal again. A year ago _ around the time of
Diana's funeral _ the British turnout and the soul-searching grew
so massive that even I, a visiting American who arrived caring very
little about the royals or their soap opera, found myself
thunderstruck and wondering excitedly what it all meant. At the
very least, a media orgy of unprecedented grossness was going on.
Beyond that, the winds of social history seemed to be blowing in
directions that were simultaneously democratic, sentimental,
Mediterranean, anti-royal, pro-youth, pro-women, modern, cultic _
in a word, un-English, or at least contrary to the picture most of
us have of this country.
</P>
<P>
   I've been back in England for several days now, feasting on the
endless daily papers and reading so many clever pundits who've been
opining on Diana that I think I'll scream if I have to read another
word about her. But one thing is as clear as the lovely late-summer
skies: Britain's pre-Diana mentality has reasserted itself.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the tabloid press is as hysterical and Dianaphilic as
ever _ and as phony in the way it pretends to speak for everyone.
But the more thoughtful media have been quite balanced and
exploratory.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Gallup poll showed that only 6 percent of the British
public planned to mourn for Diana, though majorities still admire
her and want to see a hospital renamed in her honor. Nearly half
consider the Diana thing overblown.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't say her memory has subsided into that of your
garden-variety dead beautiful superstar, but plainly rational
discourse has reasserted itself. It is now common and permissable
(as skeptics felt it was not, a year ago, in the time of the
``grief police'') to ignore Diana, to focus on other stars and news
and tragedies, to express dissent, cynicism, etc. A national auto
safety group has even complained that a ``Go Slow for Diana'' plan
(in which her fans will drive at a snail's pace today) may cause
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Much else around here also strikes me as having reverted to the
muddling, male-run middle way. Prince Charles, deep in the doghouse
last fall, has made a bit of a comeback, while his chilly mother,
Queen Elizabeth, has taken pains to appear more caring and with-it
(her Rolls recently slid up to a McDonald's). The royals have hired
hipper p.r. people, and the pendulum
</P>
<P>
   has swung _ though I'm sure the Windsors still impress even many
monarchists as disappointingly mouldy.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair, for his part, who seemed so in tune
with last year's anguish and hopes (he dubbed Diana ``the people's
princess'' and linked her seamlessly with his ``New Labor'' image
for a ``New Britain''), has gone all quiet and tactful. People like
Blair now imply it's best to be reserved again for ``the boys,''
Charles' and Diana's popular sons.
</P>
<P>
   Diana's briefly heroic brother turned out to be a cad,
reportedly treating his wife even worse than Charles treated Diana.
As for her dead boyfriend's rich Egyptian father, he has been
pushing flaky conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diana fatigue.'' ``The mourning after.'' ``Ocean of treacle.''
``Candle-in-the wind doggerel.'' ``Vulgar exploitation.'' Those are
typical reflections in the British press these days _ amid many
references, of course, to Diana's smile and flaws and good works.

 &HT;    Glenn's upcoming mission likely to be long on nostalgia,
scientific discovery
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - At T-minus two months to the space shuttle launch
of Sen. John Glenn, the scientific value of his mission seems
likely to remain dwarfed by the romance of a first-generation space
hero's historic return.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and advocates cannot help emphasizing the adventure of
the 77-year-old Glenn's return to space over the possibility that
experiments done on him in orbit could offer clues to the human
aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Even NASA Administrator Dan Goldin admits he was thrilled by the
prospect of letting the first American in orbit go back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that this nation owes Sen. Glenn his second flight,''
Goldin said. ``This man is an outstanding pilot and astronaut.
Science is one aspect, giving him his second flight is the other.
One doesn't outweigh the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin insisted that Glenn's experiments be peer-reviewed and
declared ``cutting-edge'' research worthy of a place on the space
shuttle, but at the same time he was exhilarated by the symbolic
power of flying a national icon who is edging near 80. ``It shows
that NASA still has the courage to do bold things. I'm excited
about the fact we take on the tough tasks. I think it's a statement
that we're a vital agency that's willing to explore. Very, very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The science itself isn't expected to say anything bold. The
National Institutes of Health, and its subset, the National
Institute on Aging, convened a pair of conferences last year to
evaluate Glenn's proposal and agreed that studying an elderly man
in microgravity would be a worthwhile experiment. But not because
they're hoping for some earth-shattering results that might unlock
the mysteries of growing old.
</P>
<P>
   It will be months before any results are known, and perhaps
years before any meaning can be discerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody except the insiders will take note of the scientific
results,'' said John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy
Institute at George Washington University, and a proponent of
Glenn's flight.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Sprott, who as associate director of the Biology of
Aging department in the NIA was instrumental in evaluating the
worth of Glenn's space mission, said the best anyone can hope for
is something unusual. If Glenn's body reacts the same as those of
younger astronauts then scientists may be left with a ``where do we
go from here?'' problem. But if some part of Glenn's body, from his
bones to his muscles to his cardiovascular system, does not weaken
the way they do in younger space travelers, then the experts could
have a strong signal for where to devote their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Sprott said the Glenn flight will have been
extremely valuable to geriatric science. For the public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago it was difficult to get 20 people in a room to
take it seriously,'' said Sprott, who left NIA recently to become
director of the Ellison Medical Foundation, which specializes in
elderly research. ``This gets the whole issue enough attention to
start having aging taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all that attention is positive. Critics of the
science, many of whom support Glenn's flight anyway, call the
studies a `fig leaf' excuse for letting Ohio's senior senator have
another space ride after years of devoted public service in which
he amassed formidable Washington clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any reasonable expectation that medical care is going
to change from this?'' said John Pike, director of space policy for
the Federation of American Scientists. ``Almost certainly no.''
</P>
<P>
   Pike, who supports Glenn's flight for its heroic value, said
sending just one elderly man into space for a few days isn't
``completely bogus,'' but it's not realistic to think ``this is
going to be good for little old ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real science doesn't work like that. It is infinitely more
incremental than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprott is indifferent to such criticism. ``I don't really feel
bad about the science,'' he said, ``recognizing that we're dealing
with'' the first subject.
</P>
<P>
   He joins Logsdon in the view that Glenn's involvement in the
space program is worth the public relations bonanza, even if the
science remains shadowed by Glenn himself. Logsdon said the
scientific effort is a ``plausible'' use of NASA resources that can
withstand the scrutiny of vast public attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will stand up as well as it has stood up so far,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the debate, Glenn stays steadfastly focused on the
scientific purpose of his flight. Even if everyone else talks about
the unparalleled public attention NASA now enjoys. He acknowledges
that his trip could change the way the elderly are viewed, but that
is as much as he's willing to contemplate outside the scientific
realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that what I'm doing on this will be the toe
in the door that opens up a whole new area of research for NASA
into the future that they haven't been into before,'' Glenn said in
an interview earlier this summer. ``I see myself as part of that
scientific cutting edge, in a new area.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA has long known that astronauts exhibit the same general
degradation of their bodies after prolonged weightlessness that is
the hallmark of growing old on earth. Though, for young astronauts
the changes reverse upon returning from space. But it was Glenn
who, upon learning of this, pressed NASA to send him into space to
see if an already aged body continues to weaken after nine days in
weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   So, did NASA consider sending just any elderly man?
</P>
<P>
   No, Goldin admits.
</P>
<P>
   And as Glenn's old friends from Project Mercury, America's first
manned space program, say, no one else would have made this flight
happen. It took Glenn's name and his muscle as a senator to get
NASA even to look at it. But all that is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think we were going to the moon,'' for all the
attention, said original astronaut Wally Schirra, 75. ``But the
space program needs it desperately, not to go to Mars, just to keep
public interest in the space shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   Schirra, who spent 11 days in orbit during Apollo's first manned
mission in 1968 and has no desire to go back, said the science is
``not as significant as the publicity,'' but said having Glenn go
up is a good start on the study of aging and weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The two other surviving Mercury astronauts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface it makes good sense,'' said Scott Carpenter,
71, who was Glenn's backup for the first orbital flight in 1962.
``We have an awful lot of baseline data on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, who has jokingly offered to be Glenn's back up again
``though I'm sure he'd break a leg this time,'' said the science
``is not a fig leaf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``it will be a good trip for John. Naysayers
are like vandals. They have always existed in the face of
scientific endeavor and imagination, but by and large they are
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Cooper, 73, another of the Mercury Seven who echoed
Carpenter's pleasure in seeing Glenn fly again, said science
experiments are always open to debate before they've been done. And
the same is true of space flights. He said the parallels between
growing old and being in space for extended periods is a topic ``it
certainly doesn't hurt to look'' at.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he said. ``We may find out something really
important.''

 &HT;    Stores will throw parties as the wraps come off Titanic
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rose: ``I don't see what all the fuss is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal: ``You may be blase about many things, Rose. But not
Titanic!''
</P>
<P>
   (Kate Winslet, Billy Zane in an opening scene from ``Titanic'')
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Blase? Please. They haven't yet invented the word for
how opposite of blase this all is.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Blockbuster never extends its store hours, but that
all changes at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, when ``Titanic'' finally comes
out on video and the huge chain's metro Atlanta stores stay open
for business and partying till 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Media Play in Alpharetta, Ga. is staying open for an
unprecedented 36 straight hours to sell ``Titanic.'' But stragglers
beware. By Tuesday evening, the stock could be depleted, and, even
more tragic, the ``My Heart Will Go On'' karaoke contest will be
long over.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy in Duluth, Ga. has 2,500 copies of the Winslet-Leonardo
DiCaprio weeper to sell _ and no real idea of how long that initial
supply will last. Like all the big chains, Best Buy encouraged
buyers to reserve copies, but will sell the two-cassette package to
anyone as long as stock holds out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can process that many customers, I expect to sell them
all the first day,'' said general manager Bill Smith. ``I expect
them to be lined up to get in when we open.''
</P>
<P>
   What, no women and children first?
</P>
<P>
   ``Only if Leo's going to come to our house and smooch her on the
cheek,'' said Marietta, Ga.'s Mary Schaffer with a laugh, pointing
to her 11-year-old daughter, Shauna. ``Then maybe I'll go stand in
line at Blockbuster at midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember life before ``Titanic''? OK, then, remember way, way
back last winter, when the biggest concern anyone had was scoring a
ticket to the biggest movie of all time? The film was long (three
hours plus, meaning fewer daily showings), the fans intensely loyal
_ Shauna and her twin brother, Derek, have seen it a combined 15
times, for instance _ and the theaters, it seemed, were always
full.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's video release brings some promise of relief _ plus a
whole boatload of new concerns. Priced to buy at $19.99 to $24.99
in most stores, ``Titanic'' may still be out of allowance reach of
its core audience of Leonardo-loving girls. (It's a scientific
fact: A recent survey of girls ages 8 to 15 rated him the person
they'd most like to crash their slumber party.)
</P>
<P>
   But what if the rental supplies run out?!
</P>
<P>
   ``Blockbuster has a guarantee that you can rent it,'' Lindsey
Gall, 12, said with absolute certitude. ``If I can sneak out, I can
walk over there at midnight 'cuz I live close.''
</P>
<P>
   She was kidding, of course. But only about the sneaking out
part. Blockbuster has indeed made that guarantee, which is great,
but even better . . .
</P>
<P>
   Even better . . . ``a smart buyer could make out like a bandit
on this thing,'' said Allen Auchenpaugh, general manager of Media
Play in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there's the Kate-and Leo-festooned GiftCard, good for $5
off subsequent transactions, that Blockbuster offered purchasers
who reserved a video early. The free ``Titanic'' calendar (trust
us, real Leo fans will never want to leave February) that Best Buy
dangled before potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Titanic'' whistles, just like the one Rose blew on while
bobbing amidst the frozen bodies, that will go to a limited number
of Media Play customers after midnight. Or the sweepstakes entries
(the grand prize is a cruise anywhere in the world) each
Blockbuster store will award to the first 100 customers between
midnight and 2 a.m. Some would-be purchasers especially fretted
over the reservation issue. Did they really have to plunk down $5
in advance to be assured of getting a copy Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them they should,'' Auchenpaugh said last week, clearly
enjoying all this Titanicism. ``You don't know what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If this all sounds like so much smart marketing _ ``Will there
be enough videos?!'' from the same folks who brought you the ``Will
there be enough lifeboats?!'' movie _ to some extent, it is.
Auchenpaugh, for one, admits that when his Media Play's initial
supply of several thousand videos starts to run low, ``I can get a
(replacement) shipment the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet hype can't exist in a vacuum, anymore than movies can
continue playing to empty theaters. Last week, nine full months
after it was first released on the big screen, ``Titanic'' was
still playing in six metro theaters. One woman in her early 30s has
paid to see it ``at least 45 times,'' confided an employee at
Gwinnett County's Venture Mall Cinema 12.
</P>
<P>
   It's all the stuff of urban legend by now: the unidentified
metro Atlanta resident who's supposedly seen ``Titanic'' every
single day since it opened. The youngster who Xeroxed the words to
``My Heart Will Go On'' and made everyone on the school bus sing
``Titanic's'' theme song. The boys who essentially hijacked their
carpool driver when she wouldn't stop incessantly blasting that
Celine Dion ballad on her CD player.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old twins who are determined to see ``Titanic'' 10
times each before it leaves area theaters. Oops, that one's
verifiable. Derek Schaffer likes the story line, as well as the
acting. So does Shauna. But like practically every other young girl
in America, Shauna also really likes DiCaprio. Enough to have 28
photos of him decorating her bedroom. Enough to make Derek
half-groan, while sitting on a bench in a nearby mall with Shauna
and their friend, Lindsey Barwick: ``She's trying to put them in
the car.''
</P>
<P>
   But not enough, apparently, to put him off the movie. You may be
blase about many things. But not Titanic. And especially not
``Titanic'' on video.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to buy it so we can watch it every day,'' Derek
said urgently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hundred times,'' Shauna added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day for a lifetime,'' Lindsey sighed happily.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need,'' Derek confided, ``is Mom to drive to the video
store.''

   Retailer Blames Consultant for 2000 Computer Glitch
</P>
<P>
   In one of the first instances in which a company has tried to
blame consultants or computer vendors for installing a system that
will not recognize dates after Dec. 31, 1999, the apparel retailer
J. Baker is asking Andersen Consulting to reimburse it for the cost
of a computer system installed about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Andersen has asked a Massachusetts court to rule
that Andersen met its contractual obligations when it installed the
system.

ANALYSIS: FEW BIDDERS FOR NETWORKS DESPITE GOOD CURB APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hardly a week goes by without a new rumor of an imminent sale or
merger involving CBS Corp.'s television business or General
Electric's network, NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The president of CBS, Mel Karmazin, who announced a partial
spinoff of the company's radio and outdoor advertising businesses
last week, is looking for ways to lift the share price of CBS in
the face of widespread investor pessimism about the future of
television. NBC's president, Robert Wright, has already said his
company is looking for new revenue opportunities for its
programming, including joint ventures with cable programmers.
</P>
<P>
   And though both Karmazin and Wright say they intend to hang onto
their networks, the future of the broadcast networks appears
uncertain with broadcast programming costs on the rise and
audiences continuing to defect to cable _ hence the sale rumors.
Only ABC, still being digested by Walt Disney Co., seems immune
from such speculation.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the merger talk, why has no bidder emerged so far?
Certainly there is at least one interested party with an obvious
strategic incentive for owning a broadcast network: Barry Diller's
USA Networks. And three other big media companies _ Sony, Time
Warner and Viacom _ might have their own reasons for buying one.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the glamour of owning such powerful companies, the
roster of potential buyers is small.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are new advantages ever since the Federal Communications
Commission allowed network companies to own their programming and
share in the sale of rerun rights,'' said David Londoner, an
analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co. ``In this market, everybody talks to
everybody else. And sure, anyone would love to buy them at the
right price. But you could drive a truck between the bid and the
ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Anderson, president of the Yankee Group, a consulting
firm in Boston, added: ``Owning networks ain't what it used to be.
When the prime-time players had 85 percent of the prime-time
audience, you were buying into a monopoly. Now they are at 50
percent market share. There is sticker shock over advertising
prices. And the Internet is eating away at the youth market.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Anderson said, ``companies have proven that they
can launch their own networks for far less money.''
</P>
<P>
   Both NBC and CBS own television stations and operate programming
businesses, while NBC also owns the CNBC cable network and the
MSNBC cable network in a partnership with Microsoft. But while TV
stations and cable services generate large amounts of cash,
broadcast networks typically yield profit margins of only about 10
percent at best. And at worst, as in the current environment, CBS
is losing money and NBC is expected to see a drop in profits in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   For purely financial players in the media industry, like Hicks,
Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, the growth potential of a network is too
limited and the risk too great to justify the price. Either CBS or
NBC and their businesses might cost close to $10 billion _ or
roughly 18 times cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to leave strategic buyers or partners like USA
Networks, Viacom, Sony and Time Warner. Yet each faces different
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   USA's chairman, Diller, has already sought a merger deal with
NBC. USA owns some television stations, a home-shopping service and
the USA and Sci-Fi cable channels. And as a result of the venture
struck this year with Seagram Corp., USA owns Seagram's Universal
television production business, and Seagram owns 44 percent of USA.
</P>
<P>
   NBC in particular would assure Diller that Universal's
television shows would get distribution on its network, which has
been the prime-time leader for the last four years. An NBC deal
would also add to USA's stature in the cable industry because of
NBC's cable services.
</P>
<P>
   But Diller is no longer entirely the master of his own fate.
Seagram's chairman, Edgar Bronfman Jr., objected to a deal that
would have diluted Seagram's USA stake, and Diller himself
reportedly had concerns about the price. And though Diller
undoubtedly would still welcome a merger, the 25.2 percent drop in
USA's share price since July 31 must be sobering.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, whose movie studios also make television programs, might
be a logical entrant to the network game. But as a foreign company,
it can own no more than 25 percent of a network, leaving the giant
company a passive minority investor.
</P>
<P>
   As for Viacom and Time Warner, both have taken years to recover
from big mergers: Time Inc. with Warner Communications in 1989 and
Viacom's takeover of Paramount Communications in 1994, which in
each instance resulted in heavy debt that dragged down their share
prices. And while Viacom's Paramount is a leading producer of
television programming, Viacom's fledgling UPN network is already
giving the company a limited broadcast distribution system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A full-fledged network like CBS would ensure greater
distribution of Paramount's programs, but at a lofty price. And
Viacom has said publicly that it is not interested in buying CBS.
</P>
<P>
   As to an NBC takeover by Viacom, ``I would be shocked at a
deal,'' said John Tinker, a media analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery
Securities. ``It would hurt their stock because the whole corporate
theme has been focusing on de-leveraging and improving the bottom
line.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of Time Warner, whose television programming operations
include the Warner Brothers studios? A company spokesman said on
Friday that his company was not interested in acquiring or merging
with a network company. Certainly any merger would be difficult
because Time Warner, as an operator of cable systems, cannot own
television stations _ although Time Warner could spin off the
stations or simply buy the network portion. But that does not rule
out some type of joint venture. One theory floating around Wall
Street would have Time Warner's CNN and a broadcast network combine
their costly news operations, generating savings that some experts
estimate as high as $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   And as Dennis Leibowitz, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, put it: ``Time Warner is the only one that could afford
to buy the network without the stations since it would provide
guaranteed distribution for Warner Brothers television programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers does, of course, own a fledgling broadcast
system, the WB network. But ``to the extent that a network is a
platform for programming, Time Warner could get more value from CBS
or NBC than from the WB network,'' Leibowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Where does all this leave the potential sellers?
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, when Karmazin, announced that CBS would spin off 20
percent of its radio and outdoor advertising businesses, he
insisted that he wanted to keep CBS's television business. Still,
many on Wall Street think he would welcome a sale if he could get
the right price.
</P>
<P>
   And one person said the spinoff of 20 percent of the radio
company, which would make it easier to determine the market value
of the entire radio business and _ by interpolation _ of the
television operation, could make it easier to set a price.
</P>
<P>
   As for NBC, in the view of at least one media expert, GE's
chairman, John Welch, should have sold a year ago, before the
network lost ``Seinfeld'' and was laden with the $850 million
expense of ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to sell in part because of the glamour
quotient,'' the media expert speculated. ``But maybe when he is
finally ready to sell, the same glamour factor will undoubtedly
help convince a buyer to step in.''

TOBACCO COMPANIES ACCUSED OF PROMISING GOP SENATORS AD MONEY FOR
VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department is reviewing whether tobacco
companies promised some Senate Republicans that they would pay for
television advertisements if the senators voted to defeat the
tobacco bill.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements were not to have been direct endorsements of
the senators, but were meant to explain the tobacco issue in a way
that might provide the senators with ``political cover'' for their
vote, said a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission
by an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.C., the minority leader, received a letter
dated Aug. 17 from the Justice Department confirming that it was
reviewing charges that several companies violated federal election
law, his spokeswoman, Ranit Schmelzer, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegation that tobacco companies may have promised
favorable political advertising in exchange for senators' votes on
specific legislation raises separate concerns under bribery and
gratuity statutes,'' Anthony Sutin, an Assistant Attorney General,
wrote to Daschle. ``The criminal division is presently examining
this allegation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutin's letter was first reported by The Baltimore Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle raised concerns about the tobacco companies' offer in a
letter to the Justice Department on July 2, after he learned of the
complaint by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group
based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Michael Gordon acknowledged that
the department was ``looking at the concerns raised in Senator
Daschle's letter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it an investigation yet,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco industry, said
Sunday that the accusations were ``without merit'' and that the
tobacco companies had run only ``substantive'' advertisements. No
money has been spent on advertisements for candidates, Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of our ads has been to deliver a substantive
message, not a political one,'' he said. ``These are straight
advocacy ads that talk about excise tax increases and black market
cigarettes and other ramifications of the McCain bill.'' Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., was the tobacco bill's lead sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   On June 29, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which supported
this year's tobacco legislation, filed a report with the Federal
Election Commission accusing the tobacco industry of violating
campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, which was based on news articles, including a
Wall Street Journal report, said that on June 17, hours before the
Senate took a critical vote on the tobacco bill, Sen. Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, who heads the Republican senatorial campaign
committee, held a private meeting with the Republican senators
present.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, the complaint says, McConnell told senators
that the industry was promising to run advertisements that gave
``political cover'' to senators who voted to kill the legislation.
The bill, which would have raised the price of cigarettes by $1.10
a pack, was defeated after the Senate fell three votes short of the
60 votes needed to cut off debate.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also stated that the tobacco industry had expanded
its $40 million television advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements could violate federal election law that bars
corporations from making direct contributions to a candidate's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issue ads cross the line into electoral politics when it's
done with any degree of coordination or cooperation with the
candidate,'' said Matt Myers, a lawyer for the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids. ``The promise to run them to provide political
cover stripped the veneer of any claim that these were just issue
ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Steurer, McConnell's press secretary, said Sunday, ``What
Senator McConnell said was a statement of the obvious: that the
companies would continue to fight for their interests, and they
have.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the Justice Department, Daschle stated that the
complaint filed by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids ``makes a
persuasive case that this next phase of advertising is solely
intended to affect the outcome of federal elections, not public
policy.''

 &HT;    E-mail myth: Sunscreen won't cause blindness
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Did you hear the one about the kid who went blind
after getting sunscreen in his eyes?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it didn't happen. At least not from what anyone can tell.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other ``urban legends'' _ startling fictional yarns
just plausible enough to be repeated as fact _ this one gained
currency via the Internet. A letter that's being e-mailed around
the Net purports to be written by a concerned, but unnamed, parent.
</P>
<P>
   The letter writer says his 2-year-old son, Zack, went through an
ordeal after he got sunscreen in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The ``parent'' says water didn't flush out the lotion because
the sunscreen was waterproof. Zack was rushed to an emergency room,
the letter says, where ``special medications'' were used to flush
out his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The letter goes on to say that every year, many kids lose their
sight to waterproof sunscreen. Poor Zack lost his for two days.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Poison Control Centers in Washington
has received numerous calls and e-mails about the warning. Last
month it alerted local poison control centers to the hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Gorman, assistant director of Georgia Poison Control, said
she wasn't shocked to learn about the e-mail, but she was
disappointed that people would believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reassured everyone that they don't need to worry,'' Gorman
said.
</P>
<P>
   One place where the bogus story landed is the Dunwoody, Ga.
KinderCare Learning Center, a day care. Management there, however,
was not convinced the story was real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told a few parents, but we didn't post it,'' said Michele
Mitchell, assistant director.
</P>
<P>
   The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association confirmed that
the sunscreen scare ``is an unsubstantiated story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence, scientific or otherwise, that any such
harmful effects have ever resulted from the use of sunscreens,''
the trade group said. ``Sunscreens are safe.''

 &HT;    More questions than answers surround Louchiey move
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons cut their roster to the
NFL-mandated 53 players Sunday, and by putting Corey Louchiey on
injured reserve with a dubious groin injury, the team left itself a
big question: Which rookie is going to play right tackle in
Sunday's opener at Carolina?
</P>
<P>
   The team also reached an injury settlement with veteran
linebacker Eddie Sutter, and waived undrafted rookie defensive
lineman Ben Huff.
</P>
<P>
   The move with Louchiey is most significant, and means more
roster moves are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle was an offseason priority, and the team gave
Louchiey a two-year, $3.5 million contract after he started 13
games in three years for Buffalo. But he missed the first two
preseason games, and played poorly the last two.
</P>
<P>
   By going on IR, Louchiey becomes ineligible to play for the
Falcons this season, and leaves Atlanta nine offensive linemen _
one less than coach Dan Reeves has said he wanted to keep.
</P>
<P>
   It also means rookie Ephraim Salaam, a 6-foot-7, 298-pound
seventh-round draft choice, or undrafted rookie Jose Portilla (6-6,
320) probably will become the only rookie to start at Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever doesn't start becomes the only backup tackle. Reeves
said 10-year veteran lineman Dave Widell, the backup center, would
not move to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   That's why team officials were scouring waiver wires Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may do something,'' Reeves said. ''A lot depends on who's
available. ''It'll probably be Eprhaim (who starts). He worked real
hard. He showed athleticism. And most of the negative things he did
can be corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons wanted to cut Louchiey and Sutter Saturday. But both
players said injuries impaired affected their chances of making the
team. Sutter has been bothered by a hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than risk the players filing grievances, Reeves said,
''We talked to their agents, and this is how it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Once doctors say Louchiey is healed, the team can waive him, and
he can play for another team.
</P>
<P>
   Half his $500,000 signing bonus counts against this year's
salary cap, and while he is on IR, the Falcons are responsible for
his $500,000 salary, or about $29,412 for every week.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are more than $2.75 million under the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves later this week will announce whether second-year man
Tony Graziani or 44-year-old Steve DeBerg is the No. 2 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' roster includes nine rookies _ eight of nine draft
choices, and Portilla _ and nine veterans who were not with the
team last year.

 &HT;    What Diana did for charity
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Diana's enormous impact on charity
during her 16 years as princess of Wales is undisputed. But, even a
year after her death, she continues to influence charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   Her legacy reverberates in the $114 million raised by her
memorial fund. In her example of hands-on volunteerism still
broadcast around the world. And in the increased focus her efforts
continue to bring to such causes as land-mine victims, cancer and
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to say that someone's death was timely,'' says David
Walker, executive director of Hope House, Palm Beach County's
largest residential provider for AIDS patients. ``But it occurred
just as we were establishing a program for children who have AIDS
and those who'll be orphaned because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the heightened attention brought to Diana after her
death, there was also heightened attention brought to the things
she cared most about,'' he says. ``While we haven't experienced any
increase in funding, there has most certainly been an increase in
awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Local agencies _ such as the American Cancer Society, American
Heart Association and American Red Cross chapters based in West
Palm Beach _ report no surge in donations directly linked to Diana,
but on the national level, charitable giving has risen
substantially, according to the American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Americans contributed $143 billion to charity last year _ up 7.5
percent from the $ 133 billion given in 1996. Even adjusted for
inflation, donations rose 5.1 percent in 1997, making it the
greatest increase since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Research director Ann Kaplan attributes that boost not only to
Diana's death _ which thrust her charitable works into the
spotlight _ but also to the death of Mother Teresa Sept. 5 and
attention given to huge individual donations, such as media mogul
Ted Turner's $1 billion pledge to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Langan, spokesman for the National Charities Information
Bureau, says generosity extended beyond Great Britain after the
Aug. 31 car crash that killed the princess.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the incredible amounts of money being sent to
her foundation, there were an awful lot of people giving to
American charities,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But regardless of where the money went, it's safe to say she
had a remarkable impact, and it's still very much going on.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund was
established just days after her death, donations poured in and
continue to do so at a rate of $113,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But there also has been controversy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the fund's legal team was found to have charged $800,000
for a few weeks' work. (The bill was later cut by 20 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, the fund allowed a food company that was sponsoring the
London Marathon to emblazon Diana's signature _ in the royal color
purple _ on tubs of Flora margarine. British commentators and the
princess' brother, Earl Spencer, were horrified.
</P>
<P>
   Companies must make a hefty donation to the fund to be
sanctioned, and more than 200 a week apply, but fund trustees have
been conservative since the margarine fiasco. They've licensed only
seven items: a Beanie Baby bear, a crystal candle holder, scented
candles, a tribute CD, a set of postage stamps, a set of enamel
boxes and a photograph of flowers piled outside Kensington Palace
by mourners.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute CD has raised nearly $23 million, and the postage
stamps $14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest money-raiser so far, however, has been Elton John's
recording of ``Candle in the Wind 1997,'' which has raked in more
than $30 million. John's CD isn't licensed, but all proceeds are
directed to the memorial fund.
</P>
<P>
   (The 500 British charities that raise the most in private
donations, meanwhile, earned $7.2 billion last year _ an 11 percent
increase over 1996, according to ``The Chronicle of Philanthropy.''
Many attribute that gain, at least in part, to the emphasis given
charities after Diana's death.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite its role in memorializing Diana, the fund isn't linked
to any events marking the one-year anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first place, this is out of respect for the family,''
spokeswoman Jo Greenstead told Reuters news service. ``And, as it
says in the mission statement, the fund doesn't want to stimulate
the emotions that surround the memory of the princess.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory of the princess is best sustained, perhaps, by things
like the international treaty banning land mines, recently ratified
by the British parliament. And by the $3.25 million _ raised by the
sale of her dresses two months before the crash _ now being used by
AIDS and cancer charities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, Princess Diana is the gift that keeps on
giving,'' says Stephen Lee, director of Britain's Institute of
Charity Fund-Raising Managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her overall effect on charity is probably more significant
than any other person's in the 20th century.''

FEW FEDERAL WEB SITES OBSERVE U.S. PRIVACY GUIDELINES
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to online privacy, it seems that the
Clinton administration has not been practicing what it preaches.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the administration's sites on the World Wide
Web post the kinds of privacy guidelines that the Federal Trade
Commission recently criticized businesses for failing to post, and
none of the administration's sites offer the special protections
for children that the government recommends for commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even the White House Web site does not meet the standards
recommended by the FTC and endorsed by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the White House site collects e-mail addresses _
and in some cases, home addresses _ through links that allow
visitors to send electronic messages to President and Mrs. Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore and Mrs. Gore. Yet, it does not provide
any notice about how that information will be used by the White
House. Nor does the site ask visitors to its special children's
pages to consult their parents before divulging personal
information, as the administration has recommended.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the FTC released a survey of commercial Web sites along
with a report that was highly critical of industries that gather
information online and, without notifying the visitors to their
sites, use or sell the data for marketing purposes. The report's
findings, particularly with respect to children, prompted the FTC
to recommend that Congress pass a law requiring that online
businesses and Web site operators obtain parental permission before
gathering e-mail addresses or other information from children under
the age of 13.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike operators of commercial sites, federal agencies do not
collect or sell personal data for marketing purposes. The issue,
critics say, is more one of leading by example.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a matter of practicing what they preach,'' said
David Banisar, senior policy analyst and staff counsel at the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, a public interest research
group in Washington. ``They have been pushing notice and consent,
and they can't even do it themselves. They really have a dismal
record on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Banisar also pointed out that while the White House might not be
using the information for marketing purposes, the data could be
transferred to the Democratic National Committee or used for other
political ends.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has endorsed child-protection legislation
that was introduced in response to the FTC report. It has also
endorsed new self-regulation guidelines and enforcement procedures
recently proposed by the Online Privacy Alliance, a coalition of
businesses and associations that seeks to foster privacy
protections. Those guidelines call for all Internet businesses to
clearly post policies concerning the use and collection of personal
information, and they require Web site operators to obtain parental
approval before gathering data from children.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the administration's support for these measures,
the White House Web site collects information from children without
parental notification. Within a special children's section on the
site, a White House tour led by cartoon caricatures of the ``First
Pets,'' Buddy the dog and Socks the cat, ends with an invitation to
send e-mail to President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton or Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic form asks for the sender's name, age, e-mail
address, grade at school, the school's name and, from those
visitors who want a response, a home postal address. The site does
not advise children to ask their parents before divulging that
information.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has an area
for children, like that of the White House site, that offers the
opportunity to send an e-mail message, yet does not display a
privacy policy or request that children seek parental permission
before giving out e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Web site provides links to 70 Web sites of
federal agencies, Cabinet departments and White House offices and
commissions. Of those 70 sites, only 12 had posted privacy policies
as of Friday afternoon. That amounts to 17 percent of the sites
surveyed, only slightly better than the 14 percent of commercial
sites that, according to the FTC's report, had clearly posted
privacy policies earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, the vice president's office and Mrs. Clinton's
press office did not respond directly to questions about the Web
sites' lack of a posted privacy policy. But administration
officials stressed that in May, Clinton ordered the Office of
Management and Budget to conduct an agency-by-agency review to
ensure that new technologies were not violating the Privacy Act or
otherwise eroding privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget said the
agency was drafting guidelines for federal Web sites.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top adviser on Internet issues, Ira Magaziner, said on
Thursday that the administration was working ``to get its own house
in order.'' Magaziner also noted that unlike the private sector,
government agencies are bound by the Privacy Act to protect
personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are privacy principles being followed,'' Magaziner said.
``And we are taking steps to ensure that government agencies are in
fact in a more visible way confirming that.''
</P>
<P>
   Government departments and agencies _ but not the White House _
must comply with the Privacy Act, which establishes controls over
personal information collected by the federal government. The act
requires that each agency that maintains records on individuals
inform the person whose data are being collected, by notifying the
individual of that fact either on the form that is used to collect
the information or on a separate form that the person can keep.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Schwartz, a policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a Washington advocacy group, said, ``When they collect
specific information about people, they have to give notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a technical violation of the law,'' he added. ``They
should be posting privacy policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The security of online information obtained by them is crucial,
said Kathryn Montgomery, executive director of the Center for Media
Education, a nonprofit organization has been pushing for
legislation to protect both adults and children on line
</P>
<P>
   ``Where government is concerned,'' Ms. Montgomery said, ``we
need to be very, very careful about data collected on line.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Montgomery also emphasized that she saw a clear
distinction between commercial and noncommercial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``One issue,'' she said, ``is whether we would make a
distinction between commercial enterprises that are collecting
data, selling it and coming back with exploitive personal
advertisements, and noncommercial uses of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the White House has taken a hands-off
approach to Internet commerce, saying that industry should police
itself on issues like consumer privacy. In that arena, the
administration has encouraged online merchants and marketers to
post clearly how the information they collect from consumers is
used and to adopt mechanisms to enforce stated privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the FTC has the most prominent privacy policy
of all of the federal Web sites. The agency declined to comment on
the lack of clearly posted policies by other agencies, saying its
jurisdiction _ and its survey _ covered only commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, who helped
write a report on federal Web site privacy policies a year ago,
said the government ``generally has been better'' than the private
sector in keeping private information confidential. And most
government Web sites that take applications for things like
volunteers and disaster relief, he said, do post privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a question of whether all sites in general that
collect personally identifiable information should have privacy
policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the administration, Schwartz said, ``They should lead by
example.''

ANALYSIS: DOES STOCK MARKET DECLINE SIGNAL START OF RECESSION? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sharp selloff in stocks has led a growing number
of people on Wall Street to wonder whether the stock market, often
a leading economic indicator, may be forecasting a recession in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market is down nearly 14 percent in the last six
weeks, with more than a third of those losses coming in the last
week. The stock market has not experienced such a prolonged
downturn since 1990 _ when the United States last slipped into a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   So far, few economists believe the end of the nation's
seven-year economic boom is near. Like most of the investment
strategists on Wall Street, they think that even if stock prices
had risen too high, jobs are plentiful and housing is booming. And
there are no indications of inflation that might cause the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates, the typical precursor to an
economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   Even though corporate profits are slowing down because of the
economic difficulties in Asia, Russia and elsewhere, there are few
signs yet that this weakness is widespread enough to cause the
United States' total economic output to begin to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   But if the drop in stock prices continues, it could shake the
confidence of the many Americans consumers who accumulated
considerable paper wealth in the 1990s bull market. If these
consumers begin to cut back their spending, that might be enough to
further weaken corporate profits, sending the economy into at least
a stall, if not a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   And beneath the surface of the booming American economy is a
disparity that financial analysts say cannot last. ``Americans
recently have been spending faster than their incomes have been
rising,'' Greg Smith, the chief investment strategist at Prudential
Securities, said. ``Could their spending be even stronger next
year? I don't think so.'' In recognition of that fact, Smith said,
the stock market is anticipating ``a profits recession, if not an
economic recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many economic experts say the market's decline has not
yet been severe enough to change investors' psychology. ``The
average investor doesn't believe he will be impacted by this''
recent decline in stock prices, said John Cleland, the chief
investment strategist for the Security Benefit Group, a mutual fund
company in Topeka, Kan. ``The enormous wealth that has been created
over the last three years means that most people are playing with
the house's money.'' For their outlook to change, investors will
have to get a sense that the money they are losing is their own, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Wojnilower, an economist at the Clipper Group, a Wall
Street investment firm, agrees. ``If the stock market does not fall
much from where it is now, I think all this will have zero effect
on people's spending habits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some investors already appear to be pulling back from the
stock market, perhaps in recognition that more of Americans' total
wealth is tied up in stocks today than at any time since the end of
World War II. Individuals have rushed to buy more stocks after
every significant market decline since 1990. But in recent weeks,
as many of their mutual fund investments have begun to show losses
for the year so far, investors have been funneling more cash into
the safer havens of money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that reaction can be traced to the general feeling of
uncertainty about the future that has grown in recent months, as
the economic troubles overseas have worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't that the stock market is predicting a recession,''
Peter Bernstein, a New York economist and consultant, said.
``What's happening is much more complicated than that. There is a
sense that people really don't understand what makes the world
work, and they don't know what to do about it. Two months ago,
people understood how the world worked, and in case anything
happened, Alan Greenspan was there to make everything come out
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market starts the week with the Dow Jones industrial
average coming off its worst week in nine years and, at 8051.68,
the index is 13.8 percent below its high of July 17. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, a broader market indicator, has posted a
similar decline. If the Dow falls into the 7,000s, the
psychological effect could be great on investors accustomed to
seeing a far larger number on the nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent that, many analysts on Wall Street say that what the
stock market, if not the economy, needs most is for interest rates
to decline further. Some analysts hoped that the Federal Reserve
might move in that direction after last week's symposium of
economists in Jackson Hole, Wyo., which was sponsored by the
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo. Until now, the Federal
Reserve has leaned in the direction of raising rates to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more traditional signs of an economic downturn have
begun to show up on Wall Street as well. The companies that would
be hit hardest by a recession are those in cyclical industries,
like manufacturers of heavy equipment and big-ticket items like
cars or jet airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Harnischfeger Industries, for example, a company
based in St. Francis, Wis., whose subsidiaries manufacture huge
pieces of machinery used in paper-making factories and for surface
and underground mining. Last week, Harnischfeger said it would lay
off 20 percent of its work force, or 3,100 people, because of
``ongoing weakness in all our businesses'' that is expected to
extend into 1999. Harnischfeger's stock price last week fell to its
lowest level in four years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Boeing's share price has given up two years' worth of
gains as slowing sales of jets to Asian buyers has started to
create a glut of planes around the world. Auto stocks have fallen
15 percent in the last six weeks on concerns that American
consumers might be willing to make do with their not-so-old current
models.
</P>
<P>
   And stocks of financial companies, particularly banks, have been
hit hard as investors have absorbed the impact of losses suffered
on loans made to developing countries, particularly Russia. The
coming weeks are expected to bring more disclosures of losses on
Russian operations similar to those made last week by Republic
Bank, BancAmerica and J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Some people on Wall Street see nothing to worry about in those
developments. Abby Joseph Cohen, the bullish investment strategist
at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., for example, sees the best opportunities
for investors in financial, technology and cyclical stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen among many of the financial service stocks
is certainly a whole wall of worries,'' Ms. Cohen said. But in
addition to concerns about their exposures to developing countries
like Russia, bank stocks are often the stocks in investors'
portfolios that have gone up the most over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If investors are inclined to raise a little cash, they look to
sell the stocks that have gone up a lot,'' Ms. Cohen said. ``But we
think the change in fundamentals has been dramatically overstated''
by the recent decline in financial and other stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sure. Generally, banks make money by first
borrowing money at low, short-term rates of interest and loaning it
out at higher, long-term rates. Currently, however, some short-term
interest rates are higher than long-term rates _ a situation known
on Wall Street as an inverted yield curve. As with the recent sharp
decline in stock prices, the last time interest rates maintained
such a skewed relationship was in 1990, just as the American
economy was stumbling into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve has enough room to lower interest rates
should they see fit to do so,'' said Richard Cripps, the chief
investment strategist for Legg Mason Inc., the Baltimore brokerage
and investment firm. ``And the American economy still has room to
grow. But companies like Gillette and Coca-Cola are going to get
hurt'' by their dependence on sales outside the United States to
generate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies have been the source of some of investors'
greatest gains in the recent bull market. Already, declines in the
general market are eating into the profits Americans have
accumulated in recent years. Through Friday, the average general
equity fund had lost about 2 percent of its value since the
beginning of the year, according to fund tracking companies.

COMMENTARY: HEALTH-CARE ROAD TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Miss., Pa., Tenn.)  (lb) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two new mobile health vans and a couple of support vehicles will
leave from New York on Monday on an eight-day, nine-state caravan
that sponsors hope will call attention to the plight of millions of
American youngsters who are not getting adequate health care.
</P>
<P>
   International events and the problems plaguing the Clinton
administration have taken the spotlight away from many serious
issues, and children's health care is one of them. There are 74
million youngsters under the age of 18 in the United States. More
than 20 million do not have what advocates describe as reliable
access to comprehensive health care. Eleven million are completely
without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin Redlener, the president of the Children's Health Fund,
which is sponsoring the caravan, explained how gaps in health care
that may not look particularly serious can have dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``The asthma epidemic we are dealing with in New York
City, which is part of a larger national problem with asthma, is to
a great extent related to the fact that a lot of kids are not
getting an early diagnosis and they are not getting their asthma
managed. They are ending up in droves in emergency rooms, in
hospital beds, and in some cases they are dying.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that last year the White House trumpeted the high
childhood immunization rates that have been achieved nationally.
But what has not been focused on, he said, are ``the pockets of
immunization crisis'' that continue to exist in poor urban and
rural areas, where immunization rates are in the 40 percent to 50
percent range.
</P>
<P>
   ``These children are unprotected against a large number of
vaccine-preventable illnesses,'' Redlener said. ``So they are at
risk for whooping cough, measles, polio _ all those diseases that
one could be protected from with immunization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also important to understand that, in addition to the
specific risk factor, a low immunization rate is a profoundly
important marker of poor access to health care in general.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``There is also the problem of anemia, especially
iron-deficiency anemia, which is much higher _ double the rate
among poor children, Hispanic kids, African-American kids _ than it
is among most white kids. If you do not have a regular source of
health care, anemia doesn't get diagnosed and then doesn't get
treated. Kids with chronic anemia will have everything from
weakness and fatigue to poor mental and academic functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Health Fund was established in the 1980s by
Redlener and the singer-songwriter Paul Simon. Using vans as
rolling clinics, the fund provides medical services for tens of
thousands of poor and often homeless children.
</P>
<P>
   The vans in the caravan are being delivered to programs serving
poor children in Arkansas and Mississippi. Blue and 35 feet long,
they are fully equipped pediatric clinics on wheels. Each has a
pair of examining rooms, waiting areas, nurses' stations and
state-of-the-art computer systems that will contain all of the
records of all of the children who are seen.
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to highlight the needs of medically underserved
children and alert families to health care programs that have only
recently become available, the caravan will make stops in
Philadelphia; Washington; Nashville, Tenn.; Memphis, Tenn.; and
several other locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to make a big thing out of it,'' Redlener said.
``We hope to break through this wall that has hidden from sight a
lot of the issues that affect kids and families, and show people we
still have major issues to confront with children.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal legislation approved last year will provide $24 billion
over five years for health coverage for uninsured children.
Redlener applauded that move and is trying to make as many families
as possible aware of it. But he also noted that millions of
children are not eligible for that program, and many families
``live in medical shortage areas where even with insurance, doctors
and hospitals simply are not available.''
</P>
<P>
   Children without health care can easily find themselves in
devastating trouble. Redlener and others on the caravan hope to
persuade more people to look out for them.

 EPA TO TEST THOUSANDS OF WIDELY USED CHEMICALS FOR HARMFUL SIDE
EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ In a Long Island laboratory where steel-clawed
robots in glass cages shuffle tiny trays of cells all day and all
night, the Environmental Protection Agency is gearing up for one of
the most ambitious projects ever proposed to test chemicals found
in everyday products for harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Under contract to the agency, OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. has been
asked to show how the drug industry's advanced automated techniques
for hunting down useful compounds could also be used to quickly
screen thousands of everyday chemicals, from plastics to
pesticides, looking for those that might interfere with the
hormonal systems of people and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   OSI's scientists have genetically engineered human cells with
DNA from fireflies so that the cells glow when a chemical sample
triggers the same molecular switches that in normal cells would
respond to hormones. That glow is like a yellow warning light, a
signal that the chemical ought to be rigorously tested using
laboratory animals.
</P>
<P>
   These experiments are crucial to a new plan, drafted over the
past two years by an expert committee of several dozen scientists,
industry representatives and environmentalists, to survey the
entire chemical landscape looking for what molecular biologists
call endocrine disrupters: substances that can mimic or interfere
with the body's hormones and cause problems with reproduction,
development and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The action is in response to a growing body of research
indicating that man-made industrial chemicals and pesticides may
commit a kind of molecular sabotage within the body's regulatory
apparatus, possibly causing birth defects, low sperm counts, breast
cancer, mental impairment and a range of other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   How serious this problem is and what should be done about it are
among the most hotly disputed of environmental issues, and the plan
does not address what steps might eventually have to be taken to
restrict the use of chemicals that are found to be harmful. This is
a question with great economic and environmental implications.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the scientific knowledge is still evolving, the
advisory committee found, there is ``appropriate widespread
agreement'' that a screening and testing program is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased screening is a first line of defense and a
significant first step in limiting exposure to potentially
dangerous substances,'' said Carol Browner, the EPA administrator,
endorsing the committee's recommendations. Groups representing
chemical and pesticide companies have also backed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Many kinds of commercial chemicals commonly found in industrial
wastes, solvents, cleansers, pesticides, food additives, plastics,
cosmetics, nutritional supplements, petroleum byproducts and
throughout the environment would be scrutinized, at costs that some
experts suggested could exceed $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee has given us a very aggressive approach, which
is to start with a focus on the 15,000 chemicals that are produced
in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more per year,'' said Lynn Goldman,
EPA's assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances,
who headed the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy about where it went,'' said Goldman, who is a
toxicologist and pediatrician. ``They created a way for us to take
a huge step forward. The amount of knowledge that is going to be
generated to better protect the public and the environment is
considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Congress ordered the EPA to develop ways of
screening pesticide residues in food and contaminants in drinking
water to see whether any of them are dangerous endocrine
disrupters. The agency put together the advisory committee, which
has just completed a report that goes well beyond food and water
quality to recommend what officials are calling the most sweeping
program of toxicological screening and testing ever undertaken.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The project, if implemented as planned, would examine whether
individual chemicals or their mixtures, including some naturally
occurring compounds, affect either people or wildlife by acting on
three primary endocrine systems, those governing estrogen, androgen
and thyroid hormones. In the endocrine systems of nearly all
animals, glands located throughout the body synthesize hormones and
secrete them into the bloodstream. Receptors in the cells of
various organs and tissues respond to these chemical messages to
regulate sexual development, reproduction, metabolism, the brain
and central nervous system, and other bodily functions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is so ambitious that it would be impractical to
subject every chemical to its full battery of tests. So the
committee is recommending a system of triage to sort the estimated
87,000 chemicals that are in use.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, like polymers with molecules too large to cross
cell membranes, are unlikely to pose endocrine problems and have
been excluded. Of more than 62,000 chemicals that remain, the
15,000 produced in large quantities, plus all pesticides, would be
the first to be screened.
</P>
<P>
   Even the initial screening of 15,000 high-volume chemicals would
be a daunting task if not for the new technologies that are being
tried out in the Long Island laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   OSI Pharmaceuticals, using much the same techniques, already
screens 7 million chemicals a year looking for potential new
medicines, and midway through the EPA committee's review, its
experts realized that the same approach might well be used to set
priorities for screening potential endocrine disrupters.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agency's plan, a chemical would be subjected to
comprehensive batteries of biological assays, including tests on
laboratory mammals, birds, amphibians, fish and shrimp, after the
initial screening suggests that it needed further testing.
</P>
<P>
   Those animals would be dosed with chemicals and closely examined
for effects that are thought to be caused by endocrine disruption,
like changes in the size of uterine or brain tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Though some of these tests have been used before, not all have
been used to assess endocrine disruption, and there are also
difficult questions about whether it is appropriate to use these
tests to examine the effects of very small doses of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The expert committee warned that only fully validated tests
should be adopted, and there is some question how long that might
delay the project. But most participants believe that in two to
five years, the screening ought to be in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of things don't come along very often, where you
have both science evolving and a regulation evolving together,''
said Theodore Schettler, a doctor who practices at the East Boston
Neighborhood Health Center in Massachusetts and represented
Physicians for Social Responsibility, an advocacy group, on the
EPA's advisory council. ``That is probably the way it ought to be,
rather than waiting till you have a smoking gun and a body count
before doing anything.''

WILLIAMS TRIBUTE DISTRACTS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Don't get them wrong, the Angels said, Ted Williams
deserved to be honored. It was the timing that bothered them.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the start of the bottom of the fourth inning Sunday,
the Red Sox honored Williams _ watching on TV from his home in
Florida _ by singing happy birthday on his 80th.
</P>
<P>
   What the Angels didn't like is that it took place after pitcher
Jeff Juden was finished making his warmup pitches, forcing him to
wait a few minutes before beginning the inning.
</P>
<P>
   On Juden's second pitch of the inning, Nomar Garciaparra ripped
a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Juden, a Boston native, said he's as big a fan of Williams as
anybody. But he said the timing hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was a little kid out there,'' he said. ``Maybe
they shouldn't have done that. Maybe I should have hit Nomar in the
neck. It was weird, it was definitely a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitcher warmed up, then they made him stand out there,''
Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Then they wouldn't let him
take any more (warmup pitches).''
</P>
<P>
   In command: Shigetoshi Hasegawa has made significant improvement
from last season _ his first in the majors _ to this season. He won
Sunday's game with 31/3 scoreless innings, improving to 7-3 with a
2.85 ERA and impressing his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he does is make pitches,'' Collins said. ``It's the
age-old question: What does it take to pitch in the big leagues?
It's command of your fastball. He does that, which sets up
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   One notable adjustment Hasegawa has made is learning to stay
away from the power zone of many American hitters. Hasegawa said in
Japan, power hitters like the ball inside. But in the U.S., the
power hitters like the ball out over the plate so they can extend
their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hasegawa pitches inside more, and if he misses with a
pitch, it's inside and off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   He still doesn't get the attention the other Japanese pitchers
in the majors receive, but that's OK, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, nobody here,'' he said, referring to the Japanese media.
``(Masato) Yoshi (of the Mets) and (Hideki) Irabu (of the Yankees)
are pitching today.''
</P>
<P>
   More help on the way: The Angels will add a group of players
Tuesday in Cleveland when rosters can be expanded. Expected to join
the club from Triple-A Vancouver will be infielders Justin Baughman
and Chris Pritchett and pitchers Mike Holtz and Jason Dickson.
</P>
<P>
   Activated from Double-A Midland will be catcher Charlie O'Brien,
pitcher Steve Sparks and outfielder Reggie Williams. Sparks and
Williams never actually left the team but needed to be moved off
the roster to make room for Ken Hill and Gregg Jefferies.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Ex-Angel Cecil Fielder is hitting .143 (3 for 21) since
signing with the Indians.... Center fielder Jim Edmonds' X-rays on
his ribs Saturday night were negative, but he didn't start Sunday.
He entered the game on defense in the bottom of the ninth.... On
one side of the Angels clubhouse after Sunday's game, the majority
of the team gathered to watch the end of the Rangers-White Sox
game. On the other side, Tim Salmon watched the USC football game.
Salmon's brother Mike is a former Trojans defensive back.

ANGELS BEAT RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The more the Angels play, the more they look like a
playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   After taking three of five from the Yankees in New York to begin
the trip, they left Boston and headed for Cleveland on Sunday night
having taken two of three from the Red Sox, including Sunday's 8-6
win before 31,476 at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it on an afternoon when their starting pitcher
couldn't make it out of the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Keyed by a four-run third inning, the Angels gave Jeff Juden a
7-2 lead. But the 6-foot-8 right-hander, a Boston native pitching
at Fenway Park for the first time, allowed a solo homer to Nomar
Garciaparra, a three-run homer to Mo Vaughn and was yanked with two
out in the fifth and a 7-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox did not score again, shut down by Shigetoshi
Hasegawa (31/3 scoreless innings) and Troy Percival (scoreless
ninth for 38th save).
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa (7-3) allowed only two hits, struck out three, did not
walk a batter and lowered his ERA to 2.85.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasegawa was brilliant,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said.
``He gave us exactly what we needed. He helped us get to Percy. I
really believe you've got to make pitches in this park. One thing I
know Shige can do is make pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of Troy Percival, Hasegawa has been our MVP out of the
bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   With the win and Texas' loss, the Angels increased their lead in
the AL West to three games. Sunday's game was big, they said,
because they're all big this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of them we play from now on out is bigger than the
day before,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Juden, pitching on three days' rest, gave up a triple to Darren
Lewis and home run to John Valentin to start the first inning and
put the Angels in a 2-0 hole.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels got it back in the second when Garret Anderson
hit a two-run homer, wrapping the ball around the right-field foul
pole, an estimated 305 feet from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, the Angels got a couple of walks from
knuckleballer Tim Wakefield (15-6) to start the inning. Then Darin
Erstad and Tim Salmon had infield dribblers that went for hits,
Salmon's driving in Orlando Palmeiro from third for a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Jefferies (3 for 5) followed with a two-run double and
Anderson had an RBI groundout for a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best two hitters got a combined distance of 86 feet,''
Collins mused.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on a roll, you get those breaks,'' Salmon said.
``Those are the things that are going to happen during the season,
but the timing couldn't be better. This is the road trip of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary DiSarcina had an RBI single in the eighth inning to give
the Angels an 8-6 edge, which Percival surely appreciated. Percival
gave up three runs in the ninth inning Friday, but luckily for him
the Angels had a four-run lead and held on.
</P>
<P>
   Percival said Friday wasn't on his mind when he took the ball in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to look back,'' he said. ``I've given up three or
four runs in the past. I want the ball every day. Whether I gave up
three or shut the door the previous time, I want to be back out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning two of three from the Red Sox showed Collins something
he said he was hoping to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real proud of the guys,'' he said. ``One of my biggest
concerns was coming out of New York there'd be a letdown
emotionally. They didn't do that. (Saturday) night after the second
rain delay Pedro (Martinez) was throwing great and we sunk. But we
came out today and needed a big game going into Cleveland.''

RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT'S SQUABBLING POLITICIANS MAKE LITTLE PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-U.S. and RUSSIA-ASSESS) 
(js) 
 By Michael Gordon   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With great fanfare, Kremlin aides and Russian lawmakers
announced a new accord Sunday that would ease the bitter standoff
over power-sharing between President Boris Yeltsin and the
Communist-dominated parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But within a few hours, the much-celebrated breakthrough _ which
was intended to pave the way for Viktor Chernomyrdin's confirmation
as prime minister _ broke down, as the nation's political leaders
squabbled on national television.
</P>
<P>
   With Chernomyrdin's nomination scheduled to come before the
parliament on Monday and U.S. President Bill Clinton set to arrive
for a summit meeting the following day, Russian politics swung from
statesmanship to farce.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, set the tone by
declaring in a live debate on the NTV television network that he
had not authorized his party's representative to endorse the accord
in the talks early on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov said he did not trust Yeltsin to adhere to the accord
and then declared that he would order party members to vote against
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole faction will vote against Chernomyrdin,'' Zyuganov
said sternly. ``Mr. Chernomyrdin is an accomplice with Yeltsin in
the destruction of the past years.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought a tart rejoinder from Alexander Shokhin, the leader
of Chernomyrdin's parliamentary faction, who summoned up the
specter of a complete political and economic meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin warned ominously that the Communist refusal to approve
Chernomyrdin and back the accord could eventually lead to the
dissolution of the parliament, although the compromise agreement
was intended to preclude just that.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party,
punctuated the raucous debate by proclaiming that he was ashamed of
Russia's politicians and financial barons for their inability to
exercise a modicum of statesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that I am ashamed about everything I hear around
me now,'' said Yavlinsky, who then insisted on treating the nation
to a lengthy sermon on his own political platform and who said that
he would join Zyuganov in opposing Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Then the live debate over the future of Russia's economic and
political system was suspended so the network could present a
Sylvester Stallone action film. Live coverage of the debate resumed
in the evening, as the politicians took telephone questions from
skeptical viewers, who have watched helplessly in recent weeks as
Russia's currency has shrunk in value, prices have soared, Yeltsin
has fought off a chorus of demands that he resign and his previous
prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, was unceremoniously ousted.
</P>
<P>
   In the helter-skelter world of Russian politics, it was possible
that much of this was posturing and that with a few tweaks and
symbolic concessions, the delicately balanced compromise could be
put back together again.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Chernomyrdin's nomination is defeated in the parliament
on Monday, it might be nothing more than a prelude for more
negotiating over jobs and policy. It took three tries for
parliament to approve Kiriyenko in April.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's economy spinning out of control, however, the
nation does not appear to have time for politics as usual. Seen
through the filter of Sunday night's television debate, Russia's
political system seemed at times to be on the verge of a nervous
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the way the script was supposed to read. With its
currency plunging and its banks slipping into bankruptcy, Russia's
politicians had sought a truce that would enable them to try to put
the nation's house in order.
</P>
<P>
   After days of behind-the-scenes negotiations, they had hoped to
proclaim a kind of nonaggression pact that would guarantee a
measure of political stability over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the parliament would promise not to seek
Yeltsin's impeachment. He would agree, in turn, not to dissolve the
legislature. Chernomyrdin would become prime minister and Yeltsin
would restrain his proclivity for mass firings.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of power-sharing, the accord would have preserved much
of the president's prerogatives. He would have retained his right
to hire and fire the heads of Russia's so-called ``power
ministries,'' the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Ministry and the
Interior Ministry. That would enable the executive branch to
conduct foreign policy and prevent disorder at home.
</P>
<P>
   There would, however, have been some unspecified constitutional
changes. Within a month the parliament was to have drafted
constitutional amendments to shift some power from the executive to
legislative branch.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how this was to be done was unclear, and Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the nationalist agitator, complained Sunday night that
by the time amendments were written, Yeltsin would have his prime
minister in place and would be free to ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   A new commission was to be set up under the accord to monitor
state-owned television networks, which the Communists complain is
biased against them.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin himself suggested that he did not envision speedy
changes. He said in a recently taped interview that was shown on
television Sunday night that the process of amending the
constitution could take a year _ an eternity in Russian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to promote his candidacy, Chernomyrdin sought to portray
himself as the man to unify the nation during its moment of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruble is hanging on a thin thread,'' Chernomyrdin said.
``Time must not be lost. The country cannot function without a
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's words did little to hide the fact that he has not
presented anything remotely like a plan to extract the nation from
one of its worst financial crises since the collapse of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of 25,000 Russians conducted by the NTV network Sunday
indicated that 90 percent of them did not believe Chernomyrdin, the
once _ and, perhaps, future _ prime minister, would be able to end
the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   While Chernomyrdin was trying vainly to rally the nation, the
roof fell in.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Communists were in disarray as well. In
repudiating the accord, Zyuganov broke with Gennady Seleznyov, the
Communist speaker of parliament, who was among those who heralded
the accord earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the parliament's other left-wing parties _ the
Agrarian Party and People's Power _ said they were stunned by
Zyuganov's decision to turn against the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Ryzhkov, head of People's Power, said Zyuganov's move
was ``not only unexpected but also not understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Communists decided to torpedo this document then they
should not have pulled everyone into working on it,'' Ryzhkov
added. ``Many many hours deep into the night were spent on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, the tycoon who has been trying to orchestrate
Chernomyrdin's return to power, expressed confidence that
Chernomyrdin would ultimately be approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my forecast that Chernomyrdin will be prime minister
irrespective of the way the Duma is going to act,'' Berezovsky
said, referring to the Communist-dominated lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, however, also could not resist the temptation to
settle some political scores. He denounced Russia's leading free
market reformers _ Yegor Gaidar, a former prime minister;
Kiriyenko; and Anatoly Chubais, who was recently sacked by the
Yeltsin government as the representative to the International
Monetary Fund _ as villains who had carried out economic policy
``by Bolshevik methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, for his part, had been expected to endorse the
compromise accord formally on Monday. But after the Communist
flip-flop, it was no longer clear what he would do.
</P>
<P>
   Not all viewers waited through the movie to catch the resumption
of the petulant political debate. Tatyana Ptushkina, a 49-year-old
administrator of a construction company, said she was too appalled
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shameful,'' she said. ``No words can describe what I
just saw. I had to leave the room.''

<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ William Mayo has seen just about
everything from his wooden deck overlooking the oak- and
cypress-shaded Guadalupe River.
</P>
<P>
   Once, two young women in bikinis floated down the river on a
four-poster bed. More than one oversized recliner has bobbed past
carrying a giddy, beer-guzzling vacationer. There was the group
that built an entire wet bar on a raft, including the stools. And
the Swan Lady has been floating down the river for 10 years,
sitting astride a big white swan figure and announcing her presence
by yelling out, ``It's me, the Swan Lady!'' as she is carried along
the brisk current.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, we had some folks who'd set an entire Early American
sofa on four inner tubes and were floating down the river on it,''
said Mayo, who is the president of the county's Water Oriented
Recreation District, which oversees the recreational uses of the
river. ``I called up my friends downriver and told them to grab a
drink and get outside, because they're not going to believe this
one. Look, it's wonderful. It's inventive. It's weird. That kind of
fun, I can handle all day on the river.''
</P>
<P>
   But other kinds of fun are harder to stomach for some residents
along the Guadalupe around New Braunfels, a city of 27,000 people
30 miles northeast of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Davis, who has lived on the river since 1975, said: ``They
get enough drinking in them and they start taking off their bathing
suits, or trespassing on people's property to go to the bathroom,
or yelling obscenities at people. One neighbor went out in her back
yard and there were two couples out there, you know, making out, if
you know what I mean, and she hollered at them to get back in the
river. It can get pretty raunchy out here at times.''
</P>
<P>
   It has become something of a rite of passage for thousands of
people, many in their late teens and 20s, to spend part of their
scalding summer sitting on rafts or inner tubes and floating down
this bucolic waterway in the Texas Hill Country. On an average
summer weekend, 10,000 to 15,000 will float down the winding
22-mile stretch between Canyon Lake Dam and New Braunfels.
</P>
<P>
   On holiday weekends, the numbers explode. County officials
estimated that over this year's Fourth of July weekend 50,000
people floated along the Guadalupe. One Memorial Day weekend, Mayo
said, the number was 115,000.
</P>
<P>
   On such days, this part of the river, which is about 40 yards
wide, can be an almost endless procession of raucous beer-drinking
parties of people carting coolers, boom boxes and a deep desire to
act up.
</P>
<P>
   The battle to clean up the Guadalupe gathered steam after
residents were outraged by some particularly lewd behavior over the
Fourth of July weekend. Public meetings were convened to decide
what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   So the Sheriff's Department plans to triple the number of
officers on the river this Labor Day weekend, to 30 from the normal
10, and back them up with 30 more security officers hired just for
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents are demanding that the county ban all alcohol on
the river, a proposal that has upset the sensibilities of some
Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had public meetings with 350 homeowners, and I think
two-thirds of them are clearly in favor of banning alcohol,'' said
the county judge, Carter Casteel. ``The other third just say, look,
increased law enforcement can handle the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayo, who has lived on the Guadalupe for 16 years, said he did
not think banning alcohol was the answer and contended that such a
step would discourage many tourists from using the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply cannot enforce it on 22 miles of river,'' he said.
``This country already tried banning alcohol once, during
Prohibition. It wasn't very effective, and it won't work any better
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayo asserts that a big part of the problem is caused by
homeowners who stalk into the river and confront the rowdy tubers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting in these people's faces and telling them their
bathing suits are too skimpy or something, and it becomes a
psychological thing,'' he said. ``It makes people act up even more.
Let's face it, nobody buys property on the Guadalupe River
expecting Walden Pond.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Recreational rafting down the Guadalupe did not begin until the
Canyon Lake Dam was built in the early 1960s, turning the stretch
of river below the dam into a vista of cliffs and tree-thick banks.
</P>
<P>
   Problems on the river have been cyclical, Casteel said. In the
early 80s, cars blocked the narrow River Road, but a parking ban
solved that problem. By the early 90s the issue was litter, a
situation that has been somewhat improved by handing out plastic
mesh bags to tubers and banning glass, Styrofoam and polystyrene
containers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Casteel said, the locals will have to find a way to stop
rowdiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river is nothing but a reflection of our society, in some
regards,'' the judge said. ``You know, do your own thing, get drunk
and nobody's going to say anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow,'' she added, ``we've given that impression as a
society that it's OK to act like that. But you know what? I'm not
sure we can solve society's problems on the Guadalupe River.''

ANALYSIS: SIGNS SHOW `WINTEL' AXIS IS BEGINNING TO WOBBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Washington)  (ll) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Everywhere around Silicon Valley these days,
there seem to be signs that the so-called alliance between
Microsoft Windows and the Intel chip, the so-called Wintel duopoly,
may be unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   For almost two decades, the fortunes of Intel Corp. and of
Microsoft have been inextricably bound as the two companies have
come to dominate the hardware and software hemispheres of the
personal computer world.
</P>
<P>
   But recent disclosures from documents obtained by the Justice
Department and the states as part of their investigation into
Microsoft's business practices show the deep frustration felt by
Intel executives in the face of pressure applied by Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it is changes in computer technology and the explosive
market growth of new consumer electronics products that may be
working to drive an even deeper wedge between the two companies.
And if the two partners do become estranged, it may be Intel that
feels more pain.
</P>
<P>
   Two other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices and National
Semiconductor, have already been giving Intel fits in the growing
market for microprocessors for personal computers that sell for
less than $1,000. And increasingly, the computer industry's growth
is shifting more rapidly than had been expected toward consumer
electronics devices like cellular telephones and hand-held personal
digital assistants _ markets in which neither Microsoft nor Intel
wield much influence.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft's interest in cracking the consumer
electronics market is adding to the strains in the Wintel alliance,
as the software maker quietly but actively courts new would-be
competitors of Intel.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Microsoft signed a deal with a Japanese electronics
giant, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., to use Microsoft's
Windows CE as the software for a multimedia microprocessor chip
that Matsushita is preparing for consumer audio and video products
like television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Silicon Valley grapevine is full of chatter about
Transmeta Corp., a secretive Santa Clara start-up company that is
financed in part by a Microsoft co-founder and board member, Paul
Allen. Transmeta officials declined to comment, but one conjecture
is that the company is planning a new processor chip that would
capitalize on software like Microsoft's Windows CE or Sun
Microsystems' Java for use in new generations of hand-held
computers and phones.
</P>
<P>
   The twin threat of Matsushita and Transmeta seems representative
of a rapidly eroding influence for Intel, the world's largest
semiconductor manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that termites nibble away at the roots of
giant trees, and suddenly they fall over,'' said Richard Doherty,
president of Envisioneering, a computer-industry consulting firm in
Seaford, N.Y. ``This is a termite-level pincer move against
Intel.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if Intel has been standing still. The company has
chosen to replace its aging X86 microprocessor architecture _ the
286, 386, 486 and Pentium series of chips that have been the
company's cash cow for more than 15 years _ with a new family of
microprocessors that would be restricted to the very high end of
the computer industry's price range, where PC chip competitors may
be unwilling or unable to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The potential flaw in that strategy is that, increasingly, the
industry's newest technologies and market opportunities are
occurring among lower-priced devices in which Intel has
traditionally had little to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently did the chip maker seem to acknowledge this
handicap by scrambling to acquire the Digital Equipment Corp.'s
Strongarm microprocessor, a chip that has both low power
consumption and high performance and is intended for cellular
phones and hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Yu, who heads Intel's microprocessor business, said in an
interview recently that the company was aware of its potential
vulnerability but believed that the acquisition of the Strongarm
technology would protect it against attack from below.
</P>
<P>
   Still, widespread resignations by key members of the Strongarm
design team since Intel acquired the business in February indicate
that the Intel Strongarm effort may be in some disarray.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some analysts see a chance of Intel's eventually
finding itself stranded at the upper end of the computer market
while the industry heads in other directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC business is moving downstream while the cellular phone
makers are moving upstream,'' said Andrew Allison, a computer
industry consultant and publisher of RISC Management, an industry
newsletter. ``They're going to collide with a big bang.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And the new universe created by this big bang, some experts
predict, will be very different from the world according to Wintel.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent deals reached by the major makers of digital
cellular phones to add computer features to products, neither Intel
nor Microsoft has played a role. The European cellular phone
producers Nokia and Ericsson have teamed up with Psion, a British
maker of hand-held computers. In the United States, Motorola
recently acquired Philippe Kahn's Starfish Software and Qualcomm
has struck a deal with Palm Computing.
</P>
<P>
   Another big market opportunity could be for new types of
portable computing devices that may eventually replace many of
today's notebook, laptop and desktop PCs. And that is where
Transmeta may prove to be an interesting wild card.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1995 by David Ditzel, a former
computer architect at Sun, who as a graduate student at the
University of California at Berkeley helped pioneer a type of chip
technology called reduced instruction set computing, or RISC _ an
approach that Intel fended off by sharply increasing the
performance of its X86 chips.
</P>
<P>
   Ditzel is unusually tight-lipped about what he has planned and
about rumors that Transmeta's well-financed efforts may result in a
new hardware platform for Microsoft's software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have anything to say right now,'' he said.
``Others have tooted their horns too early in the past, and we're
trying to avoid that mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But word that Ditzel's chips may run Microsoft software has
shocked many a Silicon Valley techie, because Transmeta is now best
known as the company that employs Linus Torvalds. Torvalds is the
programmer who created the increasingly popular _ and free _ Linux
operating system, which has become an icon of hipness for the
technically adept who typically scorn all that Microsoft stands
for.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Transmeta would employ Torvalds to help
design a system that would benefit Microsoft is akin to heresy for
many engineers in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a little like hiring Luke Skywalker and then
turning the whole organization over to Darth Vader,'' a hardware
designer remarked.
</P>
<P>
   But for the longtime partners of the Wintel alliance, it could
simply be a further sign that the force may no longer be with them.

EX-LB ZAMANO MAY RETURN IN '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two years after nearly losing his leg, former UCLA
linebacker Anselmo Zamano is walking without a limp and considering
a return to football.
</P>
<P>
   He's not ready yet. But next year, the unthinkable could become
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the injury he had, he's done fantastically well,'' UCLA
surgeon Gerald Finerman said. ``If he's able to recover his speed
to where he can contribute, then we'll have to look (at getting
clearance for Zamano's return). He's much, much further along than
I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of a 1996 loss at Michigan, Zamano severed
the artery behind his right knee _ cutting circulation and forcing
emergency surgery to stabilize the leg. In addition, Zamano ripped
all ligaments and cartilage in the knee. The only thing keeping his
lower leg attached was skin.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Zamano wouldn't return, the Bruins placed him on the
medically retired list _ a means of keeping him on financial aid
without counting him against the 85-scholarship limit. For Zamano
to return, UCLA must petition the NCAA for reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did was in fair intent, so I don't think that will be
a problem,'' Finerman said of a possible petition. ``From where he
was, in need of vascular repair, we didn't think he could return.''
</P>
<P>
   Zamano, a Fontana native, is trying to temper his enthusiasm
while increasing his weight and running workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking great,'' Zamano said. ``But we'll have to see how
it responds to lateral movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, byes: The Bruins open Sept. 12 against Texas _ later
than any team in the Pacific-10 _ and play 11 consecutive weeks,
culminating with USC on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time since 1992 they do not have a bye. That
year, they also started on the 12th and ended Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're healthy it's good because you get in a rhythm and
go,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``If you have a lot of byes and start
early, it's a long season.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas tickets: UCLA expects a crowd of more than 70,000 for the
opener. The first 10,000 fans entering through tunnels on the east
(sun) side will receive a visor and bottle of water.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to arrive early: the Arroyo Seco is not a model
for traffic flow, as the Washington game (86,000 spectators) proved
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Parking is available outside the Arroyo at the Parsons
Engineering Building in Pasadena (shuttle service to the stadium)
and inside the Arroyo at the Brookside Golf Course.

NORTHWEST SAYS FINAL OFFER REALLY IS FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NORTHWEST-DAKOTA, moved in ``a'' category.)

 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Setting the stage for what could be a long
standoff, Northwest Airlines said Sunday that it would not alter
the dollar value of the final offer it made to its pilots before
they walked off the job on Saturday and grounded the carrier's
1,700 daily flights.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's management seems resolved to stand firm because, in
addition to its 6,200 pilots, the airline is embroiled in contract
negotiations with about 45,000 other union workers, including its
maintenance crews, customer-service agents and flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of this is once the union goes on strike, the
company can't really move from its last tabled position,'' said
Richard Hirst, chief labor negotiator for Northwest, which has its
headquarters near here. ``If we do, we will have to take strikes in
every other contract negotiation. We have to draw a line in the
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the pilots are equally determined to obtain an
``industry-leading contract'' from the company, the walkout could
last longer than the brief period many analysts had predicted
before the strike began. That is, unless President Clinton reverses
his position and decides to intervene, a move that Northwest would
clearly welcome.
</P>
<P>
   New negotiations have not been held since the pilots walked out
early Saturday morning and none are expected for a few days, though
that could change quickly. Each side says it is waiting for the
other to make a move.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has already canceled all its flights through the end
of Tuesday, and it will begin laying off some workers Monday. The
number of layoffs was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Laying off all its workers would save the company valuable cash,
but it also would delay getting the airline up and running for as
long as two weeks if the pilots returned. Northwest plans to keep
as many workers as it needs to be able to restart the airline
before Friday, in the hope that the White House will order the
pilots back to work in time for them to fly at the Labor Day
weekend, which is traditionally a busy travel period.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Department of Transportation, who monitored the
strike's impact all weekend and have been briefed by the federal
mediator supervising the negotiations, are scheduled to meet
officials at the White House on Monday. So far the disruption
caused by the strike appears to have been unexpectedly moderate,
diminishing the chance that Clinton will step in.
</P>
<P>
   A long strike raises the question of whether Northwest will lose
more money as a result of the walkout than it would have to pay the
pilots by simply agreeing to their demands. The differences between
the last two offers on the table before the walkout are $70 million
a year over the life of a three-year contract according to the
pilots, and about $100 million a year according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Northwest lost about $150 million in the month
before the strike began, as nervous travelers, aware of the
possibility, booked tickets on other airlines. The carrier will
lose about $25 million in revenue for each day it does not fly.
Analysts estimate that the net loss will be between $10 million and
$15 million a day if Northwest lays off most of its workers,
because the carrier will avoid outlays for its payroll, taxes and
fuel bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's $10 million a day, a seven-day strike pays for one
year of the contract,'' said Paul Omodt, the spokesman for the
pilots union.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pilots gave up $365 million in wages and other concessions
in 1993 to help save Northwest from bankruptcy. In return, they
received 14.4 million shares of stock and a seat on the airline's
board of directors. Since then, Northwest has registered four years
of record earnings, while the pilots' pay has not risen beyond
where it was before the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown increasingly embittered as negotiations dragged on
for two years, the pilots want a 15.5 percent pay increase, more
generous pension and retirement benefits and stronger job
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Hirst said that Northwest was willing to compromise on
noneconomic issues, such as the number of regional jets it can buy,
but that it could not afford to pay the pilots more than their
peers at the other major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally agree with management. While the airline
industry has had its best years recently, industry profit levels
are still below the average for industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   And Northwest, the United States' fourth-largest airline,
generates 30 percent of its annual revenue from Asia _ the largest
percentage of any domestic airline. As a result, since the Asian
economy began to founder last summer, Northwest has seen its
profits decline faster than its competitors'.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Northwest's stock, which has already fallen more than
50 percent from its peak in the spring, will probably not be hurt
too badly when trading begins Monday morning for the first time
since the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarter in which a strike takes place is very much like if
an airline cashed a plane and wrote off the loss,'' said Kevin
Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley. ``Its a one-time
event. Historically, it is a very good time to buy airline stocks,
because it is just a temporary phenomenon.''

 MARKETPLACE: LEARNING TO LIVE WITH A TECHNOLOGY CORRECTION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Corrections are never fun, but they can provide a kind of
clarity that is in short supply during sustained bull markets. For
buyers of technology stocks, which shared disproportionately in
both the long bull run and last week's market rout, now is a time
to reassess portfolios and adjust as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the market corrects, the important issue is not what you
owned going into the correction, but what your portfolio looks like
when it's over,'' said Roger B. McNamee, a principal in Integral
Capital Partners, a fund specializing in technology stocks. ``As
painful as it is to sell things when they're down, corrections like
this are the last opportunity to get the next up cycle right.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks are not homogenous, of course, and there are
different reasons for buying or selling different sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Some technology companies, notably chip makers and makers of
equipment for making chips like LSI Logic Corp. and Applied
Materials, but also some software companies like Adobe Systems. and
disk-drive producers like Seagate Technology, have reported
weakening of their fundamentals from the Asia crisis, and they had
significant declines in their stock prices before the broader
correction. They may not see earnings growth for some time to come,
and growth is what usually fuels technology investments. But
analysts say the correction has made some of these companies so
cheap that they are good values.
</P>
<P>
   One theory of technology investing holds that the dominant
players in any field will never look cheap by conventional measures
but will, over the long term, so far outperform competitors that
they are a compelling investment at nearly any price. Under that
theory, at Friday's closing prices, buyers can now buy stock in
Microsoft Corp. at $105.25, a 12 percent discount to its 52-week
high; Intel Corp. at $77, or 22 percent off the 52-week high, or
Dell Computer Corp. at $118.75, an 8 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet stocks, whose sky-high multiples of price to often
nonexistent earnings make Microsoft look cheap, are still expensive
by any conventional measure. But major names like Yahoo, which
closed on Friday at $83.0625, down nearly 20 percent from its
52-week high, and Amazon.com, at $105.8906, down 27 percent, are at
least cheaper than they were before. Many technology investors want
to own them, although many would also like to see a little more
price correction in the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to own Internet stocks and would really like
to own them at one-third the price,'' McNamee said.
</P>
<P>
   He has instead been buying shares in companies that make
software for corporate operations, selling underperformers to buy
market leaders like Peoplesoft Inc., at $27.25, less than half its
52-week high; Siebel Systems, now more than a third off at $22.50;
I2 Technologies Inc., at $16, down 62 percent, and Citrix Systems,
at $63.50, off 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an environment where the premium you pay for owning
the best companies has narrowed dramatically,'' McNamee said.
</P>
<P>
   James Davidson, a managing director at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, said
the correction could serve to separate momentum investors, who
trade stocks based solely on market movement, from long-term
investors, who buy based on fundamentals. Last week's selloff
presents an opportunity to buy established franchise holders and
potential growth leaders at substantial discounts, if investors are
prepared to wait for a return, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can go wrong buying Microsoft, Cisco,
Solectron or Dell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among newer market leaders, he likes Siebel Systems, which makes
sales-force automation software; Rambus, a producer of fast memory
chips, and Advanced Risc Machines, which makes chips for portable
computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to make money in the next few days?'' he said.
``Maybe not. But over the next three to six months, no question.
It's not a question of whether these companies are good buys, just
when.''
</P>

<P>
   Although Wall Street continued bidding up technology stocks
through July 20, when the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index
peaked, many companies had started to foretell earnings shortfalls
this year when they began to recognize the scale of the Asian
economic crisis and its impact on sales. Now, though, so many
companies have cautioned investors about diminished expectations,
and enough analysts have reduced estimates going forward, that some
technology buyers suspect they may see earnings surprises on the
upside in the third and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock
Letter, said he spent last Thursday and Friday buying stocks among
fallen semiconductor and software companies, including Applied
Materials, LSI Logic and Adobe, which were all down significantly
from their 52-week highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't get prices like that on these quality companies
that often,'' Murphy said. ``Fundamental unit demand for technology
products is still double-digit, and I just don't see that anywhere
else in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Murphy said, many technology stocks that trade at
high multiples to earnings or revenues have not dropped far enough
to signal the end of the correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this is over in the technology sector you've got to
take down Microsoft and Dell,'' he said. ``The Internet stocks
still have a long way to go. That's the purpose of a correction, to
flush this stuff out.''
</P>
<P>
   John T. Rossi, a managing director with BancAmerica Robertson
Stephens, said the trading system on Nasdaq, where most technology
stocks are listed, had tended to accelerate falling prices for the
group. In Nasdaq trading, a transaction does not occur until a
seller's asking price finds a matching bid by a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In times of selloffs, bids tend to disappear,'' Rossi said.
``It's almost impossible to sell without a huge discount. Everyone
gets skittish at the same time, so nobody knows how bad it is in a
particular stock.''
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of a recovery in the personal computer industry
next year, when Microsoft ships the new version of its Windows NT
software for the corporate-network market, Rossi said, it could be
prudent now to buy stocks in the makers of semiconductors, disk
drives and software, naming Intel, Seagate, Micron Technology,
Autodesk and Adobe.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that Microsoft shares lost half their value in the
crash of October 1987, he said, ``Buying some of these technology
stocks now, when it's nearly impossible to make the body and soul
do it, is not a bad policy.''

BAY STATE DROPS OUT OF TOBACCO PACT TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Frustrated with what he calls foot-dragging by the
tobacco industry, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger has pulled out
of negotiations between nine states and cigarette makers trying to
reach an out-of-court national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   After completing another round of talks in New York on Friday,
Harshbarger said he decided to walk away and focus instead on
winning a potential multibillion-dollar settlement for
Massachusetts in state court. He is expected to announce today that
he has ordered his tobacco litigation team from the table and
directed it to focus on the state's civil suit in state Superior
Court that is seeking billions of dollars for Medicaid costs to
treat smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations that began last month have stalled, as the
cigarette makers, apparently emboldened by recent legal and
political victories, backed off earlier commitments to fund efforts
to curb teenage smoking and reduce advertising and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' withdrawal is significant because Harshbarger's
court case is considered among the strongest of those set for
trial. The industry, which has not lost a trial verdict after
scores of cases involving health care costs, is particularly
concerned that it not suffer a court setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to me that the industry is not serious about those
issues,'' Harshbarger said. ``So we are walking away and focusing
solely at beating them on trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger said that the state, if successful, would win a huge
settlement at trial and that the only purpose of negotiating with
the industry was to extract commitments on the public health
initiatives and antismoking measures. In an earlier national
settlement deal that fell through, Massachusetts stood to get $7.3
billion over 25 years in recovered medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can win money by winning our case,'' Harshbarger said.
``The purpose of pursuing negotiations has always been to secure
lasting protections for children and the public health.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco's tougher negotiating style is directly related to
recent developments in the national tobacco wars. In the last
several months, the industry has won significant legal battles and
has scored a political victory in its effort to kill what it
considered a damaging national agreement in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   With those developments, the manufacturers have been less
willing to concede on some major points they had agreed to
incorporate in the national settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, two of the nation's large tobacco companies,
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
decided to pull out of the negotiations, which resumed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with Harshbarger's decision say he was
particularly upset the industry had backed off a plan that it would
pay financial penalties against any failure to reduce youth smoking
rates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to people close to the talks, the
cigarette makers are refusing to drop their opposition to President
Clinton's efforts to bring cigarettes under Food and Drug
Administration regulation. An appeals court in Virginia this month
ruled against the presidential directive.
</P>
<P>
   The firms also would not agree to drop a suit against
Massachusetts' tobacco ingredient disclosure law, the first such
law in the nation. A federal judge has put a hold on the state's
implementation of the statute, known as the Tolman Law.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's decision to walk away from the negotiations comes
after six weeks in which attorneys general from nine states and the
cigarette makers have been meeting to rescue last year's proposed
national agreement in which the industry would have paid $368.5
billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   That deal, struck in June 1997 and which would have included
broad protection for the industry against liability suits,
collapsed two months ago when Congress failed to act on it. In
mid-July, states such as Massachusetts with pending civil suits
began direct talks with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   According to those familiar with the New York negotiations, the
industry offered between $180 billion and $200 billion to be split
among 46 states. The payment would be financed through a cigarette
increase of 35 cents a pack.
</P>
<P>
   The current negotiations also coincide with Harshbarger's
campaign to win the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Some
antismoking leaders have feared that Harshbarger, hoping to boost
his candidacy, would cut a deal that excludes some of the major
antismoking initiatives in order to announce a multibillion-dollar
windfall for Massachusetts in the middle of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Four states _ Mississippi, Minnesota, Texas, and Florida _ have
settled their lawsuits, and the industry paid a total of nearly $37
billion. But since then, the industry has won some key court
rulings that have weakened some of the suits and raised doubts on
their outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Massachusetts suit is considered to have the best
chance of any to create serious concern among the manufacturers. It
is being argued in Middlesex Superior Court, where the attorney
general has won favorable rulings in the case from Judge Martha B.
Sosman. It is currently scheduled for trial in February.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the industry is likely to face a hostile
environment in Massachusetts, a leader in the national antismoking
movement.
</P>
<P>
   A jury pool from Middlesex County, which has a generally upscale
population, is likely to be less sympathetic than most to tobacco
firms, legal analysts say. Those potential jurors also have been
subjected to years of a state-financed multimillion-dollar
antitobacco media blitz, some of it aimed directly at the
companies' business and marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with those prospects, some analysts expect the industry to
try to cut a separate out-of-court settlement with Harshbarger's
office to avoid what would be a major legal setback if it were to
lose at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing negotiations were led by the attorney general of
Washington state, Christine Gregoire, whose suit against the
industry is next to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the table were representatives from attorneys general
from Colorado, New York, California, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, and North Dakota. Harshbarger said he does not fault
the other states to continue the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleagues think they are doing what they think is best,''
Harshbarger said. ``Each state has to make its own decision based
on its case and its own interests.''

ANALYSIS: IN RUSSIA, WILL LACK OF POLITICAL CONSENSUS LEAD TO
PARALYSIS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-RDP, RUSSIA-U.S.) 
(sw) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Judging by how the grand and improbable alliance
between Russia's pro-capitalist leadership and its Communist
critics exploded Sunday evening _ on television, spectacularly, in
a crossfire of accusations and threats _ one might think these
people hadn't a clue about what to do with their country.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin's government and the Communists who
pretty much run parliament have plenty of ideas for keeping the
country from sliding into insolvency, social chaos and Third World
status. The problem is that their ideas are diametrically opposed.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to conduct government by consensus if there is no
consensus. And seldom, it seems, have two political bedmates been
more incompatible than these two.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the mismatch going to disappear, even if global pressure
in the form of President Clinton, who arrives on Tuesday, persuades
the two sides to glue together some sort of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners have no right to snicker. A glance at the last six
years of divided government in the United States shows that
democracy in action is not an especially appetizing sight.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that most Western democracies accept
the rule of law and the division of powers among executives,
legislators and courts. Despite huge strides, Russia is still a
place where rumors of coups are taken seriously and where the
popularity of a leader _ or his unpopularity _ affects not only his
power but his legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a few contradictions: Yeltsin and his acting prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, have concluded that Russia's
salvation hinges on adoption of Western market capitalism, even if
Russified by a coterie of tycoons. The Communist Party, led by the
legislator Gennady Zyuganov, wants to renationalize major
industries and the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has pledged to do what it takes to persuade the
West's line-of-credit officer, the International Monetary Fund, to
continue doling out portions of a $22.6 billion loan package agreed
to last month. Zyuganov said on Sunday that he wanted the terms of
the package rewritten to ease its bite on ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin talks of a Europeanized Russia. Zyuganov dreams of
Soviet days gone by, and parliament's nationalist bloc still fondly
recalls the czars.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov wants Yeltsin gone and substantial power shifted to
parliament via a new constitution. Whatever Chernomyrdin thinks,
Yeltsin is still president, and he is dragging his feet on those
questions. That may have been the clincher that led Zyuganov to
reject so publicly the power-sharing agreement on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative _ approval and fulfillment of the accord _ might
have turned out in some ways to be as strange as the scene that
unfolded on television Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   It is surprisingly easy to forget, seven years into democratic
Russia, that Yeltsin became president by ousting a Communist system
that he has repeatedly called cruel and despicable. For his part,
Zyuganov has long been organizing a nationwide strike against
Yeltsin's government scheduled for Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   If that mongoose-and-cobra alliance had been arranged, the new
government would have melded Zyuganov's Communists with a president
backed by free-market theorists and a prime minister whose most
ardent supporter is Boris Berezovsky, a capitalist in the bloodless
image of Commodore Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians, though disillusioned, still hope for a democratic
future. But a hard core of 25 percent or so would still support a
Communist system of government, and an unknown number of others
look for an autocrat to lead them out of troubled times.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that makes Russia's fiscal collapse so
devastating is that it has laid bare that absence of consensus
about where Russia should be going next.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was re-elected in 1996 with 53.8 percent of the vote but
has seen his popularity go into precipitous decline. Zyuganov, who
lost with 40.3 percent of the vote, wants not only a change in
economic policy but a rewrite of the constitution as well.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he will get it is now questionable. Sunday night's
breakdown seems to mean that the parliament will vote to reject
Chernomyrdin's appointment when it meets on Monday. If no
compromise is reached, Yeltsin could dissolve the parliament and
call for new elections, hoping to win a few new supporters to his
side.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Russia remains oarless at a point when almost
everyone agrees that there is no time to waste. Chernomyrdin said
on Sunday that he knows where to begin to resolve the crisis, but
that ``time must not be lost. The country cannot function without a
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksander Lebed, the retired Army general, once and future
presidential candidate and leading prospect in some eyes to become
Russia's next autocrat, is even more blunt. ''The choice is
simple,'' he said on Sunday, ``the confirmation of the prime
minister, formation of a new team of energetic people and the
presentation of a program for leading Russia out of crisis _ or a
total break-up.''

EVENTS OVERTAKE CLINTON-YELTSIN SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  WASHINGTON _ In what is shaping up to be a bizarre exercise
in diplomacy, President Clinton's scheduled summit with Russian
President Boris N. Yeltsin in Moscow this week could underscore
their political weaknesses rather than buff their images.
</P>
<P>
   When the two-day summit was planned earlier this summer,
Clinton's advisers saw it as an opportunity for the president to
boost Russia's economic reform efforts and address a range of
global issues, from stockpiles of Russia's ``loose nukes'' to
ethnic conflict in Kosovo, as well as a temporary escape from his
own domestic troubles. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But events have so overtaken that agenda that the value of the
trip has been called into question by critics. For example, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich called the upcoming trip imprudent and
questioned the value of any agreements made by two such politically
damaged leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidents remained in seclusion much of last week _
Clinton on Martha's Vineyard and Yeltsin at his suburban dacha.
Clinton emerged in Worcester on Thursday in embarrassed silence
about the Oval Office sex scandal, while Yeltsin appeared on
television Friday to quash rumors that he would resign because of
his inability to cope with his country's economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid this summit is going to be a terrible
embarrassment,'' said David Kramer, associate director of Russian
and European issues at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in
Washington. ``It's about the worst time for Clinton to go. He is
landing in a country in absolute turmoil ... meeting with leaders
who are increasingly irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming summit will be nothing like the tightly
orchestrated Cold War-era events where speeches were scripted,
agreements were struck months in advance, and the two nations were
the unquestioned global superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   This time, expectations for the summit became less clear as
political and economic events in Russia spiraled out of control.
``The conditions for the summit are hollow and it will be nothing
more than a blip,'' said Morton Abramowitz, a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin appears to be president without portfolio, having
dissolved his Cabinet and handed over some powers last week to his
newly appointed prime minister, Victor S. Chernomyrdin, whom
Yeltsin reinstalled after dismissing him as a reformer only five
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment followed Yeltsin's decision last week to devalue
the ruble and delay foreign debt repayments. Speculation that the
economy was collapsing gained ground as the ruble went into free
fall and foreign exchange was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has yet to be confirmed by the Russian parliament.
His confirmation is expected, but confidence in his ability to
implement the kind of economic and tax measures demanded by the
International Monetary Fund has been weakened by his lethargic
record, the firing of leading reformers last week, and the
likelihood that he will cut power-sharing deals with both the
Communist party and the financial and industrial elite.
</P>
<P>
   At a press briefing Friday, the Clinton administration attempted
to characterize the trip as a necessary show of support for Russia
in its time of crisis, as well as an opportunity to push for reform
at a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   ``In public and private, the president intends to reinforce the
importance to Russians and the world of holding fast to a
democratic path and economic reform in the face of new
challenges,'' said Samuel R. Berger, the president's national
security adviser. ``The Russian people should know that
particularly in times of difficulty, the US will not turn away.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is likely to press for more aid as well as to push for
the IMF to release another $4.3 billion infusion in September, but
national economic adviser Gene Sperling made it clear the
administration will tie all monetary support to measurable economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say Russia has already wasted most of the first
installment of a $4.5 billion loan, part of a United States-backed
international debt rescue package worth $22.6 billion _ in part
because Yeltsin plunged ahead with reforms without a legal
structure in place.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry that the summit could simply underline the
weakness of both presidents and highlight what some analysts have
long criticized as Clinton's short-sighted, personality-driven
approach to Russian policy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would do well to use the event to begin to ``change the
American policy of obsessive support for Yeltsin,'' said Dimitri K.
Simes, president of the Nixon Center, a think tank in Washington.
Berger noted that Clinton would be meeting with a range of regional
and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, fighting for his political life, is unlikely to focus
on crucial security and arms control issues. US officials, however,
insisted the president would press ahead by pushing for
ratification of Start 2, the nuclear arms control agreement that
would reduce deployed nuclear weapons by 60 percent, and the
beginning of Start 3 talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are the entire future of nuclear arms reduction,''
said Matthew Bunn, a Harvard University nuclear weapons specialist.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one crucial issue likely to end up on the back
burner. Others include:
</P>
<P>
   _Clamping down on Russia's nuclear exports to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   _Coordinating a response to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   _Coping with Kosovo's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   _Finding jobs for thousands of unemployed nuclear scientists as
well as a safe market for Russia's stockpile of uranium and
plutonium
</P>
<P>
   _Rebuilding Russia's crumbling early warning system for nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists who often advise the White House on policy have for
months warned that a summit would be too risky until Russia's
economic situation resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But canceling the summit at this point would further destabilize
Russia, said Senator John F. Kerry, who sits on the Foreign
Relations Committee. The Massachusetts Democrat said the summit
could at least spotlight crucial security and arms control issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extraordinarily important for us to be dealing with
Russia as a critical player,'' Kerry said. ``It would be
dramatically worse not to put something together, as perilous as
the situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bracing for the political fallout, analysts already are
developing worst case scenarios, including one that sees the summit
closing as a public relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shudder at the thought of a joint press conference,'' said
the Carnegie Endowment's Kramer. ``It will be the media's first
opportunity to ask about Monica Lewinsky, and to ask whether
Clinton puts his support behind Yeltsin, who is pretty much
irrelevant now.''

HURRICANE POINTS TO LOSING BATTLE AGAINST BEACH EROSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH TOPSAIL BEACH, N.C. _ In the aftermath of Hurricane
Bonnie, officials looking across the flat stretches of beach that
once held sand dunes can see that they may be fighting a losing
battle against erosion.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane, which pummeled the North Carolina coastline last
week, took with it about 60 percent of the dune line along North
Topsail Beach, the northernmost stretch of Topsail Island north of
Wilmington. Erosion has chipped away at the 25-mile-long barrier
island, and in a few places, its width has been whittled to about
150 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of parts of the dune line after large storms
is not surprising, said Orrin Pilkey, a geologist at Duke
University in Durham.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most dangerous island community in North Carolina
and one of the most dangerous along the East Coast,'' Pilkey said.
``The dunes are all artificial and extremely fragile, and, all in
all, it's an island community that should not have been developed
if common sense were to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The island, once undeveloped and a haven for surf fishermen, has
grown rapidly in the last few years as developers have built
condominiums and resorts. Even Hurricanes Fran and Bertha two years
ago, which knocked down first and second rows of houses in places
on the beach, did not deter development.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has taken time for homeowners to rebuild and for
businesses to recoup losses, new houses replacing those damaged by
the storms are scattered on the island. The hurricanes also took
much of what remained of the island's maritime forests, which help
slow erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not seen a hurricane have a big impact on development
just other than to bring in bigger and better buildings,'' Pilkey
said. ``That's really fundamentally the impact these things have.
It's really an urban renewal project.''
</P>
<P>
   But hurricanes, development and the natural give and take of the
tide have taken their toll on the dunes. While the southern end has
maintained a larger natural berm, other parts of the island's dune
system have had to be rebuilt. Sand from the island has repeatedly
been bulldozed into 10-foot high piles, which offer some protection
from the tides, but are not as stable as natural dunes and have to
be replaced after storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be willing to bet they lost 120 feet in the last 20
years,'' said Bill Cleary, a professor of geology at the Center for
Marine Science Research at the University of North Carolina at
Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hammond, the town manager of North Topsail Beach, said the
cost of replacing the dunes was justified if it saved houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dunes that had the vegetation seem to have held up
better,'' Hammond said. ``The ones with the limited vegetation
didn't do as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilkey said Topsail Island was never intended to accommodate
development.
</P>
<P>
   The constant chipping away of sand is proof that the island is
doing what nature intends, he said. The island has a small natural
sand supply and is at a stage where it is beginning what he calls
true migration. Barrier islands such as Topsail become thin from
erosion and begin over washing, which moves sand into the sounds
that separate them from the mainland. The over washing widens the
side closest to the mainland while the opposite side erodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That translates into island moving,'' Pilkey said. ``This is
an island that wants to migrate.''
</P>
<P>
   But homeowners do not like island migration. For several years,
the town has used bulldozers to pile up the sand, creating an
artificial dune system.
</P>
<P>
   After Hurricane Fran, the Federal Emergency Management Agency
reimbursed North Topsail Beach $1.6 million of the $2 million cost
of creating an emergency berm, by bulldozing sand displaced by
storms, said Jay Eaker, an agency spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although these efforts will cause the island to migrate more
slowly than it would naturally, Pilkey said, the process is
inevitable. If hurricane activity increases as predicted _ and
brings them to the North Carolina coastline with the regularity of
the 1950's, when the state was nicknamed Hurricane Alley _ it could
work against their best efforts to slow the process.

EVENTS OVERTAKE CLINTON-YELTSIN SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  WASHINGTON _ In what is shaping up to be a bizarre exercise
in diplomacy, President Clinton's scheduled summit with Russian
President Boris N. Yeltsin in Moscow this week could underscore
their political weaknesses rather than buff their images.
</P>
<P>
   When the two-day summit was planned earlier this summer,
Clinton's advisers saw it as an opportunity for the president to
boost Russia's economic reform efforts and address a range of
global issues, from stockpiles of Russia's ``loose nukes'' to
ethnic conflict in Kosovo, as well as a temporary escape from his
own domestic troubles. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But events have so overtaken that agenda that the value of the
trip has been called into question by critics. For example, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich called the upcoming trip imprudent and
questioned the value of any agreements made by two such politically
damaged leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidents remained in seclusion much of last week _
Clinton on Martha's Vineyard and Yeltsin at his suburban dacha.
Clinton emerged in Worcester on Thursday in embarrassed silence
about the Oval Office sex scandal, while Yeltsin appeared on
television Friday to quash rumors that he would resign because of
his inability to cope with his country's economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid this summit is going to be a terrible
embarrassment,'' said David Kramer, associate director of Russian
and European issues at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in
Washington. ``It's about the worst time for Clinton to go. He is
landing in a country in absolute turmoil ... meeting with leaders
who are increasingly irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming summit will be nothing like the tightly
orchestrated Cold War-era events where speeches were scripted,
agreements were struck months in advance, and the two nations were
the unquestioned global superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   This time, expectations for the summit became less clear as
political and economic events in Russia spiraled out of control.
``The conditions for the summit are hollow and it will be nothing
more than a blip,'' said Morton Abramowitz, a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin appears to be president without portfolio, having
dissolved his Cabinet and handed over some powers last week to his
newly appointed prime minister, Victor S. Chernomyrdin, whom
Yeltsin reinstalled after dismissing him as a reformer only five

SOFTWARE ENGINEER TESTS LAW ON ENCRYPTION CODE

   Charles Booher was hardly surprised last month when two agents
from the Department of Commerce knocked on his door in Silicon
Valley and handed him a federal subpoena. He had been expecting it
ever since he first made his data-encryption program available on
the Internet in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department is investigating whether Booher's
software, which is called Secure Office and is intended to protect
the privacy of computer files by scrambling the data, violates U.S.
export law. The rules require Americans who distribute encryption
software internationally to obtain an export license; making
software available on the Internet is considered international
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Booher acknowledges that few people have downloaded the software
from his Web site at www.filesafety.com. But achieving a large
number of users was not his goal.
</P>
<P>
   Booher, a software engineer at Phase Metrics Corp. in Fremont,
Calif., who wrote the encryption program in his spare time, said he
posted the program to challenge the export rules.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption has been a hotly debated issue in Washington lately,
with the Commerce Department, the FBI and other agencies arguing
that powerful data-scrambling programs put high-technology
espionage tools in the hands of criminals, spies and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But Booher is among the software developers who contend that
their right to write encryption code is protected by the First
Amendment and that the technology is already easily available
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not whether this stuff is going to exist,''
Booher said, ``but who will develop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Monika Wasiewicz, the Commerce Department agent in charge of the
case, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Booher was supposed to testify to a federal grand jury in San
Jose, Calif., last week, but the session was canceled because too
few jurors showed up. Booher's testimony is supposed to be
rescheduled for this week.

   Web Company Rides Initial-Offering Wave
</P>
<P>
   For any curious observer of the business world who sits before
Mark Cuban, president of Broadcast.com in Dallas, the most pressing
question is not the state of media on the Internet or the future
direction of his company, which transmits audio and video
programming over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The question is probably: What was going through his mind on
July 16 as he watched the stock price of his company shoot from $18
to $74 before settling at $62.75, the best first day for an initial
public offering in history?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, this is really, really cool,'' he remembers
thinking as he sat in the New York offices of Nasdaq and watched
the numbers ticking higher and higher. By the end of that first
day, the company's valuation exceeded $1 billion, and his personal
net worth _ on paper, at least _ rose to $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been married, but I guess that feeling I had that
day was similar to what a groom would feel at the altar,'' Cuban
said. ``I've never been the No. 1 draft pick for the NFL or NBA,
either. Actually, that's probably even closer to the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, 40, was making the rounds in New York last week with his
business partner, Todd Wagner, 38, after the so-called quiet period
when principals in newly public companies are not permitted to
publicly discuss the stock.
</P>
<P>
   It was an interesting week to be touring Wall Street. By the end
of last week's widespread market carnage, shares of Broadcast.com
were trading at $44.375, down $6.625 on Friday alone. That was
still well above the company's offering price but off more than 29
percent from its first-day close.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he remained inspired by his vision of the mythic
``94-year-old lady'' who may have bought shares at $74. ``I want to
make her look like a financial genius,'' he said.

 WITH RUTHIAN CLOUT, SOSA TIES McGWIRE AT 54  
(nk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Sammy Sosa's 54th was a long one. Cubs fans Mike and
Karen Bressler were settling into the last row at Coors Field when
the ball sailed over their heads like a plane taking off for
Chicago. The line drive bounced off the scoreboard girders about
four stories above the field, producing a rugby scrum in search of
a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy had just gotten his hot dogs and fries and everybody
ran him over,'' said Mike Bressler, 41, who moved to Denver from
Wheaton, Ill. ``There were hot dogs everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the pile emerged a bruised but glorious T.J. Salvador of
Ft. Collins, Colo., with a Cubs souvenir to match his Cubs shirt.
He offered the ball to Sosa after the game, but the slugger let the
fan keep it.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruthian clout, estimated at 482 feet, was the longest home
run of the 171 hit so far this year at Coors Field. And it tied the
Chicago Cubs right fielder with St. Louis' Mark McGwire, and left
both sluggers eight homers from breaking a record that is older
than they are: Roger Maris' 61 home runs in 1961. McGwire was born
in 1963, Sosa in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   In his first-inning at bat, Sosa missed a fastball to fall
behind 1-2 in the count. He waited for right-hander Darryl Kile's
next pitch, a slider that stayed over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see where it landed,'' Sosa said. ``I'm just trying
to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-run home run drew a devotional ovation from the home
crowd of 48,255, and respect from the Rockies players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It silenced the dugout,'' said Rockies Manager Don Baylor.
``No ballpark's going to hold that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The home crowd was disappointed in the finish, a 4-3 Cubs'
victory, but also because Sosa hit only one home run. He popped out
in the third, struck out swinging in the fifth and walked in the
eighth, only to be thrown out trying to steal second.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Sosa declined to assume the role of favorite to
pass Maris, repeating his mantra: ``This is the Mark McGwire show.
If I get it first, God bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa could cool off and still break the record with ease. He
needs a home run in about one out of three remaining games. In the
past three months he has hit better than one home run in every two
games (45 home runs in 84 games, beginning with two home runs on
May 25). In August he has stepped up the pace, hitting eight homers
in his past 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa each need just two more homers to tie the
National League record, which is also the Cubs' record, 56, set by
Hack Wilson in 1930. In 123 years of National League games, only
Wilson has hit more than 54 home runs. Ralph Kiner of Pittsburgh
also had 54, in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sosa's second home run in six games this year in
Colorado, where home runs are plentiful. The Cubs and Rockies
splattered 23 home runs and 164 hits in six games there. Other
homers Sunday came from Gary Gaetti (his 13th) and Jose Hernandez
(21) of the Cubs, and Larry Walker (20) of the Rockies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Cubs Manager Jim Riggleman, the best part of Sunday's game
was pitching, despite the homer onslaught. Kevin Tapani, now 16-7,
gave up only two runs in seven innings. Cubs pitchers had an ERA of
6.91 in the previous 11 games. Sunday, the Cubs got outs from
left-handers Felix Heredia and Terry Mulholland. Then Rod Beck
pitched through another harrowing ninth inning, walking two before
putting away his 39th save. Kile (10-15) was the loser.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Cubs a half game behind the Mets in the
wild-card race, before New York played the Dodgers in Los Angeles
on Sunday night, and two games ahead of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs clubhouse was all smiles as the players watched the
Giants lose to the Phillies. The Cubs now are 76-61. Last year at
this point they were 55-82.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were packing their bats for Wrigley Field, where on
Monday night Kerry Woods will pitch against Cincinnati's Brett
Tomko, who surrendered a home run to Sosa just last week. They
leave town with a 5-1 record at Coors Field, where last year they
failed to win a game.

   HARBIN, China _ It had been a bad year for the People's
Liberation Army. First, it faced accusations in the United States
that it was involved in a plot to direct contributions to the
Democratic Party in exchange for easier access to American
satellite technology. Then, in July, President Jiang Zemin
subjected the army to an unprecedented public scolding, charging it
with smuggling and ordering its generals to sell off their many
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the floods, offering the promise of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of thousands of soldiers as the backbone of the
nation's defense, this summer's record breaking floods have
provided the scandal-prone PLA with both a challenging battle _ and
a golden opportunity for image burnishing.
</P>
<P>
   At Harbin's river-front Stalin Park, 3,000 soldiers have spent
the last two weeks shoring up a mile-long stretch along the Songhua
River, including a crucial but tenuous section of dike that
protects this major industrial city in China's far northeast. A few
hundred feet away, citizens have been gathering at the park gates
to watch the dike-building effort, conducted in full public view
with an almost theatrical flare.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers sing songs about courage as they march across the
wide plaza to the river. Their green fatigues, bright orange life
jackets and brilliant red flags stand out against the white wall of
sandbags reinforcing the dike.
</P>
<P>
   Every night, all over China, television news shows feature
images of heroic soldiers _ evacuating children, hefting sandbags
onto a crumbling dike, forming a human chain chest-deep in the
water to hold a river at bay.
</P>
<P>
   This week many newspapers carried features on Guo Jiancheng, a
young officer who gave his life vest to a soldier who could not
swim, and was himself then swept away.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 278,000 soldiers fighting floods along the Yangtze
River in central China _ the biggest mobilization of military
personnel in that area since the Communists took power in 1949 _
and another 100,000 in the northeast, mostly along the Songhua and
Nen rivers here in Heilongjiang province. It is a return to the
grassroots for an organization that in recent years has seemed less
a military fighting force and more a big business.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers have been living in the park since Aug. 16, when
their first risky task was to build up the original dike, which was
on the verge of being submerged, with sandbags. They finished the
job in the nick of time: On Aug. 23 the river rose more than seven
feet above flood level, and since then the original dike has been
entirely under water.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers also built two back-up dikes several feet inland
from the original structure.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with water levels holding steady, the river's swift
murky waters frequently squeeze through. Col. Yu Zhongsheng said
his soldiers had plugged 50 to 70 leaks since they arrived. The
swollen river was exerting so much pressure on these man-made
walls, he said, that water inevitably seeped through.
</P>
<P>
   A large pump pulled water back into the river from a muddy pool
between the first and second dikes. Women in white coats used
plastic jugs to scoop up water that has strayed inside the dikes
and returned it to the river.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic effort has not been lost on the people of Harbin,
where life in the city has remained fairly normal throughout the
floods. After work, many stop by the barricade at the park's main
entrance to take in the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, we are very grateful to the soldiers because we know
how exhausted they must be by now,'' said Han Xue, a 24-year-old
shop assistant who had paused at the barricade with her girlfriend
during an evening stroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some thing have recently hurt the image of the PLA and this
has definitely improved it,'' said Sun Jian, a college student.
``In peacetime they have nothing to do. Now they've had a chance to
show their true colors.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Behind the barricade, Colonel Yu and his troops had settled in,
transforming the park into a mini-military camp with tents for
sleeping, eating, clinics, communications stations and even
entertainment. They expected to be camped here for another few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have praised the army on television and
military leaders have publicly sung the troops' praises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officers have played a commanding role and set examples for
their subordinates on the front line,'' said Gen. Ma Qukuan this
week in Beijing. ``They have displayed the revolutionary spirit of
fearing neither hardship nor death.''
</P>
<P>
   And, at least here in Harbin, which has been saved by the
soldiers, the desired message has been absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, this is a People's Army and this is their job,''
said Li Xin, a college student. ``On the other, it reminds us that
only a small part of the army is involved in corruption.''

MORGAN STANLEY WILL OFFER RESEARCH TO TRADERS ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has decided to sell access
to research by its top-ranked team of stock analysts to customers
of its Internet service, Discover Brokerage Direct.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which the company plans to announce this week, will be
the first time that any of the major brokerage firms has given
same-day access to research to customers who do not pay full
commissions for their stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   The price difference for such trades can be enormous. Discover
Brokerage will charge $14.95 for a trade that Morgan Stanley's
full-service brokers might charge as much as $3,600 to make.
</P>
<P>
   Discover Brokerage, which is ninth in the online brokerage race,
wants to win business by emphasizing the resources of its larger
parent. Morgan Stanley's research team was rated second to Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. in the annual poll of big customers by Institutional
Investor magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The online discount service will not offer the full range of
search that is available to Morgan Stanley's full-service
customers.
</P>
<P>
   For $19.95 a month, Discover Brokerage customers can specify up
to 20 companies they want to follow. They will receive an e-mail
notification within about an hour of the time the firm has changed
its recommendation about those companies' stocks or has published a
new report. They can also read summaries of the new reports online.
</P>
<P>
   Customers also have the option to follow 40 companies for $34.95
a month. Initially, Discover will offer online research for 400
companies but it plans to increase that to about 1,000 companies by
the end of the year. Customers can change their list of stocks once
a month.
</P>
<P>
   But online customers will not have access to the full reports
nor can they see the firm's list of recommended stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recommended list is traditionally a mainstay of the retail
broker,'' said Thomas O'Connell, an executive vice president of
Discover Brokerage. ``To distribute it away from them would not be
right.'' He said that Morgan Stanley wants to keep a clear
distinction between the two services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to replicate everything in the full-service
channel and do it at a discounted price,'' O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   The other firms that have tiptoed into offering some research
online have not provided same-day access to their Internet
customers and have typically placed various other limitations on
the offerings. Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette lets only those
customers with more than $100,000 in their accounts read its
research. They can read reports on all the companies the firm
covers, but one or two days after they are published. That delay is
critical, because a rating change by a top-ranked analyst can send
a stock soaring or tumbling, depending on the point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The two largest full-service firms _ Merrill Lynch and the
Salomon Smith Barney unit of Travelers Group _ do not offer
separate Internet trading at a discount. But Salomon does have an
arrangement to distribute summaries of its research to customers of
Fidelity Investments. Fidelity customers can subscribe to a daily
summary of Salomon's recommendations for $50 a month or a weekly
summary for $20 a month. Fidelity does not offer Salomon reports on
individual companies.
</P>
<P>
   The online brokerage firm E-Trade offers immediate access to an
unlimited number of research reports by BancAmerica Robertson
Stephens to customers who sign up for its $24.95 a month premium
service. But Robertson Stephens analysts are not among the top 20
as ranked by Institutional Investor.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Charles Schwab pulled back from a plan to
provide delayed access to reports from a number of big brokerage
firms. Those reports would have been provided by First Call, a firm
that sends the reports electronically to institutional clients. But
the plan was tabled after the brokerage firms complained, and
Schwab now says it is working on a new plan to offer research from
several brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's choice to charge a separate fee for its
research is likely to inhibit people from using the service, said
K. Blake Darcy, the chief executive of a competing online service,
DLJ Direct. ``People on the Internet believe that information
should be free or close to it,'' he said. He said that research has
proved to be only a modest attraction for those DLJ customers who
qualify for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half the people who could don't use it at all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, stock research is a draw for a group of customers that
some firms find attractive, said Julio Gomez, the founder of Gomez
Advisers, a firm that follows online brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment bank research has been among the most coveted
services, not for the day trader, but for the serious investor who
fancies themselves in the mold of Warren Buffet or Peter Lynch,''
Gomez said. He said that such customers now represent about 30
percent of the online market.

U.S. MUST PATCH TOGETHER A DAVIS CUP LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a plethora of Davis Cup veterans like Pete Sampras,
Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Michael Chang, the United States
continues to suffer embarrassment when it needs to field a reliable
lineup. This time, with the Davis Cup semifinal against Italy less
than a month away, the team captain, Tom Gullikson, has found
himself in the familiar predicament of having to start from scratch
after being deserted by his singles stars.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson confirmed Sunday that Sampras, who previously hinted
that his 1998 schedule would not accommodate Davis Cup play, has
provided ``a definitive no'' about his semifinal availability, as
have Agassi and Courier. Gullikson said that 26th-ranked Todd
Martin had agreed to play singles and doubles against Italy and
that he was trying to persuade the 15th-ranked Chang to take the
other singles role.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Chang says no, then we move on,'' said Gullikson, who
mentioned 42nd-ranked Vince Spadea, 56th-ranked Jan Michael Gambill
and 66th-ranked Jeff Tarango as possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Although Agassi and Courier volunteered for singles in the first
two rounds of 1998 play, neither will be available for the Sept.
25-27 competition in Milwaukee. The 28-year-old Courier, who
withdrew from the U.S. Open after first-round losses in two summer
hardcourts events, has been plagued by what Gullikson calls ``a
chronic case of dead arm.'' Agassi took himself off the semifinal
squad because of a scheduling conflict with the yearly charity gala
in Las Vegas for which he is the host.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who will be in black tie at the MGM Grand on Sept. 26,
said he would have sandwiched the Davis Cup around the gala had the
U.S. Tennis Association selected a West Coast site. ``God bless
Milwaukee, but it's something they should discuss with the
players,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi shares Sampras' view that the Davis Cup should be held
every other year rather than annually, and he has agreed with Chang
that players should have a greater say in site selection.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson said the USTA tried and failed to find a suitable
semifinal venue in or near Las Vegas. ``It's not that easy to do,
and I'm sure he knew when Davis Cup was when he booked the date for
his gala,'' Gullikson said of Agassi. ``It's just an unfortunate
conflict of scheduling.''

EPA TO TEST THOUSANDS OF WIDELY USED CHEMICALS FOR HARMFUL SIDE
EFFECTS

 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ In a Long Island laboratory where steel-clawed
robots in glass cages shuffle tiny trays of cells all day and all
night, the Environmental Protection Agency is gearing up for one of
the most ambitious projects ever proposed to test chemicals found
in everyday products for harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Under contract to the agency, OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. has been
asked to show how the drug industry's advanced automated techniques
for hunting down useful compounds could also be used to quickly
screen thousands of everyday chemicals, from plastics to
pesticides, looking for those that might interfere with the
hormonal systems of people and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   OSI's scientists have genetically engineered human cells with
DNA from fireflies so that the cells glow when a chemical sample
triggers the same molecular switches that in normal cells would
respond to hormones. That glow is like a yellow warning light, a
signal that the chemical ought to be rigorously tested using
laboratory animals.
</P>
<P>
   These experiments are crucial to a new plan, drafted over the
past two years by an expert committee of several dozen scientists,
industry representatives and environmentalists, to survey the
entire chemical landscape looking for what molecular biologists
call endocrine disrupters: substances that can mimic or interfere
with the body's hormones and cause problems with reproduction,
development and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The action is in response to a growing body of research
indicating that man-made industrial chemicals and pesticides may
commit a kind of molecular sabotage within the body's regulatory
apparatus, possibly causing birth defects, low sperm counts, breast
cancer, mental impairment and a range of other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   How serious this problem is and what should be done about it are
among the most hotly disputed of environmental issues, and the plan
does not address what steps might eventually have to be taken to
restrict the use of chemicals that are found to be harmful. This is
a question with great economic and environmental implications.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the scientific knowledge is still evolving, the
advisory committee found, there is ``appropriate widespread
agreement'' that a screening and testing program is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased screening is a first line of defense and a
significant first step in limiting exposure to potentially
dangerous substances,'' said Carol Browner, the EPA administrator,
endorsing the committee's recommendations. Groups representing
chemical and pesticide companies have also backed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Many kinds of commercial chemicals commonly found in industrial
wastes, solvents, cleansers, pesticides, food additives, plastics,
cosmetics, nutritional supplements, petroleum byproducts and
throughout the environment would be scrutinized, at costs that some
experts suggested could exceed $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee has given us a very aggressive approach, which
is to start with a focus on the 15,000 chemicals that are produced
in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more per year,'' said Lynn Goldman,
EPA's assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances,
who headed the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy about where it went,'' said Goldman, who is a
toxicologist and pediatrician. ``They created a way for us to take
a huge step forward. The amount of knowledge that is going to be
generated to better protect the public and the environment is
considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Congress ordered the EPA to develop ways of
screening pesticide residues in food and contaminants in drinking
water to see whether any of them are dangerous endocrine
disrupters. The agency put together the advisory committee, which
has just completed a report that goes well beyond food and water
quality to recommend what officials are calling the most sweeping
program of toxicological screening and testing ever undertaken.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The project, if implemented as planned, would examine whether
individual chemicals or their mixtures, including some naturally
occurring compounds, affect either people or wildlife by acting on
three primary endocrine systems, those governing estrogen, androgen
and thyroid hormones. In the endocrine systems of nearly all
animals, glands located throughout the body synthesize hormones and
secrete them into the bloodstream. Receptors in the cells of
various organs and tissues respond to these chemical messages to
regulate sexual development, reproduction, metabolism, the brain
and central nervous system, and other bodily functions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is so ambitious that it would be impractical to
subject every chemical to its full battery of tests. So the
committee is recommending a system of triage to sort the estimated
87,000 chemicals that are in use.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, like polymers with molecules too large to cross
cell membranes, are unlikely to pose endocrine problems and have
been excluded. Of more than 62,000 chemicals that remain, the
15,000 produced in large quantities, plus all pesticides, would be
the first to be screened.
</P>
<P>
   Even the initial screening of 15,000 high-volume chemicals would
be a daunting task if not for the new technologies that are being
tried out in the Long Island laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   OSI Pharmaceuticals, using much the same techniques, already
screens 7 million chemicals a year looking for potential new
medicines, and midway through the EPA committee's review, its
experts realized that the same approach might well be used to set
priorities for screening potential endocrine disrupters.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agency's plan, a chemical would be subjected to
comprehensive batteries of biological assays, including tests on
laboratory mammals, birds, amphibians, fish and shrimp, after the
initial screening suggests that it needed further testing.
</P>
<P>
   Those animals would be dosed with chemicals and closely examined
for effects that are thought to be caused by endocrine disruption,
like changes in the size of uterine or brain tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Though some of these tests have been used before, not all have
been used to assess endocrine disruption, and there are also
difficult questions about whether it is appropriate to use these
tests to examine the effects of very small doses of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The expert committee warned that only fully validated tests
should be adopted, and there is some question how long that might
delay the project. But most participants believe that in two to
five years, the screening ought to be in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of things don't come along very often, where you
have both science evolving and a regulation evolving together,''
said Theodore Schettler, a doctor who practices at the East Boston
Neighborhood Health Center in Massachusetts and represented
Physicians for Social Responsibility, an advocacy group, on the
EPA's advisory council. ``That is probably the way it ought to be,
rather than waiting till you have a smoking gun and a body count
before doing anything.''

U.S. MAY SEEK TO EXPAND EVIDENCE IN MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government and 20 states suing Microsoft Corp. are planning
to ask a federal judge to admit new evidence in their major
antitrust case against the software maker, according to a person
close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The request could be made as early as Monday when the Justice
Department and states are scheduled to reply to a Microsoft motion
requesting that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson reject or pare back
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Times reported Sunday that the new accusations would
be made Monday. But the person close to the investigation said that
the government and states had not yet reached final agreement on
what fresh evidence to include, and that they would discuss the
matter Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The move to bolster the antitrust case comes as federal and
state investigators deposing Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman,
decided that they needed an unexpected third day to interrogate
him. The Gates deposition, taken in private, began on Thursday and
Friday. The third session is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday at
the Microsoft corporate campus, outside Seattle, where the first
two sessions were held.
</P>
<P>
   In his videotaped testimony, Gates, according to a person who
was informed of Gates' replies, has hewed to the company's line
throughout the case, denying any wrongdoing in its pursuit of the
market for software used to browse the Internet _ the main focus of
the case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, this person said, Gates denied any knowledge of
attempts to persuade or force Netscape Communications Corp., an
Internet pioneer, to divide the market for browsing software. The
government and states contend that Microsoft proposed a collusion
pact, which was rejected by Netscape, during two meetings in June
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, federal and state investigators have been pursuing
allegations against Microsoft beyond those in the antitrust case
they filed last May. Broadly, the investigators are inquiring
whether Microsoft used its market muscle to try to limit
competition in segments of the emerging market for Internet
software.
</P>
<P>
   In that investigation, the government and states have been
examining Microsoft's dealings with several companies including
Intel, Apple Computer and Real Networks. The investigators are
looking for evidence that Microsoft might have prodded these
companies into curbing their own work on Internet-related software,
or tried to get them to limit support for Netscape, Microsoft's
main rival in Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the government and states can include new
evidence in their case, but only if the fresh evidence meshes
closely with charges already in the complaint. ``Putting new
evidence that fits into the established framework of the case is
not unusual at all,'' one person close to the case said. ``The
purpose of the discovery process is to find new evidence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jackson must make a determination on what new evidence can be
permitted before the trial, which is scheduled to begin on Sept.
23. Microsoft advisers say the effort to put additional evidence
into the case shortly before the trial shows that the government
and states are desperately scrambling to strengthen their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department and the states are casting around,
trying to figure out what they are going to do with their case,''
said Charles Rule, a partner of Covington &AMP; Burling in Washington
and a former senior official in the Justice Department, who is an
adviser to Microsoft. ``They seem to be arguing that Netscape
somehow fits into this larger tableau that they are trying to
paint.''

CLINTON AIDES DEVELOP DETAILED DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-DEMOCRATS) 
(mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's top legal and political
advisers said Sunday that they had developed a detailed defense to
what they anticipate are the four arguments that Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel, might use to mount a case of
obstruction of justice against the president.
</P>
<P>
   The mobilization of the president's lawyers and political
advisers is part of the preparation for the battle over Starr's
expected report to the House of Representatives about issues
stemming from Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   According to lawyers who say they are familiar with Starr's
plans, the report is expected to be completed by late September,
after which the House Judiciary Committee will be obligated to
consider whether to undertake impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   There are four areas of possible obstruction of justice for
which the Clinton advisers have developed detailed
counterarguments.
</P>
<P>
   The first concerns the ``talking points,'' a memorandum Ms.
Lewinsky gave to her onetime friend Linda Tripp, seemingly to help
her alter, in a way favorable to the president, an account of her
knowledge of an encounter between Clinton and another woman.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is the help given Ms. Lewinsky by friends of the
president in finding her a job.
</P>
<P>
   A third concerns any abuse of power by the president in using
the White House's arsenal of lawyers and officials to maintain the
deception that there was no improper relationship between Clinton
and Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The final area concerns the gifts given by Clinton to Ms.
Lewinsky, and whether the president conspired with her to conceal
them from lawyers for Paula Jones, who sought the gifts in
connection with her sexual misconduct lawsuit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight, in large measure, has shifted from the legal arena
to the political,'' said a senior legal adviser to Clinton.
Nonetheless, the adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said that the defenses developed would first seek to defeat any
anticipated obstruction of justice charges Starr might make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the whole obstruction of justice case is stripped away,''
another senior adviser said, ``all Ken Starr is left with is a
report about an inappropriate relationship and an understandable
effort to conceal it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House team's arguments appear strongest on the talking
points. Lawyers familiar with the testimony say Ms. Lewinsky has
told the grand jury that she wrote the talking points herself with
some help from Mrs. Tripp. Although Mrs. Tripp has denied any role,
Starr has apparently been unable to find any evidence that Clinton
or any of his associates were involved in drafting the document.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, the `talking points' were supposed to be the
smoking gun of the obstruction case,'' said one adviser. ``Now that
Starr has been unable to tie it to anyone in the White House, it's
like sand falling through his fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House contends that helping Ms. Lewinsky find a job
had nothing to do with any effort to buy her silence. Essentially,
the argument of Clinton supporters is one of timing: that Ms.
Lewinsky began getting high-level help in finding a good job before
anyone knew she was even a potential witness in the Jones case, so
the career help could not have been part of an effort to persuade
her to lie.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the evidence about the timing is complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones, a former Arkansas clerical worker, had brought a
sexual misconduct suit against Clinton, contending that when he was
governor of Arkansas he had her summoned to his hotel room in
Little Rock and then made a crude sexual advance. In an effort to
bolster their case, Mrs. Jones' lawyers sought other examples in
which the president might have engaged in sex with female
subordinates, and they sought information about Ms. Lewinsky, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers learned on Dec. 5, 1997, that Ms.
Lewinsky might be called as a witness in the Jones lawsuit. Vernon
Jordan Jr., the president's close friend, has said that on Dec. 8
he began helping Ms. Lewinsky find a job in one of the companies
with which he has connections, including American Express and
Revlon.
</P>
<P>
   While that may seem at first not to help Clinton, the
president's advisers contend that there may be documents showing
that Jordan's recollection is flawed and that he began helping her
before Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they argue, the other Clinton associate who tried to
help Ms. Lewinsky was Bill Richardson, the ambassador to the United
Nations, who interviewed her nearly two months before her name
surfaced on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   White House advisers also say they are increasingly confident
that the issue of gifts can be interpreted in Clinton's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty Clinton must overcome is that, according to
lawyers, Ms. Lewinsky has testified that he encouraged her to
ignore a request from Mrs. Jones' lawyers to turn over any gifts
she got from him. Lawyers said that Ms. Lewinsky testified that the
president told her she could avoid turning over the gifts if she no
longer possessed them and that Betty Currie, his secretary, then
showed up at the Lewinsky apartment to retrieve them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has testified that he told Ms. Lewinsky she had no
choice but to comply with the subpoena for the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the White House argument is the credibility of Ms.
Currie, who has been widely portrayed as a decent and honest
witness. According to lawyers, Ms. Currie has offered testimony
that conflicts sharply with that of Ms. Lewinsky, telling the grand
jury that Clinton did not send her to pick up the gifts, but that
she went to the apartment at Ms. Lewinsky's request. The suggestion
is that Ms. Lewinsky orchestrated the return of the gifts herself,
and that Ms. Lewinsky gave them greater value than did the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, these were impersonal things, these gifts,'' one Clinton
strategist said regarding the hatpin, souvenir blanket, brooch,
T-shirts and signed copy of the State of the Union address he gave
her. ``It's not as though he gave her a diamond tennis bracelet or
something that said, `Bill loves Monica.'''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they may counter accusations of a
widespread abuse of power as an understandable effort to conceal a
private relationship that the president has since acknowledged was
improper.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the issue of obstruction of justice, Clinton may
still face additional problems, including whether he committed
perjury when he denied having had sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky when he testified under oath in a deposition in the Jones
case on Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   He has argued that under the definition of sexual relations that
was approved by the judge that day, his answers were ``legally
accurate'' if misleading.

MARINERS CRUSH YANKEES, 13-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The emotional release of clinching a playoff berth
causes men to act like Little Leaguers, form giant human piles and
spray each other with carbonated substances. Scott Brosius was
somewhat more subdued Sunday morning when he learned from a
reporter that in beating Seattle Saturday the Yankees had clinched
a spot in the American League playoffs, the earliest clinching date
in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I can plan on extending my lease another month,'' said
Brosius, his face still puffy from sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Word that the Yankees had clinched seemed anticlimactic, because
of the team's extraordinary record and because nobody realized the
accomplishment until reporters re-examined the standings long after
Saturday's game. Andy Pettitte learned of the feat while watching
television at home Saturday evening. Yankees general manager Brian
Cashman read about the berth Sunday morning while eating a bowl of
Cap'n Crunch. Most of the Yankees were told by reporters Sunday,
before the Seattle Mariners blasted them, 13-3, before 55,341 at
Yankee Stadium. Ken Griffey Jr. launched his 46th and 47th home
runs in the game, the first amid a barrage of hits against Hideki
Irabu (11-7).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 98-37 and could reach 100 victories when they
play host to Oakland in a two-game series Tuesday and Wednesday.
Qualifying for the playoffs became a foregone conclusion long ago,
as had winning the AL East; the Yankees began play Sunday leading
the Boston Red Sox by 18 1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   In winning so many games so quickly, the Yankees have raised the
bar of expectations for themselves beyond simply making the
playoffs. ``We're trying to get everything back to playoff-type
thinking,'' said Tim Raines, the veteran outfielder. ``It would be
kind of tough to say we have the best team in baseball, that we won
130 games or whatever in the regular season, and then not win
anything in the postseason. The focus is more toward winning the
World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the players had realized they had clinched a spot in the
playoffs _ the first step toward success in the postseason, and
essentially what they have been playing for since the end of spring
training _ they probably would not have celebrated too much. ``Some
high-fives and stuff,'' Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   They probably will not go crazy when they clinch the East,
either, in the next 10 days or so. ``We have high standards for
ourselves,'' said Joe Girardi, the Yankees' catcher. ``Not that you
take things for granted, but you expect that you're going to win.
The expectations in this room are different than any team I've
played on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees clinched the moment Chad Curtis caught David Segui's
fly ball to close Saturday's game, and, not realizing the game had
any significance, Curtis flipped the ball into the stands. There
was no bedlam, no Champagne. ``I did drink an ice water,'' Brosius
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams knew nothing about the clinching until he was
approached by reporters Sunday morning. Somebody asked Williams
what was the best way to celebrate a clinching one day late?
Thoughtful as always, Williams considered the question before he
said, ``Maybe just win this game today.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't exactly work out, either. On Friday, the Yankees led
by 10-1 after four innings, then on Saturday by 11-0 after four
innings. But Sunday, Seattle jumped ahead by 10-0 in the first five
innings, pounding Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander has struggled to come back from a bruise on his
foot that he sustained on Aug. 15, and is doing all the right
things to insure that he will not be given a meaningful role in the
postseason. He allowed 10 hits and eight runs in three and
one-third innings and most every ball hit was hit hard. Mel
Stottlemyre, the Yankees pitching coach, explained later that
Irabu's split-fingered fastball was ineffective, and he could not
finish hitters off once he was ahead in the count. ``A bad game,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``A bad pitching performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the Mariners, whose heated rivalry has generally
been defused this season by the Yankees' dominance over Seattle,
engaged in two bench-clearing incidents that resulted in exactly no
punches being thrown, and a lot of chest-thumping. In the third
inning, Curtis exchanged angry words with Seattle shortstop Alex
Rodriguez near second base after Rodriguez completed a double play
throwing past Curtis; Rodriguez thought Curtis should have slid or
got out of the way more quickly. As the two yelled at each other
and drew close, other players milled around them, but nothing came
of it.
</P>
<P>
   But after Brosius was hit in the middle of the back by a
fastball in the bottom of the seventh, the Yankees' Mike Buddie
skipped a fastball past the feet of Seattle's Rob Ducey, who stared
at the pitcher suspiciously. Then Buddie hit him in the leg, the
message clear to all: This was retaliation on behalf of Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches from both benches and the bullpen gathered
at the mound, Seattle's Segui shouting that hey, the Yankees beat
up the Mariners in the first two games of this series, so why
couldn't they take their lumps in this game? Tino Martinez
retorted, but nobody really wanted to fight. Chili Davis and
Griffey playfully pushed each other, the same with Derek Jeter and
Rodriguez. Buddie, ejected immediately, was not available for
comment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are friends on both sides,'' David Cone said. ``I'm just
glad it didn't get out of hand.''

 &HT;    Kuehne sips sweet success as Amateur champ
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ His turbulent past allowed no champagne to be
sipped from the Havemayer Trophy Sunday night. No problem. Let
others do it for him. After beating alcoholism three years ago at
age19, Hank Kuehne has secured a U.S. Amateur championship.
</P>
<P>
   Winning his battle with 44-year-old Tom McKnight on the 35th
hole Sunday at Oak Hill Country Club, Kuehne, 22, officially
prevailed 2 and 1, completing a remarkable journey from despair to
delirium.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, 1995, the last time his lips touched alcohol, Kuehne
lay in a Stillwater, Okla., hospital after a one-car accident, his
life as shattered as his ribs. Today, after overcoming a touch of
relative adversity in his match with McKnight, he holds the most
prestigious amateur golf title in the world.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the collective tear ducts of the Kuehne family are
nearly spent. When McKnight conceded a two-putt par at the 17th
hole to Hank _ Henry to his close friends _ the scene became a
tearful hugfest between the winner, brother Trip, his caddie, and
father Ernie. It's a family whose joy realized Sunday was virtually
impossible to measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the second greatest victory in my life,'' said Hank, a
senior at Southern Methodist. ''No matter what I do the rest of my
life, sobriety will always be my No.1 victory.''
</P>
<P>
   For Trip, who lost a U.S. Amateur final to Tiger Woods in 1994,
there was significant solace in sharing part of Hank's victory
Sunday. In the black hole that used to be Hank's life, he was
drowning from his own disease. Admittedly, both Trip and sister
Kelli, a two-time women's amateur champion, were frightened for his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''It tops off a long journey,'' said Trip, 26. ''Henry had won
before he even got here. Golf is very easy for him. Staying sober
is his challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I started crying because we know what Henry has been through,
being 22 years old and overcoming alcoholism,'' said Kelli, who
could watch the final hole of the Amateur after missing the cut at
the LPGA Rail Classic. ''I've always been a big believer in Henry.
I think Trip would even tell you that Henry's always had more
ability than Trip and I both.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelli said she was well aware of his brother's drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pretty scary,'' she said. ''He hit rock bottom. I saw
him at a lot of parties. I told him he drank too much, but, well,
he was a senior...We were the golfing family and we could pretty
much get away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Hank Kuehne has the world ahead of him. Already in the
Masters by making the finals, he now ensures a Thursday pairing
with defending champion Mark O'Meara. He'll play in the U.S. Open
with O'Meara and defending champion Lee Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, a petroleum distributor and convenience store owner
from Galax, Va., could barely hit a fairway all day and hit only 13
of 35 greens, but remained alive by periods of one-putting magic.
Kuehne was 3-up after the morning round, but the match took several
turns after lunch. Six holes into the second round, McKnight had
four birdies and was 1-up. Kuehne was unraveling and needed a
break. It came at the 8th hole, when his drive banged into two
trees and kicked into the middle of the fairway. McKnight lipped
out to even the match, starting a trend that would lead to three
straight bogeys to start the back nine, and Kuehne never trailed
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''On 8 there, when the monkey threw it out of the tree,'' Hank
said, ''it was pretty great to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the good fortune, Trip told his little brother,
''Let's just act like you hit a 4-iron out there and right this
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, though seriously disappointed, still enjoyed the ride.
Selling propane gas and heating oil just won't be much of a rush
after this.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy as hell for Henry,'' he said. ''I think it's great
for he and his family. It would have been great for me and my
family, too.''

 &HT;    Gordon claims victory _ again
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. - Just when Mark Martin thought he might put
together a winning streak of his own, up jumped Jeff Gordon to
spoil his fun again.
</P>
<P>
   Martin all but had his name on the CMT 300 trophy Sunday at New
Hampshire International Speedway until he crossed paths with Rich
Bickle, bringing out the caution that gave Gordon a chance to break
his heart again.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon took on only two tires and got back onto the track as the
race leader. That was the last anyone else - including Martin, who
had led 193 laps - saw of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's about the only racing we did today, those last 60
laps,'' Gordon said. ''There at the end, we just tried to get in
the top five. Once we got to fifth, that caution happened to come
out at the right time for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Gordon's ninth of the season, fifth in the last
six and six in the last eight. As Bobby Hamilton said, ''I'm not
particulary surprised Gordon won. I saw (country singer) Jerry Reed
this morning. What was his big song? 'When you're hot, you're hot.'
And he's definitely hot.''
</P>
<P>
   It was too hot for Martin to handle. It was his to lose, and he
did, when he tangled with Bickle in turn four. Martin escaped, but
Bickle hit the wall, bringing out the caution Martin didn't need.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just got outrun,'' Martin said. ''I don't think anything
went wrong. At the end of the race, the 24 car (Gordon) was just
faster than we were. He just outran us. Some people said I had a
handful at the end, but I was just trying to drive as fast as
Gordon was and I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $205,400 Gordon won the Winston Cup Leader
bonus worth $20,000. It was the seventh time that Gordon had won
it.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's average speed was 112.134 miles per hour; the margin of
victory .664 seconds and the attendance 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning boils down to who has trouble, who gets in wrecks or
who gets stuck on the outside and goes back to 17th and doesn't
come back up there,'' Gordon said of the difference in winning and
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no one else to chase Gordon at the end. John Andretti
finished third, but never was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett was fourth. He has four straight top five finishes,
but has lost 39 points to Gordon over that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like I said, if you plan on gaining points in this this thing,
you gotta win the race and we weren't able to do that,'' Jarrett
said. ''That was probably the best we've run in a while, but it
just wasn't quite good enough. But, we can make some adjustments
from here and see if we can get a little better next year.''

CONSULTANT IS SUED FOR EXPECTED COMPUTER MALFUNCTION IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   J. Baker Inc., a large apparel retailer, is demanding that
Andersen Consulting reimburse it for the cost of a computer system
installed nearly 10 years ago because the system is expected to
malfunction in the year 2000, officials at the consulting firm said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To try to ward off a possible lawsuit by J. Baker, Andersen
asked a Massachusetts court on Friday to rule that the consultants
had met all their contractual obligations when they installed the
merchandising system for the retailer. The installation was
completed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The case is significant because it is one of the first that
tries to blame consultants or computer vendors for installing a
system that will not recognize dates after Dec. 31, 1999 _ the Y2K
problem. If such a suit succeeded, it could expose Andersen
Consulting, the world's largest consulting firm, as well as dozens
of other consultants and computer companies to billions of dollars
in liability.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Jackson, a spokesman for Andersen Consulting, said the firm
had repeatedly tried to resolve the matter with J. Baker. The firm
decided to ask the court for a declaratory judgment, he said, after
Baker hired a law firm to work on the matter for a fee contingent
on any final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``J. Baker is unreasonably demanding reimbursement for a system
they used successfully for nearly a decade,'' Andersen said in a
written statement. ``We felt there was no choice left but to ask
the court to help resolve this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Baker did not return telephone messages left for
them on Friday and Sunday. But according to the consulting firm,
the company is arguing that it would have insisted in 1989 that the
system be ready for the year 2000 if the consultants had then
brought up the subject. The consultants say any such claim by Baker
is groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We completely stand behind our work, will defend our position
and fully expect to win this case,'' the consulting firm's
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker officials had approved of the computer's design when it
was installed, Jackson said. And they even agreed to praise the
project's success to other companies considering whether to hire
Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, based in Canton, Mass., owns hundreds of retail stores
around the country, including the Casual Male Big and Tall chain.

   An analysis of the CMT 300 at New Hampshire International
Speedway
</P>
<P>
   The First 100
</P>
<P>
   In typical New Hampshire fashion, four different drivers led the
first four laps - Jeff Gordon led one, Bobby Labonte two, Ken
Schrader, who then got selfish and led lap four to 33. From there
it was follow the leader, that being Mark Martin, who carried the
field to lap 77 before the first caution fell, allowing Dave Marcis
his lone appearance at the front of the pakc.
</P>
<P>
   During that 77-lap charge, Jeff Burton, who won here in June,
wound his way through the field, from 25th to 17th in 10 laps, but
that was all he had. He hung on on to finish fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Martin took the lead on lap on lap 79 and nourished it for 89
laps, signalling that a second conscutive victory might be in
store.
</P>
<P>
   Lap leaders: Gordon (1), Bobby Labonte (2), Ken Schrader (3),
Mike Wallace (30), Mark Martin (64), Dave Macis (2). Retired: Steve
Park (wreck). Under Caution: 4 laps
</P>
<P>
   Second 100
</P>
<P>
   Martin picked up in the second segment where he left off the
first, leading. He kept his Ford in the lead through lap 167,
turning it over to Terry Labonte for a pair. Two laps later, Wally
Dallenbach became the first to exit due to mechanical problems. His
engined expired. Things began to heat up The days second caution
came on lap 178 when Rusty Wallace and Schrader got together in the
midle of turn three. Schrader slammed into the wall and was gone
for the day. There was more riding than racing in this segment,
evidenced by big gaps throughout the field. Bill Elliott developed
a small grease leak, which becomes serious on lap 125. He loses
four spots and pits, taking his Ford behind the wall for 43 laps
and finishes 37th. Three cautions slowed this 100-lap segment. Jeff
Green hit the wall in the middle of turns one and two; Terry
Labonte broke a piece in his engine and Rich Bickle crashed in turn

CLINTON TO MEET YELTSIN AS RUSSIA TEETERS ON EDGE OF CHAOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By NANCY MATHIS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ President Clinton arrives in Moscow tonight eds.
Monday night to begin an awkward summit with President Boris
Yeltsin just as Russia teeters on the edge of chaos, and the United
States can offer little but reassuring words.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, suffering from his own troubles at home, begins a
weeklong overseas journey with a stop in Russia before heading to
Northern Ireland and Ireland to champion their efforts toward
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The session between Clinton and Yeltsin comes at a critical, if
not ill-timed, moment in which the Kremlin faces one of its
toughest challenges since the 1991 demise of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which has struggled to define its place in the post-Cold
War world, now finds itself in a political and economic free fall,
facing instability and uncertainty; its citizens turning against
the market reforms and turning toward anti-American rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Russian officials announced an 18-month truce,
between the Communist-led Duma and the Yeltsin government, which
would allow a new Cabinet to be installed and strip away Yeltsin's
powers. Only hours later, the Communists denounced the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that it signifies a triple setback, a setback for
economic reforms, a slowdown of democratization and a setback for
American advocacy both of reforms and of democracy in Russia,''
said Zbigniew Brzezinski on ABC's This Week. He served as President
Carter's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say Clinton must meet with Yeltsin to
show support for democratic and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants a weak Russia beset by crisis,'' said Samuel
``Sandy'' Berger, the president's national security adviser.
``American has a strong interest in preventing Russia from
backsliding and in promoting its stability and success.''
</P>
<P>
   But few experts expect any significant agreements to spring from
the session.
</P>
<P>
   Into this unsettled cauldron steps an American president
weakened by domestic scandal and a Russian president who twice
sacked his Cabinet in five months and who defies wholesale calls
for his ouster, but then again, maybe already has agreed to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two presidents who are extremely weak domestically,
each of whom has a legislature that isn't in much of a mood to give
them anything. You've got elites in both capitals calling for each
president to step down. You've got investors fleeing Russia. You've
got social unrest growing. And so the Bill and Boris Show is not a
particularly compelling spectacle,'' said Jim Goldgeiger, a
political science professor at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goldgeiger said, ``It is important for the president to
go on this trip, despite the fact the timing isn't great, because
the stakes are larger than simply the current economic crisis in
Russia, and he does need to reaffirm the Western commitment to this
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing breach between the United States and Russia
on several major issues.
</P>
<P>
   On the economic front, Russia has resisted Western demands for
greater market reforms, instead seeking to prop up the ruble with
installments from the $23-billion bailout provided last month by
the International Monetary Fund. Still, the ruble tumbled last
week, amid an enormous government debt and a failing banking
system, and sparked panic among Russians and investors.
</P>
<P>
   To contain the economic free fall, Yeltsin turned again to
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, a go-slow advocate whom
Yeltsin had dismissed only five months ago. Communists, who now
dominate the Duma, also made a resurgence, calling for greater
state control and the nationalization of some industries.
Chernomyrdin pledged anew to stick with a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choices that Russia makes in the next few weeks and the
next several months will be crucial in determining its economic
future and, as the president has said, the way in which the Russian
people define their greatness,'' said Larry Summers, deputy
treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our belief that a move back towards centralized
planning, based on price controls and administrative allocation of
goods and systematic controls would be a serious policy error, and
very unfortunate with respect to Russia's economic prospects going
forward,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the IMF nor Western nations could offer hope of another
bailout because of a lack of money. In the United States, Congress
has little stomach for providing any aid to Russia, especially
because of its military sales to Iran and India.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States also have differences on Kosovo,
Iraq and the bombing of terrorists' camps in Afghanistan. The Duma
also refuses to pass START II, the nuclear arms reduction pact.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial participation into the construction of the
international space station also is in question. Its control over
nuclear proliferation and its own weapons has sparked concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian military is performing almost none of the
traditional missions that a military is supposed to perform,
whether it's internal control, prevention of internal
disintegration or border control, air surveillance, space
surveillance, protection of Russian territory from possible
convention invasions ... to nuclear deterrents,'' said Bruce Blair,
a Russian military expert at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who will accompany the president to
Russia, suggested Sunday on ABC's This Week that Clinton and
Yeltsin may sign a pact to reduce the amount of plutonium each
country has for use in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to strike some agreements or tentative
agreements,'' said Domenici. ``This is a rather big announcement
with reference to our relationship regarding nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will meet with Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin and Duma leaders
during his time in Russia. He and Yeltsin also will hold a news
conference on Wednesday which will be the first time Clinton has
faced reporters since admitting an ``inappropriate relationship''
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will travel to Belfast, Northern Ireland, on Thursday
and later visit with victims of the recent Omagh car bombing. He
will visit Dublin and Limerick before leaving Ireland on Saturday,
after playing golf.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Few people outside the Nation of Islam knew much
about Khallid Abdul Muhammad in November 1993, when, as the top
aide to Louis Farrakhan, he railed so viciously against whites,
Jews, Catholics, homosexuals and black civil rights leaders in a
lecture at a small New Jersey college that Congress denounced him
and Farrakhan eventually dismissed him from his post.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago, it seemed he was well on his way back
into obscurity. Now, however, fresh from victory over Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in a federal courtroom last week, where a judge cleared
the way for his Million Youth March in Harlem Saturday, Muhammad is
about to take center stage. It promises to be his most visible
platform yet.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad's improbable return to the public eye may surprise or
disappoint those who dismissed him as a hatemonger on the lunatic
fringe, a rabble-rouser on the college lecture circuit, a pointed
but powerless reminder of how much remains unhealed in U.S. race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   But while New Yorkers are finding that they must deal with
Muhammad, or at least with his venomous words, precisely who he is
and what he represents have long been largely a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with friends, followers and others who have known
Muhammad since he was an aspiring Methodist minister in his teens
named Harold Moore Vann depict a man of exceptional abilities and
ambition. He grew up amid segregation and Jim Crow, came of age in
the turbulent 1960s and quickly fell under the spell of the
charismatic Farrakhan, perhaps his first and certainly his most
influential father figure.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Muhammad, who is 50 but looks 35, displays his talents in
every speech, combining a debater's knack for argument with a
preacher's rhythms and tones, a stand-up comic's ear for ethnic
mimicry and an actor's awareness of his own physical presence. His
agenda for the Million Youth March explicitly evokes the black
radicalism of the 1960s: ``Black power, black nationalism,
Pan-Africanism, and black liberation theology.'' He tells close
associates that he is reprising Malcolm X's role as the
ultranationalist heir apparent of the Nation of Islam, literally
doing the math to show the similarities in the generation gaps
between the two and their mentors.
</P>
<P>
   And he at every turn seems preoccupied by his estranged
``spiritual father,'' seeking Farrakhan's approval, disapproving of
his move toward the mainstream, hoping aloud for a rapprochement
but at the same time challenging him for the hearts and minds of
young, disaffected inner-city black men.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad's past is rife with contradictions. By all accounts a
brilliant student in high school, he left college without a degree
and abandoned Christianity for a religious movement whose
interpretations of history, human genetics and even Scripture have
been attacked by mainstream scholars again and again as misguided
at best, intellectually dishonest at worst. He is described as
having boundless love for his people and Islam. But while minister
at a mosque in Atlanta in the late 1980s, facing federal charges
that he had lied on a mortgage application, he pressured a follower
to perjure herself to cover up his own crime, a law enforcement
official said. The official said he then ordered other congregants
_ including the woman's husband _ to shun her.
</P>
<P>
   Though Muhammad clearly exults in the language and theater of
violence, wishing grisly deaths to his enemies and brandishing
assault weapons for photographers, even some followers have begun
to doubt there is more to this than bluster.
</P>
<P>
   And while Muhammad displays a showman's concern for hype and
presentation _ having inflated his own credentials in claiming an
apparently unearned doctorate, or instructing a group of Harlem
children to embrace him when a photographer approached last week _
he appears conflicted about cultivating his own celebrity. After
agreeing to, and then refusing, a lengthy interview for this
article, he explained that he had no time. He also rejected an
offer that a reporter follow him as he promoted the Million Youth
March. ``To travel from city to city with a white man, who's trying
to do this kind of story on me, that other white folk can develop a
psychological profile from?'' he asked. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he conceded that he had given such interviews to black
reporters for mainstream news organizations, he dropped the
subject. ``I'm just not sure I want white folks to know that much
about me,'' he said. ``I'd rather in some cases be an enigma. It's
safer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Muhammad's origins are murky. He was born Harold Moore Jr. in
Texas in January 1948. But he may never have known his namesake. At
age 40, he called himself a ``poor widow's son.'' In a recent
television interview, he said he had been raised by another couple
entirely, but did not elaborate. And he has told others he was
raised by an aunt. ``There was always some missing link there, in
terms of that whole family structure,'' said a friend from his
youth, the Rev. Bob Hayes. ``It was a checkered kind of
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever may have troubled him at home, young Harold was a child
prodigy in church. ``From a little boy, I used to stand on the
porch and preach out to the cars as they would pass by,'' he told
Gil Noble of WABC's ``Like It Is'' last month. ``I preached my
first Sunday 11 o'clock hour sermon when I was about 11 years old.
They turned the big pulpit over to me.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he entered the all-black Phyllis Wheatley High
School in Houston in 1962, Harold Moore Jr. had become Harold Moore
Vann. He would graduate in 1966 as president of Houston's Methodist
Youth Fellowship, captain and quarterback of Wheatley's football
team, president of the drama club, an Eagle Scout, a star debater,
class officer and parliamentarian of the Beau Brummels _ a select
group of male student leaders chosen for their character and
potential.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his considerable charisma and popularity, Harold,
nicknamed ``Preacher,'' never seemed to develop any close
friendships, recalled the Rev. Thomas Wallace, a teammate who went
on to play a season with the Dallas Cowboys. ``He was a
quarterback, and a motivator,'' he said fondly. ``In the huddle,
he'd be really animated, and have this grim face all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Aided by church leaders in his hometown, Harold Vann won a
scholarship to Dillard University, a Methodist school in New
Orleans, and has said he fully intended to enter the ministry. He
studied sociology and, he told Noble, spent a semester or two at
Harvard on an exchange program. But he found himself moving away
from the church and gravitating towards the black liberation
theology that had been gaining adherents since the assassination of
Malcolm X in 1965. He says said he slowly began to realize ``what
the white man did with Christianity, and how he used the good name
of Jesus, the black revolutionary Messiah...to justify slavery and
oppression, and to justify conquering the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad's conversion, he has said for years, became complete
one day in 1967, when Farrakhan paid a visit to the Dillard Campus.
Farrakhan was then a top aide to Elijah Muhammad, leader of the
Chicago-based Nation of Islam, then known as the Black Muslims. ``I
had never heard such an exegesis of Scripture,'' he would say.
Farrakhan, meanwhile, apparently saw in the fierce young Texan an
ideal protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me that day, `You're going to be a great, great
help in the salvation of our people, and the freedom and
independence of our people,' Muhammad recalled on ``Like It Is.''
``I said I'd never be a member of the Nation of Islam, but the next
time I saw him, after doing a lot of research and trying to
disprove him, and taking professors from the campus to disprove
him, I had pretty much converted myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Dillard without a degree in 1970, Muhammad entered the
Nation of Islam in Chicago and quickly rose through the ranks,
using the names Harold 2X and Maleek Rashadeen along the way. But
when Elijah Muhammad died in 1975, his son took charge of the
Nation of Islam and renounced black separatism. Farrakhan went into
seclusion. Muhammad, disillusioned, quit a year later and moved to
Africa, where he traveled extensively and where he says he flirted
with a career as a mercenary soldier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, after the Nation of Islam had all but dissolved in
financial disarray, Farrakhan determined to revive it and rebuild
it. One of the first people he called on for help was his former
protege, who quickly returned home. For the next three years, the
two drove across the country organizing study groups and mosques in
big cities and backwaters. In 1981, Farrakhan announced the rebirth
of the Nation of Islam. Khallid Abdul Muhammad, one of his top
lieutenants, would begin to move from city to city and mosque to
mosque, raising money, training members in paramilitary groups,
organizing security patrols in inner-city housing projects _ and
always preaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things they did effectively was to point out that
black people were not the villains in the drama between blacks and
whites in America, but the victims,'' said a close associate of
both men who insisted on anonymity. ``To do that, they dramatized
it with their speech. They called the white man the Devil. The
reason was most of the black people they were speaking to were
Christians. The point was not to get blacks to hate white people,
but to stop loving them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the message was filled with hatred nonetheless, particularly
of Jews, whom Farrakhan accused of playing a disproportionate role
in the slave trade _ a theory that has been broadly debunked _ and
oppressing blacks through what he has characterized as Jewish
control of the publishing, banking and entertainment industries. By
the 1990s, Muhammad was a regular on the campus lecture tour, where
many black students cheered his ethnic chauvinism and news coverage
naturally focused on his hate-filled tirades. He reserved some of
his harshest words, in fact, for black civil rights leaders and
elected officials who showed any signs of apologizing, conciliating
or compromising with whites. By contrast, he presented himself as a
pillar of strength. He would say the most outrageous things _
claiming that ``hook-nosed, bagel-eating, lox-eating,
perpetrating-a-fraud so-called Jews'' had planted AIDS in Africa _
and would never back down.
</P>
<P>
   His 1993 speech at Kean College in Union, N.J., however, would
drive a wedge between Muhammad and Farrakhan, who had begun to
soften his own rhetoric in hopes of forging an alliance with the
NAACP and other mainstream black leaders. Though Muhammad's tirade
was nothing new, critics of Farrakhan seized upon it to show he had
not changed. The Anti-Defamation League published excerpts from the
speech in a full-page ad in The New York Times in January 1994.
Facing a barrage of criticism, Farrakhan suspended Muhammad from
his position as national spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Muhammad has continued to shock audiences on the
lecture circuit, but had otherwise largely disappeared from the
news. Moreover, he always speaks glowingly of Farrakhan, keeping
speculation alive that theirs was a divorce of convenience, a
charade for white consumption. Asked about this, Muhammad recently
likened their relationship to that of an estranged father and son
whom, he hoped, might one day reconcile. But he confirmed that he
had been permanently barred from Nation of Islam mosques.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the last three years, Muhammad, whose sources of
income are unclear, moved to New York and bought a brownstone on
Striver's Row in Harlem. Aides say that he is divorced. He has a
13-year old son who is helping to organize the march.
</P>
<P>
   Once banished by Farrakhan, Muhammad began formulating a new
strategy, his associates said _ one that would draw on his roots in
1960s radicalism, his grassroots organizing in the 1970s, his
courting of rap artists in Los Angeles in the 1980s and the mass
demonstrations organized by his mentor, Farrakhan, beginning with
the Million Man March in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He surrounded himself with acolytes and continued reaching out
to young Nation of Islam members across the country, sensing that
many would respond to his angry, defiant words more than to
Farrakhan's somewhat less strident oratory. Yet the size of
Muhammad's following is impossible to know, despite his and his
aides' claims of mass appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that he could neither seek nor expect mass defections
from the Nation of Islam, Muhammad branched out, helping to
organize the New Black Panther Party and the New Black Muslims in
Texas. In June, for example, he and several dozen armed members of
the groups marched in Jasper, Texas, to protest the murder of James
Byrd, a black hitchhiker dragged to his death behind a car by three
men who allegedly belonged to the Ku Klux Klan. But his appearance
angered local residents and the victim's family.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Muhammad has gotten what he wanted so far. In
provoking Giuliani over the Million Youth March he galvanized
support in Harlem for what had been a virtually unknown event. But
that support has come with loud disclaimers of Muhammad's beliefs.
It remains to be seen whether even a large showing on Saturday will
produce masses of volunteers for the army that Muhammad hopes to
build.
</P>
<P>
   But those who have known him longest say that Muhammad's moment
in the sun may be an end in itself. ``I really don't know which is
the true Khallid, or which one is there for the show,'' said Hayes,
his childhood friend from Houston. ``I know that he has a passion
for what he's doing, but where does that passion stop, and where
does the desire for attention begin?''

HOMETOWN GIVES LITTLE LEAGUE CHAMPIONS A HERO'S WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. _ Last December, Ken Kondek's wife, Chris, was
planning a September trip to Las Vegas to celebrate a friend's 50th
wedding anniversary. Kondek, the assistant coach of the Toms River
East Little League team, refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I don't want to go because I'm going to
Williamsport,''' Mrs. Kondek said, referring to the Pennsylvania
town that is the site of the Little League World Series. ``And this
was in December!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was wishful thinking on the part of Kondek, since he
was planning to retire from Little League coaching this year after
20 years and wanted to go out right. Or maybe he really knew
something about these young players, seeing as the Kondeks live
right across the street from the Toms River East Little League
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, Kondek could not have envisioned what played
out last week in Williamsport, a week that was capped on Saturday
by Toms River's 12-9 victory over Kashima, Japan, to win the 52nd
annual Little League World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could he have envisioned the hero's welcome the team
received on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the team bus rolled off the Garden State Parkway at Route 37
about 1:45 p.m., accompanied by a police escort, several hundred
well-wishers who had been waiting since the morning lined the south
side of the road. Along the route, the team disembarked from the
bus and got on top of a fire truck to ride on to the Little League
complex, where they were met by an estimated 2,000 residents who
were finally getting a chance to greet their young heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe this?'' asked Charlie Frazier, a vice
principal of Toms River South High School and the father of Todd
Frazier, who hit four home runs in the Series and was the winning
pitcher in the championship game. ``They could have gone to the
beach today, and instead they came here.''
</P>
<P>
   They came to celebrate not just a local team, but the first U.S.
team to win the Little League World Series in five years. Many of
the boosters who lined the road waved American flags against a
backdrop of strip malls and tire stores.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the boisterous throng also brought signs and banners,
including one hanging from the side of a camper van that read:
``Marry me Chris Cardone. Love, Alexa.'' But Chris, who hit the
game-winning home run in the sixth and final inning of Saturday's
game, does not necessarily need to stock up on wedding clothes yet
_ Alexa Manforti is only 7.
</P>
<P>
   From the first game in Williamsport in which she saw Chris,
Alexa was smitten. When her father, Al, a chiropractor, told her he
knew Chris _ he treats Chris' family _ she got even more excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started with the first game,'' Manforti said of Alexa's
infatuation. ``She said he was really cute. She wanted to get rid
of her first-grade boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chris' mother, Lucy, said of the sign: ``Not yet. I want to
hold on to him a little bit longer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from the even-keel demeanor he displayedin the
Series Mike Gaynor, the team manager who coached another Toms River
team to Williamsport in 1995, thanked each of his players
individually with a touch of emotion..
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said that if I came back, I would have more
success,'' he said. Then, turning to the team and smiling, he said,
``It kind of worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the champions, while basking in the adulation,
were clearly exhausted and not very talkative. None addressed the
crowd at the rally. Still, the second baseman, Joey Franceschini,
told reporters, ``It was awesome to have all the fans cheering you
on.''
</P>
<P>
   While a number of public appearances await, the players from
Toms River said on Sunday that they simply wanted to go home and
regain some normalcy in their lives, perhaps not fully
understanding the scope of their accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when it's going to hit them?'' Mrs. Kondek said.
``When they're 40 and they have kids. Right now, it's awesome, and
five years from now it'll be cool. But right now, they just don't
know.''

OLD FARM MACHINERY ATTRACTS A DEVOTED CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLEDO, Wash._ There's something about the sound of a World War
II-era John Deere tractor, a graceful two-step in a field of thuds
and idling rattles. Of course, there are farmers who disagree.
</P>
<P>
   At the 34th-annual Cowlitz Prairie Grange Steam Threshing and
Gas Show, the opposition came from fans of other tractors, like the
Farmall, the Case and the Massey.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who came to the show all agreed that the
collecting, refinishing and displaying of antique farm machinery _
or ``iron'' _ is an engaging and honorable pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the field of Bob Herren's farm, with Mount Rainier to the
north and the stump of Mount St. Helens to the east, the Threshing
Bee, as the show is known for short, attracted about 8,000 people
on Saturday and the same number on Sunday, the organizers said. In
addition to a tractor pull and a flea market, there were lots of
tractors driving around, several of them driven by children who
kicked switches with their feet because they were too little to
reach the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the day was the threshing (pronounced
``thrashing'' here) done on the hour, using machinery from earlier
in the century.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Zion of Kent, Wash., helped pitch oats into a 1946 John
Deere thresher, which was powered by a belt from a tractor about 50
feet away, while his cousin, Ben Klein of Sequim, dozed on the back
of the grain cart. With seven belts looped around one another in a
giant cat's cradle and pistons flying, the thresher worked like a
charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the serial number, it's supposed to be one of the last six
made,'' Zion said. ``It pretty much stays in the family.'' He said
he expected to be showing off machines like this and demonstrating
how they separate oats from chaff when his father gets too old to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the equipment was made before I was born,'' said Zion.
``Our grandfather did this in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the iron collectors, the John Deere fans seem to be the
most loyal. ``About half of them are like me,'' said John Fields,
president of the Southwest Washington 2 Cylinder Club. ``I've got a
small farm, and my newest farm tractor is a 1958. I'm able to enjoy
playing with the old farm machinery and do the farming that I
really enjoy too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields and Ted Blair of Elma, Wash., a past president of the
club, showed off an elegant 1960 620 orchard tractor, with a
swooping fairing to keep dropping fruit out of the machinery. It
was one of 202 ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Fields helped Blair start his 1944 John Deere bulldozer,
succeeding on the second try after a dozen energetic pushes to the
flywheel. Blair, who was wearing green and yellow John Deere
suspenders, doesn't use the machine for work anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to have fun with,'' he said. ``It's too old to get parts
for them, and if you broke something major, it would be down.'' The
engine putted along steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing at the engine, Fields said: ``It's that sound right
there. The others go BRRRRRR. This has a little split sound right
there, and that's what attracts people to it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the end of a long row of humming engines and spinning
flywheels, Dennis Leischner of Boring, Ore., who wore a T-shirt
proclaiming him a ``Gas Engine Nut,'' explained that farm engines
were often kept on wheels so they could be used all over, to pump
water, grid feed or separate cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the sound of them,'' Leischner said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Herren, who provided the oats for the Threshing Bee,
displayed a gas engine _ ``about a horse and a half'' _ that he
once used for pumping water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threshed the old-fashioned way, and I plowed the whole
field with a 14-inch plow, seven miles of walking to the acre,''
Herren said.
</P>
<P>
   Threshing 40 acres took all winter. Herren remembered when one
thresher served all the neighborhood farms and took 20 men to run
properly. There was suspicion when the first combines appeared, and
Herren said he still believed that the old threshers are better in
some ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grain gets to dry out a bit, and a stationary thresher can
do a cleaner job than a combine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing at a red Waterloo Boy, he said: ``This came out of the
cemetery. It was used to pump water in the cemetery in Vader.''
</P>
<P>
   He used to find old engines when surveying properties, but, he
said, ``I don't find them very often anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A South Dakota family gave the 1946 thresher to Zion's family,
which had to find a low-boy truck to haul it to Washington. When he
was done threshing, Zion let a handful of oats fall through his
hands, rolled one between his fingers and pulled back the husk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``is the beginning of breakfast.''

FERRARO FINDS TEPID TURNOUT ON CAMPAIGN STOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.Y. _ Ignoring the other Democratic candidates who
hope to run against Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in November's general
election, Geraldine Ferraro leveled an attack on Sunday against the
Republican incumbent as if the race between them were a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Calling herself ``the best alternative to 18 years of D'Amato,''
Ms. Ferraro referred only obliquely to her opponents in the Sept.
15 Democratic primary: Mark Green, the New York City public
advocate, and Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn. She sharply
criticized D'Amato's record on health care, education, gun control,
abortion and campaign finance. She noted that D'Amato had raised
millions of dollars for his re-election while repeatedly voting
against changing campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been horrendous raising funds for this campaign,'' said
Ms. Ferraro, who supports requiring full disclosure of all campaign
finance information and providing free television air time for
candidates, among other changes. If raising funds ``doesn't
corrupt, it certainly gives the perception of corruption,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ms. Ferraro had hoped to revitalize the primary race with
strong words, she may have been disappointed. Her appearance here
in Westchester County was lightly publicized, and only a few
passersby stopped to listen as she spoke on the village green. Most
of her speech, which lasted 20 minutes, was delivered to three
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even afterward, reaction was tepid at a private brunch where,
along with a gubernatorial candidate, Betsy McCaughey Ross, and an
attorney general candidate, state Sen. Catherine Abate, Ms. Ferraro
spoke to about 100 local Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Weisberg, who had driven to Bedford on an
antiques-buying trip, noticed Ms. Ferraro speaking on the village
green and wandered over to ask her whether she thought D'Amato's
fight against Swiss banks on behalf of Holocaust survivors had been
motivated simply by political opportunism. She responded that
whatever the motive, D'Amato's achievement was undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   ``She projects an honesty that could be very good for
Congress,'' Weisberg said later.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro, who once taught school, promised if elected to
fight for 100,000 more teachers statewide. She pledged to protect
Social Security and to push for a higher minimum wage, each an area
where she said D'Amato had let down the electorate.

<P>
   Evidently, being right can excuse at least a few sins.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, when word emerged that President Clinton might
have had a sexual relationship with the former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, public reaction to the news coverage was
overwhelmingly negative.
</P>
<P>
   A public opinion poll by the nonprofit Media Studies Center in
early February found that 36 percent of the respondents said the
media had done a ``good'' or ``excellent'' job on the subject.
Eighty percent of those surveyed said the coverage had been
``excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Another poll done at the same time by another nonprofit
organization, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press,
found that 60 percent of the people said the press was not being
objective enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of public opinion was close to outrage in early
February,'' said Andrew Kohut, research director of the Pew
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a confession makes.
</P>
<P>
   Two surveys released last week, based on polls conducted after
Clinton's recent admission that he did have an ``inappropriate''
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, found that the public's opinion of
the media coverage had improved measurably.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Studies Center reported that almost half of the people
surveyed now say the news media have done a ``good'' or
``excellent'' job. The poll also found that more people now said
they believed that Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky were treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Pew Research Center found a similar change.
Fifty-five percent now gave an assessment of ``excellent'' or
``good'' to the coverage, up from 42 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public was saying, `You told us too much about it, but on
reflection you were right and therefore we think you did a better
job than you were doing in January,''' said Bob Giles, executive
director of the Media Studies Center.

   Ex-Columnist Won't Join Book Tour This Fall
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to promote ``Africans in America'' this fall,
one co-author will be missing in literary action from Harcourt
Brace's planned eight-city tour to promote the weighty book about
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Smith, the former Boston Globe columnist _ who helped
write the book as a companion to a four-part public television
documentary on slavery _ will not participate in a book tour,
because her personal trouble could overshadow news coverage of the
title, said the editor in chief of Harcourt's adult division, Jane
Isay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to talk about the book and not her situation,''
Ms. Isay said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith was forced to resign from The Globe this summer after
admitting that she had fabricated characters in four recent
columns. A review by the newspaper turned up evidence of
fabrications in 48 other columns.
</P>
<P>
   Before her resignation, Ms. Smith submitted the manuscript for
``Africans in America,'' a nonfiction account of slavery from the
landing in Jamestown to the Civil War. The account was based on
material gathered by a documentary research team for WGBH in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith's co-author, Charles Johnson _ who won the National
Book Award for ``The Middle Passage'' in 1990 _ wrote short fiction
stories inspired by the same WGBH research.
</P>
<P>
   The final manuscript was reviewed by WGBH, said Ms. Isay, who
praised Ms. Smith's writing as ``outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been checked and double-checked and we stand by it,'' Ms.
Isay said.

   California Couple Sue Horse-Savvy Author
</P>
<P>
   The gushing publicity for the best-selling author Monty Roberts
likens him to a compassionate ``real-life horse whisperer'' who is
a hybrid of gentle James Herriot and straight-talking John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberts, a well-known horse trainer and author of ``The Man
Who Listens to Horses,'' is now facing a lawsuit filed by a wealthy
California couple who say that their thoroughbred suffered a broken
leg and improper treatment during a controversial experiment
presided over by Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The suit grew out of a BBC documentary, which filmed Roberts
last year as he demonstrated horse-gentling techniques on a wild
mustang, which ultimately was allowed to choose between returning
to the California desert of the Cuyama Valley and joining with
tamed horses.
</P>
<P>
   Charging fraud and negligence, Carolyn and Christopher Carradine
_ the brother of the actor Keith Carradine _ say they boarded their
horse, Big Red Fox, at Roberts' 186-acre Solvang farm because of
his humane training techniques. But they contend that Roberts used
their horse initially in the wild mustang project without their
permission.
</P>
<P>
   During the documentary's second stage, the couple permitted
their horse to participate, but they contend that Roberts
unexpectedly released Big Red into the wild and offered only
minimal care after the horse was found later with bruises, cuts and
a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're outraged,'' said Gerard Fox, a Los Angeles lawyer who
filed the civil lawsuit for the Carradines in Santa Barbara
Superior Court in April. ``They feel that their horse was used as a
guinea pig, and Monty showed a very aggressive side. You're talking
about two very sophisticated individuals who felt they were being
sold a bill of goods.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carradines are seeking up to $100,000 for expenses like
veterinary care, plus an unspecified amount in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who earlier this year was honored for his humane
treatment of horses by the American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, did not respond when messages were left seeking
comments on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   His publicist, Diana DeRosa, said she was with Roberts during
the BBC filming and witnessed his efforts to care for Big Red.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely attentive, and a vet was right there,'' Ms.
DeRosa said. ``It was the middle of the night and they ended up
driving about a hundred miles to the closest vet because the owner
wanted a second opinion. The vet was right there when it happened
and he was not overly concerned. He took care of it and said this
is not a bad wound.''

   An HBO Advertisement Makes the Front Page
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper's front page as advertising space?
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, the front pages of the metro and late city editions
of The New York Post read: ``U.S. to Terrorists: Take That!''
</P>
<P>
   But on the front page of a few thousand specially printed vanity
editions that turned up on the desks of media executives,
television critics, restaurateurs and other New York taste makers
was an advertisement for HBO's movie ``The Rat Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   The headline read: ``Comin' At Ya Sat. 9PM HBO.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls placed to editors on the Post's news desk that night
yielded more questions than answers: ``I don't know what you're
talking about. What advertisement? Maybe it was a hoax.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000 or so papers with the HBO headline were a promotional
stunt paid for by HBO, a subsidiary of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was simply a paid promotion,'' said Howard Rubenstein, a
spokesman for Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The Post and its parent,
News Corp. ``From time to time, the New York Post prints a few
thousand copies for advertising purposes at the end of a run.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers were not distributed to the public or sold at
newsstands, Rubenstein said.

 &HT;    ONE YEAR AFTER DIANA'S DEATH, MOURNERS GATHER IN PARIS
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON Jr.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Catherine Jones solemnly set out the 36 candles she
crafted in Diana's likeness around the golden ``Flamme de la
Liberte'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, an artist from Vancouver, Canada, painted each of the
8-inch likenesses of Diana, her crowned blond head bowed shyly over
an evening dress, and brought them to the Place de l'Alma to give
expression to her feelings about Diana. There was one candle for
each of Diana's years at the time of her death last Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to do something through my art to take note of
one of the most important global happenings,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Place de l'Alma lies above the tunnel where the black
Mercedes Benz bearing Diana, her boyfriend Dodi al-Fayed, a driver
and a bodyguard crashed, killing all but the bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   The golden flame was a gift from Americans to thank France on
the centennial of its presentation of the Statue of Liberty, but
over the past year it has become a monument to the princess of
Wales. Messages to the late princess are scrawled all over the
20-foot-tall gold-plated sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the flame became a focal point for people marking the
anniversary of Diana's death. Throughout the day people brought
flowers and cards, photographs, teddy bears, and even hairbrushes,
to leave at the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   At the exact moment of Diana's death _ 12:26 a.m. local time
Monday (6:26 EDT Sunday) _ the 36 candles circling the base of the
sculpture flickered in a soft Parisian breeze. But the candlelight
was washed out in the glare of TV cameras on hand to capture the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the unofficial commemoration was touted as a major
event expected to draw 10,000 mourners, the crowd _ not counting
the mass of reporters, cameramen and photographers _ rarely
exceeded 40 to 50 people. Of those, most were tourists attracted to
the flame by the lights glinting off its gold skin.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of reporters to tourists and mourners at times
was such that TV crews waited in line to capture the observations
of people with guidebooks in their pockets and cameras dangling
around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much emotion, is there?'' observed Martin Buckley,
a Tewkesbury, England, resident who watched attentively from a
nearby bench. ``I have seen only a few people actually come here to
mourn and show feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Buckley spent three nights sleeping outside
Westminster Abbey in London in order to be at the front of the
crowd gathered for Diana's wedding. He and his parents were among
the first to tour Althorp House, on the family estate where Diana
is buried. He intends to write a book chronicling his personal
journey through Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Auberge, who stayed an hour at the flame with her two
small children, said she came because of her feelings about Diana.
``She was so wonderful, so human, with all the human frailties and
qualities that make people interesting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' said the woman as she hoisted one of her little ones on
a hip, ``she was a wonderful mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony in Paris, organized by a private group called Paris
Odysee, began a series of events that some in London have come to
call ``Diana Day.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, state flags will fly at half-staff, there will be
prayers at Westminster Abbey, and a fountain commemorating the
princess and Dodi will be unveiled at Harrod's department store,
owned by Dodi's father, Mohammad al-Fayed.
</P>
<P>
   Bouquets of flowers were placed outside Kensington Palace, the
scene of massive displays of grief a year ago. Even though the
London newspapers were reporting on the ``Diana fatigue'' brought
on by media overkill of the anniversary, each of them devoted
substantial space to remembering the princess.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Althorp House in Northamptonshire, 3,000 people lined up
to tour the estate before it is closed to the public Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the royal family will hold a private ceremony in
Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where Diana's sons, William and Harry,
were informed a year ago of her death. Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his wife, Cherie, also are expected to attend the service.
</P>
<P>
   There have been few public comments from members of the royal
family or other important public figures on the subject of Diana's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham Palace issued a brief statement Sunday afternoon.
``The queen and the royal family, particularly the prince of Wales,
Prince William and Prince Harry, would like to thank people for
their messages and kind gestures of sympathy at this sad time and
for sharing their remembrances of the princess of Wales.''

expression to her feelings about Diana. There was one candle for
each of Diana's years at the time of her death last Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to do something through my art to take note of
one of the most important global happenings,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Place de l'Alma lies above the tunnel where the black
Mercedes Benz bearing Diana, her boyfriend Dodi al-Fayed, a driver
and a bodyguard crashed, killing all but the bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   The golden flame was a gift from Americans to thank France on
the centennial of its presentation of the Statue of Liberty, but
over the past year it has become a monument to the princess of
Wales. Messages to the late princess are scrawled all over the
20-foot-tall gold-plated sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the flame became a focal point for people marking the
anniversary of Diana's death. Throughout the day people brought
flowers and cards, photographs, teddy bears, and even hairbrushes,
to leave at the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   At the exact moment of Diana's death _ 12:26 a.m. local time
Monday (6:26 EDT Sunday) _ the 36 candles circling the base of the
sculpture flickered in a soft Parisian breeze. But the candlelight
was washed out in the glare of TV cameras on hand to capture the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the unofficial commemoration was touted as a major
event expected to draw 10,000 mourners, the crowd _ not counting
the mass of reporters, cameramen and photographers _ rarely
exceeded 40 to 50 people. Of those, most were tourists attracted to
the flame by the lights glinting off its gold skin.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of reporters to tourists and mourners at times
was such that TV crews waited in line to capture the observations
of people with guidebooks in their pockets and cameras dangling
around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much emotion, is there?'' observed Martin Buckley,
a Tewkesbury, England, resident who watched attentively from a
nearby bench. ``I have seen only a few people actually come here to
mourn and show feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Buckley spent three nights sleeping outside
Westminster Abbey in London in order to be at the front of the
crowd gathered for Diana's wedding. He and his parents were among
the first to tour Althorp House, on the family estate where Diana
is buried. He intends to write a book chronicling his personal
journey through Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Auberge, who stayed an hour at the flame with her two
small children, said she came because of her feelings about Diana.
``She was so wonderful, so human, with all the human frailties and
qualities that make people interesting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' said the woman as she hoisted one of her little ones on
a hip, ``she was a wonderful mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony in Paris, organized by a private group called Paris
Odysee, began a series of events that some in London have come to
call ``Diana Day.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, state flags will fly at half-staff, there will be
prayers at Westminster Abbey, and a fountain commemorating the
princess and Dodi will be unveiled at Harrod's department store,
owned by Dodi's father, Mohammad al-Fayed.
</P>
<P>
   Bouquets of flowers were placed outside Kensington Palace, the
scene of massive displays of grief a year ago. Even though the
London newspapers were reporting on the ``Diana fatigue'' brought
on by media overkill of the anniversary, each of them devoted
substantial space to remembering the princess.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Althorp House in Northamptonshire, 3,000 people lined up
to tour the estate before it is closed to the public Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the royal family will hold a private ceremony in
Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where Diana's sons, William and Harry,
were informed a year ago of her death. Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his wife, Cherie, also are expected to attend the service.
</P>
<P>
   There have been few public comments from members of the royal
family or other important public figures on the subject of Diana's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham Palace issued a brief statement Sunday afternoon.
``The queen and the royal family, particularly the prince of Wales,
Prince William and Prince Harry, would like to thank people for
their messages and kind gestures of sympathy at this sad time and
for sharing their remembrances of the princess of Wales.''

 McGWIRE'S USE OF QUESTIONABLE SUBSTANCE RAISES ISSUES FAR BEYOND(Duplication warning: also moving in `a' category) 
(nk) 
 By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, the brawny St. Louis Cardinals first baseman, has
become a folk hero to many people for his skill at hitting home
runs, baseball's most dramatic _ and clear-cut _ feat. The ball
flies out of the park, or it doesn't. But McGwire's recent
admission that he has used a testosterone-boosting compound for the
past year has led him and his fans into a place where uncertainties
abound.
</P>
<P>
   The substance used by McGwire, called androstenedione and
originally developed by East Germany's state-sponsored athletic
drug program in the 1970s, in many ways epitomizes the new wave of
performance drugs that is sweeping through the sports world, and
its use underscores the ambiguities and questions that have arisen:
What do these substances do? How can they be detected? Should they
be legal? If they are legal, is it ethically right to take them?
How should fans feel about athletes who do?
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the top team in the Tour de France was expelled
after a team car was discovered to have a trunk-load of drugs,
including a blood-thickener and drugs that mask steroids. Earlier
this month, two former Olympic gold medalists from the United
States, shot-putter Randy Barnes and sprinter Dennis Mitchell, were
suspended by track and field's world governing body for suspected
drug use. Members of the Chinese national swim team were banned
earlier this year after vials of human growth hormone were seized
in their possession.
</P>
<P>
   In all of those cases, the drugs were _ unlike traditional
anabolic steroids _ not directly detectable by current lab tests.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is compounded by big money and science,
intertwined in the so-called natural supplement and additives
industry that has arisen in the past few years following federal
deregulation. The loosening of the laws dealing with food
supplements _ intended to encourage the market for herbal remedies
and natural products _ created an opening for products like
androstenedione (pronounced an-dro-steen-DIE-own) which can be
derived from things like the Mexican yam plant and the Scottish
white pine. Manufacturers and medical experts say these products
would not have been available over the counter under the old Food
and Drug Administration rules.
</P>
<P>
   By calling a substance a supplement and carefully avoiding any
claims that it can cure a medical condition, a product can be
labeled a food even though in most of the world it is a controlled
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's opened the door for a lot of people to push the limits of
the law,'' Millard Baker said of the 1994 law. Baker is the founder
and editor in chief of Mesomorphosis, an on-line magazine that
follows the supplement and muscle-building industry.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in the law have also altered how the United States
is regarded in the world sports community and have changed American
attitudes, medical experts say, about products that might once have
seemed risky, but which can now be purchased over-the-counter like
vitamins or painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   Sports trainers and athletes say that what was once unthinkable
has become common _ foreign athletes are coming to the United
States to buy performance-enhancing substances like androstenedione
that are illegal in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other substances like creatine, an amino acid powder
also said to help build muscles, have become as unremarkable as
free weights in locker rooms from high school on up to the
professional teams. Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, who has been
running neck and neck with McGwire in the race to break Roger
Maris' single-season home run record, is one of many athletes who
has said he takes creatine. Creatine has not raised the same alarms
as androstenedione, but physicians say that its long-term effects
are not known.
</P>
<P>
   And all that adds up to big profits. The supplement industry had
$12 billion in sales last year, up from $8 billion before the
federal law took effect, according to Nutrition Business Journal, a
trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a multilevel conflict _ for drug-detection labs
and suppliers, each racing to keep ahead of the other; for athletes
who are, as always, pressured to find and keep a competitive edge,
and for fans who must decide what they want or do not want their
sports heroes to be.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is banned by the National Football League, the
International Olympic Committee and the National Collegiate
Athletic Association, which also ban all anabolic steroids. Federal
law treats anabolic steroids as a controlled substance, available
only by prescription. Major League Baseball bans illegal drugs and
a list of other substances, including anabolic steroids. The
National Basketball Association currently has no drug policy that
includes testing for steroids, and the National Hockey League bans
only illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   General Nutrition Centers, one of the biggest retail chains,
does not sell androstenedione because it says it is not yet
convinced that it is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between what is effective and legal and what is
effective and illegal is fading _ it's not clear anymore because
the people who are making these other substances are getting very
good and they are finding ways to dim the line,'' said Harold
Connolly, a former Olympic hammer-thrower and world record-holder
who used steroids in the 1960s and is now against their use.
</P>
<P>
   The man generally regarded as the father of androstenedione
production in United States _ an Illinois chemist named Patrick
Arnold, who translated German medical documents and patents in the
mid-1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union _ said he thinks the
product is safe when taken correctly. Unlike traditional steroids,
which can make testosterone levels soar to dangerous levels,
so-called precursor substances like androstenedione are converted
to testosterone within the body. Arnold said he thinks the body can
create only so much testosterone by this method and no more _ the
rest, he said, simply gets washed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take more, you cannot breach this ceiling, so far as we
can tell,'' he said. ``You will not reach superphysiological
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now the news about McGwire, and the confusion about whether
scientists like Arnold are correct, seems to have sparked efforts
to reconsider the new compounds and the supplement industry in
general.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball and its players union said they would look
at the medical and performance aspects. The International Olympic
Committee proposed setting up a special agency to coordinate drug
testing around the world. The Association of Professional Team
Physicians, an organization made up of doctors from most major
league sports in the United States, this week called on Major
League Baseball to denounce and ban androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales of health and performance-enhancement products
have surged from the publicity, and companies are racing ahead with
new products. This week, Met-Rx, a company in Irvine, Calif., with
which Arnold is affiliated, said that it is developing a new gum
that boosts testosterone _ three times more effectively than the
stuff McGwire takes, company officials boast _ while you chew.
Another company has developed a steroid that dissolves under the
tongue. Advertising copy on the Internet bursts with claims about
everything from better state of mind to heightened sexual
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much more than pharmacology to the McGwire story.
In many ways, McGwire's testing of his own limits at the plate has
become a test for Americans in general, experts in ethics and
sports say.
</P>
<P>
   Should there be limits, either in morality or law, on how much
and through what means an individual can improve upon fate or
genes? Should enhancement efforts for athletes be considered
differently from the efforts of ordinary people to improve their
states of mind through drugs like Prozac, their sexual performance
with Viagra or their hairlines with drugs like Propecia? What, in a
time of exploding interest and economic growth in natural herbal
substances and medicines, is a drug? What does the term ``natural''
even mean?
</P>
<P>
   Many drug monitors say that as testing has improved, ``natural''
substances _ harder to detect in the body, and with a legal base of
operations under the federal food supplement law _ have become the
last refuge for cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's world, athletes who are determined to cheat know
that natural substances are the way to go,'' said Dr. Don Catlin, a
professor of medicine and pharmacology at UCLA and a member of the
medical commission of the International Olympic Committee, which
specifically banned androstenedione late last year. Catlin said
that many newer substances, including androstenedione, cannot be
detected by current tests and are new enough that many leagues have
not formed policies about their use _ which makes them attractive
to athletes on multiple levels. ``And there's a whole cornucopia of
other things right behind it,'' Catlin said. ``That's where things
are going.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the questions even more is that McGwire, in chasing
one of the most hallowed records in sports, has tapped into a vein
of romance and nostalgia for a supposedly sunnier, more innocent
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this taps some pretty deep roots about what sport
means to us _ because it's baseball and baseball has a special
place in the American psyche,'' said Tom Murray, director of the
Center for Biomedical Ethics at Case Western Reserve University and
a member of the anti-doping committee of the U.S. Olympic
Committee. ``Ultimately, this is a question about values. I think
people are really struggling with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most awkwardly, perhaps, people are struggling with what to tell
young people, both about what is safe and about what, if anything,
it means that a star like McGwire, a man with a wealth of positive
attributes, looks for a controversial edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of telling kids not to take it, he comes out and says,
in effect, `It's OK because it's allowed,''' said Dr. Lewis
Maharam, the president of the New York chapter of the American
College of Sports Medicine. ``He needs to say, `What I'm doing for
me is my business, but for you kids, there's evidence that this
stuff is like steroids _ listen to your doctors and don't be buying
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some professional athletes, while not criticizing McGwire for
his supplement use, say he has to be careful because so many kids
hang on his every word and deed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of kids out there who think that if the home run
king is doing it, then I should be doing it,'' said Mark Jackson, a
point guard for the Indiana Pacers. ``It's time for him to put out
his own warning label for the kids of America, to tell them that no
one knows the long-term effects of what he is using and it could
prove to be harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many baseball fans, including parents of young children, say
that they are willing to give McGwire the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fault him for trying to enhance his performance,''
said Larry Rhine, a chiropractor from Allentown, Pa., who was in
Williamsport, Pa., last week with his 8-year-old son, Mark,
watching the Little League World Series. ``If he's within the legal
bounds of Major League Baseball, it shouldn't taint him at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhine added that his son did not seem to be having any second
thoughts either: Mark still got up every morning eager to see if
McGwire or Sosa had hit another home run, Rhine said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Arnold, the chemist, agreed in an interview that no one under 18
should think of using androstenedione. He said that the company he
is working with, Met-Rx, is careful to put such warnings on its
products. But he admitted that the implications of such use are
largely unknown. A 16-year-old male, for example, whose body is
already producing a bumper crop of testosterone, probably would not
be harmed by taking the compound, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's sort of an unknown,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that sell supplements say that business has never been
better. Chico Laney, who started a mail-order supplement company
called Muscle Up out of his parents' house in San Jose, Calif.,
three months ago, said that before the McGwire story broke, sales
were slow _ sometimes only one order a week. Over the past week,
however, he had received six to seven orders a day, mainly for
androstenedione, which he gets from an Oregon manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Laney said that at least one of the calls was from a 45-year-old
man who had heard that boosting testosterone would cure impotence.
Laney said he was not sure, because he really did not know himself
what androstenedione would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't guarantee that it was going to do that,'' Laney said.
``I told him to call back, because I'd be curious to know.''

stuff is like steroids _ listen to your doctors and don't be buying
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some professional athletes, while not criticizing McGwire for
his supplement use, say he has to be careful because so many kids
hang on his every word and deed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of kids out there who think that if the home run
king is doing it, then I should be doing it,'' said Mark Jackson, a
point guard for the Indiana Pacers. ``It's time for him to put out
his own warning label for the kids of America, to tell them that no
one knows the long-term effects of what he is using and it could
prove to be harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many baseball fans, including parents of young children, say
that they are willing to give McGwire the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fault him for trying to enhance his performance,''
said Larry Rhine, a chiropractor from Allentown, Pa., who was in
Williamsport, Pa., last week with his 8-year-old son, Mark,
watching the Little League World Series. ``If he's within the legal
bounds of Major League Baseball, it shouldn't taint him at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhine added that his son did not seem to be having any second
thoughts either: Mark still got up every morning eager to see if
McGwire or Sosa had hit another home run, Rhine said.

   Arnold, the chemist, agreed in an interview that no one under 18
should think of using androstenedione. He said that the company he
is working with, Met-Rx, is careful to put such warnings on its
products. But he admitted that the implications of such use are
largely unknown. A 16-year-old male, for example, whose body is
already producing a bumper crop of testosterone, probably would not
be harmed by taking the compound, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's sort of an unknown,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that sell supplements say that business has never been
better. Chico Laney, who started a mail-order supplement company
called Muscle Up out of his parents' house in San Jose, Calif.,
three months ago, said that before the McGwire story broke, sales
were slow _ sometimes only one order a week. Over the past week,
however, he had received six to seven orders a day, mainly for
androstenedione, which he gets from an Oregon manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Laney said that at least one of the calls was from a 45-year-old
man who had heard that boosting testosterone would cure impotence.
Laney said he was not sure, because he really did not know himself
what androstenedione would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't guarantee that it was going to do that,'' Laney said.
``I told him to call back, because I'd be curious to know.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   The recent lines for Powerball tickets took me back to my days
during World War II when I fought in the trenches _ on Manhattan
Island. I was a stocking runner, so to speak. Nylon then was used
only for parachutes and there was an acute shortage of hosiery. And
so it was that I began my career of standing in lines.
</P>
<P>
   A year or so before V-J Day, a limited supply of silk hose
became available in New York. Only one place made them available to
the public, one pair per week if you were willing to stand in line
at 6 a.m. on Saturday _ the store opened at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   No one in her right mind wanted to do it, but if you could find
a greedy 12-year-old who never had enough movie money, you could
employ her as a surrogate. My aunt hired me without so much as an
interview, and each week I manned my post at 6 a.m., a thermos of
hot chocolate and a doughnut in hand, leaning on a building or
sitting on the sidewalk until the store opened.
</P>
<P>
   I was not alone. Soon the ``regulars'' got to know one another
and we whiled away the time eating, reading, chatting.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war we could buy three pairs a week, so I
enrolled my mother and grandmother as customers as well. My
commission was 50 percent of the $2 cost, $1 a week from each of
them, enough for the latest John Payne movie, and if I went to a
matinee, a snack of Necco wafers or Jujubes, too, or a hot fudge
sundae at Schrafft's. I could have been on my way to being a tycoon
but somehow the profits were invested in Hollywood or my stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I refined these skills and adapted them to securing
standing room at the Metropolitan Opera or ``My Fair Lady.'' Being
a New Yorker is to know about standing and waiting. And about
making a buck.

   Gladys M. Distler was taking in the exhibition of Chaim Soutine
paintings at the Jewish Museum _ thickly painted canvases with bold
colors and distorted figures. Two other women were nearby, and as
she was leaving, she heard one say to the other, ``He's a good
painter _ but not for my living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I was in a packed matinee of ``Madeline'' with my 5{-year-old
niece and her father, across the aisle from a very noisy 4- or
5-year-old. A woman behind us finally blurted out, ``Can't you at
least try to control your child?'' The child's mother turned and
said, ``It's a children's movie _ that's what children do.''
</P>
<P>
   The other woman replied, ``But there are other children here who
are quiet and we can't hear because of yours.''
</P>
<P>
   The testy exchange continued until finally the mother of the
noisy child said, ``Would you like to step outside and settle
this?'' It took three nearby men to calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
   I love R-rated action movies, where bad guys are shot and
buildings get blown up. But it was only at ``Madeline,'' a G-rated
movie for children, that I got to see real New York City mean
street action.

   Dr. Samuel I. Joseph was at the delicatessen counter of a market
in Baltimore when he heard a customer addressing the clerk. ``I'd

95-year-old father and 94-year-old mother to the doctor in
Brooklyn. As they were en route to the examination room, both
parents using canes, they passed through the waiting room where a
dozen elderly patients were silently waiting to be called.
</P>
<P>
   When his parents were finished and the three were leaving, again
via the waiting room, O'Hara stopped and with one parent clinging
to each arm, said in a loud voice, ``Which one of you is going to
drive home?'' The men and women in the waiting room broke up
laughing, and began talking to one another. O'Hara was pleased, and
his pleasure lasted until he got outside. His car had a ticket.

   Weekend angst in the Hamptons department:
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Howard Purcell was having a Saturday night party and
the road was lined with cars. The host saw a stranger coming up the
driveway and went to the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a fund-raiser?'' the stranger asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, he was told; it was a private party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to do,'' the stranger said wistfully. ``I'm
hoping to find a fund-raiser to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he or didn't he? We'll never know.

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   It was very hot. I was the only customer at my favorite small
consignment shop, looking for a summer dress.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a woman burst through the door. Out of breath, she
panted her way to a saleswoman. She was desperate. ``I need white
pants,'' she breathed. In a matter of minutes, the saleswoman
pulled out a few pairs of white pants in different styles. She held
up the first pair _ white linen bell-bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate customer took one look. ``Oh no, not in a million
years,'' she said. ``Maybe not even then.''

LUKE FINLAY, 91, GENERAL AND LOBBYIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Md.)  (ll) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luke William Finlay, a retired lawyer, legislative lobbyist for
the oil industry and general who moved troops and supplies in World
War II, died on Tuesday at his home in Annapolis, Md. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Finlay, in his military role, kept the trains running when labor
disputes threatened to bring them to a halt during and just after
the war. He also served the Truman administration as a civilian
aide, helping carry out the Marshall Plan and shaping the NATO.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating with honors from the U.S. Military Academy in
1928, he entered the Army Corps of Engineers and was posted to his
native Tennessee and the Mississippi River flood control project.
He also worked on the Nicaraguan Canal Survey.
</P>
<P>
   When President Herbert Hoover released officers like him from
their obligation in order to reduce Federal spending as the
Depression took hold, Finlay entered Yale Law School, from which he
graduated in 1933 at the top of his class. He joined the New York
firm of Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell as a personal assistant to John
Davis, who was the Democratic nominee for President in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   Finlay chose New Deal labor legislation as his specialty and
drew the attention of a Davis Polk client, Standard Oil of New
Jersey, now Exxon. It hired him away in 1938 to be a legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   He was recalled to active duty in World War II and rose to the
rank of brigadier general as the executive officer of the Army
Transportation Corps. He coordinated the movements of men, materiel
and sundry supplies around the world, for which he received the
Distinguished Service Medal.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, President Harry S. Truman relied on Finlay's
military and labor-law expertise to head off a strike against the
country's railroads. The railroads were nationalized, in effect
bringing the would-be strikers under the command of the Army
Transportation Corps.
</P>
<P>
   He rejoined Standard Oil after the war. But President Truman
recruited him three more times and made him a top-grade civil
servant in the process. Finlay directed the nationalization of the
railroads once again at a time of labor trouble in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 he was sent to Paris as deputy for defense affairs in
the Office of the United States Special Representative in Europe.
The office played a central role in administering the Marshall Plan
and shaping the NATO alliance. Finlay earned the Distinguished
Public Service Award.
</P>
<P>
   Between such government assignments, Finlay served Standard Oil
with increasingly higher responsibilities in Europe. The company
then brought him back to New York in 1962 and appointed him manager
for government relations. He retired from the company in 1969 but
continued to represent it as a lawyer for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Finlay is survived by three daughters, Anne Schenck of New
Haven, Leila Dane of McLean, Va., and Susan Chavez of Annapolis;
two sons, Luke Jr., of Annapolis, and Michael, of Stamford, Conn.;
14 grandchildren, and 19 great-grandchildren. His wife, Annie Sue
Tucker Finlay, died in 1991 after 63 years of marriage.

RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT'S SQUABBLING POLITICIANS MAKE LITTLE PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds name of Stallone film, moves up background info., polishing
throughout.)  (See also RUSSIA-U.S. and RUSSIA-ASSESS)

 By Michael Gordon   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With great fanfare, Kremlin aides and Russian lawmakers
announced a new accord Sunday that would ease the bitter standoff
over power-sharing between President Boris Yeltsin and the
Communist-dominated parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But within a few hours, the much-celebrated breakthrough _ which
was intended to pave the way for Viktor Chernomyrdin's confirmation
as prime minister _ broke down, as the nation's political leaders
squabbled on national television.
</P>
<P>
   With Chernomyrdin's nomination scheduled to come before the
parliament on Monday and U.S. President Bill Clinton set to arrive
for a summit meeting the following day, Russian politics swung from
statesmanship to farce.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have watched helplessly in recent weeks as their
currency has shrunk in value, prices have soared, Yeltsin has
fought off a chorus of demands that he resign and his previous
prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, was unceremoniously ousted.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday night's live debate on the NTV television network,
Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, set the tone by declaring
that he had not authorized his party's representative to endorse
the accord in the talks early on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov said he did not trust Yeltsin to adhere to the accord
and then declared that he would order party members to vote against
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole faction will vote against Chernomyrdin,'' Zyuganov
said sternly. ``Mr. Chernomyrdin is an accomplice with Yeltsin in
the destruction of the past years.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought a tart rejoinder from Alexander Shokhin, the leader
of Chernomyrdin's parliamentary faction, who summoned up the
specter of a complete political and economic meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin warned ominously that the Communist refusal to approve
Chernomyrdin and back the accord could eventually lead to the
dissolution of the parliament, although the compromise agreement
was intended to preclude just that.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party,
punctuated the raucous debate by proclaiming that he was ashamed of
Russia's politicians and financial barons for their inability to
exercise a modicum of statesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that I am ashamed about everything I hear around
me now,'' said Yavlinsky, who then insisted on treating the nation
to a lengthy sermon on his own political platform and who said that
he would join Zyuganov in opposing Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Then the live debate over the future of Russia's economic and
political system was suspended so the network could present a
Sylvester Stallone action film, ``Assassins.'' Live coverage of the
debate resumed in the evening, as the politicians took telephone
questions from skeptical viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In the helter-skelter world of Russian politics, it was possible
that much of this was posturing and that with a few tweaks and
symbolic concessions, the delicately balanced compromise could be
put back together again.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Chernomyrdin's nomination is defeated in the parliament
on Monday, it might be nothing more than a prelude for more
negotiating over jobs and policy. It took three tries for
parliament to approve Kiriyenko in April.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's economy spinning out of control, however, the
nation does not appear to have time for politics as usual. Seen
through the filter of Sunday night's television debate, Russia's
political system seemed at times to be on the verge of a nervous
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the way the script was supposed to read. With its
currency plunging and its banks slipping into bankruptcy, Russia's
politicians had sought a truce that would enable them to try to put
the nation's house in order.
</P>
<P>
   After days of behind-the-scenes negotiations, they had hoped to
proclaim a kind of nonaggression pact that would guarantee a
measure of political stability over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the parliament would promise not to seek
Yeltsin's impeachment. He would agree, in turn, not to dissolve the
legislature. Chernomyrdin would become prime minister and Yeltsin
would restrain his proclivity for mass firings.
</P>
<P>
   The accord's distribution of powers would have preserved much of
the president's prerogatives. He would have retained his right to
hire and fire the heads of Russia's so-called ``power ministries,''
the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Ministry and the Interior
Ministry. That would enable the executive branch to conduct foreign
policy and prevent disorder at home.
</P>
<P>
   There would, however, have been some unspecified constitutional
changes. Within a month the parliament was to have drafted
constitutional amendments to shift some power from the executive to
legislative branch.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how this was to be done was unclear, and Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist figure, complained Sunday night
that by the time amendments were written, Yeltsin would have his
prime minister in place and would be free to ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   A new commission was to be set up under the accord to monitor
state-owned television networks, which the Communists complain are
biased against them.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin himself suggested that he did not envision speedy
changes. He said in a recently taped interview that was shown on
television Sunday night that the process of amending the
constitution could take a year _ an eternity in Russian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to promote his candidacy, Chernomyrdin sought to portray
himself as the man to unify the nation during its moment of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruble is hanging on a thin thread,'' Chernomyrdin said.
``Time must not be lost. The country cannot function without a
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's words did little to hide the fact that he has not
presented anything remotely like a plan to extract the nation from
one of its worst financial crises since the collapse of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of 25,000 Russians conducted by the NTV network Sunday
indicated that 90 percent of them did not believe Chernomyrdin, the
once _ and, perhaps, future _ prime minister, would be able to end
the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   While Chernomyrdin was trying vainly to rally the nation, the
roof fell in.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Communists were in disarray as well. In
repudiating the accord, Zyuganov broke with Gennady Seleznyov, the
Communist speaker of parliament, who was among those who heralded
the accord earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the parliament's other left-wing parties _ the
Agrarian Party and People's Power _ said they were stunned by
Zyuganov's decision to turn against the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Ryzhkov, head of People's Power, said Zyuganov's move
was ``not only unexpected but also not understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Communists decided to torpedo this document then they
should not have pulled everyone into working on it,'' Ryzhkov
added. ``Many many hours deep into the night were spent on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, the tycoon who has been trying to orchestrate
Chernomyrdin's return to power, expressed confidence that
Chernomyrdin would ultimately be approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my forecast that Chernomyrdin will be prime minister
irrespective of the way the Duma is going to act,'' Berezovsky
said, referring to the Communist-dominated lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, however, also could not resist the temptation to
settle some political scores. He denounced Russia's leading free
market reformers _ Yegor Gaidar, a former prime minister;
Kiriyenko; and Anatoly Chubais, who was recently sacked by the
Yeltsin government as the representative to the International
Monetary Fund _ as villains who had carried out economic policy
``by Bolshevik methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, for his part, had been expected to endorse the
compromise accord formally on Monday. But after the Communist
flip-flop, it was no longer clear what he would do.
</P>
<P>
   Not all viewers waited through the movie to catch the resumption
of the petulant political debate. Tatyana Ptushkina, a 49-year-old
administrator of a construction company, said she was too appalled
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shameful,'' she said. ``No words can describe what I
just saw. I had to leave the room.''

   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to online privacy, it seems that the
Clinton administration has not been practicing what it preaches.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the administration's sites on the World Wide
Web post the kinds of privacy guidelines that the Federal Trade
Commission recently criticized businesses for failing to post, and
none of the administration's sites offer the special protections
for children that the government recommends for commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even the White House Web site does not meet the standards
recommended by the FTC and endorsed by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the White House site collects e-mail addresses _
and in some cases, home addresses _ through links that allow
visitors to send electronic messages to President and Mrs. Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore and Mrs. Gore. Yet, it does not provide
any notice about how that information will be used by the White
House. Nor does the site ask visitors to its special children's
pages to consult their parents before divulging personal
information, as the administration has recommended.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the FTC released a survey of commercial Web sites along
with a report that was highly critical of industries that gather
information online and, without notifying the visitors to their
sites, use or sell the data for marketing purposes. The report's
findings, particularly with respect to children, prompted the FTC
to recommend that Congress pass a law requiring that online
businesses and Web site operators obtain parental permission before
gathering e-mail addresses or other information from children under
the age of 13.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike operators of commercial sites, federal agencies do not
collect or sell personal data for marketing purposes. The issue,
critics say, is more one of leading by example.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a matter of practicing what they preach,'' said
David Banisar, senior policy analyst and staff counsel at the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, a public interest research
group in Washington. ``They have been pushing notice and consent,
and they can't even do it themselves. They really have a dismal
record on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Banisar also pointed out that while the White House might not be
using the information for marketing purposes, the data could be
transferred to the Democratic National Committee or used for other
political ends.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has endorsed child-protection legislation
that was introduced in response to the FTC report. It has also
endorsed new self-regulation guidelines and enforcement procedures
recently proposed by the Online Privacy Alliance, a coalition of
businesses and associations that seeks to foster privacy
protections. Those guidelines call for all Internet businesses to
clearly post policies concerning the use and collection of personal
information, and they require Web site operators to obtain parental
approval before gathering data from children.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the administration's support for these measures,
the White House Web site collects information from children without
parental notification. Within a special children's section on the
site, a White House tour led by cartoon caricatures of the ``First
Pets,'' Buddy the dog and Socks the cat, ends with an invitation to
send e-mail to President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton or Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic form asks for the sender's name, age, e-mail
address, grade at school, the school's name and, from those
visitors who want a response, a home postal address. The site does
not advise children to ask their parents before divulging that
information.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has an area
for children, like that of the White House site, that offers the
opportunity to send an e-mail message, yet does not display a
privacy policy or request that children seek parental permission
before giving out e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Web site provides links to 70 Web sites of
federal agencies, Cabinet departments and White House offices and
commissions. Of those 70 sites, only 12 had posted privacy policies
as of Friday afternoon. That amounts to 17 percent of the sites
surveyed, only slightly better than the 14 percent of commercial
sites that, according to the FTC's report, had clearly posted
privacy policies earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, the vice president's office and Mrs. Clinton's
press office did not respond directly to questions about the Web
sites' lack of a posted privacy policy. But administration
officials stressed that in May, Clinton ordered the Office of
Management and Budget to conduct an agency-by-agency review to
ensure that new technologies were not violating the Privacy Act or
otherwise eroding privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget said the
agency was drafting guidelines for federal Web sites.

</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top adviser on Internet issues, Ira Magaziner, said on
Thursday that the administration was working ``to get its own house
in order.'' Magaziner also noted that unlike the private sector,
government agencies are bound by the Privacy Act to protect
personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are privacy principles being followed,'' Magaziner said.
``And we are taking steps to ensure that government agencies are in
fact in a more visible way confirming that.''
</P>
<P>
   Government departments and agencies _ but not the White House _
must comply with the Privacy Act, which establishes controls over
personal information collected by the federal government. The act
requires that each agency that maintains records on individuals
inform the person whose data are being collected, by notifying the
individual of that fact either on the form that is used to collect
the information or on a separate form that the person can keep.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Schwartz, a policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a Washington advocacy group, said, ``When they collect
specific information about people, they have to give notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a technical violation of the law,'' he added. ``They
should be posting privacy policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The security of online information obtained by them is crucial,
said Kathryn Montgomery, executive director of the Center for Media
Education, a nonprofit organization has been pushing for
legislation to protect both adults and children on line
</P>
<P>
   ``Where government is concerned,'' Ms. Montgomery said, ``we
need to be very, very careful about data collected on line.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Montgomery also emphasized that she saw a clear
distinction between commercial and noncommercial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``One issue,'' she said, ``is whether we would make a
distinction between commercial enterprises that are collecting
data, selling it and coming back with exploitive personal
advertisements, and noncommercial uses of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the White House has taken a hands-off
approach to Internet commerce, saying that industry should police
itself on issues like consumer privacy. In that arena, the
administration has encouraged online merchants and marketers to
post clearly how the information they collect from consumers is
used and to adopt mechanisms to enforce stated privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the FTC has the most prominent privacy policy
of all of the federal Web sites. The agency declined to comment on
the lack of clearly posted policies by other agencies, saying its
jurisdiction _ and its survey _ covered only commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, who helped
write a report on federal Web site privacy policies a year ago,
said the government ``generally has been better'' than the private
sector in keeping private information confidential. And most
government Web sites that take applications for things like
volunteers and disaster relief, he said, do post privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a question of whether all sites in general that
collect personally identifiable information should have privacy
policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the administration, Schwartz said, ``They should lead by
example.''

FACTS ON ANDROSTENEDIONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with BBN-MCGWIRE-DRUGS) 
(nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Androstenedione is called a precursor to testosterone, the male
hormone, because it is converted to testosterone in the body.
Scientists say there have been hardly any independent studies of
androstenedione. Promotional literature, citing reports from East
Germany, where androstenedione was first synthesized, says it can
temporarily triple testosterone levels from normal in a typical
male who has taken 100 milligrams. High testosterone levels are
said to speed recovery from workouts and help build muscle mass
during the workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists disagree on whether those testosterone levels can be
further elevated with higher doses, or whether _ as the
manufacturers contend _ the body has a built-in ceiling. The
companies say that precursors can boost testosterone only so far
and that anything more is flushed from the body. Other scientists
say they are not so certain, and their concern is that people in
training will take far more than the recommended dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Sustained artificially high levels of testosterone in men have
been linked to a long list of problems, from shrinkage of the
testicles and development of breast tissue to decreased sperm count
and hair loss. In women, high levels can cause growth of facial
hair, loss of menstrual periods and deepening of the voice. They
can lead to stunted height in teen-agers because of changes in bone
growth.

 &HT;    One year after Diana's death, mourners gather in Paris
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Catherine Jones solemnly set out the 36 candles she
crafted in Diana's likeness around the golden ``Flamme de la
Liberte'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, an artist from Vancouver, Canada, painted each of the
8-inch likenesses of Diana, her crowned blond head bowed shyly over
an evening dress, and brought them to the Place de l'Alma to give
expression to her feelings about Diana. There was one candle for
each of Diana's years at the time of her death last Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to do something through my art to take note of
one of the most important global happenings,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Place de l'Alma lies above the tunnel where the black
Mercedes Benz bearing Diana, her boyfriend Dodi al-Fayed, a driver
and a bodyguard crashed, killing all but the bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   The golden flame was a gift from Americans to thank France on
the centennial of its presentation of the Statue of Liberty, but
over the past year it has become a monument to the princess of
Wales. Messages to the late princess are scrawled all over the
20-foot-tall gold-plated sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the flame became a focal point for people marking the
anniversary of Diana's death. Throughout the day people brought
flowers and cards, photographs, teddy bears, and even hairbrushes,
to leave at the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   At the exact moment of Diana's death _ 12:26 a.m. local time
Monday (6:26 EDT Sunday) _ the 36 candles circling the base of the
sculpture flickered in a soft Parisian breeze. But the candlelight
was washed out in the glare of TV cameras on hand to capture the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the unofficial commemoration was touted as a major
event expected to draw 10,000 mourners, the crowd _ not counting
the mass of reporters, cameramen and photographers _ rarely
exceeded 40 to 50 people. Of those, most were tourists attracted to
the flame by the lights glinting off its gold skin.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of reporters to tourists and mourners at times
was such that TV crews waited in line to capture the observations
of people with guidebooks in their pockets and cameras dangling
around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much emotion, is there?'' observed Martin Buckley,
a Tewkesbury, England, resident who watched attentively from a
nearby bench. ``I have seen only a few people actually come here to
mourn and show feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Buckley spent three nights sleeping outside
Westminster Abbey in London in order to be at the front of the
crowd gathered for Diana's wedding. He and his parents were among
the first to tour Althorp House, on the family estate where Diana
is buried. He intends to write a book chronicling his personal
journey through Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Auberge, who stayed an hour at the flame with her two
small children, said she came because of her feelings about Diana.
``She was so wonderful, so human, with all the human frailties and
qualities that make people interesting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' said the woman as she hoisted one of her little ones on
a hip, ``she was a wonderful mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony in Paris, organized by a private group called Paris
Odysee, began a series of events that some in London have come to
call ``Diana Day.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, state flags will fly at half-staff, there will be
prayers at Westminster Abbey, and a fountain commemorating the
princess and Dodi will be unveiled at Harrod's department store,
owned by Dodi's father, Mohammad al-Fayed.
</P>
<P>
   Bouquets of flowers were placed outside Kensington Palace, the
scene of massive displays of grief a year ago. Even though the
London newspapers were reporting on the ``Diana fatigue'' brought
on by media overkill of the anniversary, each of them devoted
substantial space to remembering the princess.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Althorp House in Northamptonshire, 3,000 people lined up
to tour the estate before it is closed to the public Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the royal family will hold a private ceremony in
Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where Diana's sons, William and Harry,
were informed a year ago of her death. Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his wife, Cherie, also are expected to attend the service.
</P>
<P>
   There have been few public comments from members of the royal
family or other important public figures on the subject of Diana's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham Palace issued a brief statement Sunday afternoon.
``The queen and the royal family, particularly the prince of Wales,
Prince William and Prince Harry, would like to thank people for
their messages and kind gestures of sympathy at this sad time and
for sharing their remembrances of the princess of Wales.''

 SPORTS COLUMN: McGWIRE LET HIS TEAM _ AND HIS FANS _ DOWN  
(EDS: In the quote in graf 13, ``owe'' is correct.) 
(lh) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire, a protagonist in one of the best
pieces of theater in America, pulled the curtain down on himself
Saturday afternoon even though the performance had hardly begun. He
did so in a most bizarre, if not selfish and silly, manner, and
within just a few feet of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Matthew McGwire, wearing his father's name and
number _ 25 _ on the back of his Cardinal uniform, has served as a
batboy for parts of the summer: when he comes to town from San
Diego to visit his dad, one Mark David McGwire, a k a Leading
Contender in the Great Home Run Record Chase. On Saturday
afternoon, young McGwire, along with a near-capacity crowd of
47,627 in Busch Stadium, witnessed a remarkable event.
</P>
<P>
   No, he did not see his dad hit yet another home run _ McGwire
had 54 going into Sunday night's game against the Atlanta Braves,
even with Sammy Sosa of the Cubs and eight behind Roger Maris, the
record-holder since 1961. He witnessed his dad being thrown out of
a game, in the first inning, of all things, after arguing a called
third strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was good for Matthew to see that his father has
emotion,'' McGwire said before Sunday night's game. ``It was in the
heat of competition. I was doing whatever I can. I felt the umpire
took an at-bat away from me. So I let them know.''
</P>
<P>
   While emotion is surely part of the makeup of a champion, you
can hurt your team, disappoint a multitude and even damage to a
degree your chances at a historic record as a result of allowing
emotions to get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Plate umpire Sam Holbrook beseeched Tony La Russa, the
Cardinals' manager, who came onto the field to defend his player:
``Tony, please get Mark out of here. I don't want to throw him out
of the game.'' McGwire admitted later that Holbrook had given him
the same warning directly three times.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was in the heat of competition, but the difference
between a professional and an amateur _ at least, the difference
between a professional's response and an amateur's response _ ought
to be that the professional keeps his head.
</P>
<P>
   Cus D'Amato, the late boxing trainer, said that the killer
instinct is something you seek to eliminate, because the fighter
should never lose his poise in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   And McGwire had to have had a good notion of what he was doing.
If the umpire had told him, for example, ``If you say one more
word, it's the magic word, and a piano will fall on your head,''
the odds are McGwire would have exited voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The slugger has professed that the home-run chase is secondary
for him, that the team's results come first. He did not help his
team, however, by being thrown out _ they lost to the Braves, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   When Tom Glavine, the Braves' left-hander, whistled a 3-2 pitch
at or below McGwire's knees, and on or just inside of the plate,
Holbrook shouted strike three as McGwire was already moving toward
first base in anticipation of a ball-four call. Matthew watched
from near the on-deck circle as his father erupted in a fit of
pique. When his dad was thrown out, the fans grew unruly.
</P>
<P>
   They booed until they were hoarse, and then, if Holbrook still
hadn't gotten the drift, flung onto the field baseballs, bottles
and anything else they could find short of themselves. In the old
American tradition, the first thing the fans in the ball park
desired was to moider the umpire. Imagine throwing out the star
attraction, the very person people came from hundreds of miles
around to pay to see, for the fan base of the St. Louis Cardinals
covers nine states, from Arkansas to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mass, ugly, stupid tantrum, but it was a macrocosm of
the tantrum thrown by McGwire. ``I said things to the umpire you
can't say on TV,'' he said. ``Did I cross the line? Yeah, I
probably crossed the line. I owe up to it. He had a right to throw
me out. I'm not any bigger than the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't heed the warning. The ump then had no choice. ``You
are not supposed to argue balls and strikes,'' McGwire said. ``The
umpire did his job. I'm not any bigger than the game.''
</P>
<P>
   This is noble. But McGwire is well aware that a majority of the
fans came solely to see him in his pursuit of the record. When
Humphrey Bogart asked Spencer Tracy what he believed a performer
owed the fans, Tracy replied, ``A good performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 people asked for their money back when McGwire was
ejected. There might have been thousands more _ people who paid
from $6 for a bleacher seat to $24 for a field box _ if it wasn't
clearly stipulated at the ticket window that all sales are final.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire, whose salary is $8.3 million a season plus
incentives, can't reasonably refund the fans who wanted their money
back, he might donate, say, a buck a fan, or $47,627, to a charity
of his choice, as an expression of his acknowledged special
responsibility as a performer.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McGwire would surely understand that emotion, too.

JERRE MANGIONE, 89, WRITER ON ITALIAN IMMIGRANT LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa.)  (ll) 
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerre Mangione, a writer whose thinly veiled memoir of life in a
Sicilian enclave in Rochester, N.Y., became a classic of American
ethnic literature and gave a new name to his boyhood haunts, died
on Aug. 16 at his home in Haverford, Pa. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   His first book, ``Mount Allegro,'' was written as a nonfiction
account of his life as the son of Sicilian immigrants who spent
their lives struggling to offset the view that all Sicilians were
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But a month before publication, Mangione said in an interview in
The New York Times in 1981 that Houghton Mifflin ``insisted on
publishing it as fiction because their sales department decided it
would sell better with that label.'' The writer protested, to no
avail, and acquiesced only to changing the names of the people in
the memoir and to inserting a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer: ``The
characters in this book are fictitious and have fictitious names.
Anyone who thinks he recognizes himself in it is kindly asked to
bear that in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, first published in 1943, was reissued four times by
different publishers, appearing briefly on The Times' fiction
best-seller list and simultaneously on the nonfiction list of The
New York Herald Tribune. About 20 years after the book's first
publication, the city of Rochester officially renamed the
neighborhood after the name given by Mangione to an area ``as flat
as Kansas'' simply because he liked the sound of it.
</P>
<P>
   Mangione graduated from Syracuse University, worked briefly at
Time magazine and then became an editor with the Federal Writers'
Project, which produced a series of guidebooks to the 48 states and
employed writers like Saul Bellow, Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright
and Studs Terkel. Mangione's history of the program, ``The Dream
and the Deal: The Federal Writers' Project, 1935-43,'' was
published in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Mangione became professor in the English department of the
University of Pennsylvania in 1961 and was named emeritus professor
of American literature upon his retirement in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Among the works he produced during his tenure were ``Passion for
Sicilians: The World Around Danilo Dolci'' (1968) and ``An Ethnic
at Large: Memoirs of America in the 30's and 40's'' (1978). On
completing his last book, ``La Storia: Five Centuries of the
Italian-American Experience,'' which he wrote with Ben Morreale,
Mangione was honored by the Library of Congress with an exhibition
of his works and papers.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Patricia, of Haverford; a stepson,
David Evans of Philadelphia; a brother, Frank Mangione of
Rochester, and two sisters, Rita Morticelli of Rochester and Susan
D'Amico of Juno Beach, Fla.

EXTENT OF POLICY DIFFERENCES AMONG DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE AN
ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a remote control clicker in his hand and a
television monitor at his back, Mark Green, a Democratic candidate
for U.S. Senate, whirled through campaign advertisements of one of
his opponents, Charles Schumer, the other afternoon, disputing
Schumer's claims at every frozen frame.
</P>
<P>
   With each pause, Green sought to demonstrate that on many
issues, there was a chasm between himself and Schumer, two of the
three Democrats seeking to unseat Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   On topics including regulating health maintenance organizations
and assuring the future of Social Security _ issues that Schumer,
Green and the third Democratic Senate candidate, Geraldine Ferraro,
say are central to the Sept. 15 primary _ Green asserted that he
held a different and more traditionally Democratic position than
Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Democrats question Green's assessment, and Schumer
himself disputes it. ``There are some differences between us, but
the number of agreements overwhelm the number of differences,'' he
said. `'Overall, his attacks have been specious or trivial.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the actual extent of difference between these two
candidates _ Ms. Ferraro has been absent from this argument, giving
a speech on Sunday in Westchester County that focused entirely on
D'Amato _ has emerged as an ongoing dispute in this otherwise
subdued contest.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the attacks by Green, who asserts that he is the
only true progressive in the race, are not surprising. Green, New
York City's public advocate, has little money for television
advertisements and so has become the squeaky wheel on the political
train, trying to capture the attention that the famous Ferraro can
take for granted and that Schumer can afford to buy through
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But as a matter of policy, the question is decidedly more
complex.
</P>
<P>
   On a handful of issues, the record shows significant differences
between Schumer and Green. But in combing through Schumer's 18
years as a congressman from Brooklyn, Green has seized on sometimes
isolated votes or bills to try to place Schumer on the wrong side
of an issue. Schumer asserts that in some instances Green has
misrepresented his position or taken a vote out of context.
</P>
<P>
   Green, as New York's public advocate, is immune from such
attacks: he has not cast a legislative vote in his public life.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has so far involved only Green and Schumer. Green
has largely ignored Ferraro _ aides say he now views Schumer as the
leading candidate _ while Ferraro's campaign has for the most part
not engaged in a detailed discussion of issues. Ferraro's office,
in response to a request, provided her positions on the issues that
are now being debated by Green and Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   There are some issues on which Green and Schumer hold clearly
different views. Schumer, who is on the House Banking Committee,
voted in May for legislation to lift many of the Depression-era
restrictions on banks, insurance companies and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer argued that the bill accommodated the changing terrain
of the financial industry and would promote competition and
commerce. ``In my view, competition benefits consumers,'' Schumer
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Green asserted that the bill made it easier for banks to raise
consumer fees and to deny loans in poor and minority neighborhoods.
``Here's a bill that the White House opposed, that the majority of
Democrats opposed, that the congressman voted for, and it passed by
one vote'' in the House, Green said. He asserted that Schumer was
motivated less by ideology and more by the stream of contributions
from the banking industry, a charge Schumer denied. Ferraro would
have voted against the banking bill, her aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Green and Schumer also hold contrary views on 1995 securities
legislation that restricted the ability of shareholders to sue
corporate officers, accountants and underwriters. Schumer voted
with the majority in the House in overriding Clinton's veto.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said legislation was needed to guard against frivolous
and harassing lawsuits directed at corporations. Green called it an
``anti-shareholder'' bill. Ms. Ferraro would also have opposed the
bill, her office said.
</P>
<P>
   Green has also attacked Schumer for supporting the line-item
veto sought by President Clinton (and backed, as Green likes to
note, by Newt Gingrich, the speaker of the House.) Ferraro opposes
the line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer supported legislation prohibiting the federal government
from imposing mandates on local governments without financing them,
and voted against making an exception in cases involving ordering
schools to clean up asbestos. Green opposed the measure. Ferraro
supports the so-called unfunded mandates law, but would have
supported the exemption, her aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Green opposes the death penalty, while Schumer, who once shared
Green's view, has come to support it, as does Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   But the differences become far more murky on other matters. For
example, Green attacked Schumer on Sunday for supporting an
immigration restriction bill in 1996 that included a provision that
barred the legally born children of illegal immigrants from
attending public schools. Schumer said he opposed the provision,
but supported much of the rest of the bill. He said he voted to
send it to conference in hopes the offending provision would be
stricken, and opposed the final bill when it was not.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Green attacked Schumer for the vote, and challenged
his explanation. ``Did he say that at the time?,'' Green asked.
``When he says that as an election-year response to me, I'm a
little suspicious.'' Schumer's office noted that, in fact, he had
written a letter to Congress at the height of the debate explicitly
opposing the provision.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Green points to a handful of votes Schumer cast in
the 1980s against cutting off funds for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the so-called Star Wars missile defense program.
Schumer said they were isolated votes, and that he had since, in
words and votes, repeatedly stated his opposition to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said this was a case of Green's invoking a deceptively
outdated vote, while Green called it an example of Schumer's
changing his position in preparation for the campaign. ``The key
votes on SDI did occur a decade ago,'' Green said. ``So when the
issue was ripe, the congressman did oppose amendments to the
Pentagon budget that would have curtailed the Reagan star wars
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's most recent attacks on Schumer have been on two
subjects: First, that he is not committed to Clinton's call to use
projected federal surpluses to shore up Social Security, and
second, that he wavered on giving patients the right to sue their
HMOs. In both cases, Green backs up his assertion by pointing to
bills Schumer introduced over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Green asserted that Schumer was trying to change his political
profile to adjust to the dynamics of this Senate race, for example
to Social Security legislation Schumer introduced days after Green
first raised the issue. ``It raises questions about whether he's a
consistent progressive advocate on all these issues, or whether
he's more a politician trimming his sails to adjust to the
political winds,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer said that Green was again invoking early drafts of
legislation, and that he had in fact made clear, in later bills and
public statements, that he believed patients should have a right to
sue and that the surplus should go first to Social Security. ``From
the day the president said, `Let's put the surplus to Social
Security,' I was for it,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of reminds me of when I was in the anti-war movement
in college, and there was a small group of people who said, `They
weren't against the war in 1965, they came out against in 1966, so
we shouldn't work with them,''' Schumer said.

SAMPRAS CLOSES IN ON TENNIS HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If he could, Pete Sampras would work undercover:
punch in unnoticed, punch out with Grand Slam titles at a clip his
contemporaries cannot come close to matching. But like it or not,
and he is trying to, this year is different. This year, the
cosmopolitan, and cosmic, side he never knew he had has been
showing up everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   All around Manhattan, his larger-than-life body, caught in
midlunge and brandishing a racquet fit for a giant, is stretched
across the flanks of city buses advertising his starring role at
the U.S. Open, which begins Monday. At every newsstand that stocked
GQ's August issue, he could be seen as a cover boy swathed in
Armani and Jil Sander, smiling the same quizzical smile that shores
up his milk mustache in that unavoidable ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And not least of all, in this intensively record-conscious
summer of sport, he is surrounded by talk of his chances to make
tennis history the next two weeks. All he has to do is live up to
rank and reputation to tie Roy Emerson's career mark of 12 Grand
Slam titles by commandeering the Open a fifth time in his peerless
career.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning his fifth Wimbledon championship in July, a title
that put him on history's doorstep, there has been a lot for a
low-key guy like Sampras to download and downplay. And that is why
he repaired home to Orlando, Fla., where his house on a Lake Nona
fairway is so close to the airport that he can practically hail
airplanes like cabs, to spend the final week before the Open,
deprogramming his mind and reminding his body that there is lots of
best-of-five-set work to be done just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors Nick Faldo and Jim Courier called and tempted him
with afternoon golf outings. But there was to be no golf for
Sampras, who did not like the way his energy fizzled at this year's
Australian Open and moved to Orlando solely to be within arm's
length of Pat Etcheberry, a Marine-minded conditioning specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a Grand Slam comes around, everything else in my life
just stops dead,'' said Sampras, who takes a 1-0 record against
Marc-Kevin Goellner of Germany into the Open's opening round.
``There's something significant and historic about the Slams, and I
put a lot of internal pressure on myself to do well in them. That's
why I'm so miserable when I lose a Slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to talk about who's going to be No. 1,'' said
Sampras, who can break the record he shares with Jimmy Connors if
he ends the year at the top for the sixth straight season, ``I
think it's going to come down to who wins the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the metaphysical implications of having his
bus-sized self chugging around the city that is host to the Open,
Sampras _ who has not, for the record, ever set foot on a city bus
_ responded with a wince. Asked about his stint as a model, the
27-year-old Sampras rolled his eyes and said: ``It was all right,
but it's probably something I'll do about once every 27 years.
Everybody wants to know if I kept the clothes: Nope.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility of moving out of his tie with Rod
Laver and Bjorn Borg for second place and into a tie with Emerson
for the Grand Slam record, Sampras brightened. Is he tired of
talking about closing in on Emerson's record? Sure he is. But that
does not mean he isn't thrilled by the opportunity to make history.
</P>
<P>
   He never saw Emerson play, and became acquainted with Laver's
feats on videotape only because his former coach, Pete Fischer,
insisted that Laver, the only man to twice win the Grand Slam of
tennis in a calendar year, was worth emulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no holes in his game, had every shot and could win on
all the surfaces,'' said Sampras, who is well aware that Laver
might have collected ``15 or even 20'' Grand Slam titles had he not
been barred from Grand Slam competition for nearly a decade after
turning pro.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's not like I was going to actually play like him; he's a
lefty, I'm a righty, and I don't really think you can compare this
era to that one. But it's more the attitude he had; that's what my
coach and my father wanted for me. To have class like the Emersons,
Rosewalls, Lavers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Emerson, who does not seem terribly upset about the
prospect of sharing his record, Sampras turned out to be the
perfect candidate to eclipse the Grand Slam inroads that he and his
fellow Australians made at midcentury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Records are made to be broken,'' Emerson said last week from
Boston. ``In my day, you were trying to win the Slams in order to
get a professional contract. Pete's playing now for love of the
game and the Slams, and probably to win the one he hasn't won yet,
the French. He's a complete player, a great sportsman, and he's no
actor out there. He gets on with it the way Rosewall and Laver got
on with it. They made the ball talk. People have to respect Pete's
game; I know I do.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Sampras, who lives in a $1.1 million house with
ceilings so high that Julius and Turquoise Irving were among its
prospective buyers, is just plain astounded that his racquet has
made the ball talk all the way to 11 Grand Slam titles. ``I never
thought anything like this would happen to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other people did.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, with the entire Sampras family at the dinner
table, Sampras' iconoclastic first coach, Fischer, a California
pediatrician who is now serving a three-year prison term for
molesting a patient, held sway with his over-the-top
prognostications for the player's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I didn't think it was realistic, what he
predicted would happen to me in my tennis career,'' said Sampras,
who has stood by Fischer and stays in contact by letter. ``The rest
of us would be sitting there eating, and he'd say things like,
`When Pete's done playing, people are going to forget about Laver.'
I just sat there and never said a thing. Here I was, this
13-year-old kid, eating my macaroni and cheese and thinking, `Wow,
what's this guy smoking?'''
</P>
<P>
   The player wasn't the only skeptic at the table. His father,
Sam, had his doubts as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad wasn't sure I had the heart and the whatever, I guess
the guts, to go along with the talent,'' Sampras said. ``I think
there was a question in his mind about how important it all was for
me.'' For a time, it was a valid question. The definitive step did
not come until the 1992 U.S. Open final, in which he surrendered to
Stefan Edberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it happened because everything clicked in after
that,'' Sampras said. ``Until then, I wasn't sure if I hated to
lose, and in that match, I felt myself cave in and kind of give it
to him in the fourth set, like just being there was enough for me.
In the aftermath, I analyzed what I'd done, and it became real
clear that coming in second won't get you anything, just isn't good
enough. I've never caved in at a Slam since. I haven't won every
match, but at least I've made the other guy earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sampras, who needs goals the way normal mortals need oxygen,
wins this Open and ties Emerson's record, then what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it gets interesting,'' he said. ``I mean, people love to
see people break records. I know I do. It's just a little
overwhelming that it's me who's doing it, that guys I always looked
up to, like Borg and Connors, now I'm up there with them.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's in passing gear.

OFFERS OF HELP POUR IN FOR DAMAGED SYNAGOGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two days after a roaring fire devastated the historic
Central Synagogue on Manhattan's East Side, the senior rabbi of a
congregation suffering something akin to mourning looked beyond the
charred timbers and ruins of a magnificent landmark on Sunday and
saw some reasons for hope.
</P>
<P>
   There were offers of sites for his displaced congregation to
worship during the High Holy Days, starting on Sept. 20. There were
messages of condolence and support from across town and around the
world. And there were generous offers of help to rebuild the
126-year-old Moorish Revival temple, which lost its roof and much
of its interior on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn a great deal through every experience,'' the senior
rabbi, Peter Rubinstein, said in a telephone interview from his
study in the temple's community house across the street. ``There
are relative tragedies and traumas in life. But life itself is of
the utmost importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrible as the fire was, Rubinstein said, no one had been
killed or seriously hurt. Moreover, no irreplaceable Torah scrolls
or historic archives were lost, most having been removed earlier in
the summer for a renovation project. And the fire brought out the
best in people, from the firefighters and police officers on the
scene to government officials, religious colleagues and even
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein spoke of ``the extraordinary importance of friendship
and community as people have come forward, Jew and non-Jew alike,''
and recalled that ``among the first on the scene were some of my
Christian colleagues.'' He mentioned Cardinal John O'Connor and
``friends from other churches and synagogues,'' and added: ``They
were the source of my strength as I watched the building burn.''
</P>
<P>
   With the High Holy Days only three weeks off, Rubinstein said he
had received nearly 50 offers from churches, synagogues and the
city for places where his 1,400-member congregation _ and as many
as 3,500 others who join them during the 10 days that are Judaism's
most sacred _ could gather to worship.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Central Synagogue, at 55th Street and Lexington
Avenue, has not had the capacity to accommodate more than its core
membership, and has had to hold two or more services daily during
the High Holy Days, the rabbi said. While no decision on a meeting
location has been made, Rubinstein said he hoped to find a space
large enough for the regular congregation and those who join them
on the High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity,'' he said. ``We're going to try to
keep the congregation together, to worship together, for the first
time in decades. At this time in particular, I think it's
important.''
</P>
<P>
   With multimillion-dollar rebuilding costs looming, he said, many
members of the congregation had made ``tremendous offers of
financial assistance'' to help restore the synagogue, a national
and city landmark.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much the repairs will cost or how long they
might take, the rabbi said. One immediate task will be to cover the
roofless synagogue's gaping interior to prevent further damage.
Beyond that lay the removal of debris, a damage assessment, plans
for restoration and fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective is to move as quickly as circumstances might
permit,'' Rubinstein said. ``It's not just technical and repair
work. There will be an artistic effort to restore the magnificent
interior. We plan to keep the building in character with its
history.''

CONFESSED KILLER WAS `NIGHT AND DAY, GOOD AND EVIL' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt.)  (mk) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joanne Donovan remembers how Gary Evans, her friend and lover
for the last eight years, ate. He was like a 10-year-old, she said,
subsisting on gallons of milk and boxes of Cocoa Puffs and
Freihofer's chocolate-chip cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Robbin Evans, his sister, remembers how he skateboarded with her
son and bounced on a trampoline as joyously as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Several other women who knew Evans described him as quiet,
gentle and caring. He bolstered their confidence. He liked to draw
mountains and write poems about freedom and the stars and pure
love.
</P>
<P>
   But police in Rensselaer County, N.Y., say something very
different: that Gary Evans, a professional antiques thief, was a
brutal multiple murderer who killed five men as coldly and
deliberately as an executioner.
</P>
<P>
   Jailed in May on charges relating to a theft, Evans, 43,
confessed to each of these killings over the summer, police say,
revealing the details bit by bit and directing officers to the
graves he had dug. Reports about the Evans case appeared all summer
in local newspapers and on TV news. To people in Troy, a
once-thriving industrial center about 15 miles north of Albany, and
throughout Rensselaer County, it was riveting.
</P>
<P>
   And two weeks ago, on the way from an Albany courthouse to the
jail in Troy, Evans provided a spectacular ending to his story.
Shackled hand and foot, he kicked out the window of a police van,
jumped out, hobbled to the edge of a bridge and plunged 65 feet to
his death in the rocky shallows of the Hudson River. In a note to
his lawyer, opened after his death, he had written: ``Stars
surround me and peace and love are mine. They cannot be taken or
touched. I win.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, an autopsy revealed that Evans had hidden a handcuff key
in one nostril and a sliver of razor in the other. The bizarre
story was reported around the country _ often with an old photo of
Evans, naked to the waist, with the physique of a bodybuilder. At
home, the most common reactions were anger and relief. Some people
were outraged that a killer in custody had managed to orchestrate
his death under the noses of police guards, but nearly everybody
was relieved to be rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, amid the exclamations, some quieter voices emerged: a
dozen or more women who had been Evans' friends, and, in some
cases, lovers. They expressed shock and horror at the killings. The
person they were mourning, from their descriptions, was the
opposite of a ruthless killer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Evans would not be the first killer with female
friends and relatives who loved him and knew his better qualities.
There are mothers, wives and girlfriends with nothing but good to
say about their men on death row.
</P>
<P>
   But the range of Evans' behavior was unusual, according to
professionals who work closely with murderers. He killed with the
easy viciousness of a disturbed child dismembering a bug, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his female friends remember him as a sympathetic listener
who went out of his way to encourage and help them. ``A woman and
kid protector,'' said Ms. Evans, his sister.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donovan, 34, who reported him to police last spring when she
realized he may have murdered an acquaintance, said: ``He was very
affectionate and sweet to my daughter. He liked to play Nintendo
with her. He was always happy, always energetic. He made me feel
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who knew him as a teen-ager said that in some ways he was
as wholesome as a Boy Scout. At parties, when others were drinking
beer and smoking marijuana, he would bring a quart of milk to
drink, one woman said. As a teen-ager and an adult, he refused to
touch meat or alcohol or drugs, even aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called him `Owl,' the wisest,'' said one 39-year-old woman,
a state administrator in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the death of Evans', a 34-year-old woman, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, described an affair she had
with him 10 years ago. She was a young mother trapped in a bad
marriage when she met him one afternoon at a local pub and agreed
to see him. He took her to art museums and bought her son a red
tricycle. But mainly, he urged her to leave her abusive husband and
discussed the logistics of finding an apartment, a job and drawing
up a budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me the courage to go out and make a new life for
myself and my son,'' she said. After nine months, she left her
husband. Within a week or so, Evans disappeared, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, she is happily remarried and has a good job.
``This man made me believe in myself again,'' she said. ``I was
going down the tubes. He gave me back my self-esteem. I could never
repay him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time that he was restoring her confidence, Evans
committed his first murder. The victim, Michael Falco, 30, had
grown up in his neighborhood and occasionally lent him a hand
during thefts. After shooting Falco in the head to keep him from
talking about a burglary, he stuffed the body in the trunk of his
car, drove to Lake Worth, Fla., and buried it. Investigators found
the body this summer after he directed them to the grave site.
</P>
<P>
   Evans' long-ago lover said she felt numb, trying to fit the
killer with the caring friend she knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's night and day, good and evil,'' she said. ``I feel so
much sympathy for those victims. But I can't envision him as a
murderer. How can he be so kind and yet so brutal?''
</P>
<P>
   Evans had grown up with brutality, his sister said. Their father
frequently beat both children and their mother, who tried many
times to kill herself. When her brother was 7, Ms. Evans said, he
grabbed a butcher knife and tried futilely to stab his father, who
had been beating their mother.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, all of Evans' friends, even in high school,
were women; later, all of his victims were men.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the causes of his violence, one expert said that Evans'
seeming kindness was as cold and calculated as his killings. James
Merikangas, a Yale neurosurgeon and forensic psychiatrist, said
that a killer like Evans was ``incapable of feeling human
emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They may appear to be caring,'' he said. ``But it's a
practiced deception.'' It is not possible, he added, for anyone to
feel empathy and also callously commit murder. The actions of a
sociopath like Evans, he said, are attempts to manipulate and
control anyone he deals with.
</P>
<P>
   According to law-enforcement authorities, Evans killed to
silence witnesses _three partners in thievery and two shopkeepers
during burglaries _ who might testify against him.
</P>
<P>
   But what did he gain by being kind to women _ and, for that
matter, children and animals? Probably it made him feel powerful,
Merikangas said. All the women he befriended were in vulnerable
situations. From the number of friends and the strength of their
feelings, it seems that Evans was able to mime sympathy much more
convincingly than most killers.
</P>
<P>
   He persuaded Ms. Donovan when Damien Cuomo, an antiques thief
and her live-in lover, disappeared in 1989. ``He'll be back,''
Evans assured her. ``He'll be back sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   Shattered at her lover's apparent desertion, Ms. Donovan came to
look forward to Evans' increasingly frequent visits. ``I started to
like him as a friend,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, Evans practically moved in with her, and
eventually she realized she was in love with him. ``He was easy to
get along with,'' she said. ``He would lay on the couch and not
talk. He liked swimming and laying in the sun and relaxing.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed off his daredevil stunts for her, like diving 80 feet
into a lake. They went antiquing in Massachusetts. ``He bought me
things to make me laugh,'' she said. ``A stupid metal flower for
$15 _ ugly, ugly, ugly. I said, `Why?' And he started laughing and
I started laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked to her about the dream house in Vermont that he was
going to build, on a mountaintop. And, to her distress, about his
thefts, confiding in greater detail as the months passed. She knew
that he, like Damien, was a thief, but wanted to know as little as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, after seeing an extremely agitated Evans drive
off with Timothy Rysedorph, another Troy friend, and return,
frantic and crazy-eyed, in Rysedorph's car alone, she figured it
out. That fall weekend in 1997, Evans fled Troy, violating his
probation and becoming a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   When a police investigator approached Ms. Donovan a few weeks
later about Rysedorph's disappearance, she agreed to help. The
thefts did not particularly bother her, but murder did.
</P>
<P>
   It was months before she was able to turn Evans in. But in the
spring, he finally called her and asked her to meet him in St.
Johnsbury, Vt., where he was living the rugged life of a
survivalist.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over _ when police who accompanied her to Vermont
had arrested Evans before she could even give him a hug _ Ms.
Donovan felt ``crushed.'' With seven felony convictions, and facing
life imprisonment, Evans began confessing to the killings. One
victim was Ms. Donovan's live-in lover, the father of her child _
Damien Cuomo, whom he had forced to a remote area, handcuffed and
shot several times in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I protected him all those years,'' Ms. Donovan said. ``But how
was I going to protect him when he killed my boyfriend?''
</P>

   But Evans, it seems, facing a life in prison _ even before any
murder charges _ had given up hope of life and was planning his
death. If he committed suicide in prison, Ms. Donovan said, he
thought they would have won. But if he could kill himself outside,
he would win.

   ``He had nothing to lose,'' she said. ``He wanted to go out with
a bang. He wanted to win.''

<P>
   Is the presidency of Boris Yeltsin at an end? Technically, the
answer is no: arising from his vacation torpor last weekend, he
sacked the entire government, showing that he could still throw his
constitutional weight around.
</P>
<P>
   But this dismissal looks less like the bold coup de theatre with
which the former Yeltsin, the fearless democrat with a gift for
both seeing and seizing opportunities, used to surprise the world,
and more like the desperate act of an old autocrat who has run out
of energy, ideas and options.
</P>
<P>
   Out goes the five-month-old government of young, reformist
Sergei Kiriyenko. In _ to the sound of a crashing currency _ comes
none other than his plodding predecessor, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   And this time both president and prime-minister-designate are
talking about Chernomyrdin as Russia's next president. That may be
premature, but Yeltsin certainly looks as frail politically as he
does physically. His second presidential term seems drained of all
useful life.
</P>
<P>
   That term has already proved a gloomy failure _ a two-year coma
interrupted by fits. Reform has foundered, despite the efforts of
well-intentioned ministers, and now financial chaos looms.
</P>
<P>
   The first task for the new government, any new government, is to
repair some of the damage done by the ill-considered decisions on
Aug. 17 to default on Russia's foreign debt and devalue the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   That means recognizing the need to reassure foreigners, notably
the IMF, that any money they might in future lend to Russia would
not be squandered or stolen. It means persuading foreign holders of
existing Russian debt that they will not again be hammered. And it
means showing due determination to take hold of the country's
public finances by collecting taxes and controlling spending.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the new government has to show that it will not
succumb to populism but rather commit itself to the creation of a
functioning market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Could Chernomyrdin be the man to do all this? Only the most
uncritical optimists will say yes with any conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous five years as prime minister, he showed no zeal
for serious reform, preferring to temporize while leaving the
running to others. He was notable, in particular, for doing nothing
to bring to heel the country's huge natural-gas monopoly, Gazprom,
the company he used to run.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the World Bank reckoned that, were Gazprom to lose its
tax privileges and fulfil all its tax obligations, it would be
handing over to the government revenue equivalent to 2-3 percent of
GDP. Kiriyenko, until his dismissal, was trying to get it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has always taken care to keep his friendships in
good repair, maintaining links not just with his former Gazprom
colleagues but also with some of the tycoons who bankrolled
Yeltsin's election in 1996 in return for an unseemly grip on the
country's affairs, and indeed its assets.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that one of the foremost of these
``oligarchs,'' Boris Berezovsky, should have greeted Chernomyrdin's
return to power with the words, ``Big Capital unconditionally
supports this appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   His resurrection is less popular in the Duma, the lower house of
parliament, which must confirm him in office, but he leads the
country's second-biggest party, Our Home is Russia, and has spent
much of the past five months cultivating regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   If Chernomyrdin can make peace with the Duma, he may be able to
use his proclaimed managerial skills and undoubted experience to
run a stable government. But his path will not be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, his rivals for the presidency _ notably Yuri
Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, and Alexander Lebed, the governor of
the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk _ will be doing their best to
frustrate him.
</P>
<P>
   They know that, should Yeltsin resign or die, Chernomyrdin would
take over as president, at least for a period of up to three months
during which an election would be held. That would give him a
considerable advantage at the polls, though it would certainly not
make him an exciting candidate.
</P>
<P>
   More dangerous to his prospects, however, is Russia's economic
and financial predicament. In addition to all its familiar
afflictions _ chronic poverty, failing public services, unpaid
wages _ the country now faces an acute banking crisis, plus a
collapsed currency and the likelihood of renewed inflation.
</P>
<P>
   If this is indeed the end, in effect, of Yeltsin's reign, he
leaves a poisoned samovar. Chernomyrdin may well come to regret his
willingness to accept it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The world economy resembles an airplane that has lost two of its
four engines, with a third now starting to splutter.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is already in recession. A sharp slowdown in China may yet
push the government to devalue. Many smaller emerging Asian
economies are suffering their steepest economic declines for half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian ruble is plunging headlong. Latin America may be the
next region to hit trouble. Last but not least, Wall Street
continues to wobble.
</P>
<P>
   How much more bad news will it take before the airplane
nosedives?
</P>
<P>
   By some definitions, it already has. Several forecasters reckon
that world GDP will grow by less than 2 percent this year. That
would be the same as in 1991 and not much faster than in 1982 or
1975.
</P>
<P>
   All three of those years were deemed times of ``global
recession.'' In those cases, it was mostly America and the other
rich economies that suffered outright declines in output, while the
developing countries continued to grow. Now it is mainly the
emerging markets that have submerged.
</P>
<P>
   If the economies of America or Europe slow too, the world
economy could suffer its worst peacetime setback since the
Depression of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The developing world now accounts for almost half of world
output. As financial turmoil has spilled from one emerging economy
to the next, the risk of global recession has markedly increased.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are glimmers of better news in some Asian economies,
notably for their exports. And the fiscal stimulus already in the
pipeline in Japan is bigger than is often realized, which could be
enough to stop the economy shrinking in the second half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   However, what happens in America, which accounts for a fifth of
global output, remains critical.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the impact of the Asian slump on America has been
largely benign: lower prices for commodities and manufactured
imports and a strong dollar have helped to hold down inflation. But
weaker exports and higher imports are swelling America's
current-account deficit.
</P>
<P>
   At present, as capital flees from emerging economies into
American banks and securities markets, the deficit is easy to
finance. But for how long?
</P>
<P>
   This is not just a technical question. A desertion of Wall
Street by foreign investors would both contribute to a market
collapse and make financing that current-account deficit more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   If Wall Street does crash _ taking with it the world economy _
the blame will doubtless be laid on reckless investment in Asia.
But the present fragility of America's stock market also has much
to do with recklessness at home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent falls, Wall Street remains expensive by
historical standards _ as though investors believed that equities
were safer now than they have been for years, which they patently
are not.
</P>
<P>
   When investors flocked to Asia earlier this decade, stock
markets surged and current-account deficits ballooned. No need to
worry about that, it was argued: the flow of capital reflected
these countries' economic miracles. In one country after another,
bust then followed boom.
</P>
<P>
   A similar process may be under way in the United States.
Cheerleaders justified the surge in share prices and heavy inflows
of capital by praising America's miraculous productivity, or in
other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Now, attention has shifted to the risks. High on the list is the
fact that American asset prices have been sustained by short-term
flows of portfolio capital, just as in Asia. These could dry up or
even be reversed, just as in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Can anything be done? Some are calling for the Fed to slash
American interest rates _ less because America needs an immediate
boost than because the world at large does.
</P>
<P>
   This is misguided, because the best favor America can do the
world economy is to preserve economic stability at home. Remember
that the correction on Wall Street over the past month has been
modest: it has subtracted something from the case for higher
interest rates, but certainly fails to justify a cut.
</P>
<P>
   America's labor market is still tight, consumer demand is still
strong. Clearer signs of slowing demand are needed before the Fed
should even think about cutting interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the Fed should ignore altogether the
impact of its monetary policy on the rest of the world. The rising
risk of a global recession may in time weigh heavily with American
policymakers _ as with the Japanese, who still need to do more to
clear up their economic and financial mess.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the mistakes of investors at home and abroad, the
only immediate response they can offer to the prospect of world
recession is to hope it does not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers are right to be nervous. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The world economy resembles an airplane that has lost two of its
four engines, with a third now starting to splutter.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is already in recession. A sharp slowdown in China may yet
push the government to devalue. Many smaller emerging Asian
economies are suffering their steepest economic declines for half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian ruble is plunging headlong. Latin America may be the
next region to hit trouble. Last but not least, Wall Street
continues to wobble.
</P>
<P>
   How much more bad news will it take before the airplane
nosedives?
</P>
<P>
   By some definitions, it already has. Several forecasters reckon
that world GDP will grow by less than 2 percent this year. That
would be the same as in 1991 and not much faster than in 1982 or
1975.
</P>
<P>
   All three of those years were deemed times of ``global
recession.'' In those cases, it was mostly America and the other
rich economies that suffered outright declines in output, while the
developing countries continued to grow. Now it is mainly the
emerging markets that have submerged.
</P>
<P>
   If the economies of America or Europe slow too, the world
economy could suffer its worst peacetime setback since the
Depression of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The developing world now accounts for almost half of world
output. As financial turmoil has spilled from one emerging economy
to the next, the risk of global recession has markedly increased.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are glimmers of better news in some Asian economies,
notably for their exports. And the fiscal stimulus already in the
pipeline in Japan is bigger than is often realized, which could be
enough to stop the economy shrinking in the second half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   However, what happens in America, which accounts for a fifth of
global output, remains critical.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the impact of the Asian slump on America has been
largely benign: lower prices for commodities and manufactured
imports and a strong dollar have helped to hold down inflation. But
weaker exports and higher imports are swelling America's
current-account deficit.
</P>
<P>
   At present, as capital flees from emerging economies into
American banks and securities markets, the deficit is easy to
finance. But for how long?
</P>
<P>
   This is not just a technical question. A desertion of Wall
Street by foreign investors would both contribute to a market
collapse and make financing that current-account deficit more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   If Wall Street does crash _ taking with it the world economy _
the blame will doubtless be laid on reckless investment in Asia.
But the present fragility of America's stock market also has much
to do with recklessness at home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent falls, Wall Street remains expensive by
historical standards _ as though investors believed that equities
were safer now than they have been for years, which they patently
are not.
</P>
<P>
   When investors flocked to Asia earlier this decade, stock
markets surged and current-account deficits ballooned. No need to
worry about that, it was argued: the flow of capital reflected
these countries' economic miracles. In one country after another,
bust then followed boom.
</P>
<P>
   A similar process may be under way in the United States.
Cheerleaders justified the surge in share prices and heavy inflows
of capital by praising America's miraculous productivity, or in
other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Now, attention has shifted to the risks. High on the list is the
fact that American asset prices have been sustained by short-term
flows of portfolio capital, just as in Asia. These could dry up or
even be reversed, just as in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Can anything be done? Some are calling for the Fed to slash
American interest rates _ less because America needs an immediate
boost than because the world at large does.
</P>
<P>
   This is misguided, because the best favor America can do the
world economy is to preserve economic stability at home. Remember
that the correction on Wall Street over the past month has been
modest: it has subtracted something from the case for higher
interest rates, but certainly fails to justify a cut.
</P>
<P>
   America's labor market is still tight, consumer demand is still
strong. Clearer signs of slowing demand are needed before the Fed
should even think about cutting interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the Fed should ignore altogether the
impact of its monetary policy on the rest of the world. The rising
risk of a global recession may in time weigh heavily with American
policymakers _ as with the Japanese, who still need to do more to
clear up their economic and financial mess.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the mistakes of investors at home and abroad, the
only immediate response they can offer to the prospect of world
recession is to hope it does not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers are right to be nervous. &QL;

 &HT;    Right field beats bench for Colbrunn
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Drafted as a catcher, converted to a first baseman,
Greg Colbrunn made his Atlanta debut as a right fielder Sunday
night. He was hardly about to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new position,'' Colbrunn said. ``I've never played it
before. It's not like I'm going to be real comfortable out there or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   So why go?
</P>
<P>
   ``Get some ABs.''
</P>
<P>
   Steady work has been hard to come by for Colbrunn since he
returned to Atlanta. He has been with the team for 28 games since
being acquired from Colorado July 30 and has had only 13 at-bats.
Sunday's was just his second start, having subbed for Andres
Galarraga for one game Aug. 2 after the regular first baseman was
bruised up from being hit by pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, Colbrunn had one at-bat in the last eight games.
That he is hitting .385 since rejoining the Braves has not helped
him get to the plate more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to use him (in the outfield) someday in the playoffs
or something, at least he's been out there,'' said manager Bobby
Cox. ``You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies had used Colbrunn in the outfield four times this
season, though most of his training for the position has come from
shagging fly balls during batting practice. Cox had considered
using him there Thursday against Kent Mercker but backed off
because of Mercker's strong numbers against right-handers. Donovan
Osborne, St. Louis' starter Sunday, was a better fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to get into the lineup,'' Colbrunn said. ``Any time
I get in the lineup, I'm very happy about it, whether it's
outfield, first base, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The lineup
</P>
<P>
   With Gerald Williams leading off and Colbrunn batting second,
Cox used his 63rd different lineup of the season, which may sound
like a lot but actually isn't. Cox utilized 87 lineups last season,
the second fewest variations in the National League. St. Louis'
Tony La Russa, by comparision, has used 119.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring with Rudy
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Seanez is in unfamiliar territory. After breaking in with
Cleveland in 1989, he has never spent a full season in the majors,
most often sidelined by injury. He just completed his third month
with the Braves and has shown no sign of wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm starting to understand how they feel, going through a
full season,'' he said. ``The longest I've been around is July or
August.''
</P>
<P>
   With 30 innings pitched in 28 appearances entering Sunday,
Seanez has not yet passed his 1995 season for service (34 2/3
innings in 37 appearances for Los Angeles). But his 43 strikeouts
are a career-high and his 2.40 ERA is almost a third of his career
6.00 ERA accumulated over 91 games the previous nine years. And he
remains as strong physically as he ever has in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez has been able to work on successive days three times this
month without incident. He has pitched in 13 games in August, one
fewer than Kerry Ligtenberg, who sat out the weekend with a
fatigued arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just don't get the pitch count up too high,'' he said. ``I've
felt good. I might need a little more time to warm up or something,
but it's been good.''
</P>
<P>
   A town gone mad
</P>
<P>
   There is no overestimating how enthusiastically the city of St.
Louis has followed Mark McGwire's home run rush. The Sunday edition
of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch included 12 stories about McGwire,
ranging from the debate on Andro to a profile of Sam Holbrook, the
umpire who ejected the first baseman in Saturday's game. Also
included was a full photo page devoted to Saturday's mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates on the value of the ball McGwire hits to break the
record are ranging from $1 to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earning a Buck
</P>
<P>
   Nice pregame moment at Busch Stadium. Jack Buck, who has
broadcast Cardinal games since 1954, was honored with the unveiling
of a statue of his likeness, which will stand outside the entrance
to the team offices at the stadium. Buck was inducted into the
broadcaster wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987.

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Houston Astros
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight, Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Turner Field
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: TBS will telecast tonight's and Tuesday's games. Fox
Sports South the telecast Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, RHP John Smoltz (13-2,
3.32; 14-12, 3.06 lifetime vs. Astros) vs. LHP Mike Hampton (10-6,
3.79; 3-6, 3.51 lifetime vs. Braves). Tuesday, LHP Denny Neagle
(13-11, 3.62; 4-4, 4.42 lifetime vs. Astros) vs. RHP Sean Bergman
(11-7, 3.56; 1-3, 7.03 lifetime vs. Braves). Wednesday, RHP Greg
Maddux (17-6, 1.98; 17-8, 2.19 lifetime vs. Asrtros) vs. LHP Randy
Johnson (5-1, 1.17; 0-1, 13.50 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Series history: Atlanta leads the all-time series 279-259 and
is 26-23 against Houston over the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Past meetings: The Braves are 4-4 versus the Astros this year,
having just split a two-game series in the Astrodome last week.
They also split a four-game series in Houston May 15-18. This will
be Houston's first and only visit to Atlanta this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Astros leaders (through Saturday: Avg. _ Craig Biggio (.328);
HRs _ Moises Alou (38); RBIs _ Alou (115); SBs _ Biggio (44). W _
Shane Reynolds (16); ERA _ Randy Johnson (1.17). Saves _ Billy
Wagner (25). Strikeouts _ Reynolds (167).
</P>
<P>
   _ Quickly: The Braves have found the Astros to be a far
different team from the one that they swept in last fall's
divisional playoffs. Moises Alou's presence in the middle of the
order has converted this lineup to the highest scoring team in
franchise history, the addition of Randy Johnson has tranformed the
rotation into a rival of Atlanta's, and the bullpen remains one of
the best in the league. ... In the best season in franchise
history, the Astros are 86-51, seven wins better than the 1986
Astros, which had previously posted the club best record after 137
dates. Houston has won 21 games in August, the most wins in any
month in franchise history. ... Atlanta has been muzzled by Astros
pitching this season. The team has hit .216 against the Astros and
.277 against everyone else. Javy Lopez has been the exception. He
was 4-for-7 last week in Houston with two home runs, a double and
three RBIs. ... Hampton pitched one of his best games of the season
last Tuesday against the Braves, holding them to two runs on six
hits through eight innings. He struck out a career-high 12 batters,
baffling the Braves with a hard slider. Strangely, the victory was
just his second in 12 starts. He remains 2-2 since the All-Star
break. ... On the DL: RHP Ramon Garcia (strained right elbow
ligament), RHP Chris Holt (right shoulder surgery), RHP Jose
Cabrera (sore right shoulder) INF Jack Howell (broken left wrist),
OF Pete Incaviglia (sore back).
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's hot: Moises Alou and Brad Ausmus went into Sunday
hitting a combined .429 (9-for-21) on their last homestand. Sean
Berry had nine hits in 17 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's not: Tim Bogar is in an 0-for-19 slump. Carl Everett was
3-for-15 during their last homestand. Bill Spiers had two hits in
his last 17 at-bats.

<TEXT>
<P>
   However frequently it occurs, terrorism does not lose its
ability to shock. Nor should it. It remains one of the most
despicable of crimes, both because the killing and wounding of
innocents are central to its purpose, and because its perpetrators
can so easily do their work without having to confront their
enemies, or their victims, before slinking off to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of outrage that attends terrorist attacks should not,
however, be assumed to be equivalent to a sense of powerlessness:
public outrage is one of the most potent weapons in the limited
armory of counterterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   It tips those who sympathize with the political aims of the
terrorist against the man himself. It denies sanctuary. It buys
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing should be done to undermine its potency. Which is why at
least some of America's counterterrorist air strikes on Aug. 20 may
turn out to have been unwise.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that America should never hit back at
terrorists. America is a special target for people like the bombers
who blew up its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7 because
it does things other countries are not called upon to do.
</P>
<P>
   It does these things in its own interests, but also in the
interests of its allies and indeed of free countries everywhere. It
is the nearest thing that exists to a world policeman, but it must
operate without a world police force, a world judiciary or a proper
world system of law.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, if any action is to be taken against terrorists, it
will have to be American military action. But even on these
occasions America will have to take care to keep public opinion on
its side and not to dissipate the world's sense of outrage. That
means explaining its actions in full, and showing convincing
evidence for all the claims it makes to justify them.
</P>
<P>
   Few fair-minded people can doubt that the targets of the attacks
in Afghanistan were indeed training camps and bases for Islamist
fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   Many people will also be ready to believe that Osama bin Laden,
the hitherto obscure Saudi dissident now elevated to the status of
the world's most dangerous man, is connected with the camps, and
that he played a part in the two embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   That will be enough perhaps to make many people, at least in the
West, think the attacks were right, and deserved. Whether they were
judicious is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   If they have created 10,000 new fanatics where there would have
been none, they will be judged a mistake, but that will not be
known for years, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the factory in Sudan is different. Although a
financial link is claimed between the factory and bin Laden, there
is no suggestion that biological or chemical weapons were involved
in the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Rather it is claimed that the factory was, with Iraqi help,
making the precursors for a nerve gas. The evidence for nerve-gas
production is said to lie in soil samples, but it cannot be
revealed because that would put intelligence sources in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudanese government pooh-poohs the entire story and,
reasonably enough, wants an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with all this is not just the refusal to show
evidence, not just the decision to zap this factory rather than
countless other dubious installations around the world, nor even
the absence of any connection to the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the political convenience of the action, diverting,
as it did, attention from Bill Clinton's domestic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the knowledge that American intelligence is not
infallible, and that America's armed forces can make terrible
mistakes: just ten years ago, for instance, one of its
guided-missile cruisers, the Vincennes, shot down an Iranian
airliner with 290 civilians on board.
</P>
<P>
   That episode is less talked about in the United States these
days than the blowing up of an American airliner over Lockerbie a
few months later, but both hold lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The Vincennes blunder, for which America duly paid compensation,
shows the dangers of hasty action. Not only did it kill many
innocent people, but it contributed to a poisoning of relations
with Iran and a belief, still widespread in the Islamic world, that
the West puts a small price on the lives of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The Lockerbie incident, in which 270 people died, holds a
different moral: it is that painstaking investigation and the
pursuit of terrorists through the courts can be an effective
response to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the two Libyans suspected of playing a part in the
bombing suddenly found that they might have to stand trial in The
Hague, now that Britain and America have agreed that they can be
tried there under Scottish law. Libya, which has been harboring the
suspects, was thrown on to the defensive and at last agreed to
their trial.
</P>
<P>
   Forgoing the use of military might can be frustrating,
especially for a superpower. But it may well be wise.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which has long followed a policy of retaliation against
terrorism, has not thereby won security _ and America,
incidentally, has forfeited much goodwill in the Muslim world by
its inability to persuade the Israelis to pursue negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   If it resorts to punishment raids without the best of reasons,
and without the best of evidence, America risks finding itself
increasingly friendless in truly important disputes, such as the
one with Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilance, intelligence and the determined pursuit of terrorists
through the courts may pay off handsomely in the long run _ without
putting at risk the world's sense of outrage and the help that
comes with it. &QL;

   That is not to say that America should never hit back at
terrorists. America is a special target for people like the bombers
who blew up its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7 because
it does things other countries are not called upon to do.
</P>
<P>
   It does these things in its own interests, but also in the
interests of its allies and indeed of free countries everywhere. It
is the nearest thing that exists to a world policeman, but it must
operate without a world police force, a world judiciary or a proper
world system of law.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, if any action is to be taken against terrorists, it
will have to be American military action. But even on these
occasions America will have to take care to keep public opinion on
its side and not to dissipate the world's sense of outrage. That
means explaining its actions in full, and showing convincing
evidence for all the claims it makes to justify them.
</P>
<P>
   Few fair-minded people can doubt that the targets of the attacks
in Afghanistan were indeed training camps and bases for Islamist
fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   Many people will also be ready to believe that Osama bin Laden,
the hitherto obscure Saudi dissident now elevated to the status of
the world's most dangerous man, is connected with the camps, and
that he played a part in the two embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   That will be enough perhaps to make many people, at least in the
West, think the attacks were right, and deserved. Whether they were
judicious is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   If they have created 10,000 new fanatics where there would have
been none, they will be judged a mistake, but that will not be
known for years, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the factory in Sudan is different. Although a
financial link is claimed between the factory and bin Laden, there
is no suggestion that biological or chemical weapons were involved
in the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Rather it is claimed that the factory was, with Iraqi help,
making the precursors for a nerve gas. The evidence for nerve-gas
production is said to lie in soil samples, but it cannot be
revealed because that would put intelligence sources in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudanese government pooh-poohs the entire story and,
reasonably enough, wants an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with all this is not just the refusal to show
evidence, not just the decision to zap this factory rather than
countless other dubious installations around the world, nor even
the absence of any connection to the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the political convenience of the action, diverting,
as it did, attention from Bill Clinton's domestic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the knowledge that American intelligence is not
infallible, and that America's armed forces can make terrible
mistakes: just ten years ago, for instance, one of its
guided-missile cruisers, the Vincennes, shot down an Iranian
airliner with 290 civilians on board.
</P>
<P>
   That episode is less talked about in the United States these
days than the blowing up of an American airliner over Lockerbie a
few months later, but both hold lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The Vincennes blunder, for which America duly paid compensation,
shows the dangers of hasty action. Not only did it kill many
innocent people, but it contributed to a poisoning of relations
with Iran and a belief, still widespread in the Islamic world, that
the West puts a small price on the lives of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The Lockerbie incident, in which 270 people died, holds a
different moral: it is that painstaking investigation and the
pursuit of terrorists through the courts can be an effective
response to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the two Libyans suspected of playing a part in the
bombing suddenly found that they might have to stand trial in The
Hague, now that Britain and America have agreed that they can be
tried there under Scottish law. Libya, which has been harboring the
suspects, was thrown on to the defensive and at last agreed to
their trial.
</P>
<P>
   Forgoing the use of military might can be frustrating,
especially for a superpower. But it may well be wise.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which has long followed a policy of retaliation against
terrorism, has not thereby won security _ and America,
incidentally, has forfeited much goodwill in the Muslim world by
its inability to persuade the Israelis to pursue negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   If it resorts to punishment raids without the best of reasons,
and without the best of evidence, America risks finding itself
increasingly friendless in truly important disputes, such as the
one with Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilance, intelligence and the determined pursuit of terrorists
through the courts may pay off handsomely in the long run _ without
putting at risk the world's sense of outrage and the help that
comes with it. &QL;

   ``What a jerk!''
</P>
<P>
   The description of America's sexually compromised president is
an obvious contender for quote of the month. Perhaps it will become
a quote of the year, or eventually enter the history books and,
like Nixon's ``I am not a crook,'' somehow define an era.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Orrin Hatch, the man who uttered the memorable three words,
affects embarrassment. It was a careless outburst, overhead in a
corridor as Utah's senior Republican senator was rushing from one
TV interview to another to comment on Bill Clinton's admission of
an ``improper'' relationship with Monica Lewinsky: ``What I meant
to say was that he acted like a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's judgment is political more than moral. He chairs
the Senate Judiciary Committee; he will conduct the president's
trial if the House should recommend impeachment; he is often talked
of as a future Supreme Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Clinton last week spurned the advice that Hatch had
publicly given him. Instead of telling the truth and apologizing
(``The American nation is a forgiving nation,'' says Hatch), he had
taken a ``cheap shot'' at Ken Starr, ``an eminently fair and decent
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, his long frame folded neatly into the office couch, leans
forward slightly: ``The fact that Clinton doesn't live as I do is
not the most important thing. I don't want to judge him morally...I
want to be fair to him...I like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanctimonious humbug, or genuine concern for a flawed human
being? The afternoon sun is baking Salt Lake City to
headache-inducing temperatures; tourists in shorts and trainers
amble slowly past the Mormon Temple. But Hatch perseveres with
tailored dark suit, snow-white shirt and perfectly-knotted tie.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Mary McGrory, a columnist for the Washington Post,
slights him as ``a stiff-necked Mormon elder with popping eyes for
viewing with alarm and a permanently pursed mouth for lecturing
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the description is misleading, as well as unkind. After all,
this particular Mormon elder co-sponsored the 1990 bill that
guaranteed equal rights for the disabled; as chairman of the labor
committee from 1981-86 he dismayed conservatives by seeking
bipartisan compromise on child care, employment leave for parents
and help for babies with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he infuriated Trent Lott, the Republicans' leader in
the Senate, by siding with Senator Ted Kennedy, a Roman Catholic
with liberal political views and an alcohol-fueled history of
personal misadventure, in a bill to use tobacco taxes to expand
health insurance for children.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the friendship with Kennedy is personal as well as
political: it was the straitlaced Mormon who supported Kennedy in
1991 after a bout of late-night carousing with his nephew led a
young woman to bring a rape charge against the younger Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormons don't try to impose their views on others unless they
want to learn,'' says Hatch. ``We recognize that we are all
sinners.''
</P>
<P>
   For Washington's pundits, such contradictions in a politician
are disturbing. The left would like to revile him as a Jesse
Helms-like conservative, only nastier; the right wants to denounce
him as an apostate, his faith destroyed by the compromises of a
Senate career that began in 1976, when he filed his candidacy on
the last possible day and went on to defeat the third-term
Democratic incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hatch flits confidently from one pigeonhole to another.
This is the man who once described the Democrats as ``the party of
homosexuals'' and, during the 1991 hearings to confirm Clarence
Thomas, a right-wing nominee, to the Supreme Court, cruelly
ridiculed Anita Hill's charges of sexual harassment by the judge
(at one point waving a copy of William Blatty's ``The Exorcist,''
the source, he alleged, for one of Hill's more exotic claims).
</P>
<P>
   But this is also the man who champions nutrition programs for
the poor, ``hate-crime'' legislation to protect homosexuals and
more federal money for AIDS education.
</P>
<P>
   Does the senator see the contradictions, too? Up to a point, of
course. But why should an intelligent man be confined by party
dogma? How can a legislator be effective if he allows the perfect
to be the enemy of the good?
</P>
<P>
   Like any good Republican, the senator thinks less government is
better and lower taxes are fairer: ``I was the architect of the
capital-gains tax reduction...If we did away with death taxes, the
wealthy would use those funds far more productively.''
</P>
<P>
   But the senator has not forgotten his abject childhood in
Pittsburgh (so poor that his father built the family home from used
lumber). An ironic smile flickers across his face: ``I was raised a
liberal Democrat. I haven't lost all my compassionate instincts;
I'm for helping people who can't help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the partnership with Senator Kennedy: ``He normally gets
all the credit, but I don't care. I just want to do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   It is simply that what is right is normally better achieved by
the Republicans' agenda. (``I left the Democratic Party in the
1960s. What helped me leave was that I served as a Mormon
missionary for two years, which showed me what true compassion
was.'')
</P>
<P>
   And what will be right for President Clinton? Both as a good
Mormon and a politically calculating Republican (why present a
premature presidency to Al Gore?), Hatch is a forgiving man: ``I
don't think we can condemn people because they've made mistakes in
this life.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also a romantic man, writing ``inspirational'' music and
love songs (one celebrates Ted Kennedy's wedding anniversary,
another is dedicated to ``my friend Muhammad Ali''). As his press
secretary brings in a handful of CDs, the senator says firmly: ``I
want you to tell me what you think _ even if it sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Lexington has listened, and it's not bad. Perhaps the
president would care to listen to track four of ``Whispers Of My
Heart'': ``I've been on a stormy sea, Thru the darkest of days, But
I wasn't worried, I never lost faith, 'Cause I knew you would be
there. In you I found strength.'' &QL;

TAYLOR DENT, 17 AND SON OF TENNIS PRO, IS READY TO GO PRO, TOO
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taylor Dent's 6-foot-2-inch, 195-pound physique says
he belongs in the U.S. Open. So does his last name: his father,
Phil, was once a Grand Slam finalist and a Davis Cup stalwart for
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor Dent's birth certificate tells a different story. At
17 years 4 months, he is the youngest player in the main men's
draw. And when he takes the court against Alex Radulescu of Germany
in the first round on Monday, he will be discarding the safety net
of amateur tennis for good.
</P>
<P>
   As a professional, Dent is now eligible for plenty of prize
money and plenty of pressure; for complimentary hotel rooms and
complementary expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But then Dent has been dealing with economy-sized expectations
since he won the United States Tennis Association's 14-and-under
and 16-and-under national titles in consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gullikson, the USTA director of coaching, said: ``I think
he's got an incredible amount of ability. I think he's got a big
game and the potential to do very well on the pro tour.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of an extremely small group of American boys now
considered to have such potential, Dent has been swarmed by agents;
he has heard the encouraging words of elders, and now he and his
father/coach are convinced that the time is right to make the leap:
not straight into the top 10, mind you, but into the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've beaten all the best juniors, and I think the pros is the
next step for me,'' Dent said with a wide, can't-miss grin and not
the slightest hint of trepidation. ``It's the right timing because
I'm right there with the top guys. Last week at Long Island, I beat
some guy who was ranked 58th in the world. Regardless of what
anybody says, when you're ranked that high, there's not much
separating the top.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It would be different if I was getting blown out of
matches, just getting smoked. But I'm holding my own, and I just
need the consistency of competing with these guys day in and day
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dent, who has a powerful all-court game, a huge serve and a
one-handed backhand that he can slice or drive effectively, did
beat the world's 58th-ranked player: Mariano Puerto of Argentina.
He also pushed the former Wimbledon semifinalist David Wheaton, now
ranked 210th, to three sets in the first round in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that Dent is ready. Dick Leach, the
father of the professional Rick Leach and coach at Southern
California, said Dent could benefit from a year or two of college
tennis. But Phil Dent, who has coached his son since he began
playing at the age of 11, has a different perspective, although he
is very quick to emphasize that his son's game is a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to blow this out of proportion because he's not
ready,'' Phil Dent said. ``I know the expectations are there
because there aren't many American guys, really. But in my eyes, if
his potential level is a 10, he's probably only at a 4 right now.
He's just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every guy playing in the U.S. Open junior event here except
for the Americans is basically a pro. They get money from agents
and clothing firms. They play money tournaments. All going pro
excludes Taylor from doing is playing tennis in college and maybe a
couple of national junior tournaments. It does not necessarily mean
he will not play any more junior events. But I think he's ready to
be out there on the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketability was also a factor in the Dents' decision.
</P>
<P>
   With American prospects scarce, Taylor's appeal to sponsors is
magnified. And though the Dents say they have yet to sign any
deals, negotiations on a multimillion-dollar contract are well
under way with at least one firm.
</P>
<P>
   Though Taylor spent several years in Australia as a child, he
was born and spent most of his life in Southern California. The
only time he sounds Australian is when he imitates his father, who
reached the Australian Open final in 1974. Taylor has never seen
film of his father at his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hidden all the film,'' Phil Dent said.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that both of Taylor's parents were worth
watching. His mother is Betty Ann Stuart, a former top-20
professional player. Dent and Stuart divorced when Taylor was 12.
Since then, Taylor has lived with Phil.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son are close, teasing each other about their
respective tempers and respective laundry habits, and they will
soon be in even closer quarters as they roam the world in pursuit
of tour computer ranking points.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Dent is not concerned about his son's ability to adapt to
the nomadic life that he knows so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth,'' Phil Dent said, ``Taylor even likes
airline food.''

the poor, ``hate-crime'' legislation to protect homosexuals and
more federal money for AIDS education.
</P>
<P>
   Does the senator see the contradictions, too? Up to a point, of
course. But why should an intelligent man be confined by party
dogma? How can a legislator be effective if he allows the perfect
to be the enemy of the good?
</P>
<P>
   Like any good Republican, the senator thinks less government is
better and lower taxes are fairer: ``I was the architect of the
capital-gains tax reduction...If we did away with death taxes, the
wealthy would use those funds far more productively.''
</P>
<P>
   But the senator has not forgotten his abject childhood in
Pittsburgh (so poor that his father built the family home from used
lumber). An ironic smile flickers across his face: ``I was raised a
liberal Democrat. I haven't lost all my compassionate instincts;
I'm for helping people who can't help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the partnership with Senator Kennedy: ``He normally gets
all the credit, but I don't care. I just want to do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   It is simply that what is right is normally better achieved by
the Republicans' agenda. (``I left the Democratic Party in the
1960s. What helped me leave was that I served as a Mormon
missionary for two years, which showed me what true compassion
was.'')
</P>
<P>
   And what will be right for President Clinton? Both as a good
Mormon and a politically calculating Republican (why present a
premature presidency to Al Gore?), Hatch is a forgiving man: ``I
don't think we can condemn people because they've made mistakes in
this life.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also a romantic man, writing ``inspirational'' music and
love songs (one celebrates Ted Kennedy's wedding anniversary,
another is dedicated to ``my friend Muhammad Ali''). As his press
secretary brings in a handful of CDs, the senator says firmly: ``I
want you to tell me what you think _ even if it sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Lexington has listened, and it's not bad. Perhaps the
president would care to listen to track four of ``Whispers Of My
Heart'': ``I've been on a stormy sea, Thru the darkest of days, But
I wasn't worried, I never lost faith, 'Cause I knew you would be
there. In you I found strength.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To impeach or not; to resign or not. Whatever the
distractions _ next week's trip to Russia, last week's missile
attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan _ the questions hover ominously
over Bill Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   What makes them all the more threatening is that the answers may
be decided not by the Republicans but by Clinton's very own
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this week's statements, carefully spun in different
directions, from the House speaker, Newt Gingrich, and his
Democratic opposite number, Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, to the almost audible relief of the administration,
believes that only ``a pattern of felonies,'' not ``a single human
mistake,'' would justify an impeachment inquiry by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Gephardt commented that while impeachment should
not be undertaken lightly, ``that doesn't mean it can't be done or
shouldn't be done. You just better be sure you do it the right
way.''
</P>
<P>
   With colleagues like Gephardt, Clinton has no need of enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Gingrich be so magnanimous and Gephardt so mean?
Cynics will say it is a matter of personal ambition. Gingrich's
presumed bid for the presidency depends on casting off his old
image of the confrontational radical: to sound moderate, even if it
boosts President Clinton, is to widen his electoral appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Gingrich may calculate, why call for the
president's downfall when such calls can be cited by the
Clintonites as helpful evidence of ``a vast right-wing
conspiracy?''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gephardt, an old-style Democrat who has never
warmed to Clinton, doubtless reckons his best chance of securing
the Democratic nomination in 2000 is to distance the party from its
embattled president and, by extension, from the president's heir
apparent, Al Gore. (Gore is not without problems of his own; Janet
Reno, the attorney-general, has just launched a 90-day inquiry into
whether she needs to appoint a special prosecutor to look into his
fund-raising activities.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are those who suggest that Gephardt and others
have their eyes as much on 2004 as on 2000. After all, if President
Clinton is impeached or shamed into resignation before Jan. 20,
Gore will then serve more than half of the current presidential
term and so be eligible for just one more term.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Clinton's departure comes later, then Gore
could seek election twice and conceivably be president until
January 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a point, the cynics are doubtless right: politicians and
self-interest go together. But there is a more fundamental
explanation for these maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Clinton, thanks to his antics with Monica
Lewinsky, has ``disappointed'' (a favorite word these days in
Washington) the political establishment. But he has clearly
disappointed his party colleagues more than his Republican
opponents, and in particular he has disappointed _ many would say
``betrayed'' _ those New Democrats who were closest to him.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee Myers, Clinton's press secretary at the start of his
presidency, was this week lambasting her former boss for ``putting
through hell'' the very people who had ``worked their tails off''
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Assume such opinions are widespread, and Clinton could be on
course for a nasty collision.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the collision actually happens is another matter. For
one thing, there is little appetite on Capitol Hill for the
wrenching agony of impeachment (a vote of censure would be a much
easier course).
</P>
<P>
   For another, Clinton still has some time to play with. The
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, is likely to present a report
to Congress at some point next month.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Congress is scheduled to adjourn on Oct. 9, and that
the House Judiciary Committee will want to do some investigating
and witness-calling of its own, clearly no impeachment inquiry will
be started until after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   But what will Clinton do with that time? Some Republicans, their
memories scarred by the public blame attached to them during the
government shutdown three years ago, are convinced that the
president will try his hardest to pick a populist fight _ over the
congressional opposition to Medicare expansion, for example, or
more money for hiring teachers _ and will use his veto on various
Republican-amended appropriations bills to shut down the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The president would then look both tough and principled; the
Democrats would be inspired; and the public would be distracted
from the Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   Would such hardball tactics by the president work as well for
his ratings this time as in the winter of 1995? It is hard to say.
Pundits who once sat comfortably in the Clintonite camp have turned
against him, dismayed by his mea culpa of Aug. 17 and disgusted by
the details now leaking out about his relations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan did briefly rally
editorial opinion, but then the columnists and talking-heads began
to have second, damning, thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few core loyalists _ especially among blacks and (oddly,
given the misuse of Lewinsky) women _ have kept faith with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton has lost his magic with the pundits, he still retains
much of it with the public. An ABC poll on Aug. 23 put the
president's job-approval rating at 64 percent; 68 percent of the
sample reckoned him a ``strong leader''; and 79 percent credited
Clinton with ``a good job keeping the economy strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, if Wall Street only slips rather than slides, if
foreign policy goes the president's way, if Starr's report is not
too damning, the president will still glide, unharmed, around the
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   But those are already a lot of ``ifs,'' and the biggest is yet
to come.
</P>
<P>
   Americans like to revere not just their president but also the
very trappings of his office. Indeed, Ronald Reagan would famously
always keep his jacket on in the Oval Office. What happens if the
rumored details of Clinton's misbehavior in that same Oval Office
become common knowledge rather than Internet tittle-tattle?
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably the job-approval ratings could sink to the depths
already plumbed by those for ``high personal, moral and ethical
standards'': 19 percent. In which case, why would anyone wish this
president to stay in office? &QL;

OKLAHOMA: A DEAD CANDIDATE COMPLICATES A RUNOFF  
 ILLINOIS: POLLS GIVE INCUMBENT A REASON TO WORRY  
 MICHIGAN: LOSING GROUND, EVEN IN HIS OWN PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In last Tuesday's primary to pick a nominee to run against Sen.
Don Nickles this fall, they gave Don Carroll, an air-conditioner
serviceman, the most votes. But they did not give him a clean
majority of the votes _ only 46 percent of them _ so under Oklahoma
law a runoff will be necessary, pitting Carroll against the
second-place finisher, Jacquelyn Morrow Lewis Ledgerwood.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: Mrs. Ledgerwood, a 69-year-old homemaker, died of a
heart attack in July, too close to primary day for her name to be
struck from the ballot. But in a low-turnout contest in which the
four Democratic contenders were mostly inexperienced, underfinanced
and underorganized political unknowns because no big-name Democrat
was willing to take on a Republican incumbent as popular as
Nickles, Mrs. Ledgerwood captured 21 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic leaders suggest dropping any idea of a runoff,
considering that Mrs. Ledgerwood remained on the ballot only
because of a time technicality. They also argue that there
otherwise is no reason for a runoff because the outcome essentially
is already known, Carroll having pulled twice as many votes as Mrs.
Ledgerwood the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   But most party leaders and state officials say that the law is
the law, that the votes of Mrs. Ledgerwood's supporters cannot be
arbitrarily tossed out and that in any case there is no guarantee
that Mrs. Ledgerwood would lose a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   What if Mrs. Ledgerwood should win the runoff, remote as that
possibility might be?
</P>
<P>
   The consensus _ if there is one _ seems to be that Oklahoma law
provides that she would then face Nickles in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But because she is dead, some voters have begun asking, why
couldn't party leaders name a substitute for her at that point, a
procedure followed in many states when a nominee dies or otherwise
cannot run?
</P>
<P>
   There is no provision in Oklahoma law for naming a substitute,
most state and party officials agree. Anyway, they add, if there
were, the party might then be sorely and divisively tempted to
abandon Carroll in the primary runoff, back Mrs. Ledgerwood all
out, then try to find a big-name Democrat to substitute for her in
the fall race against Nickles.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the ultimate question: What happens if Mrs. Ledgerwood
wins the runoff and goes on to defeat Nickles in the general
election?
</P>
<P>
   Again, the consensus, if there is one, seems to be that in that
unlikely event, the Senate seat would be declared open immediately
after her victory and a whole new election would be scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' said Robert Kerr III, the chairman of the Oklahoma
Democratic Party. ``We don't know for sure yet. We've got a real
mess out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois breezed to victory in 1992 when
she became the first black woman to win a seat in the U.S. Senate.
But six years later, dogged by questions about campaign financing
and why she paid visits to an African dictator, she finds herself
struggling as she seeks a second term.
</P>
<P>
   And things seem to be getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the race, national Democratic leaders have
been nagged by worries that Ms. Moseley-Braun might be the most
endangered of Democratic senators running. Now, confirming the
worst of those worries, after months of trailing in the polls, her
Republican opponent, state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, has pulled close
to even in several polls and leads in at least one.
</P>
<P>
   Equally serious, polltakers say more voters now hold a negative
view of Ms. Moseley-Braun than a positive view. They also report
that among women, a powerful constituency in the senator's 1992
victory, about as many plan to vote for Fitzgerald, a conservative,
as for Ms. Moseley-Braun, a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald is gearing up a television advertising blitz that is
expected to cost as much as $4 million over the next several
months, maybe more if he decides to tap deeper into his personal
fortune of $40 million or so. (He spent $7 million of his money in
winning his party's nomination.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun, by contrast, is down to about $1 million in
her campaign coffers, according to her latest campaign finance
report.
</P>
<P>
   Political pros caution not to count the senator out yet, as she
has been a pretty good fund-raiser and campaigner in the past and
is far better known than Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   But given how deep Fitzgerald's pockets are and the momentum he
seems to be building, this race appears to be a toss-up.
</P>
<P>
   A month after winning the Democratic nomination in the Michigan
governor's race, Geoffrey Fieger trails the Republican incumbent,
John Engler, by almost two to one in the polls and seems to be
steadily losing ground.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger, a rogue-mouthed lawyer best know for representing Dr.
Jack Kevorkian, the advocate of physician-assisted suicide, tried
to reach out over the weekend to two crucial constituencies, naming
a running mate with close ties to big labor and calling for the
election of a black person as Michigan's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   But many political analysts and top Democrats say the damage
already done by Fieger's stick-in-the-eye campaign rhetoric _ he
has called the popular governor a ``racist,'' ``fat'' and a
``moron'' _ might be beyond repair. Some analysts and party leaders
say he might run so poorly that the entire Democratic ticket could
suffer as a result.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting a poll 10 days ago for The Detroit News that
found Engler leading the race by almost 30 points, about 10 points
more than in some earlier surveys, Steve Mitchell of Mitchell
Research told the paper, ``Fieger is not just an albatross around
the neck of Democrats; he's an anchor that could bring a lot of
Democrats down with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried by that prospect, some party members have begun to
publicly back away from Fieger or put him at political arm's
length.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be associated with him,'' state Rep. William
Callahan of St. Clair Shores, a Detroit suburb, said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan's 1st Congressional District, on
the Upper Peninsula, declared, ``I've not endorsed him, probably
won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of Congress, Rep. James Barcia of the 5th
District, north of Detroit on the Lower Peninsula's thumb, called
upon Fieger over the weekend to be ``less personal'' in his verbal
assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger's response to all this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   And Engler's take, as proffered by his spokeswoman, Maureen
McNulty:
</P>
<P>
   ``Fieger's running against his own mouth. He's not running
against John Engler.''

RAFTER SERVES UP A WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMMACK, N.Y. _ Patrick Rafter celebrated his Hamlet Cup victory
Sunday long enough to hoist the glass trophy and pose with his
poster-size $45,000 check.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' he said. `'I'm ready for the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   No postmatch beer. No golf. Rafter has a U.S. Open title to
defend.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Rafter confessed that his mind began wandering
to the Open before he put away eighth-seeded Felix Mantilla of
Spain, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, in the Hamlet final. Rafter has captured
five tour championships this year, the most by an Australian since
John Newcombe won nine in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter takes rocket-like momentum into his first-round match
against Hicham Arazi of Morocco on Tuesday. Rafter, ranked No. 3 in
the world, dropped one set all week and surrendered one service
break. Since mid-June, he has won 26 of 29 matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope that physically I'm still fresh,'' Rafter said.
``I'll take a good rest tonight and tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter tried to shorten the points against Mantilla in the
energy-zapping humidity. Mantilla showed his vulnerability by
nearly dumping two service games in the first set, but he battled
back in both to force a tie breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter built a 4-0 lead in the tie breaker _ mostly on his
assault at the net _ then let Mantilla climb back to 4-3 with a
missed dink shot, a half-volley into the net and a clunky return of
serve that landed long.
</P>
<P>
   But the Australian responded by smacking a volley winner, a
service winner and sweeping Mantilla wide with a volley, forcing
him into an awkward backhand that hit the net.
</P>
<P>
   Mantilla's waning upset hopes crumbled quickly in the second
set. He double-faulted in the first game to hand Rafter the first
of two service breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he broke me, he served better and better,'' said
Mantilla, who pocketed $26,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, the crowd favorite at the Hamlet Golf and Country Club,
shed his sweaty wristbands and spare shirts after match point and
hurled them into the crowd of 4,526. One man caught a wristband and
tried to hand it to his female companion. She shook her head no.
Even Rafter-mania has its limits.

   Whether the collision actually happens is another matter. For
one thing, there is little appetite on Capitol Hill for the
wrenching agony of impeachment (a vote of censure would be a much
easier course).
</P>
<P>
   For another, Clinton still has some time to play with. The
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, is likely to present a report
to Congress at some point next month.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Congress is scheduled to adjourn on Oct. 9, and that
the House Judiciary Committee will want to do some investigating
and witness-calling of its own, clearly no impeachment inquiry will
be started until after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   But what will Clinton do with that time? Some Republicans, their
memories scarred by the public blame attached to them during the
government shutdown three years ago, are convinced that the
president will try his hardest to pick a populist fight _ over the
congressional opposition to Medicare expansion, for example, or
more money for hiring teachers _ and will use his veto on various
Republican-amended appropriations bills to shut down the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The president would then look both tough and principled; the
Democrats would be inspired; and the public would be distracted
from the Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   Would such hardball tactics by the president work as well for
his ratings this time as in the winter of 1995? It is hard to say.
Pundits who once sat comfortably in the Clintonite camp have turned
against him, dismayed by his mea culpa of Aug. 17 and disgusted by
the details now leaking out about his relations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan did briefly rally
editorial opinion, but then the columnists and talking-heads began
to have second, damning, thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few core loyalists _ especially among blacks and (oddly,
given the misuse of Lewinsky) women _ have kept faith with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton has lost his magic with the pundits, he still retains
much of it with the public. An ABC poll on Aug. 23 put the
president's job-approval rating at 64 percent; 68 percent of the
sample reckoned him a ``strong leader''; and 79 percent credited
Clinton with ``a good job keeping the economy strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, if Wall Street only slips rather than slides, if
foreign policy goes the president's way, if Starr's report is not
too damning, the president will still glide, unharmed, around the
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   But those are already a lot of ``ifs,'' and the biggest is yet
to come.
</P>
<P>
   Americans like to revere not just their president but also the
very trappings of his office. Indeed, Ronald Reagan would famously
always keep his jacket on in the Oval Office. What happens if the
rumored details of Clinton's misbehavior in that same Oval Office
become common knowledge rather than Internet tittle-tattle?
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably the job-approval ratings could sink to the depths
already plumbed by those for ``high personal, moral and ethical
standards'': 19 percent. In which case, why would anyone wish this
president to stay in office? &QL;

DUVAL WINS HIS THIRD TOURNAMENT OF THE YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ He led from start to finish Sunday, unfazed by the
pressure and the intimidating names that were chasing him.
</P>
<P>
   This was David Duval at his best, taking on all comers,
relentlessly making machine-like shots with his eyes hidden behind
dark sunglasses. Since October, Duval has been the most consistent
winner on the PGA Tour, a player who reacts like a shark that
smells blood when he smells a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming the first three-time winner on tour this year, and
reclaiming the top spot on the money list, Duval captured another
trophy for his mantel by winning the World Series of Golf by two
strokes over Phil Mickelson. Shooting a steady 2-under-par 68 at
the difficult Firestone Country Club, Duval finished at 11-under
269 for the tournament, two strokes ahead of Mickelson, who also
shot a 68 Sunday. Davis Love III finished third, three shots back,
after making a final-round run with a 65.
</P>
<P>
   With the $405,000 first-place check, Duval passed the $2 million
mark in season earnings ($2,070,283) faster than anyone in golf
history. If not for Mark O'Meara's victories at the Masters and the
British Open, Duval would have the inside track for player of the
year honors. Yet, with six victories since last October, the
27-year-old Duval showed he is a player with special ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``When crunch time came, I hit the shots I had to hit, made the
putts I needed to make,'' said Duval, who became the first player
since Nick Price in 1993 and '94 to win at least three events in
back-to-back seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would react if someone called him the best young
player on tour, Duval said: ``That's flattering, but you have to
have a lot of arrogance to say you're better than Tiger Woods,
better than Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk and Justin Leonard. I just
don't have enough arrogance to do that. There's an awful lot of
good young players on tour, and an awful lot of good older players,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's victory was particularly impressive because it came
against an elite field of 44 golfers who qualified by winning at
least one tournament during the past 12 months. The final round
started with Duval holding a one-stroke lead over John Cook, a
two-stroke lead over Mickelson, a three-stroke lead over O'Meara,
and a four-stroke lead over Woods. A lesser player might have been
rattled being pursued by those names. But Duval gave some insight
into his mental toughness on Saturday, when he talked about how he
would approach Sunday's round.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to sound stupid, but it doesn't matter who
you're playing against,'' Duval said. ``The lowest score is going
to win. That doesn't matter if you're playing against Tiger, or
against someone else you might call a lesser name. It doesn't
matter. I don't get caught up with who I'm competing against. I get
nervous like anybody else, but getting too worked up and getting
upset is counterproductive to what I'm trying to accomplish.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Duval accomplished exactly what he wanted Sunday, while others
faltered. Cook, who shot a scintillating 62 on Saturday, never
approached that level Sunday, shooting a 71 and finishing fourth at
7 under par. A crowd favorite who went to Ohio State, Cook left
disappointed for the second consecutive year. Cook was the
third-round leader last year, but he eventually finished tied for
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I did right yesterday was the opposite today,''
said Cook, who played in the final group with Duval and admired his
playing partner's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``David drove the ball beautifully,'' he said. ``There's no
mystery as to why he's at the level he is. He and a couple of other
guys are the future of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a disappointing final round for Woods, who shot a 70
and finished tied for fifth. Woods has 12 top 10 finishes in 18
starts on tour this year, yet he has only one victory. Why is Woods
having so much trouble finishing what he starts? He wishes he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need some time off,'' said Woods, who has played four
consecutive weeks. ``I've been right there, week in and week out.
It's frustrating that I haven't won. It's just a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   It took 87 starts, including seven second-place finishes, for
Duval to win his first tour event, but he has now won six of his
last 22 tournaments. Last year at this time, people were
questioning Duval's ability to close out a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never viewed myself as a failure,'' he said. ``I always felt
I was progressing. There's a pretty impressive list of people who
took a lot longer to win than me. I always found it ironic that I
was getting knocked about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Six victories later, no one is knocking him.

   MILWAUKEE AND SPRINGFIELD _ The days are growing shorter in the
Midwest. School will soon be back in session. The crops, if not
ready for harvest, are standing tall in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time for the consummate end-of-summer ritual: the
state fair.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a million people passed through the gates of the 1998
Iowa State Fair during its 11-day run in August. Illinois and
Wisconsin boasted similar numbers. According to Carla Corbin, a
University of Illinois professor who has studied agricultural fairs
since 1991, nearly 160 million people attend such state and county
fairs every year.
</P>
<P>
   On payment of the small admission fee ($3 for adults in
Illinois), visitors are treated to an experience that is
part-carnival, part-farm show, part-food emporium, part-town
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Where else can one listen to a candidate for governor outline
his farm program in the morning, watch skunk racing in the
afternoon, and listen to the rock band Sister Hazel in the evening?
</P>
<P>
   The state fair _ and the thousands of smaller county fairs _ are
rooted in agriculture. Food is ardently celebrated: Wisconsin
bratwurst, roasted Illinois corn drenched with butter, hand-dipped
corn dogs, fried cheese curd, giant cinnamon buns, all sampled and
approved by your correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the 500-pound butter sculpture (Iowa), the
world's largest apple pie (Wisconsin), and the pork cook-off
(Illinois). Prizes are awarded for everything, from the top draft
horse to the champion wheel of blue cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Such honors are worth more than pride. In Wisconsin, the grand
champion steer fetched $43,000 at auction this year; last year's
top Illinois ham sold for a record $1,550.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a trade show for farmers, where standards of
excellence are determined and advertised. In the process, farmers
share a glimpse of their lives with those whose closest encounter
with agriculture is usually the dairy counter at the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the fair is walking through the livestock barns
soaking up the sights, the (pungent) smells, and the excitement of
the occasional pig making a dash for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Such fairs, of course, are not an American invention: they have
evolved from the medieval fairs of Europe. But they can now boast a
long history of their own.
</P>
<P>
   This year's was the 145th Illinois State Fair, now held on the
366-acre fairground in the state capital of Springfield. At the
fair of 1854, Senator Douglas of Illinois gave a rousing
two-and-a-half-hour speech in favor of the Kansas-Nebraska Act,
which allowed for the spread of slavery to new states and
territories. The young Abraham Lincoln came the next day to deliver
a rebuttal. It was his first public speech opposing the spread of
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians may now be more inclined towards TV ads, but most
still make at least one appearance at their local fair. Incumbents
are keen to plaster their names around.
</P>
<P>
   A sign at the Illinois fair reminded patrons that the drinking
water was provided by George Ryan, secretary of state and candidate
for governor.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of exposure is not lost on the private sector. The
Illinois fair had 21 corporate sponsors, each trying to exude the
spirit of the event. Ameritech, a telecoms company, sponsored the
high-dive exhibition: daring divers plunged from great heights into
the Ameritech tank below.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago chose this year's Iowa State
Fair as a place to educate the public about the new $20 bill: it
sponsored a booth where adults could see the bill and children
could win prizes by matching countries with their currencies.
(Alas, the prizes were merely bags of shredded American currency.)
</P>
<P>
   Some attractions border on the absurd. Not to be outdone by
Illinois skunk-racing, Wisconsin this year introduced the canine
musical free-style competition, ``a blend of dog obedience and
dance moves performed to music.''
</P>
<P>
   Other events have gone by the wayside. There are no longer
girlie shows on the outskirts of the fair, or exhibits of
two-headed cows and headless ladies.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that tastes have changed, says Corbin; it is just that
daytime television delivers a superior line in sex and freaks. &QL;

spirit of the event. Ameritech, a telecoms company, sponsored the
high-dive exhibition: daring divers plunged from great heights into
the Ameritech tank below.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago chose this year's Iowa State
Fair as a place to educate the public about the new $20 bill: it
sponsored a booth where adults could see the bill and children
could win prizes by matching countries with their currencies.
(Alas, the prizes were merely bags of shredded American currency.)
</P>
<P>
   Some attractions border on the absurd. Not to be outdone by
Illinois skunk-racing, Wisconsin this year introduced the canine
musical free-style competition, ``a blend of dog obedience and
dance moves performed to music.''
</P>
<P>
   Other events have gone by the wayside. There are no longer
girlie shows on the outskirts of the fair, or exhibits of
two-headed cows and headless ladies.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that tastes have changed, says Corbin; it is just that
daytime television delivers a superior line in sex and freaks. &QL;

   TOLEDO, Wash._ There's something about the sound of a World War
II-era John Deere tractor, a graceful two-step in a field of thuds
and idling rattles. Of course, there are farmers who disagree.
</P>
<P>
   At the 34th-annual Cowlitz Prairie Grange Steam Threshing and
Gas Show, the opposition came from fans of other tractors, like the
Farmall, the Case and the Massey.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who came to the show all agreed that the
collecting, refinishing and displaying of antique farm machinery _
or ``iron'' _ is an engaging and honorable pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the field of Bob Herren's farm, with Mount Rainier to the
north and the stump of Mount St. Helens to the east, the Threshing
Bee, as the show is known for short, attracted about 8,000 people
on Saturday and the same number on Sunday, the organizers said. In
addition to a tractor pull and a flea market, there were lots of
tractors driving around, several of them driven by children who
kicked switches with their feet because they were too little to
reach the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the day was the threshing (pronounced
``thrashing'' here) done on the hour, using machinery from earlier
in the century.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Zion of Kent, Wash., helped pitch oats into a 1946 John
Deere thresher, which was powered by a belt from a tractor about 50
feet away, while his cousin, Ben Klein of Sequim, dozed on the back
of the grain cart. With seven belts looped around one another in a
giant cat's cradle and pistons flying, the thresher worked like a
charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the serial number, it's supposed to be one of the last six
made,'' Zion said. ``It pretty much stays in the family.'' He said
he expected to be showing off machines like this and demonstrating
how they separate oats from chaff when his father gets too old to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the equipment was made before I was born,'' said Zion.
``Our grandfather did this in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the iron collectors, the John Deere fans seem to be the
most loyal. ``About half of them are like me,'' said John Fields,
president of the Southwest Washington 2 Cylinder Club. ``I've got a
small farm, and my newest farm tractor is a 1958. I'm able to enjoy
playing with the old farm machinery and do the farming that I
really enjoy too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields and Ted Blair of Elma, Wash., a past president of the
club, showed off an elegant 1960 620 orchard tractor, with a
swooping fairing to keep dropping fruit out of the machinery. It
was one of 202 ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Fields helped Blair start his 1944 John Deere bulldozer,
succeeding on the second try after a dozen energetic pushes to the
flywheel. Blair, who was wearing green and yellow John Deere
suspenders, doesn't use the machine for work anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to have fun with,'' he said. ``It's too old to get parts
for them, and if you broke something major, it would be down.'' The
engine putted along steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing at the engine, Fields said: ``It's that sound right
there. The others go BRRRRRR. This has a little split sound right
there, and that's what attracts people to it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the end of a long row of humming engines and spinning
flywheels, Dennis Leischner of Boring, Ore., who wore a T-shirt
proclaiming him a ``Gas Engine Nut,'' explained that farm engines
were often kept on wheels so they could be used all over, to pump
water, grid feed or separate cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the sound of them,'' Leischner said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Herren, who provided the oats for the Threshing Bee,
displayed a gas engine _ ``about a horse and a half'' _ that he
once used for pumping water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threshed the old-fashioned way, and I plowed the whole
field with a 14-inch plow, seven miles of walking to the acre,''
Herren said.
</P>
<P>
   Threshing 40 acres took all winter. Herren remembered when one
thresher served all the neighborhood farms and took 20 men to run
properly. There was suspicion when the first combines appeared, and
Herren said he still believed that the old threshers are better in
some ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grain gets to dry out a bit, and a stationary thresher can
do a cleaner job than a combine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing at a red Waterloo Boy, he said: ``This came out of the
cemetery. It was used to pump water in the cemetery in Vader.''
</P>
<P>
   He used to find old engines when surveying properties, but, he
said, ``I don't find them very often anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A South Dakota family gave the 1946 thresher to Zion's family,
which had to find a low-boy truck to haul it to Washington. When he
was done threshing, Zion let a handful of oats fall through his
hands, rolled one between his fingers and pulled back the husk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``is the beginning of breakfast.''

   ELDERHOSTEL (Kotzbebue, Alaska) _ Martha Rowe, three weeks shy
of her 77th birthday, found herself heading out of Kotzebue on a
beat-up yellow bus with a taped-together steering wheel, cracked
windshield and seats that slid around with every bump and curve in
the unpaved road. Her destination was a primitive fish camp on a
narrow strip of gravel beach between the tundra and the Chukchi
Sea, on the outskirts of Kotzebue, 26 miles above the Arctic
Circle, closer to Russia than Anchorage. ``I wanted an adventure,''
said Ms. Rowe, a retired clinical director of physical therapy at
the University of Florida in Gainesville. So did her fellow

<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. _ Last December, Ken Kondek's wife, Chris, was
planning a September trip to Las Vegas to celebrate a friend's 50th
wedding anniversary. Kondek, the assistant coach of the Toms River
East Little League team, refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I don't want to go because I'm going to
Williamsport,''' Mrs. Kondek said, referring to the Pennsylvania
town that is the site of the Little League World Series. ``And this
was in December!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was wishful thinking on the part of Kondek, since he
was planning to retire from Little League coaching this year after
20 years and wanted to go out right. Or maybe he really knew
something about these young players, seeing as the Kondeks live
right across the street from the Toms River East Little League
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, Kondek could not have envisioned what played
out last week in Williamsport, a week that was capped on Saturday
by Toms River's 12-9 victory over Kashima, Japan, to win the 52nd
annual Little League World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could he have envisioned the hero's welcome the team
received on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the team bus rolled off the Garden State Parkway at Route 37
about 1:45 p.m., accompanied by a police escort, several hundred
well-wishers who had been waiting since the morning lined the south
side of the road. Along the route, the team disembarked from the
bus and got on top of a fire truck to ride on to the Little League
complex, where they were met by an estimated 2,000 residents who
were finally getting a chance to greet their young heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe this?'' asked Charlie Frazier, a vice
principal of Toms River South High School and the father of Todd
Frazier, who hit four home runs in the Series and was the winning
pitcher in the championship game. ``They could have gone to the
beach today, and instead they came here.''
</P>
<P>
   They came to celebrate not just a local team, but the first U.S.
team to win the Little League World Series in five years. Many of
the boosters who lined the road waved American flags against a
backdrop of strip malls and tire stores.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the boisterous throng also brought signs and banners,
including one hanging from the side of a camper van that read:
``Marry me Chris Cardone. Love, Alexa.'' But Chris, who hit the
game-winning home run in the sixth and final inning of Saturday's
game, does not necessarily need to stock up on wedding clothes yet
_ Alexa Manforti is only 7.
</P>
<P>
   From the first game in Williamsport in which she saw Chris,
Alexa was smitten. When her father, Al, a chiropractor, told her he
knew Chris _ he treats Chris' family _ she got even more excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started with the first game,'' Manforti said of Alexa's
infatuation. ``She said he was really cute. She wanted to get rid
of her first-grade boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chris' mother, Lucy, said of the sign: ``Not yet. I want to
hold on to him a little bit longer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from the even-keel demeanor he displayedin the
Series Mike Gaynor, the team manager who coached another Toms River
team to Williamsport in 1995, thanked each of his players
individually with a touch of emotion..
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said that if I came back, I would have more
success,'' he said. Then, turning to the team and smiling, he said,
``It kind of worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the champions, while basking in the adulation,
were clearly exhausted and not very talkative. None addressed the
crowd at the rally. Still, the second baseman, Joey Franceschini,
told reporters, ``It was awesome to have all the fans cheering you
on.''
</P>
<P>
   While a number of public appearances await, the players from
Toms River said on Sunday that they simply wanted to go home and
regain some normalcy in their lives, perhaps not fully
understanding the scope of their accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when it's going to hit them?'' Mrs. Kondek said.
``When they're 40 and they have kids. Right now, it's awesome, and
five years from now it'll be cool. But right now, they just don't
know.''

`ABDUCTION FROM THE SERAGLIO': A LEVANTINE PORT AND HAREM REVEALED
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALZBURG, Austria _ One of the problems presented by Mozart's
``Abduction From the Seraglio'' is that the noblest character,
Bassa Selim, never gets to sing. As a result, it can easily seem
that music is able to serve only the weak: the four Europeans who,
caught in the act of abduction, are shamed by Selim's benevolence
and, beside them, the comically absurd slave Osmin.
</P>
<P>
   Selim is shown as the pattern of magnanimity, which was, from
Mozart's point of view, one of the chief virtues in a ruler. Yet
his realm is musically defined only by a caricature of Turkish
military music: the insistent piccolo and quick crashing cymbals of
the overture and of Osmin's numbers. While the libretto finds
sagacity and enlightenment at home in the Orient, the music can
discover nothing but strangeness and barbarism.
</P>
<P>
   The current Salzburg Festival production offers a fascinating
new perspective, wonderfully achieved. In the hands of a director
from the Islamic world, Francois Abou Salem, the work gains not
just a rich dramatic texture but also a deeper musical expression
of the Levantine port and palace harem where the action takes
place, for Abou Salem takes the bold step of adding to Mozart's
score a pair of players on Turkish instruments.
</P>
<P>
   A drummer (Pierre Rigopoulos) joins in the opera's ``Turkish''
music, disinfecting the crudity by concurring in it. And Kudsi
Erguner, on the ney, a long end-blown flute, wanders through from
time to time, quietly introducing a much more sophisticated voice
from the musical East.
</P>
<P>
   His interventions are very beautiful and sensitive. The most
important of them come before the start of the third act, whose
music his contemplative solo seems to introduce, and in the finale,
which is interrupted for a cadenza from him. The Europeans, having
gained their liberty, sing of their joy and gratitude. Then the
music stops on a dominant chord, and, as Erguner starts to play,
attention shifts back to Selim.
</P>
<P>
   With two other figures, he starts to whirl and slowly to retreat
into the back of the set, to the serenely exhilarating music of the
ney and drum. Selim, after the adventure of the opera, is going
back to a civilization that Mozart's music cannot comprehend but
only stop and listen to. When Mozart's music picks up again, for
the concluding chorus, the Europeans look as if they might have
made a poor choice in turning their backs on Selim's world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The dramatic realization of that world is full of life. Francine
Gaspar's set is a world in itself, opening out to the back (through
the arcade of the courtyard in the archbishop's palace, where
performances take place), to the sides, where trellised embrasures
can slide up or down to be windows or doorways, and to the
underneath, through an elaborate system of traps.
</P>
<P>
   Drifting in and out of this world come servants, soldiers,
children and ladies of the harem. The ladies are softly supportive
of Konstanze, while the soldiers are dressed to suggest a modern
Middle East, though the updating is no more insisted on than the
crosscultural aspects.

   Marc Minkowski's conducting is generally quick, always colorful
and highly musical: a consistent delight and revelation. At the
performance on Wednesday, the soprano Elzbieta Szmytka played
sympathetically against the generous but intense and alert Selim of
Akram Tillawi. Paul Groves produced an appealing sound as Belmonte,
and his ability to sustain a long note was astonishing. Malin
Hartelius and Andreas Conrad were an effective pair as Blonde and
Pedrillo, and Franz Hawlata was an excellent Osmin. This character
at the end makes the right decision, wresting his eyes from Blonde
to rush back to the entranced Selim.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fabio Coen, a children's book editor, died on Aug. 19
at his home in Manhattan. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Coen worked with many leading writers and illustrators of books
for children and young adults, among them Roald Dahl, Roger
Duvoisin and Robert Cormier. Until his retirement in 1979, he was
editor in chief of the juvenile list at Pantheon Books and Alfred
A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier years, he worked as an editor at McDowell Obolensky,
and it was there, in 1959, that he encouraged a friend, Leo Lionni,
to write and illustrate a children's book.
</P>
<P>
   Lionni, who was then the art director of Fortune magazine,
produced ``Little Blue and Little Yellow,'' which was notable for
its innovative use of collage and was followed by such critically
acclaimed books as ``Swimmy'' and ``Frederick.''
</P>
<P>
   Coen, who was born in Rome and raised in Trieste, immigrated to
the United States in 1940. He worked briefly as a stage manager
with the Barter Theater in Virginia before being inducted into the
Army, where he served in the psychological warfare division and was
eventually stationed in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Silvana Siega, with whom he founded and operated
the Package Library of Foreign Children's Books, died in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Adri; two sons from his first
marriage, Axel, of New York City, and Paul, of Locke, N.Y.; and two
grandchildren.

AWESOME AGAIN EXTENDS HIS STREAK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ On a day when the thrills and echoes of
the Travers Stakes were still settling over the old Saratoga race
track, Awesome Again lived up to his name Sunday when he stalked
the leaders into the homestretch and then swept past to win the
Saratoga Breeders' Cup by three lengths and score his fourth
straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   He is a 4-year-old son of Deputy Minister and has had a pretty
good run of success in August the last couple of years. Last year,
he won the Jim Dandy Stakes and ran third in the Travers. This
year, he won the $400,000 Whitney Handicap three weeks ago and
returned to win the $300,000 Saratoga Breeders' Cup. He is 4 for 4
this year and hasn't lost since last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse just loves this race track,'' said Patrick Byrne,
trainer of Awesome Again. ``I couldn't have asked for more. The
Breeders' Cup Classic in November is definitely in mind, and that's
what we're shooting for. We'd like to get him to the Classic
undefeated this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Day, winning his sixth stakes of the Saratoga meeting, kept
his horse tucked in behind Dogwood Stable's Early Warning and
George Steinbrenner's Concerto for a mile, and then made his move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We relaxed off Concerto,'' Day said, ``but we didn't want him
to get too far away from us. At the three-eighths pole, we had him
in our sights. Coming to the three-sixteenths pole, we had him
where we wanted. I just bided my time from there, and called on him
at the sixteenth pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again ran the mile and a quarter in 2:03, paid $2.50 for
a $2 bet as the heavy favorite and earned $180,000. At the end, he
led Concerto by three lengths, and Concerto had a neck on Early
Warning.
</P>
<P>
   3-Horse Photo, 3-Race Choice
</P>
<P>
   It took a three-horse photo to decide the 129th Travers, but the
trainer Shug Mcgaughey said Sunday that ``Coronado's Quest is doing
fine.'' Next for the star of the 3-year-old class, who has a
winning streak of five stakes races: either the $500,000 Woodward
at Belmont Park on Sept. 19, the $500,000 Pegasus at the
Meadowlands on Sept. 25 or the $500,000 Super Derby at Louisiana
Downs on Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop, who ran second in the Kentucky Derby, the
Preakness and the Travers, ``ran a great race once again,'' said
his trainer, Elliott Walden. He also was considering the Super
Derby, but was not committed.
</P>
<P>
   Archers Bay, who finished fourth, and Grand Slam, who ran fifth,
might find grass in their future. Or, maybe shorter races for Grand
Slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mile and a quarter was beyond his scope,'' said
his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas. ``Cutting him back in distance seems
to be logical.''

THE GIANTS' RUNNING TRADITION IS IN QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only once in the last 30 years has someone other than a running
back led the New York Giants in total yardage gained, and that was
tight end Mark Bavaro during the statistically quirky 1987 season.
</P>
<P>
   For 62 years, Giants football has meant running the football.
From Tuffy Leemans in the 1930's to Alex Webster to Frank Gifford
and on through Ron Johnson, Joe Morris, Ottis Anderson and Rodney
Hampton, Giants running backs have customarily been the team's
all-purpose yardage leaders, a category that excludes a
quarterback's passing statistics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One wonders whether the 1998 version of the team is going to be
able to uphold the tradition. In the four-game preseason just
concluded, Giants running backs, especially those operating behind
the first-string offensive line, consistently failed to rush the
football effectively.
</P>
<P>
   When your team was the seventh best rushing team in the National
Football League last season, and when running the football has been
your main formula for gaining field position since players' helmets
were leather, that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know why the Giants starting offense has looked
so poor in the preseason, look at the production of the running
backs on first and second downs. Tiki Barber and Gary Brown, the
backs who have three-fourths of the rushing attempts with the first
team, have combined to average just 2.8 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   On third down this year, on average, the Giants starting offense
has faced third-and-7.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many teams convert on third down from that distance.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise then that in two preseason games, the losses to
Baltimore and Jacksonville, the first-string offense didn't pick up
a first down on any of its third-down attempts. Exclude the
preseason game with the Jets, when the Giants' offense played
superbly, and the Giants third-down conversion rate this month was
just 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of early last year,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel
said over the weekend, recalling the Giants' 1-3 start to the 1997
season. ``We must have had more second-and-long and third-and-longs
than any team in the history of the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were rescued a year ago when they got fullback
Charles Way more involved in the offense, the offensive line played
more consistently and quarterback Danny Kanell took over to improve
the short and medium-range part of the passing attack.
</P>
<P>
   All those things may have to happen again if the Giants expect
to successfully begin the defense of their National Football
Conference East title Sunday against the Washington Redskins.
Because it will take a lot more than the Giants showed in Friday's
tuneup against the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   As Fassel said of his offense on Sunday: ``We didn't get
anything accomplished. A lot of those guys didn't even need a
shower when that game was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel put a lot of blame for Friday's 14-6 loss on the starting
offensive line, which is the same five players who blocked
effectively a year ago. With that experience, it's likely that the
line will return to its 1997 form. The running back situation,
however, remains unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the carries against Washington will continue to be split
between Barber, Brown and Way; but Tyrone Wheatley, the odd man out
now for four seasons, gained more rushing yards than any other back
in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley ran for 112 yards, usually operating behind the second-
and third-string linemen. Wheatley also averaged more yards per
carry (3.9) than any other back.
</P>
<P>
   Individual preseason statistics are always hard to judge,
especially late in games because it's hard to evaluate the level of
the competition. But Wheatley's production and his situation with
the team seem to be the eternal paradox.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel withholds praise from Wheatley, saying he needs to see
more consistency. Wheatley stays out of the debate publicly, but
his friends on the team say he believes he needs 20 to 25 carries a
game to find a groove and to wear the other team out _ the big-back
formula carved for the Giants by Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   But Fassel won't give Wheatley carries based on the potential of
what might happen on the 20th carry. He wants immediate production,
like most coaches, and besides, he wants to spread the carries
around to involve Barber, Brown and Way. But Barber and Brown have
struggled.
</P>
<P>
   And so, around and around goes the discussion of the Giants
running back by committee.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it ends up at third-and-7.

 WOUTER GERMANS, DEVELOPER OF SOHO GALLERY BUILDING, 60 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wouter Germans, a partner in Hague Art Deliveries,
which developed 420 West Broadway, one of the primary gallery
buildings during the heyday of the Soho art scene, died on Aug. 24
at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 60 and lived
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications after heart-bypass surgery, said his
business partner, Fritz de Knegt.
</P>
<P>
   Germans was born in the Hague in 1938 and immigrated to the
United States in 1960. In 1964, he and de Knegt, who is also Dutch,
founded Hague Art Deliveries, one of the few art-handling
businesses that specialized in storing, moving and installing works
of contemporary art, which could be large and bulky. In 1970,
Germans and de Knegt bought a large loft building at 420 West
Broadway and persuaded Leo Castelli and three other prominent
uptown art dealers _ Ileana Sonnabend, John Weber and Andre
Emmerich _ to open galleries in the building.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent years, Germans became a familiar figure around
Soho, a participant in community board meetings and a host to
visiting European artists.
</P>
<P>
   Hague Art Deliveries closed in 1984, and Germans opened the
Germans Van Eck Gallery in its ground-floor space, showing the work
of Donald Lipski, Maureen Connor, Heide Fasnacht, Daniel Weiner and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Germans is survived by his wife, Trudy Ellen Carney; their son,
Teddy; a son from a previous marriage, Wouter Germans Jr. of
London; and two brothers, Teo, of Smithtown, N.Y., and Jacques, of
Bayside, Queens.

GIULIANI'S CRACKDOWN ON CABDRIVERS COULD BACKFIRE, CRITICS WARN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER DREW and ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rules of the road _ and the consequences of
violating them _ have changed dramatically for cabbies since Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani launched his crackdown in the spring amid growing
concerns about taxi safety.
</P>
<P>
   Police figures show that ticketing of cabbies is up 36 percent
over last year's pace, and city officials acknowledge that it has
become fairly common for officers to write multiple tickets for
some offenses. In addition, stiffer fines and penalties took effect
late last month, and fleet owners are expecting a wave of drivers
to be suspended as the latest tickets are processed.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi regulators say this hard-nosed campaign is making cabbies
more cautious and should help bring down the accident rate among a
class of drivers who have long been criticized for their risky
antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got everyone's attention,'' said Diane
McGrath-McKechnie, chairwoman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But many drivers and fleet owners, and even some judges in the
commission's own court system, say some aspects of the enforcement
initiative amount to overkill, and are likely to worsen a shortage
of full-time drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say cabbies' desperate need for fares leads some
to drive recklessly, and if the city wants to improve taxi service
and make the largely immigrant driving corps more professional, it
must also find ways to make getting behind the wheel more
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's approach is really to use negative reinforcement on
the industry, to do tougher enforcement and higher fines,'' said
Edward Rogoff, a professor of management at Baruch College in
Manhattan who has studied the taxi industry. ``It seems to me that
encouraging a system where drivers can make it a profession and
earn a living and stay in the industry awhile would have a much
better effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by the taxi commission show that the drivers who receive
the fewest traffic tickets are generally those who have been in the
business for five years or more and are used to its pressures. So
one of the most difficult questions now is whether it is wise to
chase drivers out of the business after two or three tickets and
replace them with inexperienced drivers who may be no better.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, who regulate nearly every aspect of the taxi
business, say they are aware that more needs to be done, and are
readying a second round of changes. Last week, the taxi commission
announced plans to require more extensive training for new cabbies.
It has also scheduled a hearing for Tuesday on one of the most
basic aspects of the industry's economics: the fees that most
yellow-cab drivers pay to lease their medallions, or licenses, from
the cabs' owners.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath-McKechnie would not say whether her agency is
considering major changes. But another new rule, requiring taxis to
carry much more accident insurance, takes effect Tuesday. And
veteran drivers, especially those who own their medallions, say
they fear that insurance costs, which are expected to jump 40
percent, coupled with the new fines of up to $1,000 for each
violation, could drive them out of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said, the next major battle might be over
whether there should be a fare increase to pay for the safety
improvements. The industry would like an increase, but Ms.
McGrath-McKechnie has said she sees no need for one. City officials
say medallion owners should absorb the costs of the safety
improvements and find ways for drivers to make more money.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, a number of drivers said they recognized the
city's need to tighten enforcement of traffic laws, and some said
they are driving more carefully now. But city statistics show that
the number of tickets issued to cabbies had already doubled from
1995 to last year. And in recent months, the cabbies say, police
officers have been issuing tickets that classify many common
violations as more severe infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi and police officials deny persecuting cabbies, but some
drivers say they have been treated harshly.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Pellow, a 60-year-old widow who raised four children with
her earnings as a cabbie, received a criminal summons, instead of
just a traffic ticket, for reckless driving after making what a
police officer considered an ``improper turn'' while changing lanes
on Eighth Avenue in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pellow's passenger was so upset by the officer's actions
that she wrote and signed a statement on the driver's trip log
saying she ``did not notice anything unusual re the driving of the
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pellow's case has not yet been heard in court, but she has
filed an administrative complaint against the officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police are like wolves going after a bunch of little bunny
rabbits,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some drivers are getting support from an unlikely quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Several judges in the taxi commission's court system, which has
a history of upholding 90 percent of the tickets given to taxi
drivers, said they have recently downgraded or dismissed reckless
driving charges or refused to accept guilty pleas from drivers who
did not understand the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the senior judges are looking at these things and
they're appalled by it,'' said one judge, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``Most of the cops say they don't like it
either, but they have to do what they have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judges say they also expect many drivers to be
suspended over the next few months as tickets written under the
stricter laws are adjudicated. Members of the Metropolitan Taxicab
Board of Trade, which represents owners of the largest taxi fleets,
said some drivers have begun to cut back their hours or look for
other work. They said this partly explains why an average of 18.5
percent of their fleets' cars were idle each day in July, up from
13.8 percent each day in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Kaplan, one of the fleet owners, said: ``There are guys
coming in saying, `Allen, I don't know if I can continue. Maybe
I've had it.' And what's disheartening is that these are the
veteran drivers, the type of driver we're all looking for.''

EDITORIAL: CAMPAIGN REFORM'S NEXT HURDLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 31:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate returns to Washington this week, more consumed than
ever by the anguished debate over President Clinton. But lawmakers
are living in a dream world if they consider themselves immune to
Americans' general displeasure over ethics in public life. A recent
New York Times poll showed that while most Americans have a low
regard for Clinton's ``moral values,'' fully 65 percent thought his
integrity was the same as or better than that of most politicians.
</P>
<P>
   There is one very big thing that Congress can do to restore
voter confidence, and that is to finish the job of overhauling the
campaign fund raising system, eliminating ``soft money'' and other
abuses that undermine the integrity of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a more favorable moment for reform. The
public wants it. The House passed the Shays-Meehan bill earlier
this month. A clear majority favors the bill in the Senate, where
it would pass if Trent Lott, the majority leader, permitted a vote.
Instead, he and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky seem ready to use a
filibuster, as they did earlier in the year, to frustrate popular
will.
</P>
<P>
   The need for change was obvious even before the end of the last
election, when the first disclosures of abuses in Clinton's
re-election campaign began to spill out. It turned out that
millions of dollars in foreign money had reached both Republican
and Democratic campaigns, in apparent violation of the law. But
foreign money was largely a function of the ability of both parties
to manipulate a legal loophole to raise outlandish sums from other
sources as well.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans remain outraged over the way Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore used the White House for ``coffees,'' sleep-overs
and telephone calls to raise money _ activities that clearly merit
examination by an independent counsel. Yet even now the Republicans
themselves hold meetings and receptions in return for big
donations, often from businesses with an interest in weakening
regulations or tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 election cycle, the two political parties raised
$260 million in unregulated ``soft money'' from corporations,
unions and rich individuals _ money that the law requires to be
used only for so-called party-building activities, but which both
parties channeled directly into ad campaigns for Clinton and his
opponent, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Watergate reforms of 1974, particularly the strict
ceilings on contributions by individuals and political-action
committees, were important steps in the long, uneven struggle to
purge the political system of special-interest money.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1988, the system broke down as George Bush and Michael
Dukakis discovered the soft-money loophole, and changed the history
of fund raising by accepting the unlimited sums allowed for
political parties and diverting them to their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, they destroyed the central compact embodied in
the post-Watergate laws, under which presidential candidates would
accept public money while agreeing to spending limits. This was
merely a warm-up for Clinton and Dole, who each took $75 million in
public money but also raised and spent huge sums outside the
federal limits.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the latest round of public revulsion will be followed by
reform depends on Congress. If reform dies, soft money could double
to $500 million or more in the next presidential election, spawning
even more corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to remember that the legislation banning soft
money is not revolutionary. It is the spiritual successor to the
reforms of 1907 and 1947, which banned corporate and union
contributions, as well as the Watergate reforms of 1974, and as
such reflects the historic American yearning for a cleaner
politics.
</P>
<P>
   All that is needed is eight Republican votes to shut off the
filibuster that Lott and McConnell are sure to engineer this month.
The responsibility for finding those votes falls on Sens. John
McCain of Arizona and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, who championed
the cause earlier this year and now must pick it up again.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too much to ask that this Congress, on the eve of the next
century, return to the spirit that has fired reformers since the
beginning of this century?

   President Clinton's ability to maintain strong approval ratings
for the job he is doing, if not for himself as a person, has
mystified some commentators. It certainly stands in sharp contrast
to the tumbling poll numbers shown by Richard Nixon during the
Watergate investigation that ultimately led to his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for this phenomenon is that Americans think sex
is a private matter, and are as much offended by the fact that
Clinton was forced to testify about sex as by the possibility that
he committed perjury. Perhaps it is not offensive to cover up
conduct that never should have been made public to begin with. By
contrast, Nixon's conduct was a violation of the Constitution, and
his efforts to cover it up stirred a public that eventually turned
on him.
</P>
<P>
   All that makes sense. But it may not be the whole explanation.
Other things were happening in 1973 and 1974 when Nixon's approval
ratings were plunging. Most notably, the economy and the stock
market were putting in their worst performance in a generation, in
large part due to an international crisis that might have been
better handled.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to separate out the effects of Watergate and
economic maladies on Nixon's falling ratings because they were
occurring simultaneously. In October 1973, Arab armies attacked
Israel, which asked for and got massive U.S. aid to prevent defeat.
On Oct. 20, a day after Nixon made public the extent of the aid,
Arab oil producers declared an oil boycott. On the very same day,
he fired the Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, in the
Saturday Night Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab oil boycott led to a sudden increase in the price of
oil and sent much of the Western world into recession. The stock
market, already weak before the Middle East War broke out, entered
into the worst bear market since the Depression, a decline that did
not end until two months after Nixon resigned in August. By then,
the Dow Jones industrial average was down 45 percent from its peak.
</P>
<P>
   History is never run twice, so it is impossible to know what
would have happened had the Nixon administration pursued a
different course before and during the Middle East War. There were
people in the Nixon administration who were aware of the growing
U.S. dependence on Arab oil. But those concerns were not paramount
either before the war broke out or during it, when U.S. aid to
Israel inflamed Arab opinion. Would things have been different if
the president not been preoccupied by scandal? Probably not, but
there is no way to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   To return to 1998, the U.S. economy and the president's poll
ratings have been doing very well. But economists have been
surprised by the depth and the duration of the Asian problems, and
financial markets are worried that they will spread to Europe and
the United States. The collapse in Russia has unnerved investors,
as soaring oil prices did a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what the Clinton administration could have done
to prevent the Russian collapse, or what it should do now. But the
threat to the U.S. economy is now greater than at any time in the
Clinton presidency, and at a time when there is reason to doubt the
president's attention is strictly on his job.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, just perhaps, Clinton's ability to survive this scandal
will depend more on how well his administration deals with the
Russian economic crisis than on whether he is proved to have lied
about sex. &QL;

URBAN TEENS HELP KEEP `BLADE' TOPS AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``a'' national news file.) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Blade'' continued its sharp performance at the
nation's box office with an estimated $11.1 million at 2,351
theaters during the Friday-Sunday period for its second straight
weekend victory, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade,'' based on a Marvel comic hero who is a human-vampire
hybrid, benefited from strong recommendation levels among
moviegoers as its weekend-to-weekend decline was only 35 percent _
a far better return than most recent similar entries. ``Blade's''
10-day cut is an impressive $34.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Blade' is performing well among urban teens and young male
adults,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of Reel Source.
``Blade,'' which carries an estimated $45 million price tag, could
reach $60 million by the end of its domestic run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade'' outgrossed the combined take from the weekend's two
lukewarm openings _ Miramax's ``54,'' a look back at Studio 54's
rise and fall, with $6.4 million at 1,859 sites, and Warner Bros.'
``Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' focusing on singer Frankie Lyman,
with $4 million at 1,369 screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``54'' and ``Fools'' finished fourth and fifth, well behind 20th
Century Fox's seventh weekend of ``There's Something About Mary''
with $8.4 million at 2,401 theaters and DreamWorks' sixth weekend
of ``Saving Private Ryan'' with $8.3 million at 2,774 locations.
Fox added 209 screens, leading to a 9 percent gain from the sixth
weekend in what Bucksbaum described as a savvy tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox was pretty smart to add theaters to take advantage of the
fact that the new movies wouldn't be that strong,'' he said.
``Mary'' now has $116.2 million after 47 days and could hit $150
million, given the lack of strong new entries in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which saw its screen count grow by 103,
has totaled $155.5 million after 38 days, placing it 52nd on the
list of all-time domestic grossers after ``The Sting.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's fifth weekend of ``Ever After'' may edge ``Why Do Fools
Fall in Love'' for sixth place with $3.9 million at 1,912 theaters
to give Drew Barrymore's ``Cinderella'' revamp nearly $49 million
after 31 days. Finishing a close seventh was Paramount's fourth
weekend of ``Snake Eyes'' with $3.7 million at 2,243 sites,
followed by Fox's third weekend of ``How Stella Got Her Groove
Back'' with $3.6 million at 1,383 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Disney's fifth weekend of ``The
Parent Trap'' with $3 million at 2,041 theaters, followed by Sony's
second weekend of ``Dance With Me'' with $2.95 million at 1,467
locales. Paramount's second weekend of collegiate comedy ``Dead Man
on Campus'' may have also cracked the top 10 with $2.9 million at
1,830 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing 12th was Disney's ninth weekend of ``Armageddon'' with
$2.4 million at 1,324 theaters. The disaster-fest has reached
$188.6 million and ranks 27th on the all-time domestic list behind
``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Two offbeat films posted impressive results in their second
weekend of limited release _ Gramercy's ``Your Friends and
Neighbors'' with $374,000 at 69 screens and Miramax's ``Next Stop:
Wonderland'' with $360,000 at 45 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business is nearing $4.5 billion and is 13 percent
ahead of the same period last year. Summer business, from Memorial
Day weekend to Labor Day, is on track to hit $2.5 billion, or 12
percent up from last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's ``Titanic,'' source of much of 1998's improvement,
drew $385,000 at 502 theaters in its 37th weekend to push its
overall domestic total to $600.4 million after crossing the $600
million mark Thursday night. The epic, which comes out on home
video Tuesday, leads ``Star Wars'' as top all-time domestic grosser
by nearly $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade,'' ``There's Something About Mary'' and ``Saving Private
Ryan'' face competition over Labor Day weekend from Sony's opening
of ``Knock Off,'' starring Jean-Claude Van Damme battling
terrorists in Hong Kong.

SEMINOLES' EARLY TEST DOESN'T FAZE BOWDEN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It is August and a football weekend in
New Jersey, so the Florida State Seminoles are talking about a
national championship. They can't help it. Their coach, Bobby
Bowden, says he is tired of finishing Nos. 2, 3 and 4 and, shoot,
finishing on top in January is all that matters anyway. Besides,
the one and only title he owns began right here with a 42-0 rout of
Kansas in the 1993 Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a loss hurts us one bit for a national title,''
said Bowden, reasoning that his team's 1993 championship withstood
a November loss to Notre Dame. ``If we aren't good enough, we need
to know now. There's no use bluffing our way through five games.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who will stand across the field from him on Monday night
at Giants Stadium for the 16th rendition of the Kickoff Classic
matches Bowden's Southern drawl syllable for syllable. But Texas
A&AMP;M Coach R.C. Slocum has his sights set more modestly. He simply
wants to get back to the Big 12 Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it daunting to start a season against the team that is
ranked No. 2 by both coaches and the news media in the preseason
polls?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win the game, then it's a big deal for Texas A&AMP;M,'' said
Slocum, whose team is ranked 15th by the coaches and 14th by the
news media. ``If we lose, then folks will say, `Well, FSU beat
another team.' There's no downside.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the coaches nor their teams want to lose such
opportunities. But a proposal to eliminate such preseason matchups
is awaiting a vote by the National Collegiate Athletic Association
in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where good teams play meaningful games,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   The clash between the two Southern powers here before an
expected crowd of 60,000 takes on added meaning now that the Bowl
Championship Series is in place and promises to match the teams
ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in a title game, this year in the Fiesta
Bowl. While Seminole players talk about avoiding pitfalls, Slocum's
Aggies are focusing on opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of talent and depth, but we're young and
untested,'' said safety Dexter Jackson, one of only 10 seniors on
the team. ``We have some question marks. One mistake, and we're out
of what we spend every day thinking about: winning it all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The biggest question is perhaps Chris Weinke, the 26-year-old
sophomore quarterback, who will start his first football game since
1989 after spending six years in baseball's minor leagues with the
Toronto Blue Jays organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real mature, very vocal kind of leader,'' said wide
receiver Peter Warrick, an all-America candidate who leads one of
the most talented receiving corps in the nation. ``He gets on us
and tells what we need to do. He'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   He will get a stern test. Even after sending Andre Wadsworth,
Sam Cowart and five others to the National Football League, the
Seminole defense will probably defend its title as the nation's
stingiest defense against the run. Tackle Jerry Johnson and
linebacker Lamont Green, certain to be high picks in next year's
NFL draft, lead a unit that Bowden says is the quickest he has ever
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a young, nasty and intense unit,'' Green said. ``Those
young guys at Texas A&AMP;M better come out ready to play us, or it's
going to be a long night for their offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies will start the freshman center Seth McKinney on a
line that returns only two starters. Dante Hall, D'Andre Hardeman
and Sirr Parker combined for more than 2,200 yards last year while
giving defenses three different looks to prepare for.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-8-inch Hall (a junior) is a duck-and-dive-style of
runner, Hardeman (a senior) is a bruiser and Parker (a senior) is a
breakaway threat who, Slocum said, ``can take it to the house''
every time he touches it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rotate so much that we wear defenses down,'' Parker said.
``And our line is just as good as it was last year. Nobody should
count us out of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the traditional strength of A&AMP;M has been defense, and the
Aggies once more have a swarming unit led by the undersized
linebacker Dat Nguyen. At 6-1 and 213 pounds, the senior is a
Butkus award candidate who has averaged 10.6 tackles a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just flat-out fun to watch,'' Bowden said. ``He's got
tremendous heart.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens on Monday, Bowden is not taking back the
talk about the national championship. ``Please remember after we
lose our first or second game that I said, `We have excellent
potential,''' he said. ``Now we'll see how good we are.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: TRAINING ABUSIVE MILITARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 31:
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Congress has tried to insure that U.S. military aid
and training does not go to foreign soldiers who use it to kill and
torture their own people. But a 1991 law allowed training by
special forces units free of many Congressional restrictions. As a
result, such trainers have been in more than 100 countries and have
worked with some of the world's most abusive and brutal militaries.
In some cases, their training works at cross purposes with U.S.
foreign policy. An amendment to the defense appropriations bill
that will face House and Senate conferees as Congress comes back
would close this training loophole. But the Pentagon needs to stop
pursuing close relations with militaries that repress their own
people.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is sponsored by Sen.Patrick Leahy, would block
U.S. special forces from training foreign units if the State
Department had credible information that a member of the unit had
committed a gross violation of human rights. An exception could be
made if steps were taken to prevent further abuses. The Pentagon,
stung by scandals over training of repressive troops, does not
oppose the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 law did not put limits on special forces training
ostensibly because it was for the benefit of U.S. soldiers. In a
nifty bit of circular reasoning, the Pentagon says special forces
learn how to carry out one of their most important jobs _ training.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Congress banned Indonesian military officers from
receiving training. Yet a notorious unit linked to massacres of
civilians and countless other abuses was a prime recipient of
special forces training until this year. Skills taught to the unit,
known as Kopassus, included psychological operations and lethal
tactics like sniping.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported in July that special forces are
working with every Latin American military, including those with
records of human rights violations, and with no requirement to
screen out abusive trainees. U.S. special forces train Colombian
army officials in counterterrorism and intelligence gathering _
even though Congress voted to limit regular training to
counternarcotics. In Turkey, where units fighting Kurdish
guerrillas have a history of killing civilians, Americans have
trained anti-guerrilla forces.
</P>
<P>
   Such training is often at odds with U.S. policy goals. While
U.S. foreign policy tries to strengthen democracy, the special
forces training, coupled with a decline in civilian foreign aid,
means foreign contacts are now more often military-to-military.
Though trainers might theoretically serve as role models
demonstrating respect for civilian control and human rights, the
main message they convey is that those being trained have the extra
powers that come from being special friends of the United States. A
Defense Department spokesman said that the most valuable aspect of
training is to ``know the faces and personalities who grow up to be
generals and presidents.'' This has long been the Pentagon's
justification for befriending even the most abusive officers. It
was understandable, although still wrong, during the Cold War.
There is no justification for it now.

<P>
   - The Austrian newspaper Kro-Nenzeitung, which has a circulation
of 2.8 million, has canceled
 &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR; 's syndicated column because she hasn't commented
on the scandal that has plagued her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the world is continuously confronted with new details
about the president's sex scandal,'' said a note from the
newspaper's editors to its readers, `` &UR; Bill Clinton &LR; 's wife writes
about hurricanes. ... This is the reason we have decided to
discontinue `What Hillary Thinks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Paula Jones &LR; , forceful political advocate, is scheduled to
appear as guest of honor at a fund-raising banquet in October for
 &UR; Steve Arnold &LR; , who's running for re-election as a commissioner in
Guilford County, N.C. ``Paula Jones is an all-American middle-class
wife and mother,'' Arnold told the Greensboro (N.C.) News and
Record, ``whose only crime was to be seen and approached by Bill
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   - Washingtonian magazine reports that  &UR; William Ginsburg &LR; , who
became famous as  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR; 's lawyer, has agreed to take
part in a Funniest Celebrity contest this November. The event
raises money for the Child Welfare League.
</P>
<P>
   - And the Washington Post notes that brothers &UR; Bob Bennett &LR; , who
represents Bill Clinton, and  &UR; Bill Bennett &LR; , whose new book, ``The
Death of Outrage,'' is a best-seller, are making money off both
ends of the current scandal.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR;  &LR;  - In 1978, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
rejected a proposed Kenwood Winery label designed by
 &UR; David Lance Goines  &LR; because it depicted a nude woman reclining in a
vineyard. ``Obscene and indecent'' was the official ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for a 20th anniversary bottle of the Artist Series
Cabernet Sauvignon, Kenwood resubmitted the original design,
approved this time with no fuss at all.
</P>
<P>
   - A journalist who interviewed  &UR; Willie Nelson &LR;  before a
performance in a Long Island, N.Y., music venue last week told the
New York Post he was so stoned afterward, from breathing in
second-hand smoke from ``at least six joints'' smoked by Nelson,
that he couldn't find his car. ``When I left the bus my head was
spinning. ... I was forced to get a hotel room in a Holiday Inn
across the street.'' A spokesman for the singer told the Post the
incident was ``possible.''
</P>
<P>

her tattoos removed.
</P>
<P>
   - In an interview made for a BBC documentary series about the
Cold War,  &UR; Fidel Castro  &LR; reveals that during the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis, Russian nuclear missiles were armed and ready to use
against Americans. When  &UR; Nikita Khrushchev  &LR; and  &UR; John &LR;   &UR; F. &LR; 
 &UR; Kennedy &LR;  made a deal to end the crisis, the Russian leader didn't

   - Creepy crawlies: In England on a book tour, horror author
 &UR; Stephen King  &LR; told the Guardian he is ``terrified of spiders.
Snakes don't bother me. But I hate bugs.'' And at a Safeway in
Marin County,  &UR; Laura Merlo &LR;  couldn't figure out why Venus fly traps
and carnivorous plants are marked down with a sign that says,
``Great for Back to School.''
</P>
<P>
   - If you're in the need for an expert in ``the physiology of sex
steroids in the female African spotted hyena,'' look no further.
That's one of the fields of expertise of  &UR; Paul Licht &LR; , UC
Berkeley's new dean of biological sciences, says the Daily Cal.
</P>
<P>
   - At a recent meeting of the European Parliament, members of the
Green Party proposed that the World Meteorological Institute name
storms and hurricanes after members of the Global Climate
Coalition, companies (Exxon, General Motors and Ford among them)
who deny that carbon emissions are contributing to climactic
changes. The new names, said the Green Party, would change
newspaper headlines to read, for instance: ``Exxon Kills 20 in
Miami.'' The measure was rejected by the parliament.

<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Then I was in the corner of the room. I was dying. I saw my &LR;

 &UR; didn't feel like a man or a woman. And then I just came back &LR; 
 &UR; into that envelope, that body, with that soul, and I said, `I'm &LR; 
 &UR; not ready. I know what's death after life.' (pause) How many &LR;

VICTORY ELUDES THE PHOENIX MERCURY IN CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By MELANIE HAUSER    
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was seven minutes away from winning the Women's
National Basketball Association title Saturday night. The Phoenix
Mercury had spent the first 33 minutes playing the way its coach
talks _ big and brash _ and was up by 12 points on the defending
champions' court.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as though Phoenix coach Cheryl Miller had been right a
month ago when she predicted that her team would upstage the
Houston Comets in the championship series and ``win that bad boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of cruising, the Mercury collapsed under the Comets'
pressure. Not just a press, but an all-out,
turn-it-up-down-the-stretch performance from Cynthia Cooper on
down. And, even though Phoenix did force overtime, it wound up
passing on what might have been the opportunity of the season as
Houston evened the two-of-three-game championship series with a
74-69 victory and forced a final showdown Tuesday here at the
Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the game, it was like, we were almost there,''
said guard Michelle Timms, who helped stake Phoenix to the lead,
which the Mercury held until late in the second half. ``You've
never got a game won against a team like that. We executed, but we
didn't come up with the offensive boards and we fell right into
their hands and what they love to play, the transition game. They
just jumped us. We just have to stay positive and play with a
passion down the stretch. After all, we were the ones who were 12
up.''
</P>
<P>
   A cut on Timms' left cheek and scratch marks across her neck
showed the intensity of Game 2. Phoenix's Jennifer Gillom also
appeared to have taken a beating. Gillom, who beat Houston on a
last-second jumper in Game 1, was 3 for 15 from the floor Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between being double- and triple-teamed
and when you're actually being beat up,'' Gillom said. ``I've
experienced double- and triple-teams my whole life, but the way
they played me last night told me they were going to make sure I
didn't win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillom was so upset after the game Saturday that she did not
talk to reporters, nor did she go back to the hotel with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she went out to dinner with her family and let them
pick her up. But, she cautioned, she did not want to get too
relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a little angry and still frustrated,'' she said on
Sunday. ``I need that going into Tuesday's game. I don't want to
forget about it. I feel like I let my team down and that's not a
good feeling. I've got to prove that pressure can't frustrate me.
I'm not going to try to score 30 points, but I am going to play the
best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   While Houston practiced Sunday, Miller gave her team a day away
from the court. The Mercury was in this same situation in the
semifinals a week ago and beat Cleveland in Cleveland. So, Miller
said, don't try to say the pressure is on her team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure's on both teams,'' Miller said. ``We're used to
it. This team is used to playing under pressure. We know what it
takes and that's 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused and stared straight at a television camera from a
Houston station before she said, ``And I like our chances.''

PIT CREW HELPS GORDON RALLY TO ANOTHER VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Once again, the efficient work of the pit crew
and a gutsy call by the crew chief Ray Evernham sent Jeff Gordon
off pit road with the lead late in the race. And once again, Gordon
held on to take the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon came back after falling to 17th place Sunday, winning his
second straight CMT 300 at New Hampshire International Speedway.
The victory was his ninth this season and gave him a slim 67-point
lead in the championship standing over Mark Martin, who finished
second to Gordon for the fourth time in the last six races. John
Andretti finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon came into the pits in fifth place on Lap 232 of 300, and
he emerged leading, a result of quick work by his pit crew and a
crucial decision by Evernham, who put on just two right-side tires.
Martin, driving a Taurus, and Andretti, driving a Pontiac, both
burned time by taking on four new tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rainbow warriors and Ray have won a lot of races for us
this year,'' said Gordon, referring to the crew that wears rainbow
colors and works on his rainbow-colored Monte Carlo. ``And they did
it again today. I'm fortunate to have a guy like Ray making those
calls. I just had to be smooth with it, and not waste my tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham said: ``I knew we had a good car. Going with two tires
just seemed like the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham had made the same decision late in the Pennsylvania 500
last month, putting Gordon back in the lead ahead of Martin and on
his way to a victory.
</P>
<P>
   A week after cutting into Gordon's championship lead, Martin,
who led the most laps Sunday with 193, watched helplessly from his
pit stall as Gordon pulled out ahead of him. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the race, the 24 car was just faster than us,''
said Martin, who brushed the wall at least once in the closing
laps, trying to catch up with Gordon. ``He just outran us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who had won four races in a row before finishing fifth
last week at Bristol, did something Sunday that had never been
accomplished: winning from the pole at New Hampshire. Gordon won
last year's race from 13th on the starting grid.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon led the opening two laps Sunday, but fell out of the
draft on the next lap and dropped to eighth. It was not long before
he was challenging the leaders, however, running in third and
closing in on Martin and Dale Jarrett, who finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon moved up to second after another efficient effort by his
pit crew on Lap 76, but had trouble finding his gears on the
restart. Again, he fell out of the lead draft, and this time slid
back to 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several times we were out of it,'' Gordon said.
``But we never gave up. That attitude won the race for us today. I
was pretty worried there for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett continues to keep himself in the chase for the
championship, having scored four straight top-five finishes. ``We
had a good race car,'' said Jarrett, driver of a Taurus, who fell
238 points behind Gordon. ``We got a top five, but again we lost
points. If you plan on gaining points in this thing, you have got
to win races. I guess we can't consider it a success.''

WOMAN SAYS SHE NEVER HURT HORSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MELISSA SCHMITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A woman charged with cruelty to horses says she
has never mistreated animals of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Renae Ferguson, 28, of suburban Tarzana declined comment on
allegations that she solicited donations to help a needy-children's
camp, then sold the donated horses.
</P>
<P>
   But she did refute claims she mistreated the horses, saying she
had spent her life caring for and loving them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were well cared for,'' Ferguson said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson and her parents, Ed Reddeck, 56, and Darlene Craig, 48,
were arrested on suspicion of cruelty to animals last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson has been charged with 13 misdemeanor counts of cruelty
to animals in Los Angeles County and also awaits trial in Ventura
County on two felony counts of cruelty to animals in a separate but
similar case.
</P>
<P>
   Reddeck said Thursday that the charges were part of a conspiracy
by government officials against his family.
</P>
<P>
   Police and animal regulation officials said the allegations stem
from horse donations solicited by Ferguson for what she said was a
riding camp for underprivileged children.
</P>
<P>
   Police said she neglected the horses while they were in her care
and then sold them.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said the cruelty charges are false.
</P>
<P>
   She said she fed the horses regularly, and when a veterinarian
she hired checked the horses out after animal regulation officials
impounded them, the doctor gave the animals a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, Reddeck and Craig are free on $8,500 bond each.

SHYLOCK AS AN UGLY CARICATURE WITH A HOPEFUL MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.) (ll) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ The first sound heard in the outdoor production
of ``The Merchant of Venice,'' presented by Shakespeare &AMP; Co. here
this month was an Islamic call to prayer; the last was the Jewish
Yom Kippur chant, Kol Nidre.
</P>
<P>
   In between were plenty of other invocations of ethnic and
religious identity. A scimitar-wielding Moroccan and a buffoonish
Spaniard strutted the stage. Mentions were made of the foppish
French, the arrogant English and the drunken Germans.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was the Jewish usurer Shylock, out for his
pound of flesh, seeming to care more about his ducats than his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The framing incantations were the devices of the director, Tina
Packer, but the rest is all Shakespeare. This conglomeration of
what would now be called ethnic humor makes it thoroughly plausible
to see the play as Ms. Packer did: a work less concerned with a
carnivorous Jewish villain and his Christian victim than with the
relationships between minority cultures and their dominant hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Venice, after all, was one of the great trading cities of the
Renaissance, where citizens of many nations encountered one
another, submitting to a common law despite difference in dress,
manners, character and prose. It was also a society, as Shakespeare
showed quite deliberately, fraught with caricature and distrust. It
was, in other words, a culture very much like our own.
</P>
<P>
   In our contemporary version of Venice, questions about minority
cultures, their special rights and injuries have become a major
preoccupation, sometimes at the expense of common culture and
language. The Other, as the member of a minority culture is often
called, is now our conscience in debates about affirmative action
and school curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons about the mistreatment of the Other are common even in
the arts. The title of one film that opened earlier this month,
``Gadjo Dilo,'' directed by Tony Gatlif, means, rather loosely,
``crazy outsider'' in the Romany language of the movie's Gypsies. A
young Parisian is gradually welcomed into Gypsy society, but not
before he is greeted by suspicions more familiarly aimed in the
opposite direction. ``He's a thief!'' calls out one Gypsy. ``The
foreigner will take our women and children!'' shouts another.
</P>
<P>
   Shylock is treated that way as well; he is spit upon and called
a dog by the very man who comes to borrow his money. Fears about
the continuing legacy of such treatment even figured into debates
about this production of ``Merchant of Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   For two months before it opened, The Berkshire Eagle was
publishing letters rehearsing the familiar historical debates about
this play that has done so much to codify anti-Semitic caricature.
One correspondent suggested that the ``shrill voices'' strenuously
objecting to the play were so preoccupied with the Holocaust that
they could ``only give credence to the Shylock stereotype.'' That
unwitting application of the stereotype inspired another round of
argument.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this contemporary battleground of Others, there
are real wounds suffered and real debts incurred; there are
sensitivities to attend to and histories to interpret. The
accounting of all this Otherness has taken on an obsessive life of
its own. Can our latter-day Venice thrive with such a continuous
accounting? After all, the problem faced by Shakespeare's
multicultural city is not how to give each Other his due, but how
to maintain a rule of common law in a society ruled by uncommon
difference.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Shylock's bond was taken seriously by the Venetian
court. His claim for flesh could not be simply dismissed because
the ``course of law,'' a ``commodity'' as it is called in the play,
was what allowed ``the trade and profit of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem the play poses for modern interpretation is that we
can hardly consider this law purely virtuous. We might cheer the
court's decision not to award Shylock his flesh, but otherwise the
judgment that Shylock should lose his worldly goods and be forced
to convert to Christianity seems to undercut the hope of a society
of Others bound by law. This is why Ms. Packer went to such trouble
to insert the final Jewish prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dramatic bluntness here, Kol Nidre declares null and
void all rash oaths and bonds made to God during the year,
including, perhaps, Shylock's forced conversion. The prayer's
inclusion signaled the production's recognition of an injustice
latent in Venetian justice.
</P>
<P>
   But often that is as far as we take it. To a contemporary
audience, this injustice might even seem proof that the attempt to
create a transcendent set of laws and values is doomed. The play,
though, is far more subtle. One of its recurrent questions is not
just how law can work in Venice but how trade can.
</P>
<P>
   In a commercial society, standards of measurement and judgment
need to be consistent. Are the goods what they seem? Do containers
reveal or hide their contents? Such standards are not just
important for commerce. In a diverse society, how do we learn to
judge our fellow citizens? How can character be discerned from
appearance?
</P>
<P>
   This is why the subplot of Portia's marriage is so prominent. A
suitor must choose either a gold, silver or lead casket; hidden
within one is Portia's portrait and the promise of her hand in
marriage. Each suitor must judge substance from surface, discern
meaning from appearance. ``Mislike me not for my complexion,''
pleads the black Prince of Morocco before he makes a choice of
caskets, referring to yet another stereotype linking appearance to
character. Caricature, prejudgment by appearance, is not to be
trusted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the play is full of such mistakes (and even Shakespeare got
it wrong when it came to the Jews). Lorenzo thinks Jessica ``true''
at the moment of her greatest lie; Antonio thinks Shylock most kind
when he is most vengeful. ``The world is still deceiv'd with
ornament,'' declares Portia's suitor, Bassanio. In law, he
continues, a corrupt and evil plea might be camouflaged by using a
gracious voice; in religion, ``damned error'' can be hidden by
``fair ornament.'' One almost begins to wonder about the gracious
voice and fair ornament of Portia's famous speech about mercy that
``droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven,'' spoken just before she
lowers the boom on the Jew.
</P>
<P>
   So there are more ambiguities in this play than there seem at
first. But despite its flaws, despite its having tapped into some
of the deepest strands of racial hatred in Western culture, the
play is relentless in its preoccupations with the possibility of a
common law and shared standards. The play accounts for the
difficulties and sometimes embodies them, but the effort is
unrelenting. In our cultural climate, that makes it more than worth
its burden of caricature.

USC BEATS PURDUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was officially deemed the start of the Paul
Hackett era, but his USC debut was overshadowed Sunday by what
probably was the birth of the Carson Palmer era.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett accomplished what no USC coach had in 47 years _ he won
his opening game. But it was the unexpected boost from Palmer that
lifted the Trojans' morale and woke up USC's struggling offense.
</P>
<P>
   The true freshman quarterback entered the game in the third
quarter and supplied the passing and momentum to surge the Trojans
past Purdue 27-17 in the Pigskin Classic before 56,623 at the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic comeback performance for Hackett's opener, and
the energetic coach seemed relieved and excited after earning his
first victory at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``One down,'' Hackett told his players at the center of the
field immediately after the game. Then he raced across the field
and up the Coliseum tunnel waving a ``V'' sign with his fingers to
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win coming from behind, and the team believes in
itself, it feels great,'' Hackett said. ``We've taken a step. One
step.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some pretty good football coaches that haven't
won their first game since Howard Jones in 1951.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Jones coached from 1925-40, but it was 1951 when Jess
Hill won his opener, something the next six USC coaches were unable
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up the tunnel, the players told me, `We'll find a way
to get you a win,''' Hackett said. ``It's just very hard the first
time out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult and sloppy victory, but around USC, no one
complains about style points anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when someone as precocious as Palmer lifts the team's
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer entered the game with 5:03 left in the third quarter and
the Trojans trailing 17-10. His fourth snap from scrimmage, he
lofted a perfect 41-yard pass to wide receiver Larry Parker that
set up the game-tying touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   USC scored a field goal on his next series to take a 20-10 lead.
Not bad for a guy who didn't know he was playing until five minutes
before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, yeah, I was pretty surprised. I didn't know I was
going to play,'' Palmer said. ``It was just a great feeling. I
expected to be really nervous, but I wasn't. I wasn't half as
nervous as I was in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hackett described himself in training camp by saying,
``I'm not a rotate-the-quarterbacks kind of guy,'' he decided
before the game to play Palmer in the third quarter instead of
starter Mike Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a plan ahead of time, the third series of the third
quarter, Carson would get two series,'' Hackett said. ``All along
we've had a plan with Carson. Carson will see playing time, but
Mike is the starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed 3 of 6 passes for 79 yards while Van Raaphorst
completed 11 of 22 for 89 yards and an interception. Hackett
sounded like there was no controversy, but he rarely tips his hand
on such matters, so there should be plenty of speculation in the
next two weeks about who is USC's No.1 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coach's decision,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``You've got to
talk to him to see what he wants to do. You like to stay in there,
if you can. I'm going to go out and battle. There's no adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst was sorer after the game from a couple of hits he
took from Purdue defensive end Rosevelt Colvin, but it's clear the
Trojans' quarterback position is more in doubt today than at any
point during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Even Palmer's teammates noticed a difference as soon as he
entered the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like the crowd gave him a standing ovation or
something. I personally got fired up,'' wide receiver Billy Miller
said. ``One day, this guy might be up for the Heisman.''
</P>
<P>
   If Palmer ignited the offense, the Trojans' defense also
regrouped in the second half. After allowing 17 points in the first
half, the defense shut out Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Chris Claiborne and defensive back Antuan Simmons
intercepted quarterback Drew Brees, and linebacker David Gibson
recovered a fumble as the Trojans solved Purdue's single-back
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the first quarter, when Purdue had the
ball for nearly 13 minutes and led USC in first downs 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first quarter, that was unexpected. You've got to expect
the worst, and that was the worst,'' defensive end Sultan
Abdul-Malik said. ``We weren't being aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   USC was also foolish, with several offsides penalties and even
the dreaded 12-men-on-field infraction. Only Chad Morton's 98-yard
kickoff return saved the game from getting away from the Trojans,
and Purdue led just 17-10 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But the USC defense was nearly flawless in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our defense said, `Let's set our jaw and play our base
defense and just play,''' Hackett said. ``We needed something to
turn the tide. (The turnovers) just charged up our sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hackett wanted to put his stamp on the Trojans, maybe just
winning a game with a second-half comeback is something unique. USC
teams have routinely been worn down or squandered leads in the
second half the past two seasons, and the players noticed the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we rallied in the second half, it sticks out in my
mind a lot,'' Miller said. ``It was a situation where something was
going wrong in the fourth quarter, and we'd lose in the end. I
doubt this will happen this year.''

8-30 -- Toms River players basking in the adulation of their town's
residents on Sunday, one day after winning their first Little
League World Series. Many in the boisterous throng brought signs
and banners, including one hanging from the side of a camper van
that read: ``Marry me Chris Cardone. Love, Alexa.'' Chris, who hit
the game-winning home run, does not necessarily need to stock up on
wedding clothes yet -- Alexa Manforti is only 7. (Chang W. Lee/New

precisely who he is and what he represents have long been a mystery
to many. ``I'm just not sure I want white folks to know that much
about me,'' says Muhammad. ``I'd rather in some cases be an enigma.

8-30 -- Toms River players basking in the adulation of their town's
residents on Sunday, one day after winning their first Little
League World Series. Many in the boisterous throng brought signs
and banners, including one hanging from the side of a camper van
that read: ``Marry me Chris Cardone. Love, Alexa.'' Chris, who hit
the game-winning home run, does not necessarily need to stock up on
wedding clothes yet -- Alexa Manforti is only 7. (Chang W. Lee/New

DODGERS DEFEAT METS, 4-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After rallying for two come-from-behind victories
at Dodger Stadium the past two days, the New York Mets had a chance
to jump on one of their former teammates, Dave Mlicki, early on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But even though they rocked Mlicki for eight hits, including two
home runs, in the first five innings, the Mets had only a two-run
lead to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Dodgers rallied for two runs off Masato Yoshii in
the fifth and again in the seventh, en route to a 4-2 victory.
Mlicki (8-6) had nine strikeouts and no walks, and he retired the
last 13 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   The loss evened the Mets' record on this nine-game Western swing
at 3-3. More important, it dropped the Mets (75-62) back into a tie
in the National League wild-card race because Chicago had defeated
Colorado earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Mets jumped out to an early lead. After Mike
Piazza had removed himself from the game after taking an Eric Young
foul ball off his right shoulder in the top of the first, Carlos
Baerga drilled a 3-1 pitch from Mlicki into the left-field pavilion
with one out in the second for a 1-0 lead. The home run was
Baerga's sixth of the season and first since May 31, snapping a
string of 279 at-bats without one.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Edgardo Alfonzo led off the top of the third with his 13th
homer, his second in two days, a solo shot that landed in the
left-field pavilion and gave the Mets a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets failed to capitalize on many other opportunities.
They left runners on first and second with nobody out in the first,
stranded a runner on second in the second and a runner on third in
the third. And even though they had pounded eight hits off Mlicki,
it was still a 2-0 game heading into the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Then Yoshii ran into trouble for the first time. He had allowed
just two singles over his first four innings. But Bobby Bonilla led
off the fifth with a fly out to the warning track in center. Mark
Grudzielanek followed with his second sharp single to left and then
took third on Tom Prince's ground-rule double to left.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii struck out Mlicki for the second out of the inning, but
Young grounded the first pitch past Rey Ordonez and into left field
for a two-run single to tie the score. Young took second on the
throw, and Yoshii was able to strike out Trenidad Hubbard after a
long at-bat to preserve the tie.
</P>
<P>
   Both starters set the side down in order in the sixth. But,
after the Mets went down in order in the top of the seventh, Yoshii
allowed a leadoff single to Bonilla and a double inside of third to
Grudzielanek, the Dodger shortstop's third hit of the game, and
that was it for Yoshii, who dropped to 5-8. On came Turk Wendell,
who surrendered a one-strike double to Prince, which cleared the
bases and gave the Dodgers a 4-2 lead.

QB CONTROVERSY BREWS AT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After thousands of fans fled the frying pan known
as the Los Angeles Coliseum at halftime Sunday, they didn't miss
only the next 30 minutes of USC football.
</P>
<P>
   They missed the next (ITAL)four years(END ITAL) of USC football.
They missed a glimpse of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, they'll have lots of chances to catch Carson Palmer's
act in more comfortable conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Write this down: By season's end, when the brisk breezes of
winter replace the 99-degree heat of opening day, Palmer will be
the Trojans' starting quarterback and they'll be a better team
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   The towering, tow-headed, 18-year-old freshman from Santa
Margarita High in Laguna Niguel made that kind of impression when
he relieved third-year sophomore starter Mike Van Raaphorst in the
third quarter of the game against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   In two offensive series, he led the Trojans to a tying touchdown
run by Petros Papadakis and a go-ahead field goal by Adam Abrams.
He didn't win the quarterback job then and there; Van Raaphorst
returned to the field for two unproductive possessions.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth quarter, Palmer was back for one more series,
and the result was a Chad Morton touchdown sprint that ensured a
27-17 USC victory in front of about two-thirds of the original
56,623 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad way to break in: three possessions, 17 points, and
eye-catching pass completions of 42 yards to Larry Parker and 28
yards to Billy Miller on a crucial third down.
</P>
<P>
   So let's see what we have here: two quarterbacks, one young yet
experienced and the other younger yet stronger, shuttling on and
off the field, and the backup outplaying the starter. This has all
the makings of a quarterback controversy, an early public-relations
test for new USC coach Paul Hackett, a well-known wizard of the
passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said after Sunday's game, ``This is Mike's team. He's
earned the opportunity.'' He added: ``But we're in the process of
developing a really fine young quarterback (Palmer) and we need to
give him some playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   So I ask you: Where's the controversy?
</P>
<P>
   If the 6-foot-5 Palmer continues to measure up, learns to run
Hackett's varied offense as quickly as expected, it's only a matter
of time before he's starting. Hackett will know when that time
comes.
</P>
<P>
   He knew when Palmer's time came Sunday because he scheduled it.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the kickoff, Hackett told both quarterbacks of
his plan to insert Palmer for the second and third series of the
second half, regardless of the numbers on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   It just happened that the Trojans needed a lift at that moment,
having gone punt-interception-punt since the second-quarter field
goal that cut Purdue's lead to 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right when I was going in, I was thinking, `Don't mess up the
first play,''' Palmer said. Then he messed up the first play by
overthrowing an open Ted Iacenda.
</P>
<P>
   The second play made up for that. A crisp pass nailed Mike
Bastianelli on a slant pattern for 9 yards. After Morton ran for a
first down, Palmer dodged one rusher, threw flat-footed over
another and hit Parker for 42 yards inside the Purdue 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed that he stepped up and put it right on the
money,'' Hackett said of the play of the game. ``The amazing thing
was that he kept it to the outside (of the defender). That was all
arm. Normally a ball like that will die on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were energized. So were their fans _ the ones who'd
been wilting in the heat and the ones who by then were listening on
the radio in air-conditioned cars.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's and Van Raaphorst's teammates said the right things
later, claiming there really wasn't a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the difference is that Mike has more experience,''
Morton said. ``But as you can see from Carson's performance, that
doesn't seem to matter much.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst (11 for 21 for 89 yards and an interception) was
gracious, saying Palmer's heroics were ``good for the team, and
that's that.'' But he wished he'd been allowed to pass more.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer (3 for 6 for 79 yards) admitted making some mistakes and
talked about ``team.'' Sure, he said, his personal goal is to be
the starting quarterback, but there's a bigger objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go to the Rose Bowl,'' Palmer said. ``And I think we
have a team that can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: If the Trojans go to the Rose Bowl, they'll do it
with Carson Palmer at quarterback. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: McGWIRE LET HIS TEAM _ AND HIS FANS _ DOWN  
(EDS: In the quote in graf 13, ``owe'' is correct.) 
(lh) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire, a protagonist in one of the best
pieces of theater in America, pulled the curtain down on himself
Saturday afternoon even though the performance had hardly begun. He
did so in a most bizarre, if not selfish and silly, manner, and
within just a few feet of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Matthew McGwire, wearing his father's name and
number _ 25 _ on the back of his Cardinal uniform, has served as a
batboy for parts of the summer: when he comes to town from San
Diego to visit his dad, one Mark David McGwire, a k a Leading
Contender in the Great Home Run Record Chase. On Saturday
afternoon, young McGwire, along with a near-capacity crowd of
47,627 in Busch Stadium, witnessed a remarkable event.
</P>
<P>
   No, he did not see his dad hit yet another home run _ McGwire
had 55 after connecting in the seventh inning on Sunday night
against the Braves, 1 ahead of Sammy Sosa of the Cubs and 6 behind
Roger Maris, the record-holder since 1961. He witnessed his dad
being thrown out of a game, in the first inning, of all things,
after arguing a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was good for Matthew to see that his father has
emotion,'' McGwire said before Sunday night's game. ``It was in the
heat of competition. I was doing whatever I can. I felt the umpire
took an at-bat away from me. So I let them know.''
</P>
<P>
   While emotion is surely part of the makeup of a champion, you
can hurt your team, disappoint a multitude and even damage to a
degree your chances at a historic record as a result of allowing
emotions to get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Plate umpire Sam Holbrook beseeched Tony La Russa, the
Cardinals' manager, who came onto the field to defend his player:
``Tony, please get Mark out of here. I don't want to throw him out
of the game.'' McGwire admitted later that Holbrook had given him
the same warning directly three times.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was in the heat of competition, but the difference
between a professional and an amateur _ at least, the difference
between a professional's response and an amateur's response _ ought
to be that the professional keeps his head.
</P>
<P>
   Cus D'Amato, the late boxing trainer, said that the killer
instinct is something you seek to eliminate, because the fighter
should never lose his poise in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   And McGwire had to have had a good notion of what he was doing.
If the umpire had told him, for example, ``If you say one more
word, it's the magic word, and a piano will fall on your head,''
the odds are McGwire would have exited voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The slugger has professed that the home-run chase is secondary
for him, that the team's results come first. He did not help his
team, however, by being thrown out _ they lost to the Braves, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   When Tom Glavine, the Braves' left-hander, whistled a 3-2 pitch
at or below McGwire's knees, and on or just inside of the plate,
Holbrook shouted strike three as McGwire was already moving toward
first base in anticipation of a ball-four call. Matthew watched
from near the on-deck circle as his father erupted in a fit of
pique. When his dad was thrown out, the fans grew unruly.
</P>
<P>
   They booed until they were hoarse, and then, if Holbrook still
hadn't gotten the drift, flung onto the field baseballs, bottles
and anything else they could find short of themselves. In the old
American tradition, the first thing the fans in the ball park
desired was to moider the umpire. Imagine throwing out the star
attraction, the very person people came from hundreds of miles
around to pay to see, for the fan base of the St. Louis Cardinals
covers nine states, from Arkansas to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mass, ugly, stupid tantrum, but it was a macrocosm of
the tantrum thrown by McGwire. ``I said things to the umpire you
can't say on TV,'' he said. ``Did I cross the line? Yeah, I
probably crossed the line. I owe up to it. He had a right to throw
me out. I'm not any bigger than the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't heed the warning. The ump then had no choice. ``You
are not supposed to argue balls and strikes,'' McGwire said. ``The
umpire did his job. I'm not any bigger than the game.''
</P>
<P>
   This is noble. But McGwire is well aware that a majority of the
fans came solely to see him in his pursuit of the record. When
Humphrey Bogart asked Spencer Tracy what he believed a performer
owed the fans, Tracy replied, ``A good performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 people asked for their money back when McGwire was
ejected. There might have been thousands more _ people who paid
from $6 for a bleacher seat to $24 for a field box _ if it wasn't
clearly stipulated at the ticket window that all sales are final.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire, whose salary is $8.3 million a season plus
incentives, can't reasonably refund the fans who wanted their money
back, he might donate, say, a buck a fan, or $47,627, to a charity
of his choice, as an expression of his acknowledged special
responsibility as a performer.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McGwire would surely understand that emotion, too.

USC DOESN'T WILT IN HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES - The men in black shoes looked cooked 16 minutes
into their season opener against Purdue, and not just because their
soles might as well have been steaks on the backyard grill in the
118-degree heat on the Coliseum field.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five seconds into the second quarter of the Pigskin
Classic, the USC football team trailed Purdue by 10 points. At that
point, the Trojans had minus-1 yard of total offense to Purdue's
133 yards and zero first downs to Purdue's eight.
</P>
<P>
   To put it kindly, their feet were about all that was sizzling.
The Trojans would adjust their defensive scheme and tinker with
their personnel in the second half but there would be no changing
the footwear that made them feel like they were walking barefoot on
a blazing beach.
</P>
<P>
   Black shoes, after all, are one of the few traditions that
haven't gone the way of Student Body Right.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in decades past, the Trojans no longer can be counted on
to churn out the Pac-10's finest running backs while contending for
national championships. For at least one sweltering day, though,
they gave their faithful reason not to sweat the team's prospects
for 1998 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans scored 20 unanswered points - 17 of them in the
second half - for a 27-17 win over the Boilermakers, an aptly-named
opponent considering it was so hot the 56,623 spectators could have
been forgiven for wondering if that was Traveler V or a camel being
ridden around the field after each of USC's three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Chad Morton brought the Trojans' equine mascot galloping
out of the tunnel the first time, running back Purdue's first
kickoff 98 yards to tie the game at 7. Purdue regained the lead
with a 39-yard scoring drive and padded it with a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   USC trimmed the deficit to a touchdown by halftime on a 60-yard
drive that culminated with the first of senior placekicker Adam
Abrams' two field goals. The stands thinned noticeably during the
intermission as the fans fled from the heat and probably also from
still-fresh memories of so many second-half meltdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 USC football team that finished 6-5, failed to advance
to the postseason for the second consecutive season and cost coach
John Robinson his job wore down noticeably as their games wore on.
They were outscored 96-48 in the second half of their eight Pac-10
contests under Robinson, who was neither a paradigm of fitness nor,
apparently, a stickler when it came to his own players'
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   After assessing his troops during spring practice, new field
general Paul Hackett decided the players needed a summer vacation
less than they did a voluntary boot camp. He left them with
conditioning suggestions and a stern warning that training camp
would be devoted to getting the playbook down pat, not getting in
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 75 players took Hackett's words to heart and stayed in
L.A., gathering daily to do sprints and crunches. Cook and the
others lifted weights and, when required, one another's spirits.
</P>
<P>
   They built stamina and muscles and camaraderie. Then they
reported to UC Irvine for training camp and for three weeks Hackett
and his accomplice, strength and conditioning coach Matt Schiotz,
totally tore them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camp Hackett was so hard, I got physically ill,'' said junior
guard Travis Claridge, the anchor of an inexperienced offensive
line. ``There were some times, I was throwing up even before
practice because I was just exhausted. What we went through there
was literally hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Miller, a senior receiver from Westlake Village, caught a
team-high four passes to help make Hackett's head coaching debut a
success, then admitted there were times in the days leading up to
the opener when he felt hate in his racing heart for Hackett
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times I was sweating, I was dehydrated and I was so
tired I was thinking to myself, `I hope this pays off,''' Miller
said. ``And you know what? It did.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not kidding. All four of Miller's receptions came in the
second half when all of his leg muscles should have been
complaining vehemently.
</P>
<P>
   But then, all the Trojans seemed to turn up their intensity even
as Mother Nature was turning up the heat.
</P>
<P>
   The USC defense recorded both its sacks in the second half when
it should have been bent over at the waist, wheezing. Linebacker
Chris Claiborne and Antuan Simmons each intercepted Purdue
quarterback Drew Brees in the final two quarters when the only
things they should have been trying to catch were their breaths.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Schiotz wound up with a game ball for his
contributions to the win.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's pick in the waning moments of the third quarter set
up a 45-yard field goal from Abrams that put USC ahead for good at
20-17. Quarterback Carson Palmer, showing a poise that belied his
true freshman status, led the Trojans on their final scoring drive,
which was highlighted by a 28-yard pass to Miller and punctuated by
a 13-yard run by Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer earlier had led the offense to its first score. He
spelled incumbent starter Mike Van Raaphorst with five minutes left
in the third and threw a 42-yard strike to Larry Parker to set up
Petros Papadakis' first collegiate touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, preferably sooner than later, Palmer will be
handed the keys to the USC offense. But for now, Hackett said, the
starting job belongs to the sophomore, Van Raaphorst, who can read
defenses and body language well enough to know the game was USC's
long before the final seconds ticked off the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were wearing down a little bit in the second half,'' he
said. ``I think the smog might have had a little something to do
with it. And I think we were in better condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that, a USC team built to last. For a program looking to
regain its past glory, that's a good start.

QB CONTROVERSY BREWS AT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What would life be at USC if there wasn't some
controversy, some football pot boiling over with suggestions and
speculation from the alumni and media?
</P>
<P>
   Game one of the Paul Hackett era wasn't even three quarters old
Sunday before the pundits threw out the first debate. In the season
opener against Purdue at the Coliseum, where a sweaty time was had
by all, Hackett started sophomore Mike Van Raaphorst at quarterback
but ended with true freshman Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   The early returns after a 27-17 win showed Palmer being the
quarterback of record for 17 of the 20 points the Trojans' offense
scored. In the world of instant analysis, we have a meaningful exit
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett will have none of this, of course. He has no desire to
look upon game one as the equivalent of the New Hampshire primary.
Van Raaphorst is the starting quarterback, but Palmer and Dominguez
High's Jason Thomas are going to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mistake a lot of coaches make is to put one
quarterback on a pedestal and treat the rest of the quarterbacks as
backups,'' said the hyperactively sincere Hackett after becoming
the first USC coach since 1951 to win his debut. ``You have to
coach the kids the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the quarterbacks learn by sitting in the same room.
We've adjusted the repetitions (in practice) so it's 50-50 for Mike
and Carson.'' Thomas is injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, here we have one guy who has been here three weeks
(Palmer) learning a complex offense, and he's doing real well, and
we have another (Van Raaphorst) who is a 3.8 student who has a good
spring behind him and knows the offense,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Mike for three years, and Carson for four years, and
Jason for four years. My goodness gracious, we're going to go
recruit us some linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be a problem, as long as the quarterback issue
doesn't become one. USC, after all, lost two in fall drills. John
Fox moved to tight end and Quincy Woods to receiver after seeing
the crowd under center.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst, who led USC to a 45-21 win over Stanford in one
of his two starts last season, didn't necessarily do anything wrong
Sunday. The offense in the first half simply flunked rhythm. It ran
a grand total of six plays for minus-one yard in the first quarter.
Van Raaphorst completed four of five passes on a second quarter
drive to a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst was intercepted on USC's first second half drive,
and the second drive sputtered at midfield. The next time USC got
the ball, Palmer replaced Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the plan always was to insert the Santa Margarita
High product after the first two series of the third quarter. It
was serendipity that his insertion would come with USC trailing
17-10 and turn out so meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer overthrew Ted Iacenda on his first play. ``I was praying
all day that I wouldn't screw up my first play,'' said Palmer,
``and that's exactly what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer then hit Mike Bastianelli for nine yards on the next, and
then showed why he was shared the title of best quarterback in the
prep class of '98 with Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   He took a straight drop, stepped up from a hard backside rush,
replanted himself, and, with a Purdue linemen in his face, threw a
strike to Larry Parker for 42 yards. USC scored three runs later to
make it 17-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the deep ball, I saw Larry with a shorter cornerback on
him,'' Palmer said. Everything else, the nice footwork, the ensuing
touchdown, is a blank. ``All I remember is Larry catching the ball
and my jumping around.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true freshman.
</P>
<P>
   It is only proper to insert a word of caution here. It's not
like Palmer just won himself as Rose Bowl. Hackett admitted that
Palmer was working off a short sheet of plays, too. He still has a
lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   And two of the last three USC quarterbacks to win a Rose Bowl
were fellows who never graced a prep All-America list, Tim Green
and Brad Otton. The third was Todd Marinovich, who hit all of the
notes, high and low, during his USC career.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer didn't really play a major role in the rest of USC's
offense Sunday. The ensuing series to the go-ahead field goal was
set up by a Purdue turnover. Van Raaphorst then returned for the
next two series.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was reinserted for the run-out-the-clock finale. His
third down, 28-yard completion to Billy Miller ended Purdue's hopes
and led to USC's clinching touchdown. But that pass was more shot
put then spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Mike's team,'' said Hackett. ``But you're not going to
not let a guy like Carson in the game. You can see his skill and
ability. When he's ready to play more, he'll play more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any quarterback will tell you he'd like all the reps and
playing time,'' said Van Rasphorst. ``But my mom would smack me if
I wasn't (respectful of Palmer). I was raised to respect people.
It's not an antagonistic relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Controversy is what you guys will talk about. We'll get along.
All you ever have is each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off two bowl-less seasons, maybe USC can afford letting
any quarterback debate play itself out, and in trusting the
judgment of the old quarterback coach, who is the new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, quarterback is the one position I'm familiar with,'' said
Hackett.

SOSA HITS 54TH HOMER AS CUBS BEAT ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 4th, 5th and 16th grafs for updating)  (nk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Sammy Sosa's 54th was a long one. Cubs fans Mike and
Karen Bressler were settling into the last row at Coors Field when
the ball sailed over their heads like a plane taking off for
Chicago. The line drive bounced off the scoreboard girders about
four stories above the field, producing a rugby scrum in search of
a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy had just gotten his hot dogs and fries and everybody
ran him over,'' said Mike Bressler, 41, who moved to Denver from
Wheaton, Ill. ``There were hot dogs everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the pile emerged a bruised but glorious T.J. Salvador of
Ft. Collins, Colo., with a Cubs souvenir to match his Cubs shirt.
He offered the ball to Sosa after the game, but the slugger let the
fan keep it.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruthian clout, estimated at 482 feet, was the longest home
run of the 171 hit so far this year at Coors Field. And it
temporarily tied the Chicago Cubs right fielder with St. Louis'
Mark McGwire, eight homers from breaking a record that is older
than they are: Roger Maris' 61 home runs in 1961. McGwire was born
in 1963, Sosa in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night in St. Louis, McGuire moved back ahead, hitting
his 55th in the seventh inning of the Cardinals' game with the
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   In his first-inning at bat, Sosa missed a fastball to fall
behind 1-2 in the count. He waited for right-hander Darryl Kile's
next pitch, a slider that stayed over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see where it landed,'' Sosa said. ``I'm just trying
to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-run home run drew a devotional ovation from the home
crowd of 48,255, and respect from the Rockies players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It silenced the dugout,'' said Rockies Manager Don Baylor.
``No ballpark's going to hold that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The home crowd was disappointed in the finish, a 4-3 Cubs'
victory, but also because Sosa hit only one home run. He popped out
in the third, struck out swinging in the fifth and walked in the
eighth, only to be thrown out trying to steal second.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Sosa declined to assume the role of favorite to
pass Maris, repeating his mantra: ``This is the Mark McGwire show.
If I get it first, God bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa could cool off and still break the record with ease. He
needs a home run in about one out of three remaining games. In the
past three months he has hit better than one home run in every two
games (45 home runs in 84 games, beginning with two home runs on
May 25). In August he has stepped up the pace, hitting eight homers
in his past 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa each need just two more homers to tie the
National League record, which is also the Cubs' record, 56, set by
Hack Wilson in 1930. In 123 years of National League games, only
Wilson has hit more than 54 home runs. Ralph Kiner of Pittsburgh
also had 54, in 1949.
</P>

   It was Sosa's second home run in six games this year in
Colorado, where home runs are plentiful. The Cubs and Rockies
splattered 23 home runs and 164 hits in six games there. Other
homers Sunday came from Gary Gaetti (his 13th) and Jose Hernandez
(21) of the Cubs, and Larry Walker (20) of the Rockies.

   For Cubs Manager Jim Riggleman, the best part of Sunday's game
was pitching, despite the homer onslaught. Kevin Tapani, now 16-7,
gave up only two runs in seven innings. Cubs pitchers had an ERA of
6.91 in the previous 11 games. Sunday, the Cubs got outs from
left-handers Felix Heredia and Terry Mulholland. Then Rod Beck
pitched through another harrowing ninth inning, walking two before
putting away his 39th save. Kile (10-15) was the loser.

   The victory helped the Cubs tie the New York Mets in the
wild-card race. The Mets lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday,
4-2.

   The Cubs clubhouse was all smiles as the players watched the
Giants lose to the Phillies. The Cubs now are 76-61. Last year at
this point they were 55-82.

   The Cubs were packing their bats for Wrigley Field, where on
Monday night Kerry Woods will pitch against Cincinnati's Brett
Tomko, who surrendered a home run to Sosa just last week. They
leave town with a 5-1 record at Coors Field, where last year they
failed to win a game.
